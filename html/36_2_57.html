<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CANADA ELECTIONS ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK3">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK4"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.)</B> moved that Bill C-2, an act respecting the 
election of members to the House of Commons, repealing other 
acts relating to elections and making consequential amendments 
to other acts, be read the third time and passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said: Mr. Speaker, first of all, I wish to acknowledge the 
efforts of all those who were involved to varying degrees in the 
drafting of this bill, and thus in improving the Canada 
Elections Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I particularly wish to thank the committee members—a number of 
whom are present in this House as I speak—and to offer particular 
congratulations to the leadership of my parliamentary secretary, 
the hon. member for Scarborough—Rouge River, and his predecessor, 
the hon. member for Peterborough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It had become obvious that our elections act needed reforming. 
It dates back 30 years, as has been pointed out by numerous 
members from all parties.  It was also important to amend the 
legislation to reflect a number of court decisions relating to 
the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.  Action was 
therefore required, and action there was.  Collective action, 
moreover. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last fall, my hon. colleague, the hon. member for Charleswood 
St. James—Assiniboia, pointed out, and rightly so, that this bill 
is not solely the creation of the government, but is indeed the 
fruit of a concerted effort by all parties represented in this 
House, the outcome of which is reflected in the report by the 
Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs released in 
June 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also appropriate to point out, I believe, that this reform 
of our electoral process has its roots in the Lortie commission 
of 1991.  In other words, our future elections act has taken 
close to nine years in gestation, parliament after parliament, 
committee after committee, study after study, consultation after 
consultation.  A nine year gestation period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles-A. Perron:</B> A white elephant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B> Yes, in fact, it is like four elephants in a row. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not dwell at length on the many stages we went through 
before undertaking this reform, because these are well known. 
However, I will mention the reports, three of them, from the 
chief electoral officer, which have guided our efforts and, of 
course, as I said, the work done by the former and current 
members of the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last fall, I took advantage of the parliamentary break to travel 
across the country to meet academics and students, and to talk 
to them about the reform that was taking shape. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What changes will be made by the bill?  First, there a number of 
changes of an administrative nature.  For example, the problem of 
voting hours in time zones that do not switch to daylight savings 
time has been corrected.  We have also given returning officers 
the right to vote, which is certainly something that was due. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are ensuring that the right of candidates to campaign in 
multiple unit residential buildings is protected by law so that 
people who own these large buildings cannot stop a candidate 
from entering if they happen to favour another political party. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1010"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT1"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have also harmonized certain measures of the act which the 
requirements of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms have 
called for in various judgments of the Supreme Court of Canada, 
mainly the Libman decision.  This includes the reintroduction of 
third party spending limits.  I will come back to that point in a 
few minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, with regard to financing, we have attempted to make 
certain provisions of the act consistent with the economic 
reality of today; that is to say, to take into account the need 
to change some of the measures which were designed some 30 years 
ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since Bill C-2 was introduced there have been some important 
changes.  The Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs 
continued its important work throughout the fall.  I know 
something about this because I was called upon to testify before 
the committee on at least three different occasions.  The latest 
conclusions of the committee are reflected in Bill C-2.  The 
committee made a number of amendments to the bill which I would 
like to outline to the House today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members will recall that originally the Canada Elections 
Act included a blackout of some 72 hours before polling day.  The 
supreme court felt that 72 hours was too long, but that a 
blackout was justifiable.  The court felt that 72 hours was not 
justifiable and that in order for this blackout period to work 
there would have to be other elements to justify it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We initially wanted a blackout period of 48 hours.  Many people, 
including members of the House, told us they would not want to 
support that measure.  Therefore, we eliminated the provision 
entirely, except for a blackout on voting day.  That came largely 
as a result of representations which we received from western 
Canadians who felt that it was inappropriate to have the results 
in central Canada known to people in western Canada before they 
had voted themselves, something which we recognized some time 
ago.  It was equally important to protect the new so-called exit 
polls from the night of the election from becoming known until 
people had actually voted themselves.  We concur with that and 
the change has been made to reflect it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have a blackout that establishes a cutoff for polls and 
ads to ensure that voters across the country have access to the 
same information before they vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we think it is important for voters in western Canada not to 
have access to the results of the votes cast in eastern Canada, 
surely it is equally important for voting held previously and as 
manifested in exit polls not to be revealed before the voting is 
complete. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had also decided to abolish the process of vouching, which 
allows voters in rural regions to guarantee the identity of their 
neighbours at the polling place, even if those neighbours have 
not been registered.  Here, as well, we heard some concerns and 
we have agreed to extend this vouching process to all electoral 
districts subject to certain conditions.  I want to thank the 
hon. member for Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre who made excellent 
contributions to the committee in this regard, and who offered 
amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another amendment he offered, which we accepted at report stage, 
would allow us to know the identity of people who give 
contributions through companies they own when those companies are 
numbered companies and do not otherwise have easily identifiable 
names. Now the names of the principals will be known. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the hon. member for Verchères—Les-Patriotes also made 
a contribution to that effect and I thank him as well.

<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Les Patriotes too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B> Les Patriotes too. We must not forget Les 
Patriotes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew:</B> They were great Liberals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B> The Minister for International Trade is 
reminding me that Les Patriotes were great Liberals, and I would 
not want to forget them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Getting back to my speech, I do not want to get into partisan 
rhetoric, because it is not in my nature. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another point of concern is the personal safety of electors.  If 
there is reason to believe that the disclosure of electors' 
personal information, such as their address, would put them in 
danger, they would be allowed to indicate a former place of 
residence.  This is very important for women who live in shelters 
for battered women.  Their aggressors would not be able to find 
them because the address would not be on the voter's list.  That 
was a side effect in the past when we had to print a permanent 
voter's list.  We have made accommodation in the bill to protect 
those in danger of violence.  This clause will now protect women 
who are living in battered women's shelters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also recognize the difficulties that can be encountered by 
persons with disabilities who need help to mark their ballots and 
who cannot get to the poll.  An election officer will come to 
their residence now and assist them to vote in the presence of a 
witness of their choosing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the practical side of things, we have considered the future 
impact of new technologies in the polling process and, more 
specifically, their utilization.  We will authorize the Chief 
Electoral Officer to develop an electronic voting process and put 
the process to the Standing Committee on Procedure and House 
Affairs to seek approval to test it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must thank the hon. member for North Vancouver who has been 
quite insistent on involving electronics and modernizing the 
electronic voting process.  At his strong insistence, we put that 
item in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to finances, there are a number of changes to the 
reporting procedures.  It should be clear that from now on 
candidates can include expenditures for child care and the care 
of any dependants in their reimbursable expenses. Although this 
clause has been designed for everybody, I hope it will have a 
particular attraction to women who might want to be candidates. 
It is not the be all and end all, but if it at least encourages a 
larger number of women to be candidates then it will have 
contributed toward the democratic process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another new measure lowers the veil on trust funds. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, it is the hon. member for Verchères—Les-Patriotes who 
brought this issue to our attention. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill stipulates that the name and address of the original 
donor for any contribution over $200 made through a trust created 
to promote the election of a candidate will now have to be 
clearly identified.  I thank the hon. member for bringing that 
issue to our attention as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To respond to the technical concerns expressed by experts, the 
spending limits for candidates and political parties will be 
adjusted using the revised list of electors.  We now have a 
larger than usual number of revisions on the permanent voters 
list.  This meant that a candidate running for public office 
would often not have the total number of names.  Therefore, when 
they set out campaign spending limits and found out later that 
there was a revision, they were unable to take into account the 
multiplier effect of the new people added on the voters list in 
order to increase the amount they were allowed to spend.  This 
will now be taken in account because we have made that 
adjustment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is where I am afraid that perhaps some members, in 
particular my distinguished colleague from Vancouver North, might 
not agree with me.  The most important financial reform of this 
bill relates to the participation of third parties in an election 
campaign. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1020"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT4"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT4"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1020

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The elections act formerly imposed limits on third parties and 
candidates.  Those of course had been thrown out by a court in 
Alberta and had not been appealed.  The result of this was that 
in the last election campaign those who wanted to vote for a 
member of this House had spending limits in terms of what they 
could do to promote the candidate.  However, anyone organizing to 
defeat a member of this House, effectively had no limit if they 
organized through a third party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Call that third party the National Citizens' Coalition, call it 
the rifle group, call it anything else, it does not matter. Those 
who were outside of the candidate process could do virtually 
anything, could obtain funds entirely, if they wished, from 
outside of Canada, something that is illegal for the purpose of 
electing someone and they could participate indirectly in the 
electoral process that way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Luckily the Libman decision in 1997 by the Supreme Court of 
Canada declared that control on third party spending would help 
to preserve the fairness of the democratic electoral process. 
Bill C-2 rectifies this and now puts in measures to control third 
party spending. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The measures concerning third parties are based on three major 
principles. First, third parties have a right to participate in 
the electoral process. This is in compliance with the supreme 
court ruling in the Libman case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, their spending should be restricted just like that of 
registered parties and candidates. 
That is perfectly normal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, even if the third parties have important things to say, 
their spending should be subject to limits that are stricter 
than those of the candidates or the political parties, since, 
after all, still according to the Libman decision, according to 
the supreme court, the candidates and the political parties are 
the ones trying to get elected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, naturally, the limits that apply to the third parties 
apply only to spending on advertising, whereas in the case of 
the candidates, the limits apply to almost all spending, 
including the cost of running an office, election headquarters, 
and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We therefore are proposing to limit the advertising expenditures 
of third parties to $150,000 nationally and to $3,000 within 
each riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also proposing that third parties be required to register 
once their spending on advertising exceeds $500. 
We want to avoid in this is having a group with a very small 
base, such as a school program wanting to write to a candidate, 
subject to such a limit.  We do want to be reasonable. 
Therefore, only spending of $500 or more would be subject to the 
elections act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will agree that all these measures reinforce the three 
broad principles governing our electoral process, namely 
accessibility—it is expanded by this process—fairness—I think that, 
once again, with the measures on the third parties, and so on, 
the bill talks a lot about fairness—and transparency, which will 
be increased by the new ways of disclosing amounts and electoral 
spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-2 provides us with yet another opportunity to assert 
Canada's leadership in the electoral process and thus enlighten 
democracies the world over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure that all members will recognize the wisdom of the 
measures proposed and that they will take this opportunity to 
support them.  Our electoral system is the envy of the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B> As is our country, and even the Bloc Quebecois 
members opposite who can hear me know it.  No doubt that is what 
is behind the hubbub this morning.

today so as to be able to make it home for the weekend.  I thank 
them for their contribution throughout the process and 
congratulate them on a job well done.  I would like to be able 
to jump the gun and congratulate them on their unanimous support 
for the bill, although I realize it is not impossible that one 
or two of them may decide to vote against it.  After all, we are 
living in a democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Louis Plamondon:</B> May we ask questions? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> No, there are no questions and comments for 
the first three speeches at third reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Louis Plamondon:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order. I seek 
the unanimous consent of the House to be allowed to ask a 
question of the member who just spoke. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is there unanimous consent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> No. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK5"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
will preface my comments today by pointing out that the 
government has moved time allocation on this bill.  It is the 
23rd time in this parliament that it has moved time allocation on 
a bill before the House.  It has preliminarily closed debate on 
bills 23 times since the start of this parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-2 is an example of a flawed bill that the Liberals want 
to ram through the House.  They do not particularly want it to be 
examined in this public place so they have limited the time for 
debate.  I can see the minister burying his head in shame.  I 
want to remind him that since we began debating the bill in the 
House, the Reform Party has had only two hours and forty minutes 
out of a total of seven hours and twenty-three minutes to debate 
a bill which the minister himself has said, has not been dealt 
with for 30 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before making my own comments, I will deal with a few things 
that were said by the minister.  He said that we had improved the 
Canada Elections Act by combining the results of all the parties 
working together in the House.  However, a few days ago we voted 
on the report stage amendments to Bill C-2 and there were close 
to 80 amendments proposed by the opposition.  I think this shows 
the minister that the opposition was far from satisfied with the 
process to that point.  If close to 80 amendments were being 
proposed at report stage, then the minister must be wrong when he 
says that the elections act has been improved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also mentioned that he had travelled during the break last 
fall to talk with academics and students across the country.  The 
funny thing is, the minister would not allow the committee to 
travel across the country to talk with academics, students and 
interested parties even though we had made requests to do so.  I 
actually heard him on the radio talk show CKNW in Vancouver.  I 
remind the minister that the callers absolutely trashed the gag 
law component in Bill C-2 and he had a fairly rough ride from the 
callers on CKNW in Vancouver. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also mentioned the Libman decision.  I will come back to that 
in a little more detail because it does deserve some detailed 
comment, in particular because of a court ruling that came out of 
British Columbia on February 9.  The minister knows that he is 
clutching at straws when he quotes Libman.  He also knows that it 
will cost taxpayers a lot of money to defend this flawed bill. 
What he should have done was had discussions with third party 
interests and tried to reach some accommodation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister also talked about the release of results and how 
things had been done in the bill to make sure that westerners did 
not see the results of the election before their polls had 
closed.  Even the Chief Electoral Officer told the minister that 
with the Internet in place now it was almost impossible to 
prevent the transmission of results.  If people want to see them 
they can dial up the website for Scarborough—Rouge River, for 
example, where they may have already posted their own local 
results after the polls close in Ontario.  There is really no 
effective way of preventing the distribution of results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The publication of polls is another area that has just come 
under court challenge in British Columbia. 
A very important result came out of the province on February 9 
which put into question the entire section of the bill to do with 
publication of polls.  I will deal with that a little later as 
well.  I will come back to third party spending limits too 
because they are an important part of the bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As the minister wrapped up his speech he mentioned our electoral 
system being admired around the world.  That is just plain wrong. 
The Chief Electoral Officer was questioned at length in committee 
by members of all parties about the patronage system which is 
riddled throughout the elections act. The Chief Electoral Officer 
has no power over who is appointed as a returning officer or a 
deputy poll clerk.  All those positions are patronage 
appointments put in place by the parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Chief Electoral Officer was asked whether he would 
recommend our Elections Act to any third world country or an 
emerging democracy, and I asked him that question, he said he 
would not.  There is no way that he would recommend Canada's 
Elections Act to a third world country or an emerging democracy. 
He did not say what the minister just said, that our act is 
admired around the world.  He said the act was not fit for a 
third world country.  I remind the minister that the act is far 
from perfect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Notwithstanding the fact that the minister took great pains to 
point out the various amendments that were finally accepted by 
the minister during the committee process, as I mentioned almost 
80 amendments were proposed by the opposition parties in the 
House.  We went through a lengthy voting session two nights ago. 
We were up until 12.40 in the morning voting on almost 80 
amendments.  That proves absolutely that the opposition parties 
were not satisfied with what happened at committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is now crystal clear that the government sent the bill to 
committee before second reading with the intention of keeping it 
out of the public spotlight, despite the claims of the minister 
that the process was designed to accommodate meaningful 
amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not very many significant amendments were made in committee, 
even though the official opposition, third party witnesses, the 
print media, broadcast witnesses, small parties and many other 
expert witnesses made suggestions, good ones, on ways in which 
the bill could have been made more democratic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The elections act is so biased toward the parties with seats in 
the House that it is normal for any changes to the elections act 
to be slipped through on a Friday afternoon when there is hardly 
anybody here.  I know the people who are watching this debate on 
television do not have a vista of the House right now, so they 
cannot see or have any idea who is here and who is not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know I am not allowed to mention the presence or not of 
members in the House, but it is a well known fact that when the 
government wants things to slip through quietly without too much 
attention it does it on a Friday afternoon when it can be done 
with a lot of ease because hardly any members are present. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case I know the minister started off thinking he would 
be able to push the elections act through in that manner.  He was 
quite surprised to find that initially the official opposition 
was vigorously opposed to some parts of the bill.  That was 
joined then by the other opposition parties and we turned it into 
a bit of a nightmare for the minister.  He has moved closure on 
debate now to try to ram it through on a Friday before we all go 
home for a break. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Elections acts should be politically neutral and should be 
supported by all parties in the House.  They should be supported 
by the Chief Electoral Officer.  They should be supported by the 
voters.  That is not the case with the elections act.  It is 
opposed by all those groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has wasted an opportunity to modernize and 
democratize the act.  The new act does little more than renumber 
the paragraphs in the old act.  At the same time it tries to 
reintroduce sections that have already been struck down by the 
court.  The bill maintains the most objectionable provisions of 
the old act, especially those that benefit the ruling party, 
which in this case is the Liberal Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill does nothing to address serious public concerns 
involving campaign financing, party registration requirements, 
the timing of byelections, third party spending issues and 
patronage appointments within elections canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rights of electors and third party participants in the 
democratic process continue to be trampled by provisions which 
adopt a paternalistic role in terms of dictating how much money 
can be spent and presuming to decide for electors who is a 
frivolous candidate and who is not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In drafting the bill the government virtually ignored the work 
of the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs, even 
though the minister made reference to that report. 
The government also ignored several decisions of various courts 
and the Supreme Court of Canada.

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is very inconsistent in the way it looks at court 
rulings.  Given its past reluctance to go against any court 
ruling by introducing the bill and pushing it through the House, 
the government is saying that it is okay for the courts to make 
child pornography legal and to allocate fisheries according to 
race, but it is not okay to touch the elections act or anything 
that affects our ability to get elected, especially if it is the 
ruling party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Returning to some specifics of the bill, I will deal first with 
third party spending.  Let us look at the effect of third party 
spending.   I think everybody would agree, if one candidate only 
has $1,000 to spend—and that is certainly the case with some of 
the smaller parties—and another candidate like myself has an 
allowance of $60,000, that there is an imbalance.  I think 
everybody would agree that my $60,000 would allow me to put up 
billboards and to run advertisements on radio and television. The 
smaller party candidate who only has $1,000 would be lucky if he 
or she could put up one or two billboards and would truly be at a 
disadvantage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are looking at the difference between $100,000 and $1 
million in a riding there will not be much difference.  If I 
could spend $100,000 on billboards and advertisements and 
somebody else came along with $1 million, he or she would have so 
many billboards and so many advertisements that it would actually 
be an irritation that would work against the interest of that 
third party.  Even if there is an influence from third party 
spending, relatively speaking it is not great when we consider 
that candidates get to spend $60,000 or more and the parties get 
to spend a lot more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister spent a lot of time talking about Libman at which 
point I mentioned that he was clutching at straws.  In Libman v 
Quebec the supreme court struck down the third party spending 
limit in the Quebec referendum act as too restrictive.  It said 
that reasonable spending limits were both constitutional and 
desirable and left it up to the legislatures and parliament to 
determine a reasonable limit.  However the supreme court decision 
is in conflict with two separate decisions in the court of 
Alberta and the February 9 decision in the B.C. supreme court 
which struck down all third party spending limits as 
unconstitutional. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The supreme court decision dealt with spending during a 
referendum campaign whilst the other three courts dealt with 
spending during election campaigns.  It therefore appears that 
the minister is clutching at straws when he uses the Libman 
decision based on referendums to try to defend a gag law in an 
elections act.  Furthermore, the main evidence in the Libman case 
was based on the Lortie report which as the minister stated is 
some nine or ten years old.  The Lortie report was based on a 
preliminary report by a UBC political science professor named 
Richard Johnston. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His report indicated that third party spending—and this was a 
preliminary report—might influence election outcomes.  However, 
Mr. Johnston filed his final conclusions a few years later in 
which he said that third party endorsements had no discernible 
effect on election outcomes.  That is the flaw in the Libman 
case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his ruling in the B.C. case Justice Brenner stated that there 
was no evidence which would allow him to conclude that third 
party spending or advertising had any impact on voter intentions 
and that to override charter rights it was necessary that there 
be more than a general hypothetical concern about a problem when 
there was no evidence the problem existed in the past or is 
likely to exist in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Libman case was based on the Lortie report, which was based 
on flawed evidence.  The B.C. court pointed out that flawed 
evidence.  If the minister forces the issue back into court—and 
certainly the Canadian Taxpayers Federation and the National 
Citizens' Coalition have said they would take it there—he will 
lose.  There is no doubt that referendum spending is different 
because it only relates to a yes and no answer to a question, 
whereas elections involve an enormous number of issues and 
candidates. The same rules cannot be applied, and in any case not 
a single study in the world indicates that third party spending 
can be linked conclusively to an election result.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Gerald Chipeur, a constitutional lawyer with the firm of 
Fraser Milner, has successfully challenged unfair sections in 
both the provincial and federal elections acts.  He told the 
procedure and House affairs committee that the Libman decision 
would likely not survive a challenge because of its applicability 
to referendums rather than to elections. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, one group that appeared before the procedure and 
House affairs committee was Environment Voters.  In support of 
its arguments against third party spending limits, it provided an 
opinion letter from barrister Clayton C. Ruby of Ruby and 
Edwardh, a law firm in Toronto.  In his letter Mr. Ruby stated 
that in his view third party spending limits could not be 
justified under the constitution.  He also made reference to the 
Libman decision by stating: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—these limitations were postulated by the Court in the context 
of a simple yes/no proposition being put to the electorate of one 
province.  Limitations that are appropriate to this kind of 
narrow and focused question are simply inappropriate to the broad 
complexities and shaded nuances of a many sided campaign for a 
general election...I believe these new proposals for a campaign 
spending limitation are flatly unconstitutional. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The supreme court passed an opinion on the Alberta court's 
striking down as unconstitutional spending limits in the 
elections act.  The supreme court put out its opinion that it did 
not think the Alberta court's ruling was valid in terms of 
elections even though the supreme court had not studied the 
evidence.  It was not a ruling based on evidence.  Yet the 
minister continues to cite the supreme court's comments as 
justification for imposing spending limits on third parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Far from levelling the playing field, if the supreme court 
decision were to be upheld it would give advantage to the 
Liberals because it restricts the ability of any other person or 
group to counter government propaganda during an election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new bill limits third party spending to $150,000 for a 
general election, of which no more than $3,000 may be spent in 
any particular riding.  This is in stark contrast to the total 
election spending limit for the Liberal Party of Canada which is 
close to $30 million.  Of this amount, approximately $18 million 
is allocated to its 301 candidates in the form of their 
individual campaign expenses, while the remaining $11 million can 
be spent directly by the party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By way of comparison, for the 1997 general election the election 
expenses limit for the Bloc Quebecois was $3.02 million.  For the 
PC Party it was $8.5 million.  For the NDP it was $11.4 million 
and for Reform it was $8.5 million.  Let us remember that these 
were the maximum amounts allowed and not necessarily the actual 
amounts spent.  They are based partly on the number of candidates 
running. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I already mentioned that the National Citizens' Coalition and 
the Canadian Taxpayers Federation intend to challenge third party 
spending limits as unconstitutional.  They are confident of 
winning their case based on what has been learned from the 
Alberta, the B.C. and the Quebec court decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not the place of the government to limit the right of 
individual Canadians or groups of Canadians to spend their own 
money in support of a cause or candidate.  The right to spend 
one's own money on election advertising is a right which is just 
a valid for the poor as it is for the wealthy.  It would have 
been a much better approach to consult with third party interests 
across the country in an effort to reach a compromise on 
reasonable spending limits.  That way the expensive cost of court 
challenges, which will eventually strike down all the limits, 
could have been avoided. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In completing this section I would mention as evidence that 
third party spending cannot be tied directly to any outcome. 
During the referendum on the Charlottetown accord the yes side 
lost even though it spent 10 times as much as the no side. During 
the 1993 election the PC Party spent many millions of dollars 
more than any other party in the race and yet had only two 
members elected to the House.  Reform, which spent one of the 
smallest amounts per member, had 54 members elected to the House. 
In addition, referenda conducted in Switzerland and California 
over several decades show no correlation between the amount spent 
by each side and the final voting result.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even if third party spending did make a difference in elections, 
why would we be opposing that?  Elections are supposed to be for 
the voters.  If the voters are upset or pleased with any 
candidate, why should they not be permitted to spend their own 
hard-earned money on opposing or endorsing that candidate as they 
see fit?  What right does the government have to interfere in 
their freedom to express their opinion about a candidate? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am prepared as a member of this House to have any third party 
spend anything it wants in my riding. I believe that as long as 
members of the House are following the will of their 
constituents, they will not be removed from office.  It is when 
they choose to represent their party view or their own personal 
view over the will of their constituents that they get kicked out 
of office.  That is why many members are afraid of third party 
spending limits.  They are afraid that if they do not obey their 
constituents' will and instead obey their party will or personal 
will, they will be thrown out of office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have one more quote from the ruling of the B.C. Supreme Court 
on February 9 regarding third party spending.  The court said: 
“There are certain circumstances in which the goal of fairness 
in elections would support an argument for third party 
advertising.  If in a future election campaign all of the parties 
were to agree on a significant policy point then the lack of 
third party advertising would mean that the people would be 
limited to the views of the major political parties and media 
commentators.  The third party spending limits would effectively 
silence citizens who wished to express a contrary view”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is an argument right from a judge of the Supreme Court of 
British Columbia.  It supports the idea of third party spending 
limits. I find that an interesting and supportable argument. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Turning to the publication of poll results during the blackout 
period, in the case of Thomson Newspapers v the Crown, previous 
legislation preventing the publication of poll results in the 
final 48 hours of an election campaign was struck down.  The 
government is now imposing a 24 hour blackout even though the 
print media have declined to give any assurances that they will 
not again challenge this provision in court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would say that the print media probably have been encouraged 
to take this back to court by the ruling which just came down 
from the British Columbia court.  The British Columbia court has 
struck down yet again any blackout provisions on the release of 
poll results and it went every further.  It said there should not 
even be a requirement to print methodology for the polls. What 
the court in B.C. has said is that there is no right of 
government to interfere in the publication of polls or even the 
methodology for those polls. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government rejected a suggestion that I made in committee 
and which was accepted as a compromise by the media, that they 
could print poll results right up until the time of the election 
but they would have to print the methodology so that voters would 
know how those poll results were obtained. The minister rejected 
that compromise.  Now the court is striking down the entire 
provision that was in the act.  We have ended up with something 
worse than if we had accepted the compromise which I negotiated 
with the parties during committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 326 of the new elections act requires that the first 
person to transmit poll results and anyone who transmits them in 
the 24 hours thereafter, must provide the details of the poll 
methodology.  However, in the recent Pacific press case in 
British Columbia, Justice Brenner struck down the provisions 
requiring publication of such information on the grounds that it 
offends the principle of freedom of the press which is guaranteed 
under section 2(b) of the charter of rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As in his ruling on the matter of third party spending, Justice 
Brenner applied the rule that in order for a law to justifiably 
override a guarantee under the charter, it must be demonstrated 
that there is a pressing and substantial need for such 
legislation.  He concluded that there is no history of false or 
misleading elections opinion surveys being published, that there 
is no evidence that any individual has encountered any difficulty 
in obtaining methodological information from the sponsoring media 
outlet, and very few individuals are interested in obtaining such 
information beyond the customary information routinely provided 
by the media.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Justice Brenner therefore concluded there is no pressing and 
substantial need for these requirements and he struck down the 
law.  We now have the British Columbia case of February 9 pushing 
another section of the minister's elections act right out the 
window. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Public opinion begins to form long before the election writs are 
issued.  It continues to be shaped throughout the election period 
and after based on the many types of information and issues that 
are being discussed.  To suggest that voters will change their 
allegiance on the basis of poll results a few minutes before they 
go to the polls is absolutely ridiculous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In committee the Chief Electoral Officer of Ontario had this to 
say about blackout provisions: “I have concluded that the 
blackout has no truly useful purpose and therefore ought not to 
be imposed on the electorate for electoral process.  It is 
unnecessary and it limits the constitutional right otherwise 
given to Canadians.  I suggest that Bill C-2 not impose blackouts 
at all”. He also stated that enforcement of blackout provisions 
is virtually impossible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Constitutional lawyer Gerry Chipeur, whom I mentioned earlier, 
in his presentation to the committee said that of all of the 
provisions in this bill that fly in the face of court decisions, 
the blackout provision is the most certain to be struck down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Turning to another court case on the requirements for registered 
party status, in March 1999 an Ontario court struck down the 
sections of the elections act which would require a party to run 
50 candidates in an election to remain on the register and to 
have its candidates listed with party affiliation on the ballot. 
The court indicated that two candidates should be sufficient to 
constitute a party.  However all of the small parties who 
appeared before the Standing Committee on Procedure and House 
Affairs, including the Communist Party of Canada which had 
challenged the law and had it struck down, said that the number 
12 as contained in a private member's bill which I had put 
forward to the House was an acceptable compromise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All members will know that the number 12 relates to the 
recognition of party status in this House.  The position I put 
forward in committee was that 12 was a sensible number as opposed 
to two, which most people would think was a bit low. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government had bothered to consult with the affected 
parties an acceptable compromise could have been reached because 
all of the parties agreed to 12.  Then we could have finished 
this whole legal court challenge, put it to bed and we would have 
had a workable number in the bill.  However, the minister refused 
to accept it and now that case is going to appeal on March 2 and 
3, in a couple of weeks. Right about the time that this bill goes 
to the Senate we are going to have a court case probably striking 
down provisions in the bill.  It is totally ridiculous the way 
the minister has handled this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The court said that we could have a party of two people and that 
is clearly what the court will ultimately decide again.  Instead 
of 12 we are going to end up with two.  The minister foolishly 
has plunged ahead with his number when there is every piece of 
evidence to support a higher number. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact in committee when he was asked about it, the minister 
said, “Obviously given that I am the minister who suggested to 
have the appeal, I am of the opinion that it works just swell the 
way it is”. I think that shows the intransigence of the minister 
on this. He is quite happy to ignore the ruling of the Ontario 
Court of Appeal because he does not like the number 12 or the 
number two. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The position the official opposition takes is that elections are 
for the voters.  The government takes the position that elections 
are for the parties. The reason it wants the 50 candidate rule is 
because it does not want competition from small parties.  The 
government thought back in 1993 that the Reform Party would not 
be able to get 50 candidates so we would not be able to have our 
party name on the ballot.  It thought that was a great way to 
prevent us from ever coming to the House of Commons. It was wrong 
because here we are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is still trying to prevent any other party from 
getting a foothold in this place and it is wrong.  Voters have a 
right to know that if there is a candidate on their ballot, that 
that candidate has a relationship to some other candidate in 
another riding by means of party affiliation. 
It makes sense for openness and the conveyance of information to 
voters that there be a party name on the ballot beside every 
candidate who is a member of a party, regardless of whether that 
party runs 12 candidates or 50 candidates in the election.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Turning to patronage appointments, one of the worst parts of the 
whole elections act and the piece that the Chief Electoral 
Officer criticized three times in three separate appearances at 
committee was the patronage appointments in Elections Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Chief Electoral Officer cannot even appoint his own 
returning officers.  All 301 returning officers are appointed by 
the Prime Minister of Canada.  They are Liberal patronage 
appointments to what should be non-partisan positions throughout 
Elections Canada.  It is a disgrace. No wonder the Chief 
Electoral Officer will not even recommend our elections 
legislation to a third world country because of the patronage 
that is riddled throughout it.  He told the committee how 
difficult it is to get rid of an incompetent returning officer 
because he cannot go to the Prime Minister and say “Your 
political appointee is incompetent and an idiot who should be 
removed from office”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every one of the opposition parties tried to get the government 
to change that rule and to allow the Chief Electoral Officer to 
advertise based on competence and ability to do the job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That whole system of patronage runs right through Elections 
Canada with all the political parties being able to appoint 
people at the lower echelons within the structure.  Certainly 
many of my Reform colleagues and I refused to do that in the last 
election.  We insisted that the returning officers advertise in

important natural resources, our Great Lakes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The area surrounding the Great Lakes is home to 8.5 million 
Canadians and is of great economic importance to Canada. 
Recognizing this, Canada and Ontario signed an agreement 
respecting the Great Lakes Basin Ecosystem, crafted to restore 
and protect the ecosystem, to prevent and control pollution and 
to conserve species, population and habitats.  A strong ecosystem 
is also integral to a healthy and vigorous economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since signing the Canada-Ontario agreement water quality has 
improved substantially.  Among the accomplishments is a 
significant decrease in the levels of contaminants in the lakes 
and an increase in the number of sentinel species, such as lake 
trout and osprey.  Yet there is much more to be done.  I make the 
plea for new funding to improve our waterways and enhance the 
quality of life for our citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call for the renewal of the Canada-Ontario agreement to ensure 
continued co-operation and co-ordination in this important 
endeavour.  Above all else, let us leave an environmental legacy 
to our children.

Emploment Insurance Act, which calls for the right to opt out

In so doing, he is saying no to the Government of Quebec, to the

particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, keeping that program in Ottawa lends political

</I></B></P><P align=left>It would seem that the federal government is once again turning 
its back on hard-working Canadians.

has also hit low income families especially hard, many of whom 
cannot handle any extra heating costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995 the Liberal government raised gas taxes by 1.5 cents per 
litre as a means to lower the federal deficit.  The deficit is 
gone.  Can the government explain why the fuel tax still remains? 
Because of such extra taxes the Department of Transport enjoys a 
surplus in excess of $6 billion per year, mostly due to fuel tax 
revenue increases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I urge the Liberal government to take action immediately 
and lower fuel taxes to help all Canadians through this very

</I></B></P><P align=left>The other day in the House the minister said that more than 
money would be required to fix health care.  We certainly all

required as well.  More money must be delivered on Monday when 
the budget comes down in order to restore the 50:50 
federal-provincial partnership if the minister wants to have the 
moral high ground again and if he wants to be able to work with 
his provincial counterparts, as he says he wants to do.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the budget will be tabled on Monday, but let us look at what the 
government has done over the last two to three years.  When all 
other programs were being reduced, we restored and increased the 
transfers to the provinces for health.  The Prime Minister, in 
his letter to the premiers following their February 3 meeting, 
said that careful consideration would be given to the priorities 
expressed by premiers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge the member to wait until Monday.  I also urge the member

B.C. to work with us toward medicare renewal in the months ahead.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr.

the government laid down the rules for medicare in the Canada 
Health Act, it was contributing a heck of a lot more money to 
medicare than it is today on a percentage basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the minister not acknowledge the need to get back to a 
50:50 relationship between the federal government and the 
provinces if he wants to show the kind of leadership in reforming 
and saving medicare that he claims he wants to do?  He is going 
to have to do that.  When will that be done?  Is he committed to 
doing it? 
<P><A NAME="LINK52"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I acknowledge that the Government of Canada has to do its part. 
Not only is this the right thing to do, and the money is needed, 
but over time the Government of Canada will not be in a position 
to enforce the principles of the Canada Health Act unless it has 
a presence in the system.  That is why, under the Prime 
Minister's leadership, we committed significant additional money 
last year to health transfers to the provinces.  As we said at 
the time, more will be done as our balance sheet improves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the hon. member.  I urge him and his counterparts

as “How to Say Goodbye”, our wish for the minister.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon—Humboldt, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker,

“Getting People to Like You”.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, all week and today included the government has suggested 
that it has restored the cuts it took out in 1995.  That 
statement is a distortion of the facts and it does a great 
disservice— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  Let us go easy.  It is not 
out of order, but you are getting close. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:</B>  My apologies, Mr. Speaker.  Let 
me just say that it obscures the facts and does a disservice to 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The facts are the government cut the cash to health care.  Cash 
transfer payments are the glue that holds the national health 
care system together.  When cash drops so low, the government 
loses the moral authority to enforce the Canada Health Act.  We 
are still short $4.3 billion in cash. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is simple and straightforward.  On Monday will the 
government put back the cash it took out of health care? 
<P><A NAME="LINK93"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, if the hon. member wants to be informative and tell the 
whole story, why does she not give the facts on the value of the 
tax points in billions of dollars for health care and the value 
of equalization?  Without that, her answer is incomplete. Because 
of your ruling, Mr. Speaker, I cannot say misleading, but at the 
very least it is incomplete. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  More than that, you cannot even say that you 
are not going to say misleading. 
<P><A NAME="LINK94"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, let me mention to the Deputy Prime Minister the 
government's own words in the federal budget of 1997 which stated 
“only the cash transfer affects program spending”.  The 
government knows that it is the cash that makes the difference 
and gives the government the power to enforce the principles of 
medicare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the cash has been restored, why do we have a crisis today? 
Why is the Ottawa Hospital today making choices about urgent 
surgery, not elective surgery, and choosing who shall have that 
surgery? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is that the cash has been cut and all we know is 
that the government is preparing to put in a one time only 
payment.  On Monday will the cash be put back and will it stop— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The hon. Minister of Health. 
<P><A NAME="LINK95"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the budget will be tabled on Monday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The numbers speak for themselves as the Deputy Prime Minister 
has said.  The total value of the transfers to the provinces, all 
of which can be used for health care, is higher now than it was 
when we took office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opposition can quibble about numbers in the past but the 
real question in front of Canadians is, how do we hang on to our 
health care system for the future?  How do we make sure it is 
sustainable for our families and children in the years to come? 
That is what we are focusing on.  I am now working with people in 
the provincial departments to make sure we reshape medicare for 
the future.

the Department of Transport has become a profit centre at the 
expense of the trucking industry and the people employed in it. 
The government eliminated the Atlantic regional freight 
transportation assistance program and the maritime freight rate 
both of which allowed Atlantic truckers to equalize costs and 
compete with other parts of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the government meet with representatives of the trucking

<P><A NAME="LINK99"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique—Mactaquac, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the Liberal government has done everything it can to 
drive up operating costs for the trucking industry.  The Liberals 
increased the excise tax on diesel fuel.  They eliminated federal 
competitive assistance programs and have now allowed the 
condition of our national highways to deteriorate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The deputy premier of New Brunswick took the initiative to meet

</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me just correct the record with respect to the excise tax. 
The government has not increased the excise tax on diesel fuel. 
In fact, that tax was imposed in the first place and then 
increased by the previous Conservative government.  It was four 
cents when we came into office and it is four cents today.

invited to participate.  Any decision would be clearly premature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to underline that we do have a concern about the

identify appropriate intervention that might get these people 
back to work.  The project identified was twofold: building the 
boardwalk and clearing up the waterfront area, which has now 
turned it into a tourist attraction.  There is evidence in the 
file on this project that the landowners gave permission and a 
building permit was issued.  As a result, 164 fishers moved on to 
long term employment.

previous attempts votable, and it has refused all attempts to 
even have my proposals reviewed by the standing committee.

intentionally left out of the charter of rights and freedoms. 
Recent court cases have proven that Canadians have no protection 
whatsoever from the arbitrary taking of property by the federal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My bill would make up for this mind-boggling omission from the 
charter by strengthening the property rights provisions in the 
Canadian bill of rights.  My bill would also require a two-thirds

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I move that the first report of the Standing Committee on 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, presented on Tuesday, February 22, be 
concurred in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate my hon. colleague from Peace River seconding the 
motion to concur in this report today.  I will be splitting my 
time with the hon. member for Yorkton—Melville. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased to have the opportunity to speak today about 
this very important issue, especially in light of the 
announcement that was made as recently as yesterday by the 
government.  I am speaking about the agricultural crisis, 
especially as it relates to western Canada and producers in all 
four western provinces. As members will notice, I have included 
my own province of British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not many people understand that in the northeast corner of 
British Columbia, an area that I represent, there is an 
agricultural sector that is very similar to the three prairie 
provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba.   It is a very 
important issue in my particular riding of Prince George—Peace 
River and all across Canada, but especially on the prairies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the brief time that I have I must say that I feel the 
government has failed miserably in properly and adequately 
addressing the agricultural income crisis in Canada today. I say 
today because the most recent opportunity to address this problem 
in a very real way was as recent as yesterday and the government 
failed. 
The Liberals have failed once again.  They have come forward with 
some ad hoc funding but no plan to get that assistance to the 
producers, especially the farmers who are beginning to prepare 
for spring seeding.  The uncertainty producers are facing is 
whether they should even put a crop in the ground this spring. 
This is something the government needs to address in a 
comprehensive and very real way.  It should not be done in some 
photo-op by the minister saying “Well, we have listened, we have 
heard the concerns emanating from western Canada and we intend to 
address this by throwing in another $240 million”.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This was another announcement just like the others we have seen 
over the last year and a half. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson:</B>  It is the same money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill:</B>  Mr. Speaker, as my hon. colleague from 
Peace River said, it is the same money.  They just keep 
announcing it over and over again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers are not fooled.  One of the reasons that the official 
opposition, the Reform Party of Canada, launched its own series 
of grassroots agricultural meetings across western Canada was to 
get input from farmers themselves at small townhall meetings, not 
by blowing into Regina, Saskatoon or Calgary and talking to a 
select group of witnesses who appear before the standing 
committee.  We wanted to go out and talk directly to the 
producers who were most affected by the government's lack of 
agricultural policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues, who are agricultural critics for the official 
opposition, instituted a plan to travel across western Canada and 
set up meetings called assistance for struggling agricultural 
producers, ASAP.  The acronym could also be “as soon as 
possible”.  As soon as possible we need to help farmers in 
Canada.  It is important for Canadians to ask themselves a very 
serious question at this juncture of our history:  Do we want to 
have a viable agricultural industry in Canada?  If the answer to 
that is yes, and I suspect it is, we want a healthy and secure 
supply of food in our nation, then we must give farmers the 
support that is necessary and the certainty to conduct their 
business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been holding these meetings all across western Canada. 
By the time they are done, around mid-March, my colleagues will 
have conducted over 60 small townhall meetings scattered across 
western Canada.  In my riding we held one about half way through 
the north and south Peace River agricultural regions in a small 
little community called Farmington.  I suspect this is one of the 
few times members will hear that name in this place.  It is not a 
big community but it is a very important agricultural community 
in my riding of Prince George—Peace River. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The meeting was held on January 11, a cold winter night with 
blowing snow and blizzard conditions in the Peace River country 
in northern British Columbia.  We expected maybe a few dozen 
farmers to show up.  When my colleague and I went to the meeting 
we were not sure just how many people would brave the cold, the 
wind and the snow that night but over 100 farmers came out to 
that meeting, these were men and women who realized their 
livelihoods and the very security and future of their family 
farms were at stake.  Some of them travelled dozens of kilometres 
and, in some cases well over 100 kilometres, to attend the 
meeting that night. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Peace River held similar meetings in his 
riding of Peace River, Alberta, the adjoining riding just 
immediately to the east of my riding.  He held meetings in Grande 
Prairie and Peace River and the response was the same.  If we 
lump the two meetings together, we had well over 150 individuals 
show up to air their concerns.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following the meeting we had in Farmington, one of my 
constituents undertook a unique journey.  Nick Parsons, from 
Farmington, a small community just north of the city of Dawson 
Creek, at mile zero of the Alaska highway, took it upon himself 
to undertake a combine odyssey to Ottawa.  He decided to drive 
his combine right here to Parliament Hill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  To send a message. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill:</B>  Exactly.  He wanted to send a message and 
he is sending a message.  He is a little over halfway in his 
journey, a journey of some 3,000 kilometres.  I know this because 
I have driven it, but I was not driving a combine.  It took me 
about four days by car as compared to his four to six weeks to 
drive his combine down here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members would be amazed at the support this farmer has received 
during his travels.  When I was talking to him via his cell phone 
the other day he told me that his journey is one of tears and 
fears.  The fears of Canadian farm families are being expressed 
to him as he travels across western Canada; the fears that the 
industry is dying and the fears that there is no hope. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can anyone imagine being a farmer in western Canada today?  The 
reality is that the government has given them no hope for a 
future.  This is being expressed to Nick Parsons every day as he 
continues his journey across western Canada.  Every day 
individuals stop Nick's combine and hand him $20, $10 or whatever 
they can afford to assist him in his journey across western 
Canada while he tries to draw attention to the plight of the farm 
family and farms in Canada.  He wants everyone to know that no 
matter how hard the farmers have struggled, they cannot make ends 
meet.  No matter how efficient they have become over the last 
number of decades, the reality is that they cannot make ends meet 
because international subsidies have driven down the price of 
their product to the point where they cannot pay their bills. 
They are now on the verge of losing their farms and their homes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to try to convey the tragedy that is occurring on farms 
across western Canada to the urban public who perhaps might be 
watching the proceedings today.  What is happening is a national 
tragedy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers are looking to the government for something more than 
having money thrown at them, money that never reaches them. In 
the last year or so I have often made the comment that no matter 
how many announcements, how many photo opportunities the 
government has to announce the same money over and over again, 
all the money in the world sitting on the cabinet table does the 
farmer and his family absolutely no good until it is on their 
kitchen table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of the money that was announced, even before the most recent 
announcement yesterday, around 25% has actually reached farmers 
to help them.  This is a tragedy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unfortunate that my time is up because I could, on behalf 
of farmers all across Canada, go on speaking about this all day. 
<P><A NAME="LINK161"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis Gruending (Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is referring to the agriculture 
committee report, which was just tabled as a result of hearings 
held in December 1999.  I note there was an earlier report in 
December 1998.  These two reports indicate that there is a 
problem.  Members of the agriculture committee understand there 
is a problem and they want to do something about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After reading the report, I agree with much of the analysis and 
much of the analysis has been provided by the member who just 
spoke. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The New Democratic Party caucus disagrees strenuously with at 
least one conclusion in the report.  Our agriculture critic, the 
member for Palliser, tabled a minority report, an addendum to the 
report, in which he stated that the committee suggests that 
Canada is so impoverished that it cannot afford to invest in our 
grain farmers to the same extent as other countries.

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report indicates that Canada cannot compete with the 
treasuries of these countries.  My hon. colleague, the member for 
Palliser, says that Canada certainly has the financial resources 
to compete on a comparative basis with the United States and 
Europe.  The problem is that the Canadian government has decided 
it does not want to compete.  We know that it has cut support to 
farmers since 1993 by roughly 60%, so my colleague in this 
minority report is saying that we in fact can compete. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been on to this issues, as has the Reform Party.  The 
NDP caucus has and will continue to support farmers in rural 
communities in the ways that they are attempting to put bread on 
their own tables in addition to putting it on ours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from the 
New Democratic Party for his comments and his intervention.  He 
certainly raises a very valid point.  What I was trying to drive 
home during my brief remarks is that I think it is incumbent upon 
all Canadians to look inside themselves at this juncture in our 
history to decide what priority they place on our agriculture 
industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member was referring to the level of support that other 
countries give to their agricultural sector, whereas in Canada, 
especially in the grain sector, we have seen a diminishing level 
of support from the federal government over a number of years. We 
could debate all day how much our national treasury can afford to 
support an individual sector of the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member referred to his party's minority report on the report 
of the standing committee.  Our agricultural critics also put 
forward a minority report in which we listed eight positive 
things, other than just an ad hoc propping up of the sector, the 
government could undertake to assist farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The farm safety net programs must be reformed to ensure long 
term stable protection.  That was one of the things that we put 
forward, something that a lot of farmers have advocated for a 
long time.  A lot of farmers have been involved through their 
local producer organizations in promoting an expanded NISA 
program, the Net Income Stabilization Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government could lower the costs it imposes on 
producers by giving general tax reductions, lowering user fees 
charged by the Department of Agriculture and Agri-Food and 
reducing federal taxes charged on the manufacture, transportation 
and sale of agricultural input such as fertilizer and especially 
fuel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hear members raising the issue of the high cost of fuel in 
the House every day.  That is something the government could move 
on.  It could do something about that.  It could bring down the 
taxes on fuel.  It would have a direct impact on the input costs 
of farmers as they do their planning for this spring's seeding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well the government could further lower the costs of farmers 
by enabling a competitive, commercially accountable grain 
handling and transportation system.  Many parliamentarians from 
all parties have talked about changes to our transportation and 
grain handling system, yet very little is being done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition, the Reform Party of Canada, has 
identified a whole raft of things in our minority report, as have 
other parties, that the government could be doing to assist 
farmers.  Yet we see nothing but a photo op and government 
members saying they will throw another couple of hundred million 
dollars at it.  Maybe it will eventually get to the farmers and 
maybe it will not, but they will throw it at them in the hope 
that it solves the problem.  Farmers especially know darn well it 
will not solve the problem.

the three prairie provinces, so essentially I will be reporting 
on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to acknowledge the fact that we cannot pin a label 
on all the people on the other side.  Some of them are willing to 
step out of the mould.  I would like to acknowledge especially 
the fact that the member for Broadview—Greenwood in Toronto has 
done his share in trying to profile the plight of prairie farmers 
when he organized that rally. 
Back in November the Reform had a supply day.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills:</B>  Bob was also there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz:</B>  Yes, there were more members, but I 
acknowledged the member for Broadview—Greenwood because he 
helped organize it.  The point I am trying to make is that the 
more we can get people from the other side joining together with 
us to show this is a non-partisan issue and to communicate to the 
people in the cities the plight of farmers, the better off we 
will all be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some real issues we have to deal with in this place 
and it is very difficult sometimes not to be partisan. It is 
great to see members on the other side helping us because they do 
not have elected people on the prairies and in rural ridings to 
help communicate that message to the cities.  There is one 
cabinet minister from Regina who is strangely silent on the 
issue, but I am glad to see other members trying to do their 
best. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned, I have been travelling with the committee. 
Yesterday the Prime Minister made quite a big deal of the fact 
that $1 billion were being made available to farmers in 
Saskatchewan.  I need to clarify the fact that it was not $1 
billion in new money.  I hope he does not think farmers are not 
smart enough to know what has been going on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have used the words billion dollar boondoggle in referring to 
the mismanagement of the jobs fund under HRD.  I used the words 
billion dollar boondoggle to describe the gun registry because in 
a few years a billion dollars will have been wasted going after 
the good guys rather than dealing with the real problem in Canada 
in that regard.  We could talk about the billion dollar 
boondoggle in aboriginal affairs, and I suppose there are other 
areas.  Here we have a billion dollar boondoggle.  When we look 
at all the things that are going on, we are going to be talking 
real money soon.  Why do I call it a boondoggle?  It is because 
the money is not getting to farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The programs are announced.  When we listen to the media it 
sounds like some grand thing has been done.  I suppose the 
impression created in Toronto is that farmers are getting this 
money.  If we listen carefully and we read the fine print, it 
says that we will know by the end of March how the funds will be 
disbursed.  The farmers need the money.  As my colleague from 
Prince George—Peace River said, it has to be on the kitchen 
table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two years ago Reform said something needed to be done about the 
crisis developing in agriculture.  The Prime Minister said 
“These things take time to develop”.  What have the bureaucracy 
and the government being doing for the last two years?  The Prime 
Minister went on to say “You know me.  I have to do my homework 
first”.  What was announced yesterday clearly shows that he has 
not done his homework. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is only a small fraction of what farmers pay in tax. 
Farmers are taxed to the max.  Some of their input costs may be 
as much as 50% tax.  People in the cities do not realize that 
farmers only get back a small fraction of the money they send to 
Ottawa back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday I had with me a box of shirts from the backs of a few 
farmers.  They want me to make the point with the people here and 
across Canada that the government has literally taken the shirts 
off their backs.  I wanted to present those shirts to the Prime 
Minister and the finance minister on behalf of farmers in 
Saskatchewan, and they would not accept them.  Then I went to the 
agricultural minister who said he would not take them to the 
Prime Minister.  I still have the shirts that the government has 
taken right off the backs of farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many points need to be made in this regard.  Reform has 
suggested a lot of good things.  I want to let people who are 
watching know that they can access a minority report on the 
Reform's position on the Internet. 
We are limited in time in the House so I cannot go into all the 
details, but I will briefly summarize what Reform is saying. 
Canada must aggressively attack international subsidies and trade 
barriers so that farmers do not have to compete with all the 
grain being dumped on the international marketplace that forces 
farmers to sell their product below the cost of production.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson:</B>  It sounds like the Boy Scouts to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz:</B>  Exactly.  My colleague from Peace 
River has just made the point that we have tended to be the Boy 
Scouts at the bargaining table.  It is about time we got tough. 
Our competitors are tough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does that do for prices within Canada?  Because farmers are 
caught in the international marketplace they are actually 
subsidizing the food being eaten in Toronto.  People do not know 
that farmers are being forced to sell below the cost of 
production and people within Canada are benefiting from that 
fact.  Whatever happens in the international marketplace happens 
here.  That is why our government has to come to the rescue in 
the short term and reduce taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government must immediately reduce the burden it places on 
farmers.  Farmers pay an inordinate amount of tax, everything 
from an excise tax on fuel to user fees.  What are user fees? For 
people watching in the cities, user fees such as grain inspection 
fees amount to $138 million annually for prairie farmers. 
Farmers are compelled to pay the cost of agencies that benefit 
all sectors of society.  A good quality safe food supply helps 
everybody but the farmer has to pay the whole shot.  That is not 
fair.  Those fees should be reduced, and Reform is asking for 
that to take place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should give grain farmers the freedom to market 
their own grain independent of the wheat board.  One may often 
hear or be given the impression, especially by the minister 
responsible for the wheat board, that because the wheat board has 
a monopoly and farmers are not allowed to sell outside it is 
somehow great for farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point is that farmers are not even allowed to process their 
durum wheat into pasta and put it on the store shelf for sale. 
The wheat board makes them sell their own grain to the wheat 
board and buy it back before they can process it.  Of course 
there is a big handling fee and they have to buy it back at a 
higher price and the profit is diminished. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope at some future point I will be able to address this 
problem even more.  We need to debate agriculture a lot more in 
the House.  At this point I would like to move: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House now adjourn and consider these things. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The request for the 
House to adjourn is not receivable by the Chair because the House 
is now under special order on time allocation and the vote on 
Bill C-2 must be and will be put today at 2.15 p.m.  We are still 
on questions and comments.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, one of 
the difficulties with discussing agriculture in Ottawa is that 
there is a pervasive feeling with the Liberals and I believe 
sometimes with the Reform Party that if it is not grown in the 
west, it is not agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is the agricultural crisis and issues which face all 
Canadian farmers are not western centred.  There are significant 
issues and indeed a crisis in western agriculture, but there are 
also agricultural crises in other parts of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My riding which represents 50% of the agricultural product from 
Atlantic Canada, a greater level of agricultural output than all 
of Prince Edward Island, is in an agricultural crisis.  We have 
had four years of unprecedented levels of drought and 
destruction. For instance the fruit growers have been virtually 
pummelled by this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am concerned with— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  If the hon. member 
for Kings—Hants will forgive me, I must correct a statement I 
made just a moment ago.  I want to put people at ease.  I said 
that the vote would be taken at 2.15 p.m.  I was in error.  The 
vote will be at 1.15 p.m.  We will go into Private Members' 
Business at 1.30 p.m. Therefore, to be clear, we are under time 
allocation and time allocation means that the vote will be taken 
today at 1.15 p.m. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I 
ask for further clarification on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my understanding that the motion to adjourn the House put 
forward by my hon. colleague from Yorkton—Melville is in order. 
The reason it is in order is that the House was considering Bill 
C-2 this morning during the hour of debate from 10 o'clock to 11 
o'clock.  The House went to Routine Proceedings following 
question period and we are now on motions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not considering Bill C-2 any longer. We have no way of 
knowing when we return to orders of the day following Routine 
Proceedings whether the government will call Bill C-13 or another 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I would ask that you seek further clarification and 
a further ruling on this because my understanding is that we are 
not currently under time allocation that has been imposed on Bill 
C-2. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I will be happy to 
consult with the table and we will make sure that we are doing 
exactly the right thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members can see the Chair benefits by having a lot of good 
professional advice at his beck and call. At page 9, chapter III, 
sittings of the House, Standing Order 25 states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it is provided in any Standing or Special Order of this 
House that any business specified by such Order shall be 
continued, forthwith disposed of, or concluded in any sitting, 
the House shall not be adjourned before such proceedings have 
been completed except pursuant to a motion to adjourn proposed by 
a Minister of the  Crown. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unless a minister of the crown makes the proposal that the House 
adjourn, the House will not adjourn and we are still under the 
provisions of the standing order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ruling was correct. We are in debate. We are in questions 
and comments and we will start the questions and comments period 
from the beginning.  The hon. member for Kings—Hants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the agriculture industry 
is in a crisis across Canada and for very different reasons. 
Frankly a solution that may work in one region will certainly not 
address issues in other regions.  Geographically Atlantic 
Canadian agriculture faces very different issues from those of 
western Canadian agriculture.  That is common sense.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government changed the EI rules in 1995.  It had an 
extremely deleterious impact on agriculture in Atlantic Canada to 
the extent that Atlantic Canada farmers in my riding last year 
lost about 30% of their crops because of the difficulty in 
attracting seasonal workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the short growing season in Atlantic Canada, seasonal work 
issues are more important than they are in other regions.  It is 
a growing season issue.  The government may have thought that if 
the rules were changed those people would go from seasonal work 
to full time work.  It did not work that way. Many of those 
seasonal workers are now on provincial welfare rolls because of 
this misdirected policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party is positing some solutions for agriculture in 
western Canada.  As a party that purports to be a national party, 
I would be interested in its recommendations for the seasonal 
work issue facing farmers in Atlantic Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to reply 
to this question because I spent quite a bit of time visiting 
farms in that member's riding. I heard firsthand the concerns of 
those farmers.  Perhaps a point that could be made here is that 
some of the members of parliament from that area should be 
representing those people so I would not have to be going there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to develop our policy we spent time on the farms in 
that area.  It is interesting to note that the farmers there have 
concerns that are very similar to the concerns in the west. One 
is that the federal government does not have an agricultural 
policy which deals with concerns right across Canada.  It is time 
we developed a comprehensive agricultural policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member says that some of the problems faced by people in his 
riding are not the same as those in the west.  Of course there 
are individual characteristics but there are common 
characteristics. One of the things I am finding that farmers and 
also small businesses face right across the country is that 
people bear a huge tax burden which they can do nothing about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Built right into the farmers' input cost, be they on the 
prairies or in Nova Scotia or New Brunswick, is a high level of 
tax that farmers cannot avoid when the federal government uses 
employment insurance premiums as a cash cow that is built right 
into the product.  They are pyramided.  Whenever the farmer has 
to buy something he is caught paying that tax and he cannot pass 
it on. That is just one example.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Question, question.

Lotbinière, on questions and comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Odina Desrochers:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is such a complicated 
business, asking a question of those people over there, that one 
has to start with a brief preamble so that they will be able to 
grasp what it is all about, and get back on track with reality. 
They need something concrete. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I wanted to say, first of all, is that I was against this 
report that has been made public.  In committee, I stated that I 
had a great deal of difficulty understanding the title's 
reference to urgency, when all the decisions reached by the 
government do not reflect urgency or crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know whether my Reform colleague shares my 
opinion.  Does he agree also that the inertia of this government 
needs to be condemned?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I can put my response 
in just a few words.  Yes it is a crisis.  I agree with my hon. 
colleague from Quebec.  It is a genuine crisis.  It has developed 
very quickly because of the drop in commodity prices. However, 
the farmers would be able to survive if their input costs were 
reduced.  The government could do much to reduce those input 
costs but it has done nothing, such as tax reduction.  Yes there 
is a huge crisis out there and something needs to be done in the 
next month.

unusual proceeding.  The clerk has just filled me in on the 
proceedings of the proceeding, so I will fill the House in on the 
proceedings of the proceeding as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened was that I recognized the hon. member for 
Broadview—Greenwood on debate.  At the same time the hon. member 
for Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca was on his feet.  It is the purview 
of the Chair to recognize whomever the Chair chooses to 
recognize. The only way a member has to challenge the Chair's 
decision on who has been recognized is to move that another 
member be recognized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is where we are now because the hon. member for 
Broadview—Greenwood had not begun to speak.  Had the member for 
Broadview—Greenwood begun to speak, it would have been game over 
and the point of order would not have been receivable. But 
because the member had not begun to speak, another member rose on 
a point of order.  That is where we are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  In the spirit of co-operating with the member from the 
Reform Party, I have no problem in deferring and allowing the 
member to proceed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  That is really 
generous but I still have to put the motion.  Interestingly, a 
while ago we discussed whether a point of order is in fact a 
point of order and can be raised if there is another point of 
order on the floor.  If the hon. member cares to go back to 
<I>Hansard</I>, I will not get into that again.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>FIRST NATIONS OMBUDSMAN ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK173">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from November 4, 1999 consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-222, an act to establish the office of First 
Nations Ombudsman to investigate complaints relating to 
administrative and communication problems between members of 
First Nations communities and their First Nation and between 
First Nations, allegations of improper financial administration 
and allegations of electoral irregularities, be read the second 
time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK174"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay—Boundary—Okanagan, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, this private member's bill deals with accountability for 
native people.  Accountability is something that everybody claims 
we should have.  There are many people on the government side who 
do their very best to ensure that many do not.  Nowhere is the 
lack of accountability any more blatant than in the case of 
Canada's aboriginal people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The two biggest problems that governments generally have foisted 
upon native people are the reserve system and the Indian Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had occasion to be present at a service club where a native 
woman was the speaker for the evening.  She was university 
educated and married to a Vancouver city police officer who was 
non-native.  She was a very articulate woman.  She pointed out 
that under the Indian Act, should she die, she is not even 
allowed to leave her estate to her husband or her children 
because the Indian Act makes her a ward of the government, a ward 
of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development.

<A HREF="#LINKT38"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another problem is the reserve system.  It is nothing more than 
the ghettoizing of Canada's native population.  In my riding I 
have the largest concentration of Russian Doukhobor people in the 
world, bar none.  Not even Russia.  It was the Doukhobor people's 
custom to live in a communal lifestyle when they came to Canada. 
That is the way they established themselves.  Over time they have 
chosen to integrate into society, to have regular jobs, to have 
homes and to participate in all the benefits and responsibilities 
of being Canadian.  A few have chosen not to do that and have 
stayed in a communal lifestyle.  The operative word is chosen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is something that is being taken away from Canada's native 
people.  There are things being done that virtually force them or 
at least put a tremendous amount of pressure on them to stay on 
reserves.  The money that goes to the various reserves is done on 
the basis of the population of the reserve.  It is incumbent upon 
native leaders to find ways to encourage native people to remain 
on reserve.  For people who are not already on reserve they try 
to force them, in one manner or another, to become residents of 
the reserve.  It is nothing more than a feudal system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the big problems is elections and how people are 
democratically elected.  When I was talking about the Nisga'a 
treaty and some of the problems of potential autocratic 
leadership, some people asked if the leaders were not elected in 
most cases.  The answer is that they are.  As I pointed out to 
them, I am elected.  I am the member of parliament for my riding. 
I am elected by the people of my riding to represent them.  If I 
do not do a good job, they are entitled to write to a newspaper, 
go on radio, stand on the street corner and rail against me, and 
run against me in the next election.  If they beat me, fine.  If 
they do not, life goes on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What if I owned all their houses, owned their bank accounts and 
controlled where they worked?  What kind of accountability would 
people have if they became leaders with that incredible kind of 
power or if someone ran against them and was not successful? When 
the same people was back into power, what kind or retribution 
would they force upon the people who had the temerity to run 
against them and to speak out against them? What is holding those 
leaders accountable to native people when such things happen? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have documented case after case of situations where that has 
happened.  That is not to say that some native bands cannot act 
benevolently on behalf of their people.  We have some excellent 
cases of that.  The Sechelt band operates very effectively with a 
municipal style native government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have other examples.  I mentioned the Nisga'a so I will start 
with them.  Many Nisga'a people live in poverty on reserves, in 
very oppressive conditions, but there are only 1,700 native 
people on Nisga'a lands at this point in time.  Yet $29 million a 
year go into their treasury from the provincial and federal 
governments for 1,700 people.  Of course there are individual 
incomes.  How come so many of them are living in such poverty if 
they have $29 million a year? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that is not bad enough, we have the Stoney just across the 
B.C. border in Alberta.  They total 3,300 people and have $50 
million a year in income.  Yet again many of them live in 
poverty, some to the point of living in basements of condemned 
homes.  What happens to that money and where is the 
accountability?

<A HREF="#LINKT39"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who speaks on behalf of native people who are looking for help 
and looking for better living conditions on reserves with the 
money coming in that is supposed to be theirs in part and 
supposed to be handled by the leaders on their behalf?  Somehow 
magically it disappears and they are not getting help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have many other examples.  The 5,500 Samson Cree have an 
income of $92 million a year and yet many people on those 
reserves are living in very trying conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government reluctantly agreed under pressure from us to the 
Nisga'a committee travelling.  It made a procedural mistake in 
the House and had no choice but to agree to it in spite of the 
fact that it publicly stated it did not want to be there.  The 
government rigged, and I use that word without any hesitation, 
the witness list to ensure that people who had something to say 
were not allowed to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We held an additional day of hearings for people who were frozen 
out by the Liberal list.  We heard from members of the Squamish 
band who own a great deal of very valuable, very expensive 
commercial real estate in West Vancouver.  They get tremendous 
royalties and revenues from that as well as the usual provincial 
and federal government payments.   They told us that they 
received an income of $900 a year from the band in terms of help. 
We heard cases of people living in rat infested, rusted out 
trailers.  That was the housing provided by the band.  There is 
no accountability, none at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Welfare or social assistance is not paid directly to natives who 
live on reservations.  It is paid to the band council.  When that 
money is paid, the government looks upon the council to fairly 
distribute it to people in need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the four tribal councils of the Nisga'a is under 
investigation for welfare fraud.  The money that has been going 
to aid people in need on reservations has in fact not been 
reaching them.  The preliminary investigation indicates that 
tribal council members' wives and children have been placed on 
the rolls to receive the money themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are the solutions?  One of the first problems we always 
encounter is getting the government to admit there is a problem. 
It seems it has at least done that.  A letter was written to a 
constituent by the then parliamentary secretary.  I believe he 
still is the parliamentary secretary.  There is much that can be 
said on the issue, but my time is coming to an end.  We think the 
government should be held accountable.  It was acknowledged in 
the letter which I do not have time to read now that there was a 
need for accountability.  An article in the paper indicated that 
funding was going to leaders of various special boards to assist 
people but that it was not getting to them at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Indian Affairs 
and Northern Development is indicating that I should be cut off. 
I can well understand why he would want me to be cut off.  The 
Liberals do not want the truth to get out, but it will get out 
through newspapers, through us and through native people speaking 
out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When will the government start listening and start helping 
people instead of shovelling money at the people who support 
them?  When will it be accountable and start dealing with the 
real problems of native people instead of trying to buy them off 
through their leaders? 
<P><A NAME="LINK175"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Iftody (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
once again the hon. member in his predictable rather silly, 
non-factual, inaccurate, exaggerated speech that I have heard 20 
to 30 times in the House refers to facts in newspaper articles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I found it quite intriguing when I read in the <I>National 
Post</I> that it may have been his riding which received millions 
of dollars in grants from HRDC.  At the same time this fellow is 
standing in his place very puffed up and self-righteous about how 
awful it is that we are doing this in Canada.  It is quite 
interesting.

<A HREF="#LINKT40"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On a brighter note and more focused on the debate I will address 
Bill C-222 put forward by the member for Wild Rose for whom I 
have great respect.  He is a decent and good man.  He believes 
very deeply in these issues although he is always wrong. However, 
we have to be compelled somewhat by his own deep feelings and 
belief in this regard.  That is charming in itself. It is 
important to the member and we are equally passionate and 
committed to accountability and the other issues as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The plan we have put forward is about giving aboriginal peoples 
the tools they need to become self-sufficient, self-supporting, 
and contributing members of the Canadian family.  I think all of 
us in the House and indeed all Canadians believe our ultimate 
goal is to have first nations people participate fully in 
Canadian society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would require the federal government to appoint an 
ombudsman empowered with certain quasi-judicial authority to 
oversee and investigate operations and elections of first 
nations, as the member alluded to.  The proposed legislation 
would make it possible for this person, he or she, to propose 
changes to first nation policies and practices.  If a first 
nation does not make the changes suggested, the ombudsman would 
make a report to the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not surprising coming from the Reform Party that it 
hearkens back to the turn of the century when the Government of 
Canada dispatched officers of the department who were in a sense 
officers of the court.  They had those certain powers to dispatch 
moneys and work with the native people.  They were in fact less 
bureaucratic and more quasi-police people who policed the 
reserves.  We find it quite unacceptable.  Indeed it does not 
help the situation at all.  Not least of which, it does not help 
first nations people in their communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill deals with two main areas relating to accountability: 
band elections and financial management.  I point out some 
specific problems with the bill.  It is incongruent with the 
Indian Act, I say to the member and his research staff, those 
great folk in the Reform Party research staff from whom I hear 
from time to time.  These two pieces of legislation could not 
operate together.  The member in constructing the bill missed 
half the equation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the House should note that an election appeals 
process already exists in the Indian Act under the Indian band 
election regulations.  These election processes, or for that 
matter any irregularities and complaints, fall within the mandate 
of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development.  The 
bill is in direct conflict not only with the act as a whole but 
with the appeal process generally and more specifically.  It is 
very incongruent.  No attempt is made by the member to reconcile 
the conflict in existing laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also fails to make a distinction between the various 
ways first nations elect their leaders.  There are 610 bands in 
Canada.  Of them 273 conduct their elections pursuant to the 
electoral provisions of the Indian Act.  As already pointed out, 
the Department of Indian and Northern Affairs investigates 
alleged violations of the Indian Act.  These might include 
ineligible voters, ineligible candidates or secrecy violations. 
The bill fails to recognize that another 320 of Canada's first 
nations elect their leadership through traditional practices 
based on traditional electoral systems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not find that at all surprising.  Again, again and again in 
the House it has been well established and now will be come 
social fact and a part of Canadian history that the Reform Party 
does not care about first nations people and has no interest in 
recognizing their culture, their history and their development as 
a people in this country, to say nothing of the fact that they 
were the first people here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not as well research this project sufficiently to take 
into account that 17 other first nations have negotiated modern 
self-government legislation.  The legislation governs the manner 
in which these communities elect their leadership. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1345"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT41"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once this legislation were in place the federal government would 
have no role to play in the leadership selection process.  Given 
that Bill C-222 would likely infringe on the aboriginal treaty 
rights or other rights, consultation is required.  What would 
happen if this bill were brought in? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general and others have compelled the Government of 
Canada or the minister not to litigate but to negotiate, in other 
words to stay out of the courts.  It ties up these matters for 
years and years.  It makes for rich lawyers but bad policy, bad 
outcomes and even more bad situations for first nations people. 
That has not been thought about at all.  The bill does not 
contemplate that at all. Rather, it takes a confrontational 
approach once again to a complex problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, adopting this bill is not a simple process.  I stress 
that it would require the House to repeal or amend several other 
pieces of legislation in order to consider passage of this bill. 
Given that it would likely infringe treaty rights, more 
consultation and work would obviously have to occur. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More important, this bill was not developed in consultation with 
any first nations people, notwithstanding the member's visits. I 
say quite honestly that on many occasions the member has visited 
first nations in his communities.  He has tried to do something 
constructive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On financial accountability, we need to work closely with first 
nations communities.  The idea of having a policeman of sorts 
scowling through the books and backyards of first nations 
communities is not one that is particularly palatable for most 
reasonable Canadians.  Canadians are very fair minded about these 
issues and would frown quite quickly on the notion of these kinds 
of practices which are endemic and systemic to the Reform Party. 
It seems to delight in these kinds of things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the whole question of accountability, two weeks ago in 
Winnipeg I had the privilege to meet with the Auditor General of 
Canada, the chief of the Assembly of First Nations, Phil 
Fontaine, and some 300 first nations people from across the 
country.  We discussed the question of accountability within the 
first nations communities. I can tell the Reform Party and other 
members that I was absolutely delighted with that meeting and 
with discussions with the auditor general.  The grand chief and 
the first nations people were there, many of them women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have a genuine interest in resolving the administrative 
problems and practices that may be occurring on their reserves. 
They are not running away from those problems.  Many first 
nations are bringing them forward in their own communities and 
challenging their leaders to come forward with suggestions to 
make them more accountable to the members themselves.  This is 
what we cheer on and support.  It facilitates government to 
government relations.  It builds a better Canadian society and a 
better future for first nations people. This is what the 
government is trying to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the Reform Party in bringing forward these kinds of 
measures not to fan the flames of discontent and irritability 
which sometimes exist between first nations and other Canadians 
but look very deeply into these matters.  Look at them clearly 
and soberly.  Bring forward to the House of Commons some good 
suggestions that we might debate and include in our legislation 
in order to make the country an even better place in which to 
live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I thank you for your indulgence and the opportunity 
to speak in the House and to inform the hon. members. I still am 
the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development, at least, I understand, until July 15.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
speak today, on behalf of the Bloc Quebecois, to the bill put 
forward by the hon. member for Wild Rose. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1350"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT42"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should say from the outset, if we are to lay our cards on the 
table right away, that the Bloc Quebecois is going to oppose the 
hon. member's bill, for various reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We feel that the bill is extremely paternalistic.  I looked up 
the definition of ombudsman for my personal interest and I would 
like to share it with everyone.  An ombudsman is someone 
responsible for defending the rights of citizens in their 
dealings with public authorities.  The Reform Party sees an 
ombudsman as someone who will defend the rights of citizens in 
their dealings with their own elected representatives.  I find 
this extremely paternalistic, and aboriginal peoples need no 
more of the paternalism that has always plagued them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Indian Act, which has been in force since 1876, is an 
extremely paternalistic statute that leaves people completely 
powerless.  Every time they try to escape from the dependence in 
which they are trapped, they must seek the minister's 
permission.  Whether it is a question of selling grain, buying 
livestock or trying to expand their band council office, they 
are always forced to ask for additional funds or seek the 
minister's permission. This bill is more of the same and, in my 
view, is very paternalistic.  I think that we must trust 
aboriginals to resolve these issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government may support them when they have specific needs, 
but that is a far cry from having the House of Commons establish 
the office of ombudsman to sort out all these issues.  For one 
thing, I do not believe in it, and for another, I believe it is 
extremely paternalistic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois has always been proud to consult aboriginal 
people before taking a position. I am sure aboriginal people are 
not interested in having an ombudsman who will interfere in 
their lives and settle disputes. There are always disputes in 
society and we cannot always have someone like King Solomon to 
settle them. Discussion, consultation and mediation are the key 
to settling any dispute. We do not think that creating the 
office of ombudsman is the solution to all problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposal made by my colleague refers to two problems in 
particular that he would like to see solved by the ombudsman, 
namely improper financial administration and electoral 
irregularities. It is easy to say “we will appoint someone who 
will settle all this”, but I do not think this is a constructive 
solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I was saying earlier, problems are solved through discussion, 
consultation, mediation and work in the field. It is not up to 
people in Ottawa to settle these issues once and for all. This 
is not a way out for first nations, nor is it the way of the 
future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party also has a strong tendency to generalize. No 
one denies that there are problems within aboriginal 
communities. The auditor general has documented that fact. 
However, the Reform Party has a tendency to generalize when it 
discovers short term or very specific problems. Fortunately, the 
situation is not the same everywhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I regularly visit aboriginal communities. They usually are under 
very good administration. 
Certainly there are some that are poorly administered, but it is 
not fair to the aboriginal people to say that this is 
generalized, that aboriginal people are not good administrators, 
that they commit election fraud.  It is a dangerous trend, one 
that contributes to narrow-mindedness, to imply that the 
aboriginal people have always been catered to, hand and foot, 
and that everything has always been paid for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to point out that the social contract of the time, and 
yet they were here first, informed them “We are going to put you 
into some small areas.  There are 600 such small areas 
throughout Canada, 600 small communities”.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We told them “We are going to settle you there, and we will pay 
your bills.  Meanwhile, we will take over all the natural 
resources and everything that you had, because you were the 
first inhabitants, but now it is all ours”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Generalizing in this way, saying that administration is bad on 
all reserves, is a disservice to aboriginal people, and to the 
white population as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is needed is perspicacity and discernment.  That is why we 
are going to vote against the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as inappropriate financial administration is concerned, I 
have just said it was not generalized. 
Things are new.  With the agreements on land claims and 
self-government, more and more money is returning to the native 
peoples, who are now being invited to administer it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to put ourselves in the shoes of people who, for 325 
years, have administered nothing.  The Minister of Indian 
Affairs has administered everything for them.  It is 
understandable that there are certain problems at times.  These 
people must be given the benefit of the doubt.  We must not 
condemn them out of hand, saying they are worthless, will never 
manage and will always have to be supervised.  Earlier, it was 
said that the first criticism of this bill was its paternalism. 
Things have to be seen differently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general has indicated a number of problems, and they 
have to be resolved other than through an ombudsman. 
One of the ways proposed, which we wholeheartedly support, 
involves some support from Canada's chartered accountants.  They 
said they are prepared to lend a hand, to help those communities 
needing their expertise or to make it available to them at a 
reasonable price in order to set things up and try to reconcile 
rigid and responsible administration with the fact that nothing 
like this has happened for 125 years.  This is another way out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also support everything that involves round tables.  The 
native people discuss and settle their problems in a circle. 
This approach is totally in keeping with native tradition and 
culture.  One way around things would be for the native peoples 
to meet with specialists in the matter and discuss things until 
solutions are reached. 
This should not be left up to someone in Ottawa, who will decide 
what is right.  This is the wrong approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for electoral irregularities, everyone knows that the Indian 
Act provides a mechanism.  This statute has not always been very 
sensitive to native traditions.  In addition, there have been 
amendments, with the result that aboriginals may now have their 
own electoral system, subject to the minister's approval of 
course. At least now aboriginals can benefit from  electoral 
legislation more in tune with their traditions and culture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would like to see more trust placed in aboriginals.  We trust 
them to sort out their own affairs. 
When we have bills that affect them, we should consult them. 
They too have a great desire to end their longstanding 
dependence on the federal government.  When I say end, I do not 
mean to go their own way completely and do whatever they wish. 
They must be allowed to manage their future in a manner 
respecting their traditions and their culture, which are very 
different from ours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all these reasons, and particularly because we trust 
aboriginals to resolve their own problems, the Bloc Quebecois 
will oppose Bill C-222 put forward by the member for Wild Rose.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in the House to speak to Bill C-222 introduced by the member for 
Wild Rose. This bill, the first nations ombudsman act, would 
establish the office of an ombudsman to investigate complaints of 
an administrative, financial or electoral nature concerning first 
nations people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have all read in the papers about mismanagement on first 
nations in Canada and how more than $4 billion provided to first 
nations in transfer payments did not always reach the intended 
recipients.

<A HREF="#LINKT44"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem with this is that it has given some people the false 
sense that all first nations are poorly managed, when in fact 
many first nations manage themselves extremely well.  It is the 
examples of mismanagement and misconduct that make the news and 
malign the efforts of other first nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This does not mean however that an ombudsman's office is not a 
good idea.  On the contrary, this suggestion has a great deal of 
merit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Provencher was stating that he did not think this 
was a good idea and that he did not believe the government would 
go along with this because somehow it would mysteriously change 
the way we do business.  Yet our own government has an 
ombudsman's office and should have an ombudsman's office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many organizations, including governments, make use of similar 
offices to provide people with an avenue by which they can lodge 
a complaint and feel that their concerns are being addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members of parliament, all of us have had occasions where we 
have either advised constituents of the presence of an 
ombudsman's office or, as a last resort, when a constituent feels 
that an ombudsman still has not responded satisfactorily to the 
problem, we have sent him or her to a higher office.  Every 
member of parliament in the House, I am sure at one time or 
another, has used an ombudsman's office or has suggested that a 
constituent use an ombudsman's office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The establishment of a similar office for first nations would be 
an effective and useful means of addressing concerns of 
aboriginal people, whether it be matters resulting from alleged 
unfair election practices or financial or administrative 
problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the PC Party's critic for Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, I had heard from aboriginal people on numerous 
occasions who have expressed their frustration with the lack of 
options available to them when they question the procedures or 
processes of the band chief and council.  An independent 
ombudsman's office would provide a possible solution and would be 
in a position to assess information and respond to complaints. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, it would allow aboriginal people to air their 
grievances when they feel they have been ignored by the chief and 
council or are unwilling to discuss it in a more public format. 
In some cases ombudsman's offices will only investigate an issue 
if all other avenues have been explored.  In the case of first 
nations, however, it would be more effective if the ombudsman's 
office could be contacted at any stage or whenever a problem 
arises.  It is my understanding that this bill would not limit 
access to the ombudsman's office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the bill would allow any member of a first nation 
community to avail himself or herself of this service whether 
they live on or off reserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the provisions of the bill, the ombudsman would be 
appointed for a term of five years with the governor in council 
making the appointment on the recommendation of the minister. 
First nations would be involved in this process by making 
representations to the committee that would then report to the 
minister.  It is important to ensure the impartiality of the 
ombudsman and this process would distance the first nations from 
the appointment of that ombudsman, otherwise the effectiveness 
and objectiveness of this office would be jeopardized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In places where there have been questions about the legality of 
election processes or allegations of inappropriate use of band 
funds, there is currently little opportunity for aboriginal 
people to lodge a complaint except with the people who are often 
implicated in that same complaint. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously this is not an ideal situation and does little to 
alleviate the problem.  The only other course of action available 
is to complain to the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development or to members of parliament, particularly those in 
the critic area or with in whose constituency the first nation 
falls. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has a fiduciary responsibility to 
aboriginal people and has the obligation to work on behalf of 
aboriginal people to protect their rights.  This is an onerous 
responsibility that is sometimes misunderstood.  The bill would 
acknowledge that first nations people also have to rely upon 
themselves and their organizations and elected bodies to protect 
their rights and access to services.  Instead of having to 
outline their complaints to the minister of Indian affairs, they 
would have an independent ombudsman's office that would address 
their concerns.  With the input of first nations, this process 
has the potential to help first nations people assume greater 
responsibility and accountability for their actions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In some cases band members are not able to access the 
information that would help them prove their allegations.  The 
bill would provide an ombudsman with the power and authority to 
access such records.  At the same time, it would be at the 
discretion of the ombudsman as to what constitutes reasonable 
grounds for an investigation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said earlier, I feel the bill has a lot of merit.  There 
are always misunderstandings or misdemeanours that can easily be 
addressed if the proper process is put in place.  The 
establishment of an ombudsman's office is one solution that could 
help first nations better serve their communities and, in the 
long term, provide better service, more transparency and 
accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are objectives that all governments and institutions 
strive to achieve with varying degrees of success. It is always a 
good idea to explore new options and possibilities for 
improvement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is a worthy proposal.  It is not without some problems 
but the idea of an ombudsman's office should be embraced by the 
government and by all members of parliament. It would seem only 
natural that there be someone to whom ordinary citizens of Canada 
could turn to when they have questions or when they feel they 
have not been treated fairly by the authorities.  All other 
segments of Canadian society have an ombudsman's office somewhere 
that they can turn to.  Why should we exclude the ombudsman's 
office from first nations communities? 
<P><A NAME="LINK178"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
Bill C-222, the first nations ombudsman bill, was proposed by my 
seatmate and friend, the hon. member for Wild Rose.  I would like 
to thank and congratulate him for this initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was listening as the parliamentary secretary passed judgment 
on the bill and I have a couple of comments to make before I 
start into the main part of my speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said that the Indian Act is incongruent with this proposal. 
That may well be, but the minister, I understand, wants the 
standing committee to look at amendments to the Indian Act and, 
of course, we can always make amendments to accommodate this 
proposal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I travelled with the Indian affairs committee, I spoke to a 
chief who told me how their traditional electoral practices 
worked.  I will explain this process so that people can hear 
about the kinds of things that can happen when we go traditional. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When all the candidates for a particular office, let us say the 
chief, get into a large room they are all sent into different 
corners.  While they are waiting there, all the voters gather in 
the middle of the large room and begin moving toward their 
various candidates.  One can well imagine the intimidation one 
would feel.  This is not to say that anyone is being intimidated, 
but members can just imagine how lonely we would feel all alone 
in a corner and then finding out that our jobs had been on the 
line.  There is no secrecy in a situation like that.  If someone 
had found that his or her job or some benefits he or she had 
accrued as a member of the band were lost as a result of this 
process, he or she may want to bring that to the attention of an 
ombudsman. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary said “stay out of the courts”.  In 
response to that, I must say that his government is so frequently 
in the courts with different bands and first nations that it is 
almost impossible to write it all down.  We know there are 
hundreds of millions of dollars worth of claims pending against 
the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there are flaws, we accept that.  There is probably no piece 
of legislation the Liberals have ever introduced that has been 
perfect.  What do we do when we get a bill?  We pass it and send 
it to a committee for review.  We could invite the band 
leadership to the committee to pass judgment, give their advice 
on how to improve it or just tell us what they think.  Why would 
we kill it here?  The initiative did not come from the House.  It 
came from the grassroots people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reports of mismanagement are downplayed but they come from 
across Canada.  I was reading newspaper reports last year about 
east coast chiefs and councillors holding and doling out high 
paying jobs.  Judge Reilly in Alberta caused an uproar when he 
slammed the Indian leadership for problems that contributed to a 
number of suicides on the Samson Cree Nation Reserve at Hobbema. 
Nothing was happening until he issued his report.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Squamish band members in B.C. have asked the RCMP to 
investigate band finances.  They have appealed to Indian affairs 
for help and were told that the department was only a funding 
agency, that it was not an investigative body, which is true.  It 
is only a funding agency but it is also supposed to be a 
legislative agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year the <I>National Post</I> ran an entire series of 
articles detailing the squalor and corruption on some reserves 
and the helplessness of band members to effect change.  The need 
for such an officer became apparent to participants at grassroots 
meetings of aboriginals sponsored by the Reform MPs in the summer 
of 1998 and 1999.  I was there and I would not have believed it 
if I had not seen it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These meetings were held across Canada with a significant cross 
section of people attending.  The idea of an aboriginal ombudsman 
came out of those meetings.  One of its strongest supporters was 
Leona Freed who has emerged as the leader of a new group called 
First Nations Accountability Coalition.  These people are calling 
for this, not us because we think we have all the solutions.  We 
think that the people who are affected by legislation might also 
have some solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Participants at these meetings charged band leadership with 
questionable allocation of band funds:  refusals to conduct 
forensic audits when requested; jobs changing hands after band 
elections; nepotism, favouritism, cronyism; housing allocations 
to families and friends of chiefs and councillors; band leaders 
flying high on expense accounts, going all over the world to 
meetings and whatever; third world living conditions on wealthy 
reserves; misuse of dedicated funds meant for training, health, 
housing and land purchases; and any number of things.  The 
government denies all of this, but from time to time it has to 
admit the facts in individual cases.  However, it refuses to see 
a cause and effect relationship or to believe that anything can 
be done to improve the situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Department of Indian and Northern Affairs has been of little 
or no use.  Letters written in confidence to the minister have 
fallen into the wrong hands.  What has been done?  Allegation 
co-ordinators have been established to help with the work of 
co-ordinating allegations made, but they have no teeth, no 
authority to act and no investigative powers.  What use they are 
is up in the air. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997 several elders, led by Greg Twoyoungmen from Alberta, 
came to Ottawa to meet with the Minister of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development to talk about the problems on their 
reserves.  What did they get from the minister?  They got a 
closed door.  The minister would not meet with them.  The only 
people who would meet with them were the Reform Party critic and 
deputy critic for Indian affairs.  Much of what we hear came from 
there as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who do these people turn to when all the doors are closed? The 
department of Indian affairs sends people back to their reserve 
leaders.  The RCMP need significant proof before they can move. 
They cannot go to the courts for lengthy and expensive court 
battles on a civil basis because they simply do not have the 
funds available to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was the grassroots Indians themselves who proposed the office 
of aboriginal ombudsman as an independent watchdog.  They are 
convinced that an ombudsman will enable band members to exercise 
oversight into the affairs of bands in a way that is out of their 
grasp right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the better parts of this proposal is that the ombudsman 
would not serve at the pleasure of bands but would serve a fixed 
term of five years and not more than two terms.  The ombudsman's 
pay cheque would not come from a band so his or her independence 
would be assured and he or she could not be called into question. 
The ombudsman would get assistance from the Chief Electoral 
Officer when needed to help settle disputes and would report to 
parliament annually. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The need for such legislation is clear.  The bill is worthy of 
support by members of the House.  I encourage every member to 
vote in favour of it, send it to committee and let the first 
nations leadership meet with the committee and give their views 
on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be a mistake to let some of the assertions from the 
other parties that have opposed this legislation, that what the 
Reform Party is saying is that all band membership is illegal and 
that is why this is needed, to go unanswered. 
That is not so.  For the times it does, it hurts individuals. 
Many bands conduct their affairs in an open and businesslike way. 
They have nothing to fear from any legislation that is designed 
to protect individuals.  Individuals are often hurt by that type 
of thing.

three or four people come to my office, we sit in a circle around 
my coffee table and we have a ceremonial drink.  We call it 
coffee.  We are pretty much alike when it comes to that type of 
thing.  We gather in a circle, face one another and hash out the 
problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not the issue at all.  The issue is protection of 
individual people who run afoul of a large bureaucratic 
organization that has economic, political and judicial power on 
its side.  The people need an aboriginal ombudsman to protect 
them.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I congratulate my colleague for introducing this 
critically important bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One profound tragedy in our country today is the existing 
situation for aboriginal people on and off reserve. The present 
government, previous governments and all Canadians have created 
an institutionalized welfare system in aboriginal communities. 
Through legislation we have put our heels on the necks of those 
people and have prevented them from having the same rights, 
responsibilities and obligations as other Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an insult to them that the government and previous 
governments have pursued these policies for such a long time.  It 
will lead to the balkanization of our country.  It will do 
nothing to address the fundamental problem of grassroots 
aboriginal people being dislocated from the wealth, the hope, the 
possibilities and prosperity that this country has to offer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is empowering, albeit with honest intentions, the 
leadership of aboriginal people to rule.  It is doing nothing to 
ensure that grassroots aboriginal people generate the control, 
responsibility and power to stand on their own two feet.  That is 
why this bill is so important.  It is important to have an 
ombudsman to ensure that grassroots aboriginal people are heard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have some true stories to tell.  I have worked with 
aboriginals for a long time on and off reserve and in emergency 
rooms.  I have seen firsthand the devastation brought on by fetal 
alcohol syndrome, child abuse, sexual abuse and gross poverty.  I 
have not seen this type of situation since I worked in Africa. 
There have been medical problems that I have not seen since I 
worked in the third world.  It is going on in our country today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I implore the media to investigate what is happening in Nunavut, 
in northern Ontario, in northern Quebec, in Vancouver East and in 
northern British Columbia.  This is not to say that all reserves 
or all aboriginal people are suffering from the same maladies. 
The incidence of poverty, medical problems and disempowered 
aboriginals is epidemic. We are ensuring that continues by virtue 
of the policies that are implemented in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to empower grassroots people, but through the Nisga'a 
treaty and others we have done the exact opposite.  We have 
empowered the people at the top.  Time and time again grassroots 
aboriginal people have come to me saying they would like to send 
their children to school.  But a lot of the money that is to go 
to the school to pay for books and teachers and to ensure that 
the kids get an education does not get there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The elders in the aboriginal communities are saying that they 
would like to teach their people their traditional ways.  Money 
has been allocated for that but it does not get to them.  It 
disappears.  Yet the chief and band council members drive 
expensive cars, live in expensive homes and go on expensive 
vacations while their people live in abject poverty.

</I></B></P><P align=left>If we were successful and if proposals made by the government 
and previous governments and the Conservative Party had worked, 
why is it that aboriginal communities have some of the highest 
rates of violence and sexual abuse?  Their mortality figures are 
the highest. Maternal deaths are the highest. Infant mortality 
figures are well beyond anything in the non-aboriginal community. 
Why is it that their diabetes rates are four times higher than 
non-aboriginal communities?  I could go on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Individual grassroots aboriginal people are not empowered to 
stand on their own two feet.  We are not giving them the same 
resources and legal tools which enable us to produce for 
ourselves, our families and our communities. By doing so we get 
self-respect. It is a myth to say that we can give people 
self-respect. People only get self-respect by taking it.  We only 
get it by being able to support ourselves, our families and our 
communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is up to the aboriginal leaders to take a different tack and 
control themselves.  How can they ensure that their people are 
going to have the power to represent themselves as opposed to the 
present situation where a small cabal of people at the top 
controls the situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some aboriginal reserves work well under these conditions, the 
ones on the west coast in the Charlottes for example.  There is 
responsible governance on the part of the people.  They have 
invested the money the government has given them in ways which 
the people earn revenue.  They have invested in the tools which 
give aboriginal people the education and the power to generate 
funds and work.  They have healthy communities and live in 
congruence with their environment. This is what is taking place 
in some communities but unfortunately in many communities across 
the country that is not the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can only plead with the government for an ombudsman to ensure 
that aboriginal people are heard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the current HRD minister was minister of Indian affairs, I 
went to her about situations in my riding. Children were falling 
into open sewers. Health Canada determined it to be a health 
hazard to the people living in the area. Yet it took years to get 
the money to the people so they could fix the problem.  In part 
the leadership was not prepared to deal with these people in an 
honest way.  This is what is happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The regional director could not intervene on behalf of the 
grassroots aboriginal people because the leadership in the 
community said no.  The leadership in the community was 
compromising—and I am saying that nicely—the ability of the 
grassroots people to fix the problems on the reserve. If their 
own leadership will not speak for them, who will? The leadership, 
the director and the minister will not speak for them.  If the 
minister just turns her face away and says that is the way it is, 
who will speak for these people?  No one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If non-aboriginal people suffered from the same type of nonsense 
that aboriginal people suffer from, they would not tolerate it 
because it would violate their basic rights.  The basic rights of 
aboriginal people are being violated across Canada.  As a result 
they are suffering from health problems and poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To merely give them money will not work.  It will not work to 
engage in a process of land claims that will balkanize the 
provinces. It is going to compromise the tax base of a province 
and its ability to work with people to provide resources for 
everybody. We are going to compromise the economy of those 
provinces for everybody. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only people who will benefit from this are the people at the 
top in aboriginal communities.  That is what is happening. 
The fact that the government is prepared to turn a blind eye and 
stick its head in the sand is one of the greatest tragedies of 
this country today.  It is truly profound.

room.  We will not see the children with gross infections on 
their faces, sitting among adults, looking for basic parenting, 
looking for the basic care which all children deserve.  They do 
not receive that care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Understandably, their societies are ill.  If any of us were put 
in that environment, whether we were aboriginal or 
non-aboriginal, we would do the same thing.  If we give people 
things all the time we create an institutionalized welfare state 
which takes the souls from human beings.  It cuts away at the 
souls of the people.  It destroys them from inside.  That is why 
these people simply cannot get on their own feet, given the 
current situation and given the current legal tools which this 
government and previous governments have followed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this way of doing things were successful, then we would have 
seen a dramatic improvement in the health and welfare of 
aboriginal people.  Have we?  The answer is an obvious no.  The 
longer we continue doing what we are doing, the longer this will 
continue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members from all political parties find the situation to be 
appalling.  I know that all members of parliament want to do 
something about it.  I know that all members want to work with 
aboriginal people to ensure that there is change.  For God's 
sake, give those people the same rights and responsibilities that 
we have.  They will flourish.  They will teach us a great deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1967 former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau created a superb 
white paper.  He recognized at that time that the way to 
aboriginal emancipation was through integration, not 
assimilation.  Those were wise words then and they are wise words 
today.  I can only implore the Minister of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development and the Prime Minister to hearken back to 
that document which was created by Mr. Trudeau, read it again and 
listen to what he said.  Within the context of that document is, 
in my view, in our view and I think in the heart of the Prime 
Minister, the way to ensure that aboriginal and non-aboriginal 
people will come together, respecting their differences, ensuring 
that the respective cultures and languages will flourish and 
ensuring that all people in this beautiful country will be 
empowered to be the best they can become. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The failure to acknowledge that, the failure to change the 
present course, which is a course of separation, a course of 
balkanization, will hurt not only aboriginal people but 
non-aboriginal people.  That is something that all of us will 
have to live with for the rest of our lives.  We can strive for 
something better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must work with grassroots aboriginal people, not necessarily 
the leadership.  Normally these questions are dealt with by the 
leadership of aboriginal groups and parliamentarians. The 
discussion does not get to the people on the ground, who want the 
same things which we have.  They want safety, they want hope, 
they want prosperity and they want a future.  They want to live. 
They want their culture and language to survive in perpetuity. 
We want that and they want that.  We would all benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot tolerate the present situation.  It will ensure the 
ultimate cultural and social genocide of these people.  That is 
something for which we as Canadians should never be proud. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that 20 years from now we will see that the Nisga'a 
treaty was a success.  I truly hope for that.  However, it is our 
view that it will not be the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that the government will see fit to work with us and to 
implement the solutions found in the document of former Prime 
Minister Trudeau for the sake of all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The time provided 
for the consideration of Private Members' Business has now 
expired and the order is dropped to the bottom of the order of 
precedence on the order paper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It being 2.30 p.m., the House stands adjourned until Monday next 
at 11 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
