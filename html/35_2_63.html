	<B>Mrs. Eleni Bakopanos (Saint-Denis, Lib.)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should support all 
measures leading to the demilitarization of the Republic of Cyprus in such a way 
as to enhance prospects for a peaceful and lasting resolution of the dispute 
regarding Cyprus that would benefit all the people of Cyprus and bring about an 
end to more than two decades of division on the island.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	She said: Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a saddened heart to speak 
about a tragedy that has endured for nearly 22 years, a tragedy 
which highlights the failure of the international community to find 
a just and viable solution to a grave injustice of this century. Just 
because it does not make the headlines every week does not mean 
the Cyprus problem is under control.
<P>
	A recent shooting in the UN buffer zone of a Cypriot soldier is a 
clear reminder to all of us that this situation could turn into a crisis 
at any time.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	For me, this motion represents my commitment to human rights 
and to the peaceful resolution of international conflicts. At a time 
when respect for the great principles of international law and for 
basic human rights is an essential requirement for a fair and stable 
international order, Cyprus remains an unacceptable and tragic 
exception.
<P>
<B>(1105)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The Cyprus problem involves the illegal occupation of a small 
country by a large and militarily much stronger neighbour. It 
involves a violation of international treaties, a systemic destruction 
of a cultural heritage of an ancient land with thousands of years of 
history and civilization, and a displacement of more than a third of  
Cyprus' population and the tragedy of 1,619 missing persons.
<P>
	What makes the Cyprus issue a particular tragedy is that while 
numerous conflicts rage on around the world without a solution in 
sight, the Cyprus problem does have a solution that is within the 
reach of the international community. This is the demilitarization 
proposal I am introducing in the House of Commons today.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The United Nations has tried on several occasions to reconcile 
the two communities, but without success. Let us note the role 
played in the latest UN initiatives by the Right Hon. Joe Clark as 
special representative of the Secretary General of the United 
Nations from May 1993 to May 1996. Unfortunately, no agreement 
was reached because the Turkish side was not flexible enough. We 
are now at an impasse.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The continuing presence and overwhelming military strength of 
the Turkish occupation troops on the island, currently standing near 
30,000, is perhaps one of the biggest stumbling blocks in the 
resolution of the Cyprus problem.
<P>
	This is an alarming fact that led the United Nations secretary 
general to describe the occupied area of Cyprus in his December 
1995 report to the security council as ``one of the most highly 
militarized areas in the world in terms of the ratio between 
numbers of troops and civilian population''.
<P>
	This has led to the creation of unstable conditions threatening 
peace and security not only in Cyprus but in the wider region of the 
south eastern Mediterranean. Security concerns and anxieties are of 
crucial importance to both sides and serve to promote continued 
mistrust which we all know is detrimental to any solution.
<P>
	What the situation requires is a solution that will take into 
account the security concerns of both sides, a solution that will help 
to restore confidence and enhance prospects for a peaceful and 
lasting solution to this grave problem.
<P>
	The proposal by the president of Cyprus, Mr. Glafcos Clerides, 
for the complete demilitarization of the republic of Cyprus is such 
a solution. Formally submitted to the United Nations in December 
1993, this comprehensive plan, if implemented, provides among 
other things for the disbanding of the Cypriot National Guard and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3894"> 3894 </A></B>
<P>
the handing over of all its arms and military equipment to 
substantially strengthen the UN peacekeeping force.
<P>
	The money saved from defence spending would be used to fully 
finance this force and the remainder of the savings would be 
reserved for development projects to benefit both communities. 
This offer is conditional on the parallel withdrawal of Turkish 
troops and Turkish settlers from Cyprus, as also called for in the 
UN resolutions-there are a number of them-and the disbanding 
of Turkish Cypriot armed units.
<P>
	If implemented, these measures leading to a reciprocal reduction 
of defence spending and reduction in the number of troops on 
Cyprus will help to restore confidence between the parties, will 
meet the security concerns of all parties involved and will enhance 
the prospects for a peaceful and lasting resolution of the dispute 
regarding Cyprus. These would benefit all the people of Cyprus and 
bring an end to more than two decades of division of the island.
<P>
	Recent developments have made the resolution to the Cyprus 
problem an issue once again for the international community.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In fact, the European Union was to start six months after the 
1996 intergovernmental conference closes, that is to say, in about 
two years.
<P>
<B>(1110)</B>
<P>
	As a result, Europe is getting involved more seriously in the 
resolution of the Cyprus problem. The European Union, the United 
States and Great Britain have also appointed special 
representatives. More than at any other time, a solution may be 
within reach.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The final issue I wish to address is perhaps the most pertinent for 
the House and its members. Why as members of Parliament should 
we support this? That is a question everyone will be asking today. 
The answer is self-evident for me: Canada's longstanding 
commitment to the peaceful resolution of conflicts and its regard 
for human rights violations wherever they may occur. Canadians 
are no strangers to the Cyprus problem, having been involved in the 
United Nations peacekeeping forces in Cyprus for nearly 30 years.
<P>
	We have an opportunity today to lend our respected voice in the 
international community to bring about the successful 
implementation of this plan and to send a clear message that the 
status quo is no longer an acceptable solution.
<P>
	The proposal has already received considerable support. At a 
meeting of the Commonwealth nations in November 1995, the 
heads of government, including our  Prime Minister, expressed full 
support for the proposal by the president of the Cypriot government 
for the demilitarization of Cyprus. Resolutions have been passed in 
both the United States Senate and Congress. The European Union 
has also passed a resolution welcoming the proposal. Most 
recently, Australia and New Zealand respectively passed 
resolutions in support of this proposal.
<P>
	Canada contributed to the United Nations peacekeeping forces in 
Cyprus for nearly three decades. We have not forgotten this issue 
nor its importance to all Canadians, in particular Canadians of 
Cypriot origin.
<P>
	This motion will reiterate Canada's conviction that only peaceful 
negotiations can bring disputes to a peaceful and just resolution. 
Canada has shown leadership in the field of human rights and has 
stood firm on its commitment to respect for international law. As 
Canadians we can once again show leadership through the Minister 
of Foreign Affairs and the Prime Minister by supporting this 
motion. I invite all members on both sides of the House to support 
this motion. This will be our first step in finding a just and viable 
solution to the Cyprus problem.
<P>
	Why should Nicosia remain as the only divided capital city in 
the world? We have seen the tumbling of the Berlin wall, the 
commencement of a Middle East peace process. Why can we not 
work together as responsible members of the international 
community to bring an end to the Cyprus problem once and for all?
<P>
	I intend to raise this matter tomorrow in the House in a question 
to the Minister of Foreign Affairs. He has said he will support this 
motion and will work hard with other members of the 
Canada-Cyprus friendship committee of the House in order to 
find a viable and just solution to a problem, a tragedy, that has 
existed for 22 years.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to rise in support of Motion M-239 tabled on May 1 by the hon. 
member for Saint-Denis. In her motion, the hon. member is asking 
that the government ``support all measures leading to the 
demilitarization of the Republic of Cyprus in such a way as to 
enhance prospects for a peaceful and lasting resolution of the 
dispute regarding Cyprus''.
<P>
	I commend my colleague for this initiative. It was with her and 
other parliamentarians that I travelled to that country in January 
1995. This visit has been an unforgettable experience for me. 
Unfortunately, we were able to visit only the southern part of the 
island, that is the Greek part under the control of President Glafcos 
Clerides, whose government has been recognized by the 
international community. We could nevertheless see, in the 
distance, the ghost city of Famagusta, a city now abandoned that 
played a major role in the history of Cyprus.
<P>

<HR>

<P>
	Cyprus combines oriental and occidental values. A small island 
240 kilometres long by 100 kilometres wide, with a total area of 
9,251 square kilometres, lying in the eastern Mediterranean Basin, 
Cyprus has a history that goes back more than 3,000 years. 
Unfortunately, this country has sustained the effects of the 
antagonism between the Greeks and the Turks dating back to the 
fall of Constantinople in 1453.
<P>
	Cyprus was also marked by 82 years of British occupation. 
Indeed, Cyprus was a British colony from 1878 to August 1960, 
when it achieved independence. At that time, 81 per cent of the 
574,000 residents of the islands were Greek speaking and 18 per 
cent were Turkish speaking. In Parliament in Nicosia, 35 seats were 
allocated to Greek speaking Cypriots as compared to 15 to their 
Turkish speaking fellow citizens, or a 70 to 30 ratio.
<P>
	Within just a few years, an interethnic spark of violence 
degenerated into a bloody conflict affecting the whole island. The 
Turkish Cypriots decided to create a separate government they 
called PTCA, which stands for Provisional Turkish Cypriot 
Administration.
<P>
	In 1964, UN peacekeepers, including a Canadian contingent, 
took over from the British troops. That year, Greece dispatched 
approximately 5,000 troops to Cyprus while Turkey built its 
military strength up to 10,000 on the island. That is how the green 
line, or neutral zone between the Turkish and Greek 
neighbourhoods of Nicosia, came to be.
<P>
	From 1964 to 1974, Cyprus experienced a relatively calm period 
and had a great president in the person of Archbishop Makarios, 
who governed well and was a leader of the group of non aligned 
countries. I had the honour of meeting him in Chile, during a visit 
in that country. In 1974, the dictatorship of the colonels in Greece 
organized a coup in Cyprus. Ankara took advantage of the situation 
and sent 7,000 troops, who occupied one third of the island.
<P>
	We must look for a negotiated settlement in Cyprus. In his May 
1994 report to the security council, the UN secretary general stated 
that the security council was facing an already familiar scenario, 
namely the absence of an agreement essentially because of a lack 
of political will on the Turkish Cypriot side.
<P>
	In my opinion, we must first end the occupation of the island by 
about 40,000 Turkish troops. The UN secretary general also 
identifies Cyprus as one of the most militarized zones in the world, 
in terms of its soldiers and civilians. In November 1993, the 
secretary general said that the security council found unacceptable 
the status quo in Cyprus, which was established and maintained 
through the use of force.
<P>
	Part of the solution lies in the proposal made by the President of 
Cyprus, Glafcos Clerides, to completely demilitarize the island. 
The proposal was submitted to the UN in December 1993 and 
reaffirmed on many occasions since. It involves the dismantling of 
the Cypriot national guard and the surrender of all military 
weapons and equipment to a UN peacekeeping force.
<P>
	I support Motion M-239 to demilitarize Cyprus. I am very 
touched by the support of Dr. Oscar Arias, the former President of 
Costa Rica, who is leading an extraordinary campaign to end 
armament. Costa Rica is already a demilitarized country, as is 
Panama and, more recently, Haiti. I support the demilitarization of 
these three countries. The money thus saved could be used to 
promote the island's economic and social development.
<P>
<B>(1120)</B>
<P>
	The UN peacekeeping force must continue to play a lead role in 
this peace process. This demilitarization proposal has already been 
supported by the U.S. House of Representatives and the European, 
Australian and New Zealand parliaments, as well as the 
Commonwealth heads of government at their 1995 meeting in New 
Zealand. It is now the turn of this House of Commons to support 
this initiative, which will, I believe, lead to peace and stability for 
this island.
<P>
	I thank the Cypriot community of Canada, particularly those in 
Quebec, for constantly keeping the problem of Cyprus before us, 
and for bringing legitimate pressure to bear so that a solution may 
be found to this problem as soon as possible.
<P>
	Being a member of the Commonwealth like Cyprus, Canada 
ought to play a more significant role in peace keeping and in 
finding a solution to the Cyprus problem. This problem has gone 
unresolved for far too long. I urge the Canadian government to step 
up its efforts in this area.
<P>
	On the one hand, I find it deplorable that Canada pulled its 
peacekeepers out of Cyprus in 1992, after 29 years of presence on 
the island. The presence of the UN peacekeeping force is 
indispensable as an aid to negotiation and political settlement of 
the Cypriot question.
<P>
	On the other hand, the mediation overtures begun by former 
Prime Minister Joe Clark, representing Secretary General Boutros 
Boutros-Ghali, have unfortunately not led to the anticipated results.
<P>
	I also find it deplorable that Canada is represented by only an 
honourary consul in Cyprus. The situation there, and the size of the 
Cypriot community here in Canada, justify the presence of a full 
time career consul general.
<P>
	I hope that the Republic of Cyprus, as my colleague has said, 
will be able to join the European community in the near future. 
This will help solve the problem.
<P>
	Greek and Turkish Cypriots have lived peaceably together for 
four centuries. The 1974 crisis left more than 3,500 dead, 3,000 of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3896"> 3896 </A></B>
<P>
those Greek Cypriots. As well there are another 1,619 missing, 
whose fate is as yet unknown.
<P>
	During my visit, I was made aware of this tragedy of the 
thousands of missing persons, when I spoke of having become 
familiar with the same phenomenon of the disappeared in Chile, 
Argentina and a number of other countries. The disappeared 
represent a very serious problem today. I might mention as well 
that, in Cyprus alone, there are also more than 200,000 displaced 
persons.
<P>
	Cyprus, a country I came to love very much during my visit, has 
played a great role in the past. Since 1974, however, its people 
remain separated, because no solution has been acceptable to both 
the Greek community in the south and the Turkish community in 
the north.
<P>
	I also saw that the area we visited is experiencing a very strong 
economic upturn, and the standard of living is very high. 
Thousands of tourists every year visit the island. I would like to see 
every part of Cyprus benefit from prosperity and a still higher 
standard of living.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, Motion No. 239 
put forth by the hon. member for Saint Denis reflects the intent 
previously stated by the United Nations, the Australian Parliament, 
the New Zealand Parliament, the U.S. Senate and the U.S. House of 
Representatives. By supporting this motion, Canada will be joining 
these world leaders in calling for a peaceful settlement of the 
Cyprus issue and ensuring the future stability and well-being of the 
people of Cyprus.
<P>
	In joining the nations and global organizations that have 
previously stated their support for the demilitarization of Cyprus, 
Canada is declaring that demilitarization would meet the security 
concerns of all parties involved. It would enhance prospects for a 
peaceful and lasting resolution of the dispute regarding Cyprus. It 
would benefit all the people of Cyprus and hence merits 
international support.
<P>
<B>(1125)</B>
<P>
	Cyprus has been plagued with conflict since 1963 when violence 
broke out over accumulated tension between the Greek and Turkish 
communities. Cyprus became independent of British rule three 
years earlier, with a constitution intended to balance the interests of 
the island's Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities.
<P>
	A treaty between Cyprus, Greece, Turkey and the United 
Kingdom guaranteed the basic provisions of the constitution and 
the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Cyprus. Unfortunately, 
the application of the provisions of the constitution were not easily 
enforced and tensions between the two communities escalated with 
time and eventually led to the outbreak of violence.
<P>
	As early as 1964 the United Nations established a peacekeeping 
force in Cyprus. Since then, the security council has periodically 
extended the mandate of the peacekeeping mission. Most recently 
the security council extended the mandate of the peace force until 
June 30, 1996. While expressing concern that there has been no 
progress toward a final political solution and while urging the 
leaders of both communities to promote tolerance and 
reconciliation, these forces will doubtless continue to patrol the 
buffer zone between the 30,000 Turkish troops that remain in 
Cyprus and the Greek Cypriot forces.
<P>
	The presence of Turkish troops in northern Cyprus as well as the 
Greek troops occupying the area hamper the search for a freely 
negotiated solution to the dispute. These troops pose a potential 
threat to the security and well-being of all Cypriots and hinder the 
peace and stability of the region.
<P>
	Until demilitarization occurs there is a strong danger that 
negotiations will remain unprosperous and no settlement will be 
reached. This conflict has lasted too long and we as members of an 
influential nation must voice our concern for the Cypriot people 
who continue to suffer from uncertainty about the future of their 
country.
<P>
	Cyprus has become a test case of the effectiveness of the United 
Nations and of the application of the basic rules of international 
law. Since this conflict began, the United Nations has proposed a 
number of peace plans to create a federal independent and 
non-aligned Cypriot state. The United Nations has also sponsored 
numerous rounds of negotiations between the conflicting parties, 
most of which have not been fruitful.
<P>
	In 1992 Dr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali reported to the UN security 
council on the results of the latest round of negotiations. He 
regrettably announced that the lack of political will continued to 
block the conclusion of an agreement.
<P>
	In that same year the security council reaffirmed that a 
settlement must be based on a state of Cyprus with a single 
sovereignty and international personality and a single citizenship, 
with its independence and territorial integrity safeguarded. In 1994 
resolution No. 939 effectively conceded in the absence of 
agreements on fundamental issues that confidence building 
measures were not a realistic possibility to ending the conflict. 
Unfortunately, the presence of foreign troops in Cyprus has 
hindered the ability of negotiators to come up with agreements on 
the fundamental issues mentioned in resolution No. 939.
<P>
	The European Parliament in a joint resolution called upon the 
European Union, its member states and Turkey to give their full 
backing to a continuous and broad dialogue to promote respect for 
human rights and freedoms. This is a resolution that we must echo 
here in the Canadian House of Commons.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3897"> 3897 </A></B>
<P>
	Our concern in this issue must be first and foremost for the 
Cypriot people. They are the ones suffering from this elongated 
war and the lack of political negotiations between the warring 
nations involved. It is only through negotiated settlements between 
Greece and Turkey that peace can be restored. It is only through 
the establishment of peace that a concern for human rights and 
democracy will return to the region.
<P>
	Canada is a strong believer in human rights and fundamental 
freedom for all people. This cannot merely be a spoken promise. 
We must also act on it. We can begin by approving this motion to 
restore peace and stability to Cyprus through the removal of all 
foreign troops in the area.
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	Unfortunately, while the necessity and validity of this motion is 
not in question, its ultimate effectiveness is. Canada's distance 
from Cyprus hinders our ability to become an active participant in 
this issue. It is up to the regional authorities involved to solve this 
problem. They are the ones that must join together around the 
bargaining table and negotiate a settlement that will end the 
militarization in Cyprus and allow the Cypriot people to live in 
peace. Our role of diplomacy is the one we should be emphasizing 
and promoting in that area.
<P>
	I ask the government to call on the European Union to take a 
more active role in ending the conflict in Cyprus. The European 
Union has an influence over this conflict that Canada does not 
enjoy. First, member states of the union are at a much more 
strategic spot to deal with the Cypriot conflict than Canada is. They 
also play a unique role in the dispute in that in July 1990 Cyprus 
formally applied for full membership to the European community.
<P>
	In response to Cyprus's plea for membership, the leaders of the 
European Union agreed at the Corfu summit that the next phase of 
enlargement of the union will include Cyprus, subject to a solution 
of the Cyprus problem. This gives the European Union a tool for 
use in negotiations and ultimately a settlement of this problem.
<P>
	To give this issue the utmost attention, it is important that the 
conflict be ended now. We urge all parties involved in the Cyprus 
question to demonstrate goodwill and a new resolve to work 
actively toward a lasting and peaceful political settlement. This is 
the most effective way for Canada to become involved.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Cannis (Scarborough Centre, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am very pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to this most 
important motion, Motion No. 239, which promotes the 
demilitarization of the Republic of Cyprus. Let me say at the outset 
that I fully support this motion. I want to congratulate the member 
for Saint-Denis for bringing it forward.
<P>
	In the last several years we have witnessed the creation of new 
areas of tension and conflict through the unleashing of destructive 
forces of chauvinism and ethnic  strife. At the same time, in many 
parts of the world we have witnessed the triumph of reason, the 
entrenchment of democracy and the emergence of free market 
economies.
<P>
	In July 1994 a brutal armed force was unleashed by the Turkish 
government. The result was the illegal invasion of a sovereign state 
and member of the United Nations, the island of Cyprus. To this 
day 37 per cent of the island's territory is illegally occupied.
<P>
	Turkish and Greek Cypriots were forcibly evicted from their 
homes and became refugees in their own country. Almost 50,000 
Turkish Cypriots have been forced by Turkish troops to flee their 
homes and lose their property. Thousands of Greek Cypriots have 
been displaced, their properties stolen and their family members 
murdered. Close to 2,000 Greek Cypriots simply vanished, and to 
this very day are unaccounted for.
<P>
	This constitutes a gross violation of basic human rights for both 
the missing persons and their beleaguered families.
<P>
	I met the father of one of the missing. His name is John Kasapis. 
Mr. Kasapis is a United States citizen whose then 16-year-old son 
was vacationing in Cyprus in 1974. To this very day this 
heart-broken father has not heard of the whereabouts of his now 
38-year-old son. Is he alive or is he dead? Can this father or the 
families of the 1,619 other missing persons, of which I would like 
to point out are also relatives of many Canadians, ever rest, find 
peace and can their wounds ever heal?
<P>
	On July 20 the people of Cyprus and the rest of the civilized 
world will be commemorating the 22nd anniversary of this brutal 
and illegal invasion. I am sad to say that there seems to be no end in 
sight. It seems that no solution is the solution for the illegal Turkish

<P>
	I recently attended a meeting of NATO and the North Atlantic 
alliance group where one of the topics discussed was illegal 
immigration. I was shocked to learn that just over 20,000 illegal 
Turkish immigrants are seeking asylum in Germany.
<P>
	Mr. Katlu Adali in the Turkish newspaper <I>Yeniduzen</I> describes 
how the Turkish Cypriot population has decreased by 60,000 to 
70,000. Turkish Cypriots living in the Turkish occupied north of 
Cyprus flee to the southern part of the free island not just for jobs, 
not just for a better life, but more significantly for political asylum.
<P>
	It is also reported in the <I>Ortam</I>, another Turkish newspaper, that 
the Republic of Cyprus recognizes Turkish Cypriots as equal 
citizens of the republic as it also recognizes many other groups on 
the island, namely the Maronites, the Latins, the Armenians, just to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3898"> 3898 </A></B>
<P>
name a  few. Reading this I wonder what type of regime the Turkish 
authorities are running.
<P>
	Thousands of new Turkish settlers have been brought from 
mainland Turkey to the island and into the occupied areas. This is 
altering drastically the demographic character of Cyprus at the 
expense of Turkish and Greek Cypriots.
<P>
	In January 1992 the Spanish parliamentarian, Mr. Cuco told the 
Council of Europe's committee on migration, refugees and 
demography that the colonization of areas of Cyprus under Turkish 
occupation by Turkish settlers constitutes an additional obstacle to 
peace and is Cyprus' most serious demographic problem since the 
invasion of 1974. This was based on Mr. Cuco's on the spot 
investigation.
<P>
	Moreover, the Council of Europe has condemned the continuous 
human rights violations by Turkey, and according to a 1983 report 
released by the Council of Europe, the European commission of 
human rights found that Turkey's continuing occupation of Cyprus 
violates articles 5, 8, 14, 26 and article 1 of protocol 1 of the 
European convention on human rights. The aforementioned clearly 
condemns Turkey's violation of human rights relating to missing 
persons, the family and their properties.
<P>
	The more people who are aware of human rights violations, the 
more likely they are to act on them. The more one learns, the more 
compassionate one becomes and less likely to harm.
<P>
	Through my presentation I want people to learn to work toward 
an expedient, just solution for Cyprus and for the betterment of all 
humanity. The confidence building measures have been a step in 
the right direction, which is why this motion is most important and 
why I ask my colleagues in the House to fully support it.
<P>
	Just as our American counterparts, the European Parliament, the 
New Zealand House of Representatives and the Australian House 
of Commons are working vigorously toward helping to bring a 
speedy and just solution to the Cyprus issue, I point out that we too 
as Canadian parliamentarians, through the Canada-Cyprus 
friendship association, are working just as vigorously for a just 
solution.
<P>
	It is also important to mention to this hon. House that 
approximately two years ago the Canada-Cyprus friendship group 
under the direction of its chairman, the hon. member for Kent, 
endorsed a demilitarization proposal for Cyprus as was outlined by 
the President of the Republic of Cyprus, Mr. Clerides, to the 
Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Boutros 
Boutros-Ghali.
<P>
	Therefore, I will not go into the details of the six-point 
demilitarization plan, as it was already outlined by my colleague so 
eloquently, but I would like to take this opportunity to commend 
President Clerides for this bold initiative.
<P>
	The Commonwealth heads of government which met in 
Zimbabwe unanimously endorsed the resolution which reiterated 
its support for the independent sovereignty, territorial integrity, 
unity and non-aligned status of Cyprus and for securing 
compliance with all the United Nations' resolutions on Cyprus. 
Moreover, it expressed full support for the proposal of the president 
for the demilitarization of Cyprus.
<P>
	What is significant is that we as a Canadian government, 
members of the Commonwealth in essence have already endorsed 
this proposal. With the meeting in Zimbabwe there is even more 
reason why the House should support this motion.
<P>
	One wonders for how long the people of Cyprus will wait for the 
invader to leave their home. For how long will the Cypriot people 
stand by and witness ethic cleansing?
<P>
<B>(1140 )</B>
<P>
	The Turkish occupying forces to this very day continue to 
plunder systematically and destroy the Cypriot cultural heritage in 
the occupied area of the island. Religious property is a particular 
target. Churches continue to be converted into mosques, vandalized 
and turned into entertainment centres and pubs. What is happening 
in the occupied areas of Cyprus by the Turkish forces is a total 
disgrace and against all principles of human rights and freedoms.
<P>
	Twenty-two years have passed, and the security council's many 
resolutions remain unimplemented and totally ignored by Turkey. 
Unless the aggressor is faced with progressively more severe 
consequences for its disregard of international legal order, there is 
not going to be, I am sad to say, any solution or justice in Cyprus 
and the United Nations will lose credibility in the future.
<P>
	Cyprus is not looking for pity. Cyprus wants what we all want as 
civilized human beings. Cyprus wants what all progressive 
institutions are advocating and that is justice.
<P>
	In conclusion, not only do I extend my support for this motion 
for the demilitarization of the Republic of Cyprus, but I urge all 
hon. members of the House to do the same so that we can all be part 
of a process that will bring forth a just and peaceful solution to this 
peace loving island. Let us all work together to right the wrong. Let 
us mend the wound.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John English (Kitchener, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
extremely pleased to speak today on Motion No. 239 calling for 
demilitarization of Cyprus.
<P>
	I would like to express my thanks and support for the motion of 
my colleague from Saint-Denis. She has shown extraordinary 
commitment and perseverance in bringing forward this very 
impor-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3899"> 3899 </A></B>
<P>
tant motion. Those of us who are  familiar with private members' 
business and its trials and tribulation think it is important that we 
note her efforts.
<P>
	All members of the House are well aware of the long 
commitment Canada has made toward the peaceful resolution of 
the disputes in Cyprus. Canada has been an active participant in the 
resolution of those disputes for over 30 years, and we have 
acquired a deep knowledge and appreciation of that situation on 
that island.
<P>
	Even though Canadian troops left the island in 1993, Canadians 
maintain a deep interest because of our Commonwealth ties, 
because of the experience of so many Canadians and because so 
many Canadians are of Cypriot background.
<P>
	Today we are very worried. In the words of Secretary-General 
Boutros Boutros-Gahli: ``Cyprus is a dangerous island''. Its 
northern part is ``one of the most densely militarized areas in the 
world''. It is filled with arms and with soldiers and there are 
dangers which we hear about in the daily press.
<P>
	Last week the hon. member for Saint-Denis mentioned that a 
Greek Cypriot was killed by a Turkish soldier. This summer we 
have heard about the conflict in the Mediterranean and the entire 
eastern Mediterranean is becoming a very dangerous place and a 
genuine threat to peace on a much broader level.
<P>
	From the outset, Canada has supported the efforts of the United 
Nations and the international community toward the reunification 
of the island. This was embodied in security council resolution 939 
and we concur with the principles of that resolution that a peaceful 
negotiated settlement, based on a federal structure that would take 
into account legitimate concerns and aspirations of both 
communities is the most promising solution.
<P>
	Very recently the security council's five permanent members 
reaffirmed their full support for the good offices mission of the 
secretary-general and underlined the importance they attach to a 
comprehensive approach to an overall settlement of the Cyprus 
problem on the basis of the relevant security council resolutions 
and the discussions of 1977 and 1979.
<P>
	That is why we are here today for this very important debate. 
Canada has an opportunity to take a lead in calling for 
demilitarization of the island. As you know, Mr. Speaker, from 
your own very important work in conflict resolution, 
demilitarization is a fundamental first step in achieving conflict 
resolution in situations similar to this situation in Cyprus.
<P>
	In our own case we have played a dynamic and instrumental role 
in maintaining world peace through peacekeeping efforts, but in the 
case of Cyprus, Canadians peacekeepers were there for many 
decades and peace was not achieved. Therefore we took strong 
action through Mr. Clark who represented the secretary-general in 
trying to work out a solution. This  year was, in the words of the 
United States ``to be the year of Cyprus''. It seemed that 
resolutions have been found for other conflicts in that part of the 
world in Bosnia and Israel. Perhaps they are not moving in the 
direction we would like at this moment, but this was the year that 
Cyprus would be approached. Mr. Holbrooke was to be President 
Clinton's personal representative but, alas, that was not achieved.
<P>
<B>(1145)</B>
<P>
	Today we are facing a situation in which demilitarization of 
northern Cyprus is a serious problem and we do not have the 
resolution we had hoped for a few months ago.
<P>
	As the member for Saint-Denis pointed out, many other nations 
have adopted the same motion we are debating today. The United 
States, Australia, New Zealand, the European parliament and the 
Canadian government through the Commonwealth heads of 
government meeting have agreed to support the essence of this 
resolution. Given our nation's distinguished history in the area of 
peacekeeping, is it not a logical step to support the demilitarization 
of Cyprus?
<P>
	It is unfortunate and indeed tragic that we are debating this issue 
today because it does indicate a failure on the part of the world 
community and of the United Nations. Despite more than 20 years 
of commitments, security council resolutions, high level 
discussions, we are left without a solution. If we are to attribute the 
super politics of the cold war to these difficulties, what is the 
answer now? We must look at the intransigence of the Turkish 
Cypriot government and of Turkey, as the previous speaker 
indicated.
<P>
	As Canadians we are convinced that peaceful negotiations are 
the only solution. Since the failure of the 1993-1994 negotiating 
sessions we as Canadians have made repeated calls on both parties 
to redouble their efforts to resolve outstanding differences. Clearly 
there is no single solution to this complex issue. However, as the 
president of Cyprus pointed out in a letter to Boutros 
Boutros-Ghali, the secretary general of the UN, demilitarization is 
a major step in reducing the anxiety and mistrust on opposing 
sides. Without it a continued arms build-up is inevitable and the 
consequences can easily be predicted.
<P>
	Many people, Greeks and Turks alike, are excited at the prospect 
that for the first time there is a possibility of strong international 
support for bringing peace to this beautiful but dangerous island.
<P>
	What is important now is not finger pointing but rather 
conciliation, a desire for peace and a resolution of this conflict. As 
a nation Canada can help achieve this by supporting the motion and 
sending a clear message to those two choose the status quo that 
such intransigence will no longer be tolerated.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3900"> 3900 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am happy to rise 
in support of the motion by my colleague from Saint-Denis.
<P>
	I have a sense that I have been here before when I look at this 
resolution. I wrote on the Cypriot constitution of 1960, three 
decades ago, that it was an example of a perfect constitutional 
document conceived by the dry light of reason, but one had great 
doubts about its capacity to survive. Legalistic solutions are not 
viable in isolation from the society in respect to which they 
operate.
<P>
	I knew the German scholar who was largely responsible for the 
1960 constitution. The checks and balances were there, the perfect 
equilibrium of forces, but it did not work. I think it is an example of 
the optimism of the late 1950s and 1960s that solutions were 
possible by legal means without necessarily understanding the 
underlying social forces.
<P>
	There are reasons why the motion by the member for 
Saint-Denis is timely and helpful at this stage. It is true in relation 
to conflict resolution that when the parties are at each other's 
throats and the blood is there it is difficult to arrive at rational 
solutions. There is a moment, however, when exhaustion and 
attrition step in and it is almost a truism that it is the time in which 
to move. One would have thought that after 20 more years of 
conflict this would be a good time for third party initiatives, 
particularly one as determinedly neutral in its application as the 
suggestion for a United Nations demilitarization and the 
replacement of the armed forces of the warring parties by a UN 
force.
<P>
<B>(1150 )</B>
<P>
	UN peacekeeping is a Canadian development, a Canadian idea. 
Prime Minister Pearson suggested it first and he won his Nobel 
prize for basically suggesting that at the moment when the parties 
have everything to gain by solution it is right to offer a face saving 
device, interposing oneself as a neutral force between them.
<P>
	If we look at the possibilities for Cyprus, of the accession to the 
European Union, which is conditional upon the peaceful process 
being attained, this is good for Cyprus. It is good for the plural 
communities in Cyprus. Therefore it is right to bring our efforts to 
bear.
<P>
	There is a role for Canadians in this. One obviously is to offer 
our services as part of a United Nations force. The second, though, 
is to offer our experience in a country that is a plural society our 
solution in terms of constitution making. The thing that is very 
clear is neither the Westminster model, the British made in 
Westminster style federalism, which is too rigid in its a priori 
categories, nor the German model, the Bonn model of 1949, which 
was essentially used by German jurist Forsthoff as an inspiration 
for the 1960 constitution. Neither of these has the outlook toward  
pragmatic adjustments of conflict that our original Westminster 
model constitution of 1867 has developed through time.
<P>
	I can see a role for a Canadian parliamentary initiative with the 
support of our Minister of Foreign Affairs in which we could say 
federalism is more than rigid a priori forms. It is a process. It can 
be achieved in stages, step by step, étapisme in the conventional 
terminology. We are prepared to offer on an all-party basis the help 
of Canadian parliamentarians in setting together the basis for 
institutional co-operation between the different communities on a 
basis of respect for the rule of law and due process in dealings 
between citizens. This is an example of federalism as process, 
federalism in motion, to which our Canadian experience is 
peculiarly suited.
<P>
	I ask hon. members to express, as they have in this debate, their 
support for this excellent idea and its timing. It is right, the notion 
that a UN force should replace the warring parties armed forces, 
that we should offer help in federalizing the relations between the 
parties, not necessarily in terms of an ideal blueprint constitution 
they might find difficult to accept tomorrow but in terms of 
concrete steps through institutional co-operation in which we can 
provide our continuing effort and support.
<P>
	The very good thing in this debate is that the speakers from all 
three parties, all main parties, have spoken as one in looking for a 
peaceful solution and in an approach with a very constructive 
spirit. This is something that should encourage our foreign minister 
in offering Canadian good offices and providing the bridge to the 
types of arrangements that have been discussed widely in all parts 
of the House.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sharon Hayes (Port Moody-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened to some of the debate today. I am pleased to 
speak in support of this motion.
<P>
	I read it into the record again:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should support all 
measures leading to the demilitarization of the Republic of Cyprus in such a way 
as to enhance prospects for a peaceful and lasting resolution of the dispute 
regarding Cyprus that would benefit all the people of Cyprus and bring about an 
end to more than two decades of division on the island.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I have heard from people in my constituency of the situation on 
the island, of the heartbreak, of the conflict, of the number of years 
of difficulty in that region.
<P>
<B>(1155)</B>
<P>
	In the debate today we saw an example of the international 
community on two accounts, first the international community in 
the recommendations it put forward, security resolution 939, which 
actually recommended a resolution process to the problem on 
Cyprus. Unfortunately on the international scene we have also seen 
an example of international complacency on an issue that has gone 
on for 24 years on this island.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="3901"> 3901 </A></B>
<P>
	Today we are debating something that hopefully will be a move 
toward the solution in areas of security concerns of the people who 
live on that island along with their friends and relatives around 
the world, hopefully a solution that will be a lasting peaceful 
solution.
<P>
	There will be no simple solution, but perhaps to find the first 
step is what we are about today. That first step, the bridge to peace, 
may be and hopefully is the step of demilitarization on that island. 
Canada today has an opportunity to be part of that solution as it 
speaks up. As was just said, all three parties are in agreement for 
that.
<P>
	Our party certainly feels private members' motions need to be 
taken seriously. We commend the private member who brought this 
forward. However, we do not feel that one hour of debate is enough 
for an issue like this or for anything a private member has worked 
on.
<P>
	I ask for unanimous consent to make Motion No. 239 votable. It 
is an opportunity for all parties together to speak for peace in the 
world.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is there unanimous consent to make 
Motion No. 239 votable?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> There is not unanimous consent. The 
debate will end at 12.03 p.m. There being no further members 
wishing to speak, I will ask the hon. member who presented the 
motion to resume the debate.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Bakopanos:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank all members on behalf of 
Canadians, especially on behalf of Canadians of Cypriot origin, for 
having supported this motion. It has been unanimously supported 
by both sides of the House. The government is supporting the 
motion. The minister, through the parliamentary secretary today, 
said it would be moving on the motion and asking the international 
community to support the motion.
<P>
	Again, I thank all members for their support and for lending their 
voice to say enough is enough. Let this be the year for Cyprus, as an 
hon. member said. Let us work together to find a solution this year 
for the tragedy that has existed in this century.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The time provided for the consideration 
of Private Members' Business has now expired and the order is 
dropped from the Order Paper.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CRIMINALCODE">CRIMINAL CODE</A></H3>
	The House resumed from June 14, 1996 consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-45, an act to amend the Criminal Code (judicial 
review of parole ineligibility), be read the second time and referred 
to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
government bill proposes to amend a single section of the Code- 
section 745. This section has been in effect since 1976, but was not 
first applied until 1987.
<P>
	It allows a convicted murderer to present an application for 
parole after serving 15 years in prison. This recourse will be used 
increasingly as inmates likely to make use of it complete 15 years 
of their sentence.
<P>
<B>(1200)</B>
<P>
	At the moment, only 175 of the 2,085 persons convicted of 
murder have completed the 15 years of prison requisite to the 
presentation of the application. Of these, only 74 have actually 
exercised the right, and 63 have had a hearing before a jury. In 13 
cases, the jury rejected the application to reduce the number of 
years of imprisonment without eligibility for parole. In 50 cases, 
the jury reduced the number of years.
<P>
	What happens when the jury allows an application and reduces 
the number of years? The inmate may then apply to the National 
Parole Board, which will hold a hearing, hear witnesses, including 
the victim, and allow or deny parole. Of the 50 allowed to apply to 
the board, only 17 were granted full parole, six were denied parole 
altogether, eight were granted partial freedom and six are entitled 
to temporary absences.
<P>
	As we can see, section 745 simply gives inmates the opportunity 
to seek a jury's approval to apply for parole earlier than scheduled. 
The period is usually 25 years in the case of first degree murder and 
10 years in the case of second degree murder, which may be 
extended to 25 years by the trial judge on the recommendation of 
the jury.
<P>
	Section 745 of the Criminal Code is an exceptional measure. 
However, the National Parole Board has final say. Therefore, 
section 745 is not, as some would have us believe, a wide open 
back door out. It is a glimmer of hope for those who redeem 
themselves. This measure is an incentive to inmates to behave 
responsibly during their incarceration.
<P>
	In the opinion of the associate chief justice of the Ontario 
Supreme Court, this review process establishes a happy medium 
between the need to show clemency with respect to an offender 
whose conduct while serving his sentence is good, which may be 
conducive to rehabilitation, and the interests of the community, 
which demands that the act that led to the inmate's incarceration be 
condemned.
<P>
	It is the only provision of the Criminal Code that gives citizens 
responsibility for a decision as to the just and equitable nature of a 
sentence. The Criminal Code as it now stands therefore provides 
for a judicial review mechanism that seems appropriate.
<P>
	In 1994, the Liberal member for York South-Weston presented 
a bill aimed purely and simply at repealing this  section. We in the 
Bloc Quebecois argued to keep section 745, but his bill was passed 
anyway at second reading by a vote of 136 to 103. However, the 
session ended before it went to third reading. On March 12, 1996, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3902"> 3902 </A></B>
<P>
the same bill was reintroduced in the House and is now before the 
justice committee.
<P>
	Today the Minister of Justice is at it again with a proposal to 
keep this review procedure, but with a few changes. We are in 
favour of the proposed amendments because they maintain this 
recourse, with the addition of a few justifiable changes. It must be 
remembered that this section has not been amended at all since it 
was first introduced, in 1976.
<P>
	First of all, the Minister of Justice is proposing that this recourse 
be dropped in the case of those found guilty of more than one 
murder. We support this measure, which creates a difference in 
treatment between someone who has killed one person and a serial 
killer. This is obviously entirely logical, at least in our view. 
Section 745 is intended as an exceptional measure, and it is 
understandable that a serial killer would be excluded from its 
application, as would anyone still posing a threat to society.
<P>
	This amendment will make it possible in future to exclude the 
Fabrikants, Olsons and Bernardos. They will have to serve the 
sentence handed down by the court before being able to apply for 
parole. Furthermore, it is very difficult to see how a repeat offender 
or a serial killer could be successful in a request for judicial review.
<P>
<B>(1205)</B>
<P>
	It is appropriate to amend section 745 in this regard. This 
amendment will make it possible, and rightly so, to exclude from 
the application process those with very few chances of being 
paroled in any case. This measure will increase public safety and 
sends the message that murder is unacceptable.
<P>
	The purpose of the second proposed amendment is to require that 
decisions of juries to reduce parole ineligibility periods be 
unanimous. At the present time, the application must be approved 
by two thirds of the jury. This will increase public safety and 
reduce the number of approved applications.
<P>
	If there is unanimous agreement to reduce this period, a two 
thirds majority is enough to substitute a lesser number of years or 
to immediately terminate the ineligibility for parole. The two thirds 
rule is maintained when it comes to setting the number of years by 
which the ineligibility period is being reduced, which strikes a 
certain balance.
<P>
	We support this measure because section 745 is an exceptional 
provision. The unanimity requirement highlights the fact that it is 
exceptional. Furthermore, should the application be turned down, 
the jury may, by a two thirds majority, set the time at or after which 
another application may be made by the applicant.
<P>
	This bill requires that the jury be unanimous, but still allows the 
inmate to make another application after two years. Again, a 
certain balance is struck between protecting society and 
recognizing the inmate's efforts.
<P>
	Finally, the last proposed amendment is that any review 
application be subject to judicial screening. This provision is 
obviously aimed at eliminating unfounded applications that have 
no reasonable chance of being approved. To do so, the judge 
reviews the application, the report from Correctional Services, and 
any other document submitted by the attorney general or the 
applicant.
<P>
	The judge makes a decision based on the applicant's character 
and behaviour and the nature of the offence of which he was 
convicted. Although this additional step may initially appear to 
make the procedure more cumbersome, its purpose is obviously to 
avoid having to train a jury and to communicate with the victim to 
ask for information.
<P>
	Should the judge decide that the applicant has shown there is a 
real possibility the application will be approved, the chief justice 
designates a judge of the superior court of criminal jurisdiction to 
empanel a jury to hear the application.
<P>
	If the judge rules that the applicant has not shown there is a real 
possibility the application will be approved, he can set the period at 
or after which another application may again be made or decide 
that no new application may be made. The applicant or the attorney 
general may appeal to the appeal court any ruling made by the 
judge.
<P>
	These three amendments will reduce the number of applications. 
With the exclusion of multiple murderers and the introduction of 
judicial screening, it is likely that only serious applications will be 
referred to a jury. And, by requiring that applications be approved 
by the whole jury, we can expect a more thoughtful decision. It will 
be up to the National Parole Board to make the ultimate decision.
<P>
	In short, this bill gets our support because it maintains an 
appropriate recourse while trying to prevent any possible cases of 
abuse. In our view, however, there was no reason to disrupt House 
procedure to rush this bill through. This is pure improvisation. I 
must also tell you in closing that, as an exception, the justice 
committee will be sitting this evening to hear the justice minister, 
senior justice officials and another witness. The committee will 
also have to resume its hearings tomorrow, going into overdrive 
because time is running out.
<P>
<B>(1210)</B>
<P>
	I must say these hearings look like a travesty, the whole idea 
being to pass Bill C-45 as quickly as possible. Let us say it is really 
not standard procedure. That is the most appropriate term I can use 
in this place.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3903"> 3903 </A></B>
<P>
	To say it as it is, the Minister of Justice left it to the last minute. 
We could certainly have started discussing this bill a few months 
back. The Standing Committee on Justice could have summoned 
witnesses. But no, instead the Minister of Justice chose to wait 
till the very last minute and to improvise.
<P>
	Why? Could it be that he wanted to boost his image, an image 
recently tarnished by certain matters currently before the courts, in 
short, the Airbus affair? Perhaps. At any rate, we will let the public 
be the judge of that. I just wanted to point out that this is not 
standard practice. As far as I am concerned, a travesty of hearings 
is not standard practice for a Minister of Justice.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, to set 
the record straight, the Reform members who will be speaking to 
this bill will not be splitting their time henceforth.
<P>
	I am pleased to rise today to speak on Bill C-45, the legislation 
which was introduced by the Minister of Justice. The effect of the 
legislation will modify and not repeal section 745 of the Criminal 
Code of Canada.
<P>
	At the outset, it is important to inform the House that I will not 
and cannot support the legislation. I can also say that my Reform 
colleagues, unless instructed otherwise by their constituents, will 
not be supporting the bill.
<P>
	We Reformers were given clear instructions by our membership 
in Vancouver last weekend at our national policy assembly. 
Delegates to the assembly put forward a policy resolution to repeal 
section 745 of the Criminal Code. The policy resolution to abolish 
and not modify section 745 of the Criminal Code carried the 
greatest support of any resolution passed. It was supported by 98.8 
per cent of the Reform delegates. The resolution has now been 
adopted as official Reform Party policy.
<P>
	Reformers at the Vancouver assembly were unified in the vote to 
repeal section 745 because we recognize, as do most Canadians, 
that section 745 is a symbol of all that is wrong with the criminal 
justice system in Canada. Section 745, a provision which allows 
killers the right to apply for early parole after serving only 15 years 
of a life sentence, symbolizes the decay of the criminal justice 
system in Canada. Consequently, the majority of Canadians have 
come to view the criminal justice system as one where justice is 
granted to the criminal element of our society and contempt is 
shown to victims. This is a sad reality.
<P>
	Reflecting on the last couple of years, I note that since 1993 the 
Reform Party has been asking the minister to repeal section 745. A 
former member of the government, the member for York 
South-Weston, introduced a private member's bill, Bill C-226 on 
March 17, 1994, which was reintroduced as Bill C-234.
<P>
	The House of Commons voted at second reading to refer Bill 
C-226 to the standing committee. At that time 74 Liberals, 
including the transport minister, voted against the justice minister 
and supported the repeal of section 745. It is not just on this side of 
the House; those members who are reflecting the viewpoint of their 
constituents on the government side of the House want to see this 
section repealed.
<P>
	Bill C-226 was buried in committee. Bill C-234 has not yet been 
dealt with despite a memo by one government member on the 
justice committee asking the committee to make this private 
member's bill a priority. No such effort is about to happen. It is not 
going to be a priority on the government side.
<P>
<B>(1215)</B>
<P>
	The justice minister has had the opportunity to abolish section 
745 and has had almost three years to do so. That does not count the 
eight or nine years the Liberals sat in opposition. They clearly 
heard the views of constituents and of their members at that time. 
They have no excuse. Such action would be an important first step 
in restoring in the eyes of Canadians credibility to the criminal 
justice system. Obviously the justice minister does not have the 
strength of character to take substantive action. He can be assured 
that Canadians will remember this on election day.
<P>
	The justice minister claims that the prospective legislation 
before this House will decrease the opportunity for killers to seek 
early release and parole. Let us examine this claim.
<P>
	The truth about Bill C-45 is that if adopted by Parliament the 
proposed amendment to section 745 would effectively categorize 
murderers as good killers or bad killers. The effect of Bill C-45 is 
to say to Canadians that killers who murder just one victim are 
okay and are therefore entitled to another chance for freedom, 
whereas killers who murder two or three times or more are bad and 
should be punished differently.
<P>
	When I think about this piece of legislation I turn to the province 
of Quebec and reflect on what happened at École polytechnique. 
How would mass murderer Marc Lépine be categorized by taking 
that many lives? Should we not have anther section for him? 
Should we not say that after five murders they are even worse than 
bad or after 10 they are on another list downward? It is unsettling to 
think of taking one life or 10 lives. One is too many and they should 
all be categorized the same.
<P>
	I hear a different perspective from Canadians. My Reform 
justice colleagues and I have travelled the country speaking to rank 
and file citizens. What we hear from Canadians is a unified 
message that a killer who commits first degree premeditated 
murder ought not ever to have the opportunity for early release. 
Canadians tell us that at the very least, life should mean life. This is 
obviously a sentiment to which the justice minister is either 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3904"> 3904 </A></B>
<P>
unaware, or more likely a sentiment which the justice minister has 
a vested interest in not being aware of.
<P>
	Many polls and studies have been done across this country over 
time. The majority of Canadians, by far 75 per cent, would like to 
see the death penalty back. This government has a difficult time 
just dealing with early release of first degree murderers let alone 
ever introducing legislation that would execute a murderer. I find 
that unacceptable. If Canadians want to see the death penalty 
reinstated in this country, then they should have the right to voice it 
loud and clear and their government should follow through with 
legislation.
<P>
	The fact that there no longer exists truth in sentencing for killers 
has outraged Canadians. Consequently a particular feeling is 
finding its way into discussions in coffee shops and at dinner 
tables. The feeling is that the return of capital punishment is 
desirable and necessary in the case of first degree premeditated 
murder and it should be swift.
<P>
	The Reform Party has pledged to allow Canadians to express 
their democratic will in a binding national referendum on the issue 
of capital punishment. We believe that Canadians should have the 
final say as to whether villains like Clifford Olson and Paul 
Bernardo deserve to live comfortable lives in prison receiving the 
amenities of colour TV, free education, three square meals a day 
and much more.
<P>
<B>(1220 )</B>
<P>
	When I think about it, our prison system is absolutely disastrous. 
To cater in any way other than providing the bare necessities for 
existence to any of these low life individuals who have taken 
someone's life is reprehensible. Yet this minister and the solicitor 
general along with their friends support it.
<P>
	Canadians know the justice minister's perspective regarding 
capital punishment. Indeed, the changes proposed to section 745 
are a testimony to his belief that even 25 years behind bars for child 
killer Clifford Olson is much too severe a sentence. I have heard 
the minister say often in the House that to even send anyone to jail 
is a waste of a life. That is shared by his colleague who also 
introduced this bill some years back. I do not believe that is 
acceptable to most Canadians.
<P>
	We know this is the true feeling of the justice minister because 
nothing contained in the legislation he proposes in Bill C-45 will 
stop Olson from applying for early release under section 745 in 
August, two months from now. I will return to this subject in a 
moment.
<P>
	I have served in Parliament for more than two and one-half years 
now and I have observed how the justice minister conducts 
business. It is obvious that instead of listening to victims groups, 
rank and file Canadians, police officers or prison guards, the justice 
minister bends his ear to special interests, legal aid defence  
lawyers and other left wing, soft on crime special interest lobbies. 
That is probably not a complete list when it comes to special 
interests. Victims groups in this country are growing and those 
groups that support them are growing.
<P>
	I had an opportunity to listen to Mrs. Debbie Mahaffy in 
Hamilton on Friday. She will not give up the fight to see justice 
done after her experience with the death of her daughter. I intend to 
support her whenever and wherever I possibly can, as I know my 
colleague from Crowfoot will. Mrs. Mahaffy has a message to 
deliver which is worthwhile for all Canadians to hear and pay 
attention to. I am going to support her and I trust my colleagues in 
the House will also.
<P>
	It is obvious that the justice minister has attempted to mislead 
Canadians into believing that his government has the broad support 
of victims with respect to Bill C-45. That is absolute nonsense. The 
opposite is true.
<P>
	On Friday I participated in the Hamilton East rally, the riding 
vacated by the disgraced Sheila Copps. Mrs. Mahaffy spoke of her 
daughter Leslie who was brutally raped, tortured and murdered by 
Paul Bernardo. She told those in attendance that the justice minister 
had telephoned her shortly before announcing the changes to Bill 
C-45. Mrs. Mahaffy's response was to ask the justice minister how 
he could sleep at night knowing that his proposal in C-45 would do 
nothing to stop Clifford Olson and most other killers from applying 
for early release under section 745. She wondered, as do most 
Canadians, on what grounds the justice minister would argue that 
most first degree murderers deserve to walk our streets again as 
free men or women.
<P>
	Many of my colleagues have spoken to the technical failures of 
Bill C-45. I too would like to speak at great length to the failures of 
the bill. However, due to the time for debate on this issue, I would 
like to explore another line of argument. I will share with the House 
two personal examples which illustrate why section 745 of the 
Criminal Code must be abolished and not modified, and 
consequently, why Bill C-45 is a half measure.
<P>
<B>(1225 )</B>
<P>
	Prior to the election in 1993, I served for 22 years as a police 
officer. I was on duty on May 24, 1977 when my colleague, 
Constable William Shelever, was shot in the back of the head. His 
assailant, Roy Glaremin, also shot and injured another constable 
that night. Glaremin applied for judicial review under section 745 
in 1993. He has initiated proceedings for another review later this 
year. Lawyers tell me that he will likely be successful this time 
around. Nothing contained in the proposals brought forward by the 
justice minister will stop Glaremin from seeking early release.
<P>
	The bare truth about section 745 of the Criminal Code is that 
nearly 50 of the last 60 murderers who have applied for early parole 
hearings using section 745 have had their eligibility period 
reduced. That is an 80 per cent rate of parole success for killers 
seeking release under section 745. At least 18 of these murderers 
have had their parole eligibility reduced from 25 to 15 years. Most 
of these killers were imprisoned as first time murderers and 
therefore are all eligible for early release under section 745. 
Nothing contained in Bill C-45 will change this reality.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3905"> 3905 </A></B>
<P>
	I would also note, on the point of application, that a first degree 
murderer will not apply directly to a jury but now has another 
hurdle to jump. Application has to be made to a superior court 
judge, but at what cost? Bill C-45 contains a royal 
recommendation, a nice sounding term which means additional 
money will be expended. The appeal rights of section 745 
applicants have been expanded through this bill. The applicant can 
appeal to a court of appeal on any determination or decision made 
by the superior court judge. Applicants have a right to apply for a 
judicial review more than once. It has created another level of 
bureaucracy within the judiciary, within this hearing process.
<P>
	I sat as immigration critic for several months. It became obvious 
that the layers and layers of appeals were benefiting only one 
group. No insult to yourself, Mr. Speaker, or any other lawyer in 
this country, but it only fed that particular group, the most 
sophisticated of all lobbyists. Who has the ear of the justice 
minister? Who has the ear of the immigration minister? Who has 
the ear of the solicitor general? It is not the people of this country, 
Canada. That has to change but it will not change under this 
government. It is expanding that type of process, the judicial role 
of the courts, in the whole justice industry. It will get more 
burdensome as time goes on.
<P>
	To claim that the justice minister's tinkering with section 745 
will toughen up parole standards is false. It has been engineered to 
mislead Canadians into believing that real action has been taken to 
keep murderers in jail. The truth is that the justice minister has no 
intention of getting tough with criminals. His section 745 proposal 
is evidence of that fact.
<P>
	I want to state for the record that the Reform Party will accept 
nothing less than the full repeal of section 745 of the Criminal 
Code. The proposals put forward by this Liberal government do not 
properly address the concerns of the majority of Canadians. 
Anything less than a true life sentence is completely unacceptable 
where the killer has committed premeditated first degree murder.
<P>
	Section 745 is anything but a faint hope clause. Rather, it is the 
sure bet clause or the sure bet law for killers. It must be repealed 
and scrapped, not modified and not tinkered with. We will accept 
nothing less.
<P>
<B>(1230 )</B>
<P>
	Another reason that illustrates why section 745 must be repealed 
is the case of Clifford Olson. Last April this  serial child killer sent 
me a sneering personal note in which he boasted about his prospect 
for early parole under section 745. In his letter Olson wrote: ``I'm 
getting out, Art. Quick, get section 745 repealed. Smile, sucker''. 
The note was signed in type: ``Yours truly, Clifford Olson, the beast 
of British Columbia''.
<P>
	Later this fall, Clifford Olson will have served 15 years of his 
multiple life sentences for mass murder and rape, sentences which 
are being served concurrently. He will make his application for 
early release under section 745 on August 12.
<P>
	The case of Clifford Olson clearly illustrates that anything less 
than a true life sentence for killers, whether they are one-time 
murderers or multiple murderers, is completely unacceptable. Life 
should mean life.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I appreciated hearing the member for Calgary 
Northeast discuss Bill C-45. He spent considerable time talking 
about repeal of section 745 of the Criminal Code.
<P>
	He also mentioned a meeting in Hamilton where people had 
gathered to discuss crime. I sense, as does he, that a lot of 
Canadians are not happy with the slowness of the current 
government to reform the criminal justice system.
<P>
	It must be confusing for Canadians. Does the member think 
Canadians understand the funny signals they are actually getting 
from this House? When we voted on a private member's bill to 
repeal that part of the Criminal Code several Liberal members 
voted in favour of it. That legislation was moving along very 
quickly.
<P>
	Suddenly we have another piece of legislation, also from the 
government side, this time from the minister, which would not 
repeal that section of the Criminal Code, but would categorize 
murderers into multiple murderers versus single murderers. It 
almost says that some types of murder are not as reprehensible as 
other types of murder.
<P>
	I know the hon. member is out talking to the public about justice 
issues. What kind of signals are Canadians getting? Do they 
understand what is happening here in the House? Are they 
confused? What are they saying about the legislation brought down 
by the justice minister versus the private member's bill from the 
government side which actually calls for the repeal of that section 
of the Criminal Code?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hanger:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his question.
<P>
	The debate around section 745 has been intense for the last two 
to three years, and definitely the last two years, since the member 
for York South-Weston introduced his private member's bill to 
repeal that section. That is the view which most people have. They 
would like to see section 745 gone.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3906"> 3906 </A></B>
<P>
	Even beyond that, I will refer again to the studies and polls that 
have been taken for several years. People in this country would like 
to see the reinstatement of the death penalty for first degree, 
premeditated murder. That is the feeling I am picking up, not only 
in Hamilton, definitely in Toronto and in most large centres across 
the country. Everywhere people want to see some teeth and 
punishment put back into the system, and it is not happening.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to ask the hon. member who just spoke if he could 
explain the reason why the members of the Reform Party will vote 
against the amendments put forward by the Minister of 
Justice-that is what we are led to believe, given that they are in 
favour of repealing all section 745-while at the same time 
wanting this House to pass this bill as quickly as possible.
<P>
	I would like to know what the reasoning is behind the Reformers 
opposing the bill, when at the same time being prepared to help the 
Minister of Justice ram this bill through.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hanger:</B> Mr. Speaker, it would absolutely be beneficial to 
have more opportunity to debate the bill.
<P>
	Let us turn it around and put the blame on the shoulders of the 
people who should have the blame placed on them. That is 
government ministers introducing legislation 10 days before the 
House rises for the summer. They are the ones who are responsible 
for cutting short this debate. The minister, the solicitor general and 
the Prime Minister know full well that no time was offered to have 
a proper debate on this bill. They have rammed it through. They 
have forced an inflexible situation.
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	I know the member is in favour of this bill. Be that as it may, she 
may not be reflecting the viewpoint of her constituents. I do not 
know. The majority of people to whom I talk want to see this bill 
scrapped. That is why we are voting against it as a party.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, for 
those who are watching on C-span and the parliamentary channel I 
would like to outline briefly what we are debating. This is a debate 
on Bill C-45. Bill C-45 has been brought into place to make some 
changes to section 745 of the Criminal Code which allows for early 
parole for convicted murderers under certain circumstances.
<P>
	In 1976, about 20 years ago, Parliament abolished capital 
punishment. When it did so it also said that there would be no 
eligibility for parole for 25 years for individuals who were 
convicted of first degree murder and 10 years for second degree 
murder. This change in  how murderers were treated in 1976 is 
background to our debate today on Bill C-45.
<P>
	Under section 745 of the Criminal Code, which was also brought 
in in 1976, in addition to first degree murderers not being eligible 
for parole for 25 years of a life sentence there were certain 
provisions brought in which would allow a convicted murderer to 
apply for early parole. The application would be heard by a 
12-member jury from the community and this jury would look at 
things like hope for rehabilitation, protection of prison guards and 
the public interest in order to decide whether a convicted killer 
should be eligible to apply to be let out early from a life sentence or 
25-year sentence.
<P>
	Bill C-45 is a change to this process whereby convicted 
murderers can apply for early release from their sentences. This 
amendment is designed, according to the justice minister, to focus 
the operation of section 745 more narrowly. In other words, it 
would apply less broadly and to less convicted offenders and also, 
according to the justice minister, it would apply in ``only the most 
deserving of cases''. The justice minister so far has not explained 
what he means by a deserving murderer but perhaps the public can 
get him to do that at some point.
<P>
	Bill C-45 does three things. First, no longer will convicted 
murderers have an automatic right to apply for early parole under 
section 745. A first degree murderer will only be able to apply if he 
or she has committed only one murder. If he or she has committed 
multiple murders then application would first have to be made to a 
superior court judge. That judge would have to decide if there is a 
``reasonable chance'' of success for the application for early 
release before the application could be heard by the 12-member 
jury that I mentioned before.
<P>
	The second change is that the 12-member jury, in order to 
approve an early release, would have to reach a unanimous 
decision instead of only two-thirds, as is now the case. That makes 
it more difficult, it is a little higher bar for the offender to jump 
over.
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	Third, after Bill C-45 comes into effect, multiple murderers 
would not have a right to apply under section 745 for early release. 
In other words, they would serve their full sentence of 25 years. 
Those are the three changes proposed in Bill C-45.
<P>
	I would like to like to spend the bulk of my time talking about 
what Bill C-45 does not do. I have talked about its history a little. I 
have talked about the three things it does, but there are seven things 
it does not do. I believe these seven things are very important to 
Canadians.
<P>
	The first thing Bill C-45 does not do is respond to a clear demand 
of two things from Canadians. The first is a much tougher response 
to people who violate the rights of others, particularly to the extent 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3907"> 3907 </A></B>
<P>
of committing  premeditated murder, cold bloodedly, with malice 
aforethought: the deliberately planned extinction of an innocent 
person's life.
<P>
	Canadians are fed up with the weak-kneed approach to this kind 
of incredible violation of the rights of law-abiding citizens. In my 
home town of Calgary, 35,000 readers of the Calgary <I>Sun</I> clipped a 
coupon, signed it, demanding the repeal of section 745 of the 
Criminal Code, and mailed it in. That is 35,000 people in one city 
who responded to one opportunity to voice outrage and demand for 
change.
<P>
	At our Reform Party assembly two weekends ago, members 
voted 98 per cent for the repeal of section 745. Even in this House, 
as other speakers have mentioned, many members voted for the 
repeal of section 745. Therefore, Bill C-45 has ignored the multiple 
and clear direction of the citizens of this country.
<P>
	Justice is really the reflection of society's response to the 
violation of the rights of other people. Society is demanding a 
response that its justice minister, its elected government, is 
ignoring and flouting in this legislation.
<P>
	The second thing this bill does not do is demonstrate society's 
repugnance and repudiation of murder. As most know, polls and 
surveys of Canadians have clearly and consistently shown that 
there is a feeling in society that when one of its members violates 
the ethics of society to the extent of deliberately taking an innocent 
life, the offender's life should be forfeited.
<P>
	They are asking for the return of capital punishment yet we have 
not been able to have a debate on that important issue, although 
there are strong feelings and arguments on both sides. It is 
something Canadians are demanding in order to show their outrage 
against this kind of activity, and it is something they have not been 
given.
<P>
	Society has also been awakened to the fact that since 1976 and 
since these applications for early release have been put into place, a 
life sentence does not mean a life sentence at all. Life does not 
mean life. Life means, at best, 25 years no matter how vicious, cold 
blooded and repugnant the crime might have been.
<P>
	Sometimes it means only 15 years. Of the murderers who apply 
for early release under this provision, 80 per cent are given a 
reduced sentence. What we are saying, in that kind of response, is 
that society views murder as an innocent life being worth 15 to 25 
years maximum of a murderer's life. That does not demonstrate the 
kind of repugnance that many Canadians are telling me about. They 
want that message to be sent.
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
	The third thing the bill does not do is ensure truth in sentencing. 
Paul Bernardo, for example, was given a life sentence with no 
possibility of parole for 25 years, except that there is a possibility 
of parole. It is not a life  sentence, it is a maximum of 25 years. He 
can apply to have that sentence shortened. There is no truth in 
sentencing.
<P>
	Families, friends and supporters of the victims said at least the 
guy was put away. He will never walk the streets again. His 
freedom and his ability to be accepted by society have been totally 
cut off. They have woken up to realize that is not true. There is no 
truth in sentencing. Life does not mean life. Twenty-five years does 
not mean 25 years.
<P>
	The fourth thing the legislation does not do is hold murderers 
responsible for their murders. It suggests some murderers are less 
responsible than others. It says that if there has been one murder 
committed the murderer will receive some consideration. Only if 
there are multiple cold blooded murders will the consideration be 
reduced. There is no justification. There is outrage that this could 
even be contemplated.
<P>
	If Clifford Olson had killed only one young child from his 
community, according to this legislation he would be deserving of 
consideration. However, because he killed more than once, his 
privileges and the consideration he will be given will be reduced. If 
Paul Bernardo had tortured, confined and killed only one young 
woman he would be thought to be more deserving.
<P>
	What does this say about our society? A murder is a murder. A 
life is valuable. The value is not predicated on the quantity. It is the 
quality of one life we should be protecting.
<P>
	Fifth, the legislation will still allow people such as Clifford 
Olson and Paul Bernardo to apply to a superior court judge to have 
their sentences reduced. These are individuals who have totally 
outraged any laws of society. They have violated the very basis on 
which we have government. Government is for the protection of 
the life and property of citizens. Here are two individuals who have 
totally violated the entire basis on which we organize ourselves as a 
society and yet they will still have the right to make their pitch to 
have their penalty reduced. They will be able to argue before a 
superior court judge.
<P>
	There are two points to be noted. The superior court judge, in 
order to allow the application to proceed, must be satisfied that 
there is a reasonable prospect of success. What does this reasonable 
prospect of success mean in practice? It has not been defined. What 
criteria will the judge use? There are no guidelines. Does this mean 
the judge must examine the convicted killer's actions or attitudes in 
prison? Does the judge look at the killer's childhood or schooling? 
What role does the victim's family play in all of this, because these 
considerations are to be made on written criteria? Do the victim's 
family and friends count at all? Will they be heard? This legislation 
provides no answers to these questions.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3908"> 3908 </A></B>
<P>
	Not only that, when the superior court judge makes his or her 
finding of a reasonable chance of success, if that finding goes 
against the convicted killer it can be appealed. There will be extra 
money allocated to cover the cost of the appeal. Once again we 
have a more convoluted process. More layers of judicial process 
will be put into place. This is for the protection and the 
consideration of people who have already been found to be cold 
blooded killers of innocent people. Shame on us for allowing that 
kind of thing in the House and for going along with it when there 
is a decisive, clear step supported in the House which could have 
put an end to this nonsense once and for all.
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	Sixth, Bill C-45 has been introduced in such a way that it does 
not allow for proper debate and examination of this measure and 
the consideration surrounding it. The bill was introduced just last 
week. The House is slated to adjourn this week. In that short space 
of time the House must debate it at second reading, examine it in 
committee, complete with witnesses, propose amendments and 
improvements to the bill in committee and come back to the House 
for final reading and debate and passage.
<P>
	At the same time we have other pieces of legislation that need to 
be cleared from the table during this session. Is the government 
taking its responsibilities to Canadian citizens seriously when 
legislation which is so fundamental to the interests of Canadians is 
brought in at the 11th hour with other important legislation on the 
table? Clearly the process is not able to deal with it adequately, 
have it examined by experts, commentators, the pros and cons 
thoroughly looked at, letting the public know why it was brought in 
instead of the total repeal of section 745. No, it is done almost off 
the cuff. That is no way for a responsible government to deal with 
substantive legislation in Parliament.
<P>
	Finally, the bill does not satisfy the demands of justice on behalf 
of victims. There are people who have lost loved ones, sons, 
daughters, husbands and wives, brothers and sisters, in the most 
inhumane and horrible ways. The least these people expect from 
their government, their justice system and from society which is to 
protect them is justice, something they can point to and say this 
terrible thing was done but it was met with a just response.
<P>
	Instead we have a bill before us which states if you kill only one 
person deliberately, you are entitled to quite a bit of consideration 
and will probably only spend 15 years in jail.
<P>
	I was at a candlelight vigil a couple of weeks ago in Calgary for 
families of victims of violence. Many had loved ones who had been 
murdered, including Darlene Boyd whose daughter was murdered, 
and Bev Smith and others. I saw the pain, anguish and turmoil of 
these people whose loved ones had been deliberately and  brutally 
taken away from them. I saw their anger and frustration with the 
justice system and the weak response this terrible act has called 
forth. It made me understand a little better why we in the House 
need to be much more serious in our response and treatment of the 
people who would violate the rights of law-abiding citizens.
<P>
	It is our view that the law must be seen to be working for all 
Canadians, including the victims of crime and their families. There 
is simply no reason to maintain early release for the criminal, 
because there is no release for the survivors of these victims.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we have heard Liberal members say life is life and that all 
we are discussing here is where the life sentence shall be served, 
whether it is in custody or in the community under parole 
supervision. Certainly if someone has been released on parole they 
will still serve their life sentence. They will be on parole for the 
balance of their life.
<P>
	As a former parole officer I can talk about the limits and the 
difficulties of trying to enforce a useful parole supervision, 
especially on particularly manipulative offenders. People must 
understand what parole supervision is. The average parole 
interview is a half-hour interview in an office every month.
<P>
<B>(1255 )</B>
<P>
	If we are to look at intensive supervision, perhaps a half-hour to 
an hour interview once a week in a community office with the odd 
check-up on someone's place of residence or where they are 
employed, and when we are talking about sophisticated serial 
killers out on parole, people have to understand what community 
supervision means. It means checking up to ensure the person is 
also going to their drug and alcohol program or seeing their 
psychologist.
<P>
	However, it is of great concern that those who get out on parole 
have very intensive supervision and that they will serve their life 
sentence on parole. The public has to understand the nature of that 
supervision.
<P>
	This bill proposes that the initial merits of the application to 
change the parole eligibility date from 25 years down to something 
lower will go before a judge. The judge will have to rule and give 
reasons for judgment. Does that mean now, because we are in a 
court process, the rule of law applies because it certainly brings in 
the element of appeal? One side or the other can appeal and if there 
are errors in law, we all know how lawyers can split hairs on those 
issues. They can always find some error in a law that makes it 
perhaps an avenue for appeal. Will we have nearly every one of 
these being appealed all the way to the Supreme Court of Canada? 
Of course in those kinds of situations would not the taxpayer be 
paying for all the court costs of the offenders?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3909"> 3909 </A></B>
<P>
	This whole element of appeal is undefined, as far as I am 
concerned, and I want to know if the member has any further 
explanation as to the possibility of that.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ablonczy:</B> Mr. Speaker, Bill C-45 contains what is called a 
royal recommendation, an allocation of additional moneys toward 
the implementation of the measures in the bill. The money will be 
used to fund applications for appeal from the superior court judge 
who in the first instance may have turned down the original 
application. This can be appealed to a ruling by a higher court, and 
those appeals have to be funded.
<P>
	The costs and the process will be expanded under this provision. 
It is difficult at this point to say how it will work in practice 
because it is a matter of legislation at the present time. However, 
these things do have a habit of having consequences that were 
probably not intended, to be fair to the legislators, and certainly 
that sometimes cannot be foreseen. The consequences definitely do 
cause expanded costs and expanded court time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Glen McKinnon (Brandon-Souris, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
know the proposals being put forward by hon. members opposite 
are in the interest of the national good or in their view of the 
national good.
<P>
	My concern is whether there are any data available on extent that 
section 745 is actually used on an incidental basis. How many 
times it has been used, how many people have had their sentences 
shortened and, if so, what has been the outcome of that shortened 
sentenced?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ablonczy:</B> Mr. Speaker, there are data on the use of section 
745. I mentioned in my speech that 80 per cent of individuals who 
apply under section 745 for a review of their sentence have been 
granted some reduction in their sentence.
<P>
	The question we have to ask ourselves as legislators is that in the 
cases where someone has deliberately taken the life of an innocent, 
law-abiding citizen, is it right, is it something we should 
countenance and is it something we should allow and promote to 
give these people an opportunity to have the penalty they have been 
given for that kind of action reduced and have all of the 
mechanisms in place to allow that. That is really the question 
before us. I think the Canadian public says no. Many of our 
members say no. The government is saying yes and that is what we 
are objecting to.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to address Bill C-45 introduced by the 
Minister of Justice on June 11. I have been looking forward to 
speaking on this bill.
<P>
	Bill C-45 is of grave concern to all Canadians and to members of 
Parliament, considering we dealt with scrapping section 745 in the 
private member's bill by the hon. member for York 
South-Weston. The bill passed through second reading and spent 
about 17 months in  committee. We were wondering why the 
Liberals did not bring that back.
<P>
	The amazing thing about Bill C-45 is the sheer audacity of the 
Minister of Justice to think that he can sucker the Canadian people 
into thinking he and his government are actually doing something 
about section 745 of the Criminal Code. There is nothing 
happening and this bill was redundant even before it came before 
the House.
<P>
	The bill would amend section 745 of the Criminal Code, the 
so-called faint hope clause. The only faint hope is that the Minister 
of Justice and the Liberals will ever deal with the criminal justice 
system, sentencing and parole in the way Canadians want. That is 
the faint hope. The real hope is that one day the Reform Party will 
replace the members over there and we will get some real changes 
to the Criminal Code. That is the real hope.
<P>
	Section 745 as it now stands permits lifers after serving 15 years 
to have their parole ineligibility reviewed. These are people who 
have been convicted of the heinous crime of first degree murder, 
people who have savagely taken another human being's life, people 
who without hesitation and with premeditation have wiped out a 
human life. This section deals with lifers, those convicted to life. 
Life of course to the Liberals means 25 years. I think Canadians 
believe life should mean life. In other words, if you take a human 
life in a savage crime you should spend the rest of your life behind 
bars, get out of society because you do not belong there.
<P>
	Section 745 gives an opportunity to those currently convicted of 
first degree murder to have their parole ineligibility period reduced 
after serving 15 years. In other words, they can apply for parole 
after 15 years if they have received a life in prison sentence for a 
savage crime like murder.
<P>
	There is no question that something had to be done about this 
section of the code. Like many other justice reforms that have been 
undertaken by the Minister of Justice and this Liberal government, 
this bill does not bring about the change in any way, shape or form 
that Canadians have been asking for. It just does not do the job.
<P>
	We have seen it time after time from this minister and the 
Liberal Party where they tinker with sections of the criminal justice 
system but nothing really ever gets done. They try to fool people in 
the same way they are trying to fool Canadians with regard to Bill 
C-45. This is a redundant piece of legislation before it even begins 
and I will address that a little further in my presentation.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice and the Liberal government continue to 
ignore the cries, the demands, the pleas from the Canadian people 
to get tough on people, in particular, savage murderers. Get tough 
on the criminals through the justice system, through the Criminal 
Code.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3910"> 3910 </A></B>
<P>
	The majority of Canadians want section 745 repealed. I really 
believe that. The majority of Canadians also believe that life 
should mean life. It is only soft-headed Liberals that can interpret 
life as 25 years or 15 years or maybe even 10 years. Where does 
it end? While Canadians believe life should mean life, and while 
Canadians believe that savage murderers should be treated 
appropriately in sentencing, the minister does not believe that, not 
this Liberal minister, not those Liberals across the way, save for 
a few of them.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	Bill C-45 demonstrates how the minister believes that life should 
mean life for the bad murderers, those who would kill more than 
one person, but not for the good murderers, those who would stop 
at one. When we analyse the minister's thinking, one wonders 
whether in fact the Prime Minister perhaps erred in his choice when 
he picked him. We have seen nothing but weak-kneed bleeding 
heart pieces of legislation by the justice minister which do not deal 
at all with the concerns of Canadians.
<P>
	Let us get to the redundancy. Bill C-45 would outlaw section 745 
reviews for those who commit multiple murders. This provision is 
absolutely redundant. Multiple murderers do not get out now. 
Historically they never get out of jail. What on earth is the Minister 
of Justice trying to pull here? Is he trying to tell Canadians that in 
spite of the fact that multiple murderers never get out now, this 
clause is going to ensure that they will never get out? Big deal. 
They are either getting out early or they are not. The fact is that 
they are not. What is the use of the bill?
<P>
	The use of the bill, once again, is that the Minister of Justice is 
trying sucker Canadians, is trying to mislead them into thinking 
that the Liberal government cares about what Canadians are 
feeling. That is the purpose of the bill. Unfortunately we have a 
minister who is not being honest with the Canadian people.
<P>
	To talk about multiple murderers again, I introduced a private 
member's bill last year that would have looked after this. It called 
for consecutive sentencing for those who are convicted of one or 
more crimes. If the government had not been so afraid to deal with 
that bill, the minister would not have had to bring in Bill C-45 
because consecutive sentencing for multiple murderers would have 
looked after this. It would have ensured that they never got out.
<P>
	Those who kill only one person are entitled to a section 745 
review. Now the minister is telling us that he has the ability, he has 
the vision to pigeon hole murderers into good murderer or bad 
murderer categories. That is an absolutely audacious way to think.
<P>
	I have to ask: Is one life any less precious than three lives, than 
two lives, than five lives? Is one life any less precious? Does the 
destruction of one life have any less effect on the victim's family 
and friends? It seems the  minister believes it is okay to allow them 
to go through the torture of a section 745 review: If a murderer kills 
just one person, then let us allow them to go through the review; let 
us bring in the victim's family and friends so they can relive this 
thing over again, so they can see and hear about this savage beast 
that has taken the life of one of their family members or friends.
<P>
	The minister must think that is all right because that is the line he 
is trying to peddle us today. However, it is not okay in the 
minister's judgment, which is questionable at best, to allow the 
family and friends of a victim of a multiple murderer to go through 
a section 745 review. No, it is not okay to do that. If someone kills 
five or six people, the victims' friends and families should not have 
to go through the review, but according to the minister it is okay to 
put the victim's family and friends through it if just one person has 
been killed.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	That is the justice minister's logic. There is no rationale to it. Is 
the family of one victim somehow better to handle the rigours of 
reliving its worst nightmare during a section 745 review? Is that 
what the minister thinks? Only the Minister of Justice can answer 
these questions. Think about it. Only this minister would have the 
audacity to create categories of murderers, some deserving of 
leniency and some not. Only from this Liberal justice minister. If 
defies all imagination.
<P>
	This is only part of Bill C-45. There are two other amendments 
to section 745. One of the other amendments would assure that 
those entitled to a hearing would first have to be screened by a 
superior court judge. The judge would look at all the facts and 
determine if the applicant had a chance of success before allowing 
the hearing to proceed.
<P>
	Under the present system murderers are automatically entitled to 
a section 745 review. Considering that over 72 per cent of section 
745 applicants are successful in having their parole ineligibility 
period reduced, it is highly unlikely that judges will be rejecting a 
great deal of the applications. The history has been set for these 
reviews.
<P>
	Let us remember that judges are appointed in this country. 
Generally speaking, but almost 100 per cent of the time, the judges 
who are appointed tend to reflect the philosophy of the government 
of the day. We can be sure the Liberal government has its own 
judges out there reflecting its philosophy. We have seen the 
sentencing.
<P>
	Referring to Bill C-201, in this country people can drive and 
people can drink. They can kill one, two or three people and receive 
about three years for that crime, that 100 per cent preventable 
crime. This is because the judges are reflective of this Liberal 
government's philosophy. When I brought the bill before the 
House, the Minister of Justice instructed his parliamentary 
secretary not to allow any members of the Liberal Party to speak in 
favour of it. Why? Because the Liberals do not want public 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3911"> 3911 </A></B>
<P>
awareness raised to the point that they will have to make some 
meaningful changes. That is why.
<P>
	That is why the Minister of Justice will not let his members 
speak in favour of bills that reflect the thinking of the Canadian 
people. That is why the Minister of Justice is hog tying his fellow 
members who support stiffer sentencing and stiffer methods of 
dealing with criminals. It is because it is not in their philosophy.
<P>
	It goes back to the Pierre Trudeau days. When Mr. Trudeau and 
his government came to power all of a sudden individuals were not 
responsible for their actions; it was society that made them that 
way. That philosophy is still embedded deeply in every one of 
those Liberals who are sitting across the way, save for a few of 
them who have their heads screwed on straight.
<P>
	The minister constantly inserts cosmetic changes in an attempt 
to make it appear as if he is toughening up the section. The 
insertion of these new procedural hurdles is not the kind of change 
Canadians are looking for. It simply does not and will not do the 
job. They do not want a system where murderers simply have to 
jump through a few more hoops to get out of prison, when just a 
few cosmetic changes will make it okay for them to be released. 
They do not want a system that deals appropriately with criminals. 
The Liberals do not want a system that reflects the feelings of 
Canadians toward criminals. Canadian want them put in jail 
forever when they savagely take the life of someone. But not this 
minister and most of the Liberals across the way.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	Canadians want killers incarcerated for a minimum of 25 years. 
As a matter of fact, if the government had the guts to hold a 
national referendum on the death penalty for first degree murder, it 
would find that an overwhelming number of Canadian would vote 
in favour of it. But not these Liberals and not this Liberal Minister 
of Justice. They simply do not have the guts to deal with reality 
because it conflicts with their Trudeau-like philosophy.
<P>
	Canadians want section 745 abolished, killed, scrapped just like 
they wanted done with the GST. They want section 745 taken out of 
the Criminal Code. If someone is sentenced to prison for savagely 
taking the life of another person, Canadians want them put in jail 
forever. Liberals cannot deny that. They know it but they are afraid 
to act on it because they have no backbone.
<P>
	The last amendment offered in the bill ensures that juries hearing 
a section 745 application would have to be unanimous in their 
decision to reduce an applicant's parole ineligibility period. The 
present system only requires agreement among two-thirds of the 
jurors for an application to be successful.
<P>
	We currently have an unbelievable condition which was 
established in 1976 by, guess who? A bleeding heart Liberal 
government. Many of those members from 1976  are still dictating 
this bleeding heart philosophy about criminals.
<P>
	The new requirement is an improvement over the current 
system, but the fact remains that section 745 should not exist. It 
should be out of there. At second reading of a private member's bill 
the House voted overwhelmingly for the bill to go forward. The 
Liberals voted for it. Where is it now? It is stuck in committee and 
it will probably get buried there because the government has no 
guts.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hanger:</B> No free votes either.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harris:</B> On December 13, 1994 the House voted in favour 
of sending Bill C-226, sponsored by the member for York 
South-Weston to the justice committee. That member had the 
good sense to leave that party and sit on the other side of the House 
recently. We commend him for his good judgment. He knew what 
the government said about the GST in the last election. His 
integrity would not allow him to sit with the Liberals while they 
continued to mislead the Canadian people about the GST. What 
they said before the election, what they said in the red book and 
what they were saying verbally door to door did not always agree.
<P>
	His bill called for the repeal of section 745. Some Liberals and 
other members in the House voted for it. Where is it? It is buried in 
committee because the justice minister does not have the guts to 
deal with it.
<P>
	Actions that the majority of Canadians support do not mean 
much to this justice minister or the Liberals. What matters is the 
personal agenda of the Minister of Justice and the Liberals who are 
giving him advice.
<P>
	CAVEAT wants the section repealed. Victims of Violence want 
the section repealed. Canadians want the section repealed. 
However, the justice minister, for some reason, does not want it 
repealed. Why is that?
<P>
	When is the government going to govern the way Canadians 
want them to govern? When will they start listening to Canadians? 
When will they come down from their ivory towers and listen to the 
people? When will they repeal section 745? No one with half a 
brain could support this half-baked piece of legislation, which is 
redundant, before it even came to this House?
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have some follow-up for my colleague about the matter of multiple 
murderers and others applying, in the first instance, to a superior 
court judge for a reduction in their parole ineligibility.
<P>
	As I understand it, a royal recommendation has been attached to 
this bill to cover the additional administrative costs to be 
occasioned by the provisions of the legislation. I also understand 
that there will be avenues of appeal open to convicted murderers 
that are not open presently.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3912"> 3912 </A></B>
<P>
	If a convicted murderer appears before a jury asking for a 
reduction in their parole ineligibility and the jury finds against 
them, there is no appeal from that. There now will be an appeal 
from the superior court judge. The appeal could presumably be 
carried all the way up to the Supreme Court. These avenues of 
appeal must be publicly funded.
<P>
	A royal recommendation has been attached to this bill. I wonder 
if the member has given any consideration to the linkage between 
this royal recommendation and the new avenues of appeal that were 
not previously available to convicted killers. Can he give us some 
idea of what the linkage might be?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harris:</B> Mr. Speaker, the royal recommendation that the 
member has just spoken about provides additional funding to 
facilitate these appeals.
<P>
	One of the things we have been saying throughout the debate is 
that if the government had the sense of what the Canadian people 
want, and had the backbone to deal with first degree murderers in a 
way that is appropriate, it not only would satisfy the concerns, the 
needs and the demands of the Canadian people but it could also 
save the taxpayers a ton of money. There would be no appeals.
<P>
	That is the point that Reformers have been trying to make. That 
is the point that the member for York South-Weston tried to make 
in Bill C-226. Get rid of section 745. That way there will be no 
appeals. Life would mean 25 years. There would be no appeals.
<P>
	Taxpayers would be saved millions and millions of dollars and 
murderers would be kept off the streets for at least 25 years, 
reducing the chance of someone getting out early and killing again. 
We would satisfy the demand of the Canadian people that, when a 
human life is taken with premeditation, justice would to be served 
and the sentence would be appropriate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to ask the member about the timing of the introduction 
of this bill.
<P>
	Reflecting back to just prior to the rising of the House last 
summer, the government presented legislation that dealt with 
DNA. It gave police departments another tool to track and 
determine the guilt or innocence of rapists and murderers. It 
certainly was an advantage for law enforcement.
<P>
	At the time the bill came forward, it was rushed through during 
the dying days of the session before the summer. It fell short of 
doing a complete job. Police departments could not bank any of the 
evidence. To this day, they still cannot and it has been a year since 
the legislation came in. The justice minister never consulted with 
the solicitors general and justice ministers of the provinces. As a 
result of that, the considerable costs were downloaded on to the 
shoulders of municipal police departments as well as provincial 
attorneys general and solicitors general.
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
	I would like to ask the member, given the process as it was last 
year with the DNA bill, how he views this legislation which again 
is being introduced in the dying days of Parliament. Was there 
justice done in debate? What is the feeling he is getting from his 
constituents? It is important that members of the House, and 
members of the Liberal government, in particular, hear what is 
going on out there. They seem to have their heads buried in the 
sand so that these bills can be rushed through all their stages.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harris:</B> Mr. Speaker, the answer to the hon. member's 
question is that it is just plain, old-fashioned political trickery.
<P>
	The government knows that the DNA bill, which was introduced 
at the end of the last session, was badly flawed. It did not want to 
give the Reform Party an opportunity to point out all the 
weaknesses and inequities of the bill. The government did not want 
to hear our suggestions to make it better.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice is doing exactly the same thing with this 
bill. He knows that this is a weak bill. He knows that the bill is 
totally redundant. He knows that multiple murderers do not get out 
of prison anyway. He knows that he is just trying to fool the 
Canadian people into thinking that he is actually doing something.
<P>
	The reason he has introduced the bill now, with the House 
probably rising on Friday, is that he does not want to give 
Reformers any time to debate the issue appropriately. He does not 
want the debate to stretch out to the point that, heaven forbid, 
concerned Canadians might get some sort of an idea about what the 
minister is trying to do. He is playing make-believe that the bill 
will do some good.
<P>
	By introducing it at the end of the session, as we are about to 
rise, he has taken away the time for meaningful debate, which is 
certainly warranted in this case.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Julian Reed (Halton-Peel, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to ask the hon. member if he knows how many of those who 
were released under section 745 went on to commit murder again.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harris:</B> Mr. Speaker, I know there have been murders that 
have taken place after someone was released. I would be happy to 
send the member the figures.
<P>
	The fact is that under section 745 if even one more murder is 
committed by someone who has been let out after only 15 years, 
that is too many. The Canadian people have been saying: ``Do not 
let them out''. The Liberal member knows that. The justice 
minister knows that one is too many. If a murderer savagely takes 
the life of a person they should spend the rest of their life behind 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3913"> 3913 </A></B>
<P>
bars. If the Canadian people had their way they would be able to 
vote in a referendum on capital punishment.
<P>
	The member opposite knows the mood of the Canadian people, 
but he is being told to sit and keep quiet by the Minister of Justice. 
The Minister of Justice is in charge and no one is going to upset his 
personal agenda.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Reed:</B> Mr. Speaker, according to my information, no 
murders have ever been committed by anyone released under 
section 745.
<P>
<B>(1330 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harris:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be happy to give the figures to 
the hon. member across the way. I will also give him the figures of 
murders that have been committed by criminals who have been let 
out on parole for even lesser sentences the first time than murder. 
These are people who have been in jail for assault, sexual assault, 
rape and kidnapping and who have served part of their time, let out 
on parole and then went on to kill.
<P>
	I will provide those figures to the member and he had better read 
them because the Canadian people have read them. The Canadian 
people are asking the government when it will do something about 
it. The Reform Party is standing up for Canadians all across the 
country. We have established the victims rights bill which we will 
bring into the House and which the Minister of Justice 
half-heartedly agrees with.
<P>
	Quite frankly, we do not care much about what the Minister of 
Justice thinks about these things. It is the Canadian people we 
listen to. We will continue to listen to them because they know 
better than the Minister of Justice and the Liberal government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it is a pleasure to be here to participate in second reading debate of 
government Bill C-45, an act to amend section 745 of the Criminal 
Code.
<P>
	This is an important debate for Canadians. It is very close to the 
heart of members of my constituency of Cariboo-Chilcotin. Like 
perhaps every member in the House, I have received many letters, 
phone calls and communications from people not only in my 
constituency but from across the country talking about the justice 
system. They have told me of their dissatisfaction, of the fear they 
experience and of the difficulties the police forces are having not 
simply in enforcing the law but in getting convictions in the justice 
system after people who have committed offences are 
apprehended.
<P>
	People tell me the justice system is broken and has to be fixed. 
The Canadian people deserve, have a need and indeed a right to 
certain securities and safety in their communities. They tell me this 
system needs change and it needs to be reformed. That has been 
one of the major planks of the Reform Party's platform since its 
inception.  The Canadian people deserve safety. They need the 
security and certainty that they can walk down the street, any street 
in any Canadian city, without being concerned whether they will be 
mauled, threatened, injured or murdered.
<P>
	Why do Canadians feel this way? The answer is a simple one. 
Canadians do not feel safe in their homes or on the streets. They are 
concerned about their children's safety in their own 
neighbourhoods. In some cities like Vancouver, parents have to 
clean up the mess on the streets before their children can go to 
school because of the danger of coming into contact with harmful 
substances, objects or people. They also see the justice system as 
one protecting the rights of criminals over the needs, the suffering 
and the loss of victims.
<P>
	This bill merely perpetuates this reality. Bill C-45 does not do 
anything to protect victims and their need to recover from horrible 
suffering, pain and loss.
<P>
	As my colleague from Prince George-Bulkley Valley stated, 
Bill C-45 is totally redundant. There are two major reasons why 
this is case. Before I discuss these reasons, let me describe who the 
victims of crime are. How does section 745 of the Criminal Code 
ignore their legitimate needs?
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
	The victims of crime I am talking about are the friends and 
families of those who have been callously murdered in our society. 
Victims are sentenced by a killer. Their sentences are true life 
sentences because they carry the pain and the loss of a loved one 
forever.
<P>
	This brings to mind the sentencing of first degree murderers 
which we call a life sentence at 25 years. In my mind 25 years does 
not represent the life of a person. The son or the friend or the 
spouse who has been stolen from a victim with no regard for their 
loss, let alone no compensation, is gone forever. There is no time 
limit on that.
<P>
	Many victims of crime view section 745 of the Criminal Code as 
one way the justice system protects the rights of murderers over the 
needs of victims. Section 745 dates back to 1976 when Parliament 
abolished capital punishment with the passing of then Bill C-84.
<P>
	Included in Bill C-84 was the mandatory sentencing clause 
which gives anyone convicted of first degree murder a minimum 
25 year sentence before parole eligibility. The mandatory 
sentencing clause also included section 745, the so-called faint 
hope clause, which more and more victims are calling the sure bet 
clause. It gives every first and second degree murderer the right to 
apply for a reduction in parole eligibility after they serve 15 years 
of a 25 year so-called life sentence.
<P>
	This is the absolute right of the convicted murderer, but 79 per 
cent of those who have applied for a reduced sentence under 
section 745 have received a reduced  sentence. That means only 21 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3914"> 3914 </A></B>
<P>
per cent of murderers who apply under section 745 are denied and 
must continue to serve their full 25 years life sentence.
<P>
	Section 745 was included because the government of the day felt 
that in some situations the interests of the criminals should come 
before the interests of the public. This was expressed very clearly 
by a minister of the day. Jean-Pierre Goyer, a former solicitor 
general of Canada said in response to Prime Minister Trudeau's 
attempt at reforms of the justice system in the 1970s: ``We have 
decided to stress the rehabilitation of individuals rather than the 
protection of society''.
<P>
	That is exactly the point where we differ. That is exactly where 
we believe the government at that time made a wrong turn and 
sacrificed the safety of our citizens for the rights and the 
rehabilitation of convicted felons.
<P>
	This is exactly what victims of crime are upset about. Section 
745 violates the needs for fundamental justice. The victims are the 
ones who have to go home every night to an empty house or sleep 
in an empty bed. Then they live out every day with the grief, the 
sorrow and the suffering of knowing the one they love is never 
coming home again. The only solace they have is being sure the 
one who murdered their loved one is behind bars, unable to inflict 
such violence on anyone again.
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	After 15 years of this kind of pain many victims discover for the 
first time that section 745 even exists and that those who murdered 
their loved ones have the automatic right to a section 745 hearing to 
determine their suitability for early parole. The felon gets another 
opportunity to state why he deserves freedom while the victims 
continue to bear the life sentence inflicted on them by this same 
applicant. Even though the murderer may not be granted early 
release, victims must still relive the horror, anxiety and pain of 
their loved ones' death.
<P>
	Darlene Boyd, whose daughter Laurie was murdered 14 years 
ago, says she did not think her family members could go through 
another judicial hearing. It would be traumatic for them.
<P>
	Victims also feel cheated by section 745. They often ask: ``Why 
should the person who killed someone I loved and who has been 
convicted of murder and given a 25 year life sentence be released 
early or even be given the right to apply for early parole? I have no 
parole or judicial review or faint hope clause to shorten my 
sentence''.
<P>
	Mrs. Rose Onofrey, whose son Dennis was murdered, said: ``Is 
that all my son's life is worth, fifteen years? Why do I have to be 
victimized again and again?'' Dorothy Mallet, a convicted 
murderer who received early parole under section 745, wants to 
visit her children. ``I have to go to the cemetery to visit my son'', 
Mrs. Onofrey said.
<P>
	The problem with section 745 is that it respects murderers' 
rights over the rights and the needs of victims. The bill is a weak 
attempt to correct this imbalance. Indeed it is not an attempt, it is 
totally redundant. Bill C-45 does not go anywhere near protecting 
victims and their needs.
<P>
	There are two major reasons why this is so. Bill C-45 removes 
the right of only multiple and serial murderers to apply under 
section 745. If this legislation is passed before the House adjourns, 
and it is expected that it will, serial killers like Clifford Olson can 
still request to apply for early parole because the restrictions 
against serial killers are not retroactive.
<P>
	It is true that killers like Olson would be unlikely to win an 
appeal to apply for early parole in any case, but this is not the point. 
The point is Clifford Olson and people like him should not be 
allowed to even make the request. Allowing a criminal like Olson 
any right to ask for a hearing to determine his suitability for early 
parole degrades and undervalues the rights of Olson's victims.
<P>
	Gary Rosenfeldt, the father of one of Olson's 11 victims, said 
last week this entire section is an insult to victims. I agree. Mr. 
Rosenfeldt is correct. The families Olson has hurt and traumatized 
have suffered for years with the memories of his heinous crimes. 
Bill C-45 still gives him the right to request a hearing for early 
parole. It is insulting. Victims deserve more respect than that and 
the public deserves a greater degree of certain safety.
<P>
	The second reason Bill C-45 does not go far enough is that those 
who have killed one person still have the right to appeal their 
parole ineligibility. Multiple or serial killers are denied this right. 
This creates categories of killers in society, first degree killers that 
is.
<P>
	Those who killed one victim will have access to the process for 
early release but those who killed more than one victim will not 
have the access to the early release process. Canadians believe that 
murder is murder and that one murder is as bad as the next. Why 
then does the justice minister consider the killing of one person less 
serious than the killing of two or more people?
<P>
<B>(1345)</B>
<P>
	I can hardly believe he would do that. I can hardly believe he 
would tell the friends and family of Lisa Clausen of British 
Columbia who was murdered by Paul Kocurek in 1980 that Mr. 
Kocurek can enter into the early release process on August 2, 1996 
because Lisa was the only person he killed.
<P>
	How about the family of Kenneth Kaplinski? Kenneth was 
abducted in 1977, taken into the woods and executed by Edward 
Sales and Allan Kinsella. Kinsella obtained an early parole hearing 
and was turned down, while Sales has applied and awaits a 
response. How can the justice minister tell Ken's family that Sales 
and Kinsella will be allowed to request a hearing for early release 
because they have only committed one murder?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3915"> 3915 </A></B>
<P>
	I can hardly believe that the justice minister would tell Janet 
Shelever of Calgary that her husband's killer can still request early 
parole because her husband was his only victim. That is exactly 
what the justice minister is saying to these victims and many 
others if Bill C-45 passes.
<P>
	Victims of single murderers grieve, mourn and suffer as much as 
the victims of multiple and serial killers. If Bill C-45 passes, they 
will continue to suffer and the person who killed their loved one 
will be eligible to apply for early parole and could obtain an early 
release.
<P>
	Does Bill C-45 respect and place a high value on the suffering of 
victims? I say no and so do many Canadians. All that is valued in 
this bill is the status quo.
<P>
	There have been a couple of questions about how many people 
have been killed by people let out of jail on section 745. In fact, 
section 745 which was passed in 1976, has only allowed convicted 
killers the opportunity to appeal for the last five years. That is a 
very small window by which to test anything. In the past five years 
one killer has been out under section 745 and has killed again. 
More important, of all those who have been let out on parole, there 
have been 15 murders committed by them. That is the true story. 
That is what we need to look at.
<P>
	I challenge the justice minister to do two things. First, treat 
first degree murderers equally. Second, have some regard for the 
survivors of victims and their everlasting loss and the pain they 
suffer.
<P>
	The only way to achieve these objectives is by repealing section 
745 of the Criminal Code, not by amending it. Those who commit 
any murder, single or multiple, would have no right to apply for or 
receive early parole. Their parole privileges would be the same and 
survivors of victims would not have to relive the horror, the anxiety 
and the pain of their loved one's death. Nor would they feel cheated 
because the one who killed their son, brother, sister or mother is 
only serving a fraction of the life sentence they deserve for causing 
so much harm and such irreplaceable loss.
<P>
	This brings me to another point. Why does the Liberal 
government almost always deal with serious issues by bringing 
forward bills which at best are only half measures? Bill C-45 is 
redundant. It is not going to change anything. There is a pattern to 
this and it goes beyond Bill C-45.
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
	Think of the pain, the anguish and the horror caused to many 
Canadians with the way Bill C-33 was rushed through the House. 
After saying this was going to be a more open government, the 
Liberals gave no opportunity to Canadians to have input on the 
human rights bill. It was dealt with in 10 days.
<P>
	Consider also the GST. What a way to deal with the promise that 
was made in the red book. Because the Liberals could not reach an 
agreement with the provinces, they singled out some of the smaller 
ones and gave them a better or different deal and left the others to 
haggle and bargain with the government.
<P>
	What about the unemployment insurance bill, a bill that affects 
millions of Canadians? Without input, without even knowing 
where they are going, there is a proposal to change the whole 
policy, to ram it through, to let the sufferers fall where they may.
<P>
	This is not an appropriate way to bring legislation before the 
House. Legislation should reflect the consensus of the values, the 
will and the desires of the Canadian people. That is not what the 
government is doing with Bill C-45 in amending section 745.
<P>
	This bill will do nothing to change the facts about how unsafe it 
is for Canadians to walk on their streets and sleep in their beds 
knowing they are absolutely secure. This bill does nothing to give 
the police forces the tools and the measures they need to bring 
criminals to conviction.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened to 
the debate this morning on Bill C-45. Of course, my attention was 
drawn to the report by Willie Gibbs who appeared before the 
Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs. He informed us 
that last year 15 people were murdered in this country after their 
murderers had been released on either early release or parole. That 
is a horrible statistic.
<P>
	Fifteen people have been murdered as a result of a mistake made 
by our officials which has to do with the early release or parole of 
people who have committed offences, lesser offences than first 
degree murder. Nevertheless the officials released them. My 
concern is that is the very parole board that will have to make a 
decision on the first degree murderers if they jump through the 
hoops the justice minister is allowing them to jump through and 
end up before the parole board. It is the same parole board that 
allowed the release of those people which resulted at least in part in 
15 innocent people being murdered. Does the member have any 
comments on that?
<P>
	Not only were 15 people murdered, which is more than one per 
month, but there were 15 attempted murders, 22 sexual assaults, 21 
major assaults, 71 armed robberies, in all 165 serious crimes. Since 
1987 criminals out on some form of early release killed 206 people 
and tried to kill another 162 people. In all, 2,097 very serious 
crimes were committed by them in that period of time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mayfield:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is entirely typical of my 
colleague, a former policeman, to have dug into the facts, to have 
brought the issues to light and to have demonstrated them to the 
House in such a manner.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>

<B><A NAME="3916"> 3916 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1355 )</B>
<P>
	The member raises the whole issue of public safety that I was 
attempting to get at. The whole issue of public safety revolves 
around the need for people to be certain about who is in the 
community and can cause them harm. How can we know who and 
where these people? If we do not know these dangerous people are 
locked up, then we still live under the threat of their reoffending.
<P>
	This relates to the whole attitude of government. I suppose it is 
based upon the philosophy that a person is not really responsible 
for what he does: if a person's mother is a prostitute and their father 
an alcoholic, how can anyone blame them for anything? However, 
we all have known since we have been conscious that there is a 
difference between right and wrong. We all know what a bad 
conscience is. We all know the inner voice that speaks to us. Yet 
there has been a deliberate attempt to move the inner conscience 
away, to tell people that they are not responsible: ``Poor little you. 
How could you possibly be responsible when you have had such a 
miserable past?''
<P>
	I am not suggesting that people who had a difficult childhood 
should not be given consideration. It is our intention that all 
Canadians should have the opportunity to come to their full 
potential and do what they truly choose to do. However, when 
someone chooses to commit murder, there must be some means of 
saying that it is not acceptable and we will not allow them to 
continue to do that. They must realize that they are responsible for 
their actions no matter what happened to them as a child or what 
circumstances brought them to that point.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member commented on the lack of due process given to important 
legislation that comes before this House. He talked about the 
persistent use of time allocation, closure and the fact that 
legislation like this comes up at the end of the session when very 
little time is allowed for debate. The hon. member is absolutely 
accurate in presenting this information. Why does he think this 
happens? Why does the government use time allocation so often 
and prevents important issues from being discussed and properly 
debated, not only in this House but right across the country?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mayfield:</B> Mr. Speaker, without being cynical, that is a 
serious question. It relates very much to the political aspirations 
and the desire of the government to be re-elected. Liberals will 
doing anything they can to put before them anything they think the 
public might accept to re-elect them. It is no secret that we are 
going into the last year of the government's mandate and it will be 
going before the public in an election.
<P>
	It is no secret that Bill C-45 will do nothing. How else can one 
explain its coming before the House and before the Canadian 
people at this time unless one looks at it through the political lens. 
The Liberals see this as being a  way for them to talk about 
amending the justice system without really doing anything. They 
have not thought it through. They do not know where they are 
going. They have no plan. This is the result of a do nothing attitude 
that simply caters to public opinion with no real goal in mind.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleague, I do not know if it was your 
intention to continue, but I imagine you will have a few minutes to 
go after question period. It being two o'clock, we will now proceed 
to statements by members.

there are three forms of wealth in society: material, cultural and

	Unfortunately, we often take our biological wealth for granted. 
Through perverse practices, we degrade our natural riches. We

	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, between

	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, as we approach the parliamentary summer recess it 
would seem an appropriate time to evaluate the Liberal 
government's record over the past three years.
<P>
	Broken promises permeate the pages of the red book and can be 
proven false by the actions of ministers and their departments.
<P>
	The minister of agriculture is among the worst. He said he would 
keep article XI of the GATT. He signed it into oblivion. He said he 
would keep the Crow benefit. He scrapped it three months later. He 
said the Crow payment cheques would be out in January. It is the 
middle of June and thousands are not yet processed. He said he 
would implement a whole farm income stabilization plan. He could 
not get provincial agreement. He said he would support a plebiscite 
on continental barley marketing. He did not do it and he will not 
even respect a plebiscite on barley and wheat marketing recently 
held in Alberta. The minister typifies the cynical irony: ``I am from 
the government and I am here to help you''.
<P>
	For years farmers have said: ``Do the opposite to what the 
government tells you to do''. It seems that this, too, is the motto of 
the minister of agriculture who has not done anything he said he 
would do.

	<B>Mr. Jag Bhaduria (Markham-Whitchurch-Stouffville,

anniversary of the worst terrorist attack in Canadian history, the 
bombing of Air-India flight 182. The innocent victims of this mass 
murder included 278 Canadians of East Indian descent.
<P>
	Families of these innocent victims have been patiently waiting 
for justice but the RCMP, after launching the largest probe in 
history, has failed to lay a single charge. It even offered a $1 
million reward for information leading to the arrest of the 
individuals responsible. That was a year ago and still the victims' 
families are waiting.
<P>
	On behalf of the families of the victims I urge the government to 
immediately establish a royal commission to investigate the 
biggest act of terrorism ever committed on Canadian soil. These 
families deserve to know the facts surrounding this tragedy. They 
deserve no less than honesty and truth from the government.

	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
tragic murder of the Romanian stowaways aboard the <I>Maersk 
Dubai</I> should be a spur for urgent action on the problem of 
stowaways.
<P>
	The $7,000 fine on ships found to be carrying stowaways was 
intended to encourage ship captains to take all possible measures to 
prevent stowaways. However, not only does the fine encourage 
captains to do away with stowaways, in practice it is poorly paid 
crew members who are often held responsible by captains and who 
are in turn forced to pay the fine. Thus the fine becomes an 
incentive to throw stowaways overboard. As a result, far from 
being an isolated incident, the longshoremen's union reports that 
the tragedy on the <I>Maersk Dubai</I> is an all too common occurrence.
<P>
	The current regime also offers inadequate guarantees that those 
accused of murdering stowaways on the high seas will be 
prosecuted. In the most recent incident there were authorities in a 
position to prosecute those accused. However, what would have 
happened if the victims had been from Liberia or some other 
jurisdiction without an effective authority?
<P>
	The NDP calls on the government to review its current policy on 
stowaways and urges it to work in the United Nations for a 
convention for the protection of stowaways.

	In many ways Brad can be seen as a pioneer for his work in

adjusting to mining activities. The ultimate result is that Noranda 
can improve safety while mining deeper.

	<B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Okanagan Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
when Robert Thirsk was a student at Glenmore Elementary and Dr. 
Knox in Okanagan Centre he had a dream. He wanted to become an 
astronaut. On June 20 that dream becomes reality. The official 
payload on mission 78 will be microgravity and the effects of space 
on the human body.
<P>
	Dr. Thirsk will also conduct a number of experiments designed 
by young Canadians while talking directly to them from space by 
two-way radio.
<P>
	The enthusiasm of our young scientists must be encouraged for 
Canada's economic future depends on our excellence in science 
and engineering. As Dr. Thirsk said to me, we have succeeded in 
developing our natural resources, but we have not fared as well 
developing our intellectual resources.
<P>
	Bobby Orr's hockey jersey will also be on mission 78, a tribute 
to Canadian excellence.
<P>
	I have no doubt that if Canada can produce the best hockey 
players in the world, then we can produce the best scientists and 
engineers too. All young people have dreams. We must encourage 
them and give them a place to go.

	<B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
United Nations has proclaimed June 17 world day to combat 
desertification.
<P>
	Desertification results from changes in climate, the deterioration 
of vegetation due to over exploitation, over grazing, deforestation 
and burning, through wind and water erosion due to poor 
cultivation practices.
<P>
<B>(1410 )</B>
<P>
	Desertification is more serious in Africa and Asia, but is also 
impacting our prairies. In 1995, Canada ratified the UN 
Convention to Combat Desertification. The convention commits 
supporters to provide resources for programs and projects designed 
to halt and, hopefully, reverse the expansion of deserts. These 
efforts are urgently needed if we are to ensure the productivity of 
lands and forests for future generations.

	The United Nations has declared June 17 World Desertification 
Day. This decision is one of the follow-ups to the Rio Conference 
held in June 1992. Subsequent international negotiations resulted 
in the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification. To 
date, it has been ratified by 29 of 115 signatory countries, including 
Canada. But this convention must be ratified by 50 countries before 
it can come into force.

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="FIRSTMINISTERS'CONFERENCE">FIRST MINISTERS' CONFERENCE</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, at the first ministers' conference, the federal government 
will be proposing its so-called new philosophy to renew Canadian 
federalism, that is step by step, bit by bit.
<P>
	My question is, of course, for the Prime Minister. Is it the 
intention of the federal government to offer full, total and 
unconditional financial compensation with respect to all areas of 
provincial jurisdiction from which it intends to withdraw soon?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we are withdrawing from areas of provincial jurisdiction 
and, when we spend money for certain programs in certain 
circumstances, we will offer money as is the case for manpower 
and active measures.
<P>
	The discussion will be at the ministerial level, but I am very 
happy to see that the opposition realizes we are going to improve 
the federation and that we will withdraw from fields we were in 
previously. I hope all the provinces will be very happy with this.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, any pleasure the Prime Minister may take at the 
opposition's acknowledging his improvement of the federation is 
pure presumption on his part. Given his past record, we have no 
illusions as to his intentions. I am sorry to have to hurt him, but I 
must speak the truth.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister acknowledge that the only acceptable 
way to withdraw from areas of provincial jurisdiction is to 
accompany the withdrawal with a transfer of tax points so that the 
provinces may carry out their own responsibilities fully, 
completely and autonomously as provided in the agreements 
signed by the Lesage and Pearson governments?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, when we withdraw from the programs mentioned in my 
letter to the premiers, the Leader of the Opposition will have to 
acknowledge that, despite his predictions, I will be obliged to make 
him retract what he has just said. I will do it very gently; I would 
not want to cause the Leader of the Opposition any problem.
<P>
	As to the forms of compensation, take unemployment insurance 
as an example. It cannot be by tax points in this case, because it is 
the employers and employees throughout Canada that contribute to 
the fund. This money is then redirected to those in Canada who are 
not working. This must be a direct transfer and not tax points, 
because the amounts will necessarily vary with the level of 
unemployment in different parts of Canada. We never know the 
exact amount from one year to the next. A situation may be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3921"> 3921 </A></B>
<P>
disastrous in one province today and then quickly improve, or 
deteriorate in another part of Canada.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	This is why we have this means of redistributing wealth across 
the country to those who need it. It has to be a direct transfer and 
not tax points to ensure the flexibility needed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister is taking the position of defender of 
Canadian taxpayers, and yet he is taking $5 billion out of the 
unemployment insurance fund provided by workers and employers 
and he is applying this money to his deficit and wants us to 
consider this the standard in defending people's interests? Oh, 
come on.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister acknowledge that he is preparing to 
negotiate at the conference a partial and conditional withdrawal of 
his government from areas of jurisdiction that already belong to the 
provinces as he jumps with both feet into other areas of provincial 
jurisdiction, such as securities?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, first, under the Constitution, unemployment is the 
responsibility of the Canadian government. There is no doubt of 
this. There was a constitutional amendment on this point in 1947 or 
1949. It is our jurisdiction, and we share revenues with the 
provinces.
<P>
	The unemployment insurance deficit, when we took over the 
government, was over $6 billion. We have reduced the deficit and 
now it makes good sense to build up a surplus for those days when 
we will need one to pay employment insurance to people who need 
it. This is simply good management.
<P>
	As to providing a Canadian securities commission at the request 
of the provinces, I think, at least I hope that most of the provinces 
will want to participate in it, because it will mean investors will 
have far fewer forms than 10 or 12 to complete in order to obtain 
approval to sell bonds. With the broad flexibility I represent, any 
province not wishing to participate may do so.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, how nice to see the Prime Minister concerned about 
respect for his own areas of jurisdiction when he does not respect 
those of the provinces.
<P>
	In fact, when the Prime Minister says he wants to withdraw from 
provincial areas of jurisdiction, he knows full well that any federal 
withdrawal without an unconditional transfer of the appropriate 
financial resources is nothing but a smoke screen.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister admit that, whatever the administrative 
agreements he can negotiate with the provinces, as long as the 
federal government can set national standards and keep its hands 
on the money, it  will impose its conditions in areas that are not 
under its jurisdiction?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the provinces' financial weight compared to that of 
the federal government has not stopped growing since the 1960s.
<P>
	Does the book <I>Option Québec</I> by René Lévesque mean 
something to the official opposition? This book refers to a 
conference given by Jacques Parizeau in the late sixties, in which 
Mr. Parizeau said about the decentralization process then starting 
in Canada: ``This goes too far. This decentralization will go too far, 
and this country will become unmanageable. Quebec must get out 
of it''.
<P>
	This is how the problem should be put: ``Are we too 
decentralized?'' I do not think so. Can the decentralization process 
be improved? I think so. But this so-called centralized federation is 
a chimera that only today's independentist leaders are trying to sell 
people; that term is inaccurate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, will the Prime Minister admit that this gradual 
decentralization relegating the provinces to the role of onlookers 
amounts to bringing in through the back door the Charlottetown 
accord, which called for the federal government to withdraw from 
some areas of provincial jurisdiction, but only on certain 
conditions?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, we already answered, in relation to job training, that 
there must be an effective partnership between the federal 
government and the provinces in an area that concerns both the 
provinces, through job training, and the federal government, 
through unemployment insurance and the economic union.
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
	As for the other areas, what is the hon. member talking about? 
Where are the conditions attached to social housing? The federal 
government is withdrawing from this area. In tourism, there is a 
partnership that works very well but that could possibly be 
improved. What area could we mention, in fact? Forestry? 
Recreation? Mining? The federal government is withdrawing from 
all these areas without any conditions. What is the hon. member 
talking about?

<HR>
<B><A NAME="3922"> 3922 </A></B>
<P>
	On Thursday past, in response to a question from the member 
for Fraser Valley East, the minister stated categorically: ``I take 
responsibility for the Department of Justice. From the outset the 
Department of Justice has acted in an appropriate manner''.
<P>
	Since the minister maintains that justice officials, including 
Kimberley Prost, acted in an entirely appropriate fashion, will he 
instruct his lawyers not to make an out of court deal with Brian 
Mulroney and not to spend millions of taxpayer dollars?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we are defending the litigation 
brought against the Government of Canada. We intend to continue 
in that defence. We will put forward all the defences we have 
pleaded and we will do our best to establish them in the courtroom. 
That is our intention and that is the course we are on.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
understand from that answer that the government is not interested 
in an out of court settlement but will go to court.
<P>
	Will the minister concede that he has said all along, as has the 
Prime Minister, that this is a police investigation, that the police 
initiated it and that the police must not be interfered with in their 
work? Will he concede that he should instruct his lawyers not to 
make an out of court deal with Brian Mulroney so the police may 
continue their investigation without interference from the minister 
or his lawyers?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the police of course must continue 
whatever work they want to do unaffected by politicians.
<P>
	The police investigation is separate from the civil litigation 
commenced by Mr. Mulroney in which he alleges defamation, and 
the hon. member will know that.
<P>
	I have made it clear we have filed defences in the civil litigation 
and we are defending that action.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
minister knows the suit is also against the RCMP.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice said Friday, quoting from <I>Hansard</I>: ``I 
shall report significant developments to the House when they 
occur''. We are obviously very concerned that the government is 
planning to make a settlement and pay Brian Mulroney millions, 
because of its incompetence, during the summer while the House is 
not sitting.
<P>
	Will the government fulfil its commitment and make a 
commitment that when there are any significant developments, 
including an out of court settlement, it will recall the House to 
make sure the House can examine the deal?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member ought never to 
doubt that I am accountable to the House as a member of the 
government and that the government is accountable to the House.
<P>
	The hon. member should also know, as I have made clear, we are 
defending the litigation.

	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	In his letter informing his provincial counterparts of the agenda 
for the first ministers' conference, the Prime Minister wrote: ``The 
afternoon session will focus on the social aspects of our policies 
and programs, and in particular on preserving a viable and 
sustainable social security system for Canadians''. But we are far 
from having a social security system in Canada as it is.
<P>
	Are we to understand from what he wrote that, far from 
withdrawing from provincial areas of jurisdiction, the Prime 
Minister is set to step right into the whole social programs area and 
take it over, even though transfer payments to the provinces have 
been cut drastically?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> On that 
topic, Mr. Speaker, we will review together the report prepared by 
the provincial governments themselves. They have prepared and 
submitted to the federal government a report that we have 
considered.
<P>
<B>(1430)</B>
<P>
	My feeling is that we agree on many aspects of this study 
prepared by the provincial governments themselves. This means 
we will be able to compare notes on these points and, if possible, 
improve the Canadian social security system. Our positions are 
well known. Take the five principles of medicare; they are 
respected by everyone. And just recently, the Government of 
Alberta, which had resisted complying, signed with the Minister of 
Health an agreement whereby the five conditions set out in the 
Canada Health Act will now be applied in Alberta as in every other 
province.
<P>
	I would say we are making considerable headway in this area. 
Our Friday afternoon meeting on this subject will go along the 
same lines of ensuring that Canada's social security system 
provides all Canadians with a minimum level of protection, as 
everyone or almost everyone in this House hopes for.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the report 
the Prime Minister is referring to reflects the opinion of the 
majority of provinces. Quebec has always insisted on having 
control over social policies and their integration and making its 
own decisions in that regard.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3923"> 3923 </A></B>
<P>
	By trying to take over-that is what this is-all social programs 
in Canada and trying to impose national standards as it did in the 
areas of manpower, forestry and mining, to name but a few, is the 
Prime Minister not using a sleight of hand to in fact centralize 
behind our backs by keeping all real decision making powers in 
his hands?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I find it very difficult to understand, when we are 
proposing to get out of some fields, that I suddenly become a 
centralisateur. It is a bit difficult for me to understand but I will 
reflect on it. They want the government to stay in manpower. Fine. 
If they wanted the government to stay in forestry, mining and many 
other sectors, it would. However, the government is not interested.
<P>
	We want to ameliorate the federation and clarify the 
responsibilities so the citizens of Canada will have a better system 
of government at the provincial and federal level. This is the goal 
we are trying to achieve. I am convinced that by Friday most of the 
provinces will be very happy to accept new responsibilities and 
accept that the government is getting out of some responsibilities.
<P>
	If the hon. member wants to tell the Quebec government that I 
should keep or increase the same responsibilities, that is fine with 
me.

	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Minister of Justice has now admitted his lawyers are discussing a 
possible out of court settlement with Brian Mulroney over the 
Airbus affair. He has even said that such a settlement ``would be 
very desirable''.
<P>
	I will tell the House what a settlement with Brian Mulroney 
would be. It would be an admission that the justice department has 
botched its investigation. It would be an admission that it had no 
evidence in the first place and tried to hide this fact from the 
Canadian people from the outset.
<P>
	If the justice minister says his department is acting responsibly 
every step of the way, will he promise here and now not to do a 
closed door deal with Brian Mulroney?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member errs in two 
respects in putting her question. First, she referred to a justice 
department investigation.
<P>
	The police are the people who investigate, and it was the Royal 
Canadian Mounted Police that conducted and is conducting an 
investigation into this case. The role of the Department of Justice, 
as the hon. member knows or perhaps should know, is that the 
international assistance  group was asked to communicate to a 
foreign government a request for assistance in the course of that 
investigation.
<P>
	The second error into which the hon. member fell was to assert 
there may have been no evidence from the outset. That too is a 
matter that relates to the police investigation. If the Royal 
Canadian Mounted Police chooses to start or conduct or conclude 
an investigation based on what it finds or does not find, that is for it 
to decide. The police in this country conduct investigations based 
on their own judgments.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, that is 
exactly the point. If the RCMP is investigating, let it investigate. 
Let us not talk about backroom deals and out of court settlements. 
This is absolutely ridiculous.
<P>
	I will tell the House what else an out of court settlement would 
be. It would be a slap in the face to millions of Canadians who 
would be forking out millions of dollars to pay this off because of 
the minister's incompetence.
<P>
<B>(1435 )</B>
<P>
	I want the minister to promise to me and to Canadians right here 
and right now that as soon as he signs this out of court settlement 
with Brian Mulroney the next thing he will do is sign his own 
resignation. Will he or will he not?
<P>

	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Prime Minister. On Saturday, between 5,000 and 
10,000 women and men came to Parliament Hill to demand that the 
government fulfil the commitments it made during the last election 
campaign, including the provision of day care services and the 
creation of jobs. The Bloc Quebecois met with women's groups 
this morning, and it shares their concerns.
<P>
	Given that the federal budget for day care services went, without 
any explanation, from $630 million down to $250 million, will the 
Prime Minister tell us what he did with the money that is missing 
and when he will give back to the children, through the provinces 
of course, all the money owed to them?

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robert D. Nault (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is quite 
obvious what happened to the money. The agreement that was 
suggested, put forward to the provinces, was not accepted by the 
provinces. The federal government then of course came back to the 
drawing board and is interested in having a discussion with the 
provinces.
<P>
	If the provinces want to make a proposal to the federal 
government we would be very interested in seeing the proposal. 
When that happens we will make comments on it, when we know 
what the provinces would like to see in the field of child care.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, this is 
what happens when the government sets conditions.
<P>
	On Friday, the Prime Minister said that, to eliminate child 
poverty, work had to be available for the parents. Since he intends 
to discuss the establishment of a job creation program during the 
first ministers' conference, will he make sure that, this time, unlike 
the last infrastructure program, there will be jobs for women?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robert D. Nault (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not 
know where members of the opposition have been. We of course in 
this Parliament have talked about jobs and the economy over and 
over again.
<P>
	Quite frankly, if they look at the results of the government they 
will know we have created over 600,000 jobs by the improvements 
we have made to the economy and by making sure we keep our eye 
on the ball.
<P>
	If the member is not aware of the information and the 
improvements we have made to the economy and the 
improvements we will continue to make, all she has to do is ask for 
a briefing and we will give her the information that shows the 
government has done a good job and will continue to improve on 
that. We will show the results with other programs we have already 
put in place in the past.

	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in December the Minister of Justice told reporters he had 
passed on information to the RCMP about the Airbus affair. He 
said: ``I have never had an instance occur where I passed 
information on and heard back from the RCMP in any way 
whatsoever''.
<P>
	Last Thursday, however, the minister told the House that the 
RCMP did indeed write back to him. I ask the Minister of Justice if 
he could simply explain this contradiction.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> I am delighted, Mr. Speaker, but first let me 
correct another error I am afraid.
<P>
	The research department for the hon. member's party consists of 
a clipping service from the <I>Sun</I> chain of newspapers, so it is very 
difficult for it to carry on.
<P>
	Let me correct an error. The hon. member referred to a statement 
I made last December that I had communicated information about 
the Airbus matter, and that is wrong.
<P>
	What I said, which is a matter of public record, is that in 
discharging my responsibilities as I saw them, when I was fixed 
with knowledge of alleged wrongdoing by the previous 
government, after consulting with my deputy and with the solicitor 
general, I passed that on to the police to do with as they might. 
They looked into the matter and responded by saying they were 
going to take no steps as there was no basis for doing so.
<P>
<B>(1440)</B>
<P>
	In terms of the most recent clipping from which the hon. 
member is working, I can also say that last December when I was 
interviewed by Mr. Koring of the <I>Globe and Mail</I> who put that 
question to me, I did say I had not heard back. I was reminded 
within a few days and then I pointed out to the <I>Globe and Mail</I> 
within a few days that indeed I had heard back. That is the fact.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, all last week and this week the Minister of Justice has 
been skilfully trying to get himself stepped back from this whole 
thing. We almost have to congratulate him for his sleight of hand. 
While he may think he is fooling people, he certainly is not.
<P>
	I would like to allow the minister one chance to clarify the 
situation. The minister has related to us the way he remembers the 
event, but just to make it clear, in the interests of transparency and 
clarity, I ask the minister if he would please table the letter from the 
RCMP in the House. Will he do that?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Yes, Mr. Speaker, I will.
<P>
	Let me say this in response to the hon. member's question. He 
speaks about my skilfully trying to distance myself from events. 
That is not the case. What I have been trying to do last week and 
today is to explain and emphasize for the hon. member and his 
colleagues that we are dealing with two different matters. It is 
neither accurate nor appropriate to mix them.
<P>
	On the first hand we have a Minister of Justice who receives 
information about an alleged wrongdoing in the past government 
who, in discharge of a responsibility, after consulting with the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3925"> 3925 </A></B>
<P>
deputy minister and the solicitor general, communicates that to the 
police. The hon. member for Calgary Southwest last week 
conceded that that indeed is the proper course.
<P>
	A second and separate matter is the decision by the Royal 
Canadian Mounted Police for its own reasons to commence its own 
investigation at a later time on the Airbus matter. It is separate. It is 
different. It is a matter for the police to decide.
<P>
	If the hon. member can understand that those two matters are 
separate, he will be a long way down the road to understanding 
these matters.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Minister of Justice is using lofty principles to hide his 
improvisation in the Airbus affair. The minister must move beyond 
discourse and explain the facts.
<P>
	Does the Minister of Justice confirm that he looked into the 
Airbus affair, in a personal and partisan manner, when he was a 
Liberal candidate in the 1993 general election?

Helms-Burton legislation. What is the minister doing to confront 
this attempt by the U.S. Congress to deny Canadians the legitimate 
right to do business with Cuba?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister for International Trade,

announced today on behalf of the government our response to the 
Helms-Burton legislation.
<P>
	We are attempting to protect Canadian sovereign interests, 
foreign policy, trade policy and the legal operations of Canadian 
businesses in Cuba. We have proposed amendments to the foreign 
extraterritorial measures act that would block any attempt by a 
company in a foreign country to carry out a court order within 
Canada on an objectionable piece of legislation like Helms-Burton. 
We have provided for a clawback provision that they can recover 
within Canada moneys and assets lost in the United States on such 
an action. Finally, the penalties have been increased for companies 
that follow the law of a foreign country as opposed to the law of 
this country.
<P>
	We hope that this will act as an effective deterrent to prevent the 
kind of operations, the kind of court action which is envisioned by 
the Helms-Burton bill in the United States, a unilateral action 
which we believe is wrong in principle, wrong in purpose and 
wrong in practice.
<P>
	In addition, we will be continuing with an action under the North 
American Free Trade Agreement. We will continue with the 
NAFTA commission meeting.

only one example.
<P>
	With this in mind, can the Minister of Justice tell the House

<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General

that transaction and we came to the conclusion that it was not in 
the public's interest to take steps to set it aside.
<P>
	If the hon. member is concerned about law, legality or matters 
involving the Constitution, then he should be much influenced by 
the fact that an expert witness testified before the Senate committee 
of legal and constitutional affairs in relation to Bill C-28. The very 
constitutional expert from Osgoode Hall law school whom the 
Tories had relied upon in criticizing the bill testified last week that 
with the amendments we have proposed, the bill is indeed now 
lawful and constitutional.

	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if rhetoric were dollars, the Liberals would not have a 
deficit.
<P>
	For two years the government has said that it cancelled the 
Pearson contract because, in the words of the former Liberal 
Minister of Transport, it was the biggest rip-off in Canadian 
history. Now the justice department is trying to defend the 
government in one of its several lawsuits by claiming the contract 
was so bad for developers that they would have lost millions.
<P>
	Will the minister please tell this House which of these two 
claims he wishes to retract: the one used to cancel the contract, or 
the one now being used to defend the government? It is impossible 
for both positions to be true.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if the concern my friend has is not 
for constitutionality but for consistency, then perhaps he can begin 
by explaining how it is that his colleague at this end of the bench 
asked me 10 minutes ago how could I dare countenance the 
payment of money to a claimant in an action against the crown and 
now he seems to be suggesting that instead of passing Bill C-28 we

conclude that never, and in no way during the 1993 election 
campaign did he make inquiries of journalists concerning the 
Airbus affair and the role former Prime Minister Mulroney is 
alleged to have played. I am therefore speaking about discussions 
or inquiries made of journalists before being appointed Minister of 
Justice.

he wants in his question. I will confine myself to facts in my 
response.
<P>
	The facts of the matter are clear. They are on the record. I was 
approached by a journalist who fixed me with knowledge of 
allegations of what constituted serious wrongdoing if they were 
true. I then sought the advice of my deputy minister and of the 
solicitor general. I think I did what every member of the House 
would expect the Minister of Justice to do.
<P>
	It is a matter of simple principle. If you are fixed with that kind 
of allegation of wrongdoing and take the advice of your deputy and 
the solicitor general, you communicate the information to the 
Royal Canadian Mounted Police and let them do with it what they 
want. If I had not done that, I can just imagine the yowls of protest 
from the parties opposite. In this matter, I did the right thing.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Colleagues, the questions that are being posed 
should go to the administrative responsibility of the ministers or 
the government at the time that they were in government.

with those matters rather than things that happened before someone 
came into a particular position of responsibility.

	<B>Hon. Fred Mifflin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I will tell the hon. member what I have told him and 
other members of his party time and time again. I will say one more 
time that the first priority for salmon fishing is conservation or 
escapement. Second is the aboriginal fishery. Third is recreational 
and commercial fishing. This is constitutional and in accordance 
with government policy, It is in accordance with the aboriginal 
fishery strategy and every law the country has ever made. I cannot 
put it any more clearly.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I could not 
agree more with the minister.
<P>
	The fact is that after section 35, the minister and his government 
have inserted another fishery, an aboriginal only commercial 
fishery. That fishery has no basis in the Constitution. In the 
Sparrow decision it was rejected or the idea of a commercial 
fishery was not addressed. In the most recent decision by the 
Supreme Court of Canada, the court declared that natives had a 
right to fish for food, ceremonial and religious purposes. There was 
no mention whatsoever of a commercial fishery.

few days ago we lost one of the longest serving members of this 
place. Mr. Hees served with great distinction as a member of 
Parliament for 37 years.
<P>
	Mr. Hees had a very distinguished career. He also had a full life, 
full of brightness and joy. He was kind enough to share his 
unlimited talents with Canadians.
<P>
	Mr. Hees studied and graduated from the University of Toronto. 
He also studied at Cambridge in England. He was an athlete who 
played for the Toronto Argonauts and had the privilege of being on 
a Grey Cup winning team.
<P>
	He served in the Canadian Armed Forces in the second world 
war as a brigade major in the Fifth Infantry Brigade. He was 
wounded and returned home in 1945. One of his good friends at the 
service in his honour mentioned a typical Hees story regarding his 
return to Canada. He came home, the dashing war hero with his 
arm in a sling, and enjoyed the attention he received everywhere he 
went, at receptions and elsewhere. The friend told the story of one 
evening Mr. Hees returned home after one those receptions with the 
wrong arm in the sling.
<P>
	Mr. Hees then went on to take an interest in public life. He ran 
unsuccessfully for the House of Commons in 1945, but was elected 
in 1950. He subsequently became president of the Progressive 
Conservative Party of Canada in the years that preceded the 
election of the Diefenbaker minority government in 1957, and the 
majority government in 1958.
<P>
<B>(1505 )</B>
<P>
	In the Diefenbaker government he was appointed minister of 
transport and served with great distinction in that portfolio. He 
went on to the department of trade and commerce and is 
remembered with a great deal of fondness by those who worked 
with him at that time.
<P>
	Mr. Hees was an unabashed cheerleader of Canada. He was a 
supporter of his officials and his department and could be a 
fantastic person for whom to work. Those people who worked with 
him in the department at the time remember the presence of this 
minister who demonstrated that, yes, a minister can make a 
substantial difference within a single department.
<P>
	Under his leadership in trade and commerce, the department 
went on to promote trade with other countries and it did this with an 
unprecedented level of success.

	Mr. Hees left politics in 1963. This was a difficult time, as some 
members will remember, for the government of  Mr. Diefenbaker. 
Mr. Hees, at the time, chose to retire from active politics. He went 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3929"> 3929 </A></B>
<P>
on to become president of the Montreal Stock Exchange. He, who 
had been from Toronto, was now living in Montreal. He also did 
very well in that responsibility.
<P>
	He returned to active politics in 1965 and was re-elected. He 
then went on to serve until he was again named to cabinet in 1984 
in the government of Brian Mulroney. This time he was appointed 
minister of veterans affairs. Of all the accomplishments of his life, 
at no point did Mr. Hees distinguish himself more than in that 
portfolio. To this day people who work in that department, who I 
know and see from time to time, and veterans, remember him very 
fondly.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, you may remember the VIP program that he 
extended to 10,000 veterans at the time. Mr. Hees, at every 
opportunity, used to say to people when he was minister of veterans 
affairs, how every Canadian was a special person. He would pause 
and remind us that those who had served in those extraordinary 
circumstances were, in his mind, exceptionally important to the 
country. He is still very fondly remembered for what he did for 
each and every one of them.
<P>
	Mr. Hees served until 1988 when he decided not to run again and 
was named an ambassador. He is also remembered fondly for some 
of the work he did in that capacity.
<P>
	I have a personal story to tell from the first cabinet meeting that I 
ever attended. I do not think I am sharing any great secret here. As 
we sat around the table on that very first day, the prime minister 
reminded us that two people there, who because of their ages could 
not get into the Senate. Of course I was under 30 years old and Mr. 
Hees was over 75. Mr. Hees' reply was: ``At least in Charest's case 
it can be fixed''.
<P>
	Mr. Hees also had a great deal of enthusiasm for his country and 
his fellow citizens. What impressed me the most about him was 
how at ease he was with himself. Here was a man who had a good 
sense of who he was and of the experiences of his life. He was 
extremely generous and shared a great deal. His wife, Mabel, also 
shared his political life. Mibs was her nickname. She was an 
extraordinary person. I want to extend to his three daughters and, as 
well, to all those Canadians who remember Mr. Hees our sincere 
condolences.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Mr. Hees was an alumnus of the Royal Military College 
and-something I would mention in passing as being of interest to 
the people of Quebec-did battle with George Drew here in this 
House to get the Collège militaire royal de Saint-Jean created.
<P>
	I recall that we found, in researching the history of the creation 
of that military college, a House of Commons discussion between 
George Hees and Léon Balcer-the former MP for Trois-Rivières, 
I might point out-in which Mr. Hees defended the idea of creating 
a royal military college in Quebec. He felt, based on his 
experience, that this was extremely important. This was a man with 
a profound sense of what Canada was, and we will miss him.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	To his family, all his friends and those who have had the pleasure 
of working with Mr. Hees, our sincere condolences.
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is with great 
sadness that I learned of the death of my good friend George Hees.
<P>
<B>(1510 )</B>
<P>
	He was a man with whom I had the honour to serve in Parliament 
for 10 years. He represented Toronto Broadview which is the first 
constituency in which I lived when I came to this country and was 
very active in local politics in the east end of Toronto.
<P>
	He had a long and distinguished career. He had great affection 
for Parliament as an institution. He was in the best sense of the 
word a House of Commons man. He was first elected in 1950 and 
saw some very interesting times in Canadian history, as has been 
pointed out by the hon. member for Sherbrooke.
<P>
	Throughout all of the political wars, George Hees was 
unflappable. He was a man of great humour, one who always had a 
spark in his eyes and always had a very benign quip at any 
situation.
<P>
	In fact I remember the regular sparring that went on between 
George Hees and Pierre Trudeau on the floor of the House of 
Commons. These became rituals to which everyone paid attention 
and the Speakers at the time, Speaker Jerome and Speaker Sauvé, 
never had to gavel down members because everyone hushed to see 
who would get the better of the argument. While I have tremendous 
respect for Pierre Trudeau, my former leader, I have to admit that 
George got the better of Pierre Trudeau many, many times because 
he was quick on his feet, he had a great sense of wit and a great 
sense of history and was able to duel verbally with the prime 
minister of the time.
<P>
	As has been pointed out, he spent his career in three different 
fields. He was a parliamentarian, he was a soldier and he was a 
sportsman. The young George Hees was a great athletic specimen. 
He played in the Grey Cup and won with the Toronto Argonauts in 
1938. We could certainly use George Hees today. We could have 
used him the last 20 or 30 years, given the problems we have had 
with our football team. George was there in the days when the Grey 
Cup was very much a passion within Canada and certainly within 
Toronto and contributed much to sports excellence, not only as a 
professional football player but in other fields.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3930"> 3930 </A></B>
<P>
	As a soldier he was one who was prepared to make the ultimate 
sacrifice. He was wounded at the battle of the Schelde and he 
carried those wounds with him until his death.
<P>
	He was a man who I think could be best remembered for his 
service as a minister of veterans affairs because he had great 
empathy with those people. He believed that the veterans from the 
first and second world wars were the greatest of Canadians of our 
generation because these were people who fought for democracy, 
fought for liberty but also had to fight for economic survival in the 
depression. These were people who knew that what hard times 
were but these were people who knew after the war that we had to 
build a new society. He felt that they understood the true meaning 
in the Canadian experience, the kind of just society that we had to 
fight to preserve and the just society that we had to build for the 
newer generation, like myself and others who are younger.
<P>
	As I said, he was a man of great humour. He was a man who I 
understand at the opening of the Ottawa airport terminal in 1962, 
when he was minister, was waiting to speak and the Royal 
Canadian Air Force did a fly past and they flew pretty close to the 
terminal and all the windows broke. That did not put George Hees 
off. He just went along with his speech in the unflappable, 
dedicated way that we knew of him.
<P>
	His wife, Mabel, was one who garnered great affection in 
Parliament. She was always with him. She was always supportive. 
Like George she was a genuinely nice person.
<P>
	If those of us who serve in the House today could only have a 
small percentage of the qualities of George Hees, then I think that 
we could say that we were good parliamentarians.
<P>
	On behalf of the Prime Minister and the government I wish to 
extend our sincere condolences to his daughters and to the rest of 
his family. We have truly witnessed the passing of a great 
parliamentarian, a great soldier and a great man.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to add my voice to those of the representatives of the other 
parties, expressing my most sincere condolences, and those of my 
colleagues, to Mrs. Hees and their three daughters. I would like to 
take a few moments for some memories of Mr. Hees.
<P>
<B>(1515)</B>
<P>
	Mr. Hees was a great sportsman, an exceptional parliamentarian 
and a career soldier, as well as a minister known for his great 
efficiency. He was also known in Quebec, more than any other 
anglophone minister of his day, for having been one of the directors 
of the Montreal International Expo, during the brief hiatus he took 
in 1963 in his political career, as well as president of the Montreal 
stock exchange. We also know how involved he  was in working for 
the creation of the Collège militaire de Saint-Jean. In all, a 
politician acknowledged by Quebec as having been a good 
spokesperson for its interests.
<P>
	As well, he was one of the few politicians to have been a minister 
in two governments, 20 years apart. He was a minister under 
Diefenbaker and again in the last Mulroney government.
<P>
	His work on behalf of war veterans is acknowledged in every 
Canadian Legion, as well as throughout the world. He has been 
held up often as an example of support, not only moral support but 
also concrete action, on behalf of veterans, and for gaining 
recognition of their true value to society.
<P>
	I had the honour of getting to know him personally, particularly 
from 1984 on. At the Conservative candidates' school prior to the 
September 1984 election, when I spent three days in Ottawa in the 
month of August, one of the lecturers was Mr. Hees himself. He 
spoke glowingly of his methods for getting elected every time, of 
how he did his door to door campaigning. I was very much struck 
by his way of reaching out to people and his contagious good 
humour.
<P>
	This man was an exceptional communicator, as well as a great 
perfectionist in everything he did. He was characterized by his 
extreme respect for his colleagues and a most exceptional sense of 
team work.
<P>
	We have lost a great democrat. We would like to express our 
most sincere condolences to his widow and their three daughters, 
and our sincere appreciation for all that he has contributed to 
democracy in Canada and Quebec.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to make a few comments on behalf of the Reform Party of 
Canada. I extend our sincere condolences to George Hees' 
daughters, his grandchildren, his great grandchild and to the many 
friends I am sure he has built up over the generations.
<P>
	George's service to his country was automatic, whether it was 
serving the country during World War II or whether it was serving 
in the House as he did for nearly four decades.
<P>
	George Hees was first elected in a 1950 byelection and won 
every election from then on until his retirement in 1988 with the 
exception of the 1963 election. Imagine running and winning every 
single time. That is an amazing legacy in itself.
<P>
	He served in the cabinets of John Diefenbaker and Brian 
Mulroney. He proved to be a very capable and effective minister 
and administrator.
<P>
	In 1988, after his retirement, he was named Prime Minister 
Mulroney's personal advisor and ambassador at large, overseeing 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3931"> 3931 </A></B>
<P>
the transportation, storage and  distribution of Canada's food aid 
programs in the third world.
<P>
	Although he was offered a Senate appointment several times, he 
always declined. That is something which is very remarkable. Even 
though he was offered a no-cut contract, he always declined 
because he thought there were other things he could be doing.
<P>
	Mr. Hees was popular and respected by members of all political 
parties. When he retired from the House he said that serving in the 
House of Commons is the finest profession any Canadian could 
have because of the association with MPs from all parties and that 
everyone is here because they are trying to do a job for the people 
of Canada. That is really noble. It is certainly the reason we are all 
here.
<P>
	I am very fortunate in that one of my staff members worked for 
George Hees for some time. When he retired in 1988 I was able to 
hire her when I first came here in 1989. I spoke with her on the 
phone this morning for a short while: ``Jenny, what do you 
remember about George Hees?'' She said: ``He was sure good to 
work for''. A personal testimonial like that is worth a million 
dollars. She said he was charming and that everybody knew him as 
George. If he was on the street in Northumberland in his home area 
people would walk up to him and say: ``Hi, George. How are you?'' 
He was theirs. They did not address him very formally because he 
was just one of them. They appreciated him as George.
<P>
<B>(1520)</B>
<P>
	He retired in 1988 but left an amazing legacy, serving as a senior 
minister. One thing I was really impressed with was that he was 
very frugal. He did not think it was appropriate to just ring up 
taxpayer dollars for all kinds of things.
<P>
	One example is that when he moved into one office the carpet 
was fairly well worn. He said: ``We do not have the money right 
now to replace this carpet''. So there it stayed. It got older and 
more and more frayed. Finally when the day came to replace the 
carpet and the workers came to clear the old carpet out, they 
thought it should go to the museum because it looked that old and 
would be a great piece for the museum.
<P>
	That philosophy of serving people was the essence of George 
Hees. He never forgot why he was here and what he was fighting 
for. Although he is no longer with us, I am sure his legacy will live 
on in the House and in minds and hearts of the Canadian people.
<P>
	On behalf of the Reform Party, we send our condolences to his 
family and say a personal thank you, George, for all you did for us.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Christine Stewart (Secretary of State (Latin America 
and Africa), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is not possible to express a 
tribute in the House on the sad passing of George Hees without 
bringing words of condolence and respect from my constituents in 
Northumberland.
<P>
	To this day Northumberland thinks of George Hees with great 
pride for the 23 years he so ably served the constituents of the 
riding of Northumberland. The tenacity and hard work of George 
Hees and his inherent sense of politics earned him the support of 
his Northumberland constituents for a period of 23 years.
<P>
	As we have heard, throughout his military and political careers 
George Hees served Canada and his constituents beyond the call of 
duty. He was a devoted parliamentarian and a person who believed 
in the great potential of Canada and Canadians.
<P>
	As Mr. Hees' successor in the riding of Northumberland, I can 
attest to the fact that he was well loved throughout the riding. He 
was respected and admired on a non-partisan basis. He was a true 
gentleman. His legacy in the region is alive and well. Around 
Northumberland there still abound everyone's favourite George 
Hees stories.
<P>
	One of mine remains his comment to me the night before my 
first election. He said he felt I had run a very good campaign. I do 
not know if at that time he imagined I would win that election 
campaign by a resounding 27 votes, but I can say that my success 
on that campaign of 1988 in large part was due to the fact that as a 
campaigner one did not forget to speak of George Hees with great 
respect and admiration.
<P>
	In Northumberland we are very proud of George Hees and the 
way he represented us. My heartfelt condolences and sympathy go 
out to his family and all the many friends of George Hees.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
behalf of the New Democrats in the House today I join with my 
colleagues to pay tribute to George Hees, honouring his long record 
of public service, military service and parliamentary service.
<P>
	I had the opportunity to sit in the House of Commons with Mr. 
Hees for nine years. I echo the comments of the Minister of 
National Defence that George Hees was a House of Commons man 
and someone who gave to this place and to those who came here as 
new members an appropriate sense of the responsibility and also 
the joy and collegiality of being a member of Parliament.
<P>
	I say with some regret that I do not always feel the House is as 
collegial as it was in previous Parliaments or as George Hees would 
have liked it to continue to be.
<P>
	I was here for some of the exchanges between George Hees and 
former Prime Minister Trudeau. I remember very well the day 
when he stepped out and raised his dukes, so to speak, and 
challenged the Prime Minister in a kidding sort of way that perhaps 
they could settle the matter outside.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>

<B><A NAME="3932"> 3932 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1525)</B>
<P>
	I remember very well his daily walks. I used to run into him near 
the flame and elsewhere because I have the habit of going for a 
walk myself. Many times I had the opportunity to have informal 
conversations with Mr. Hees and I came to like him very much.
<P>
	I swam at the Chateau Laurier and I used to talk to him there. He 
was just that kind of person you could get to know. He was as very 
interested in younger people who had been elected to Parliament. 
He would give you a bit of the history of this place and get you to 
have the right feel for your job.
<P>
	An article in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> this morning entitled ``Lives 
Lived'' was about George Hees. For the record, because I know he 
would not want the memory of another happy warrior in this place 
to be misreported, when he beat Pauline Jewett in 1965 she was not 
a Socialist, she was a Liberal. She became a Socialist later when 
she became more successful.
<P>
	When George Hees became the Minister of Veterans Affairs in 
1985 my case work with respect to veterans affairs dropped just 
like that. As Minister of Veterans Affairs he must have told the 
bureaucrats in the civil service: ``Clean up your act. I want you to 
give the benefit of the doubt to veterans. I do not want anymore of 
this stalling and delaying''. It made a real difference. Anybody who 
was a member of Parliament could see it at that time. Your case 
load with respect to veterans affairs literally disappeared overnight 
when George Hees became the Minister of Veterans Affairs. I want 
to pay tribute to that particular element of his career.
<P>
	On behalf of the NDP I extend our condolences to his family. I 
am very sorry on a personal level that he is no longer with us.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leonard Hopkins (Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, George Hees was married on June 30, 1934 to 
Mabel Dunlop of Pembroke, Ontario. Mabs Dunlop, as she was 
known, was the daughter of A.E. Dunlop, the provincial treasurer 
in the Conservative government in Ontario for many years. George 
was very proud to have married into that family. The Hon. A.E. 
Dunlop, the former treasurer of Ontario, died earlier that year just 
before George and Mabs were married.
<P>
	As Minister of Veterans Affairs, the Hon. George Hees invited 
me and others in the House at the time to the 45th anniversary of 
the Dieppe raid. I can recall how emotional he was at times during 
that visit. He did a great job for Canada as a spokesperson, as one to 
represent the veterans, and we had many cenotaph ceremonies 
remembering those who died at the battle of Dieppe.
<P>
	As veterans affairs minister George Hees was very personal, 
very in depth and had a great empathy for his job. All veterans got 
the benefit of the doubt when they asked George Hees to look into a 
case.
<P>
	One of the reasons George Hees lived from 1910 until 1996 was 
that he was a great believer in physical exercise, as mentioned by a 
previous speaker. He was always out doing his thing early in the 
morning and even in the evenings. Besides being a great person in 
phys-ed, he was never at a loss for words either.
<P>
	He was first elected in 1950 and then re-elected in 1953, 1957, 
1958 and 1962. He did not run in 1963. He came back into the 
House in 1965, when I was first elected. He was in the House for 
the next 23 years after that.
<P>
<B>(1530 )</B>
<P>
	Of interest, I believe nearly all of the ministers from the Ontario 
cabinet came to Pembroke for his father-in-law's funeral in 1934.
<P>
	George was a hail fellow well met. When we came back from the 
the 45th anniversary of the Dieppe raid, I delivered a statement in 
the House praising George Hees and thanking him for doing such a 
fine job in leading that delegation to that very important memorial. 
I recall at the time Mary Collins from Vancouver sent me a kind 
note across the House thanking me for saying something nice about 
George Hees because in those days not very many people said nice 
things about anybody. Nevertheless he was a tremendous fellow.
<P>
	I have one last comment with respect to George's in-laws. It is of 
interest to note that Paul Martin Senior first ran in the old Renfrew 
North provincial riding against A.E. Dunlop who was George's 
father-in-law. The most interesting part of that story is that Paul 
Martin Senior's father worked in the lumber yard for A.E. Dunlop 
and his son was running against A.E. Dunlop in the provincial 
election. That created a little interest. George was always one to tell 
a lot of stories of his background.
<P>
	Today we are really celebrating the life of a person who spent 35 
years of elected service in this House of Commons. As the 
representative for Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke, I extend to 
George's family and all his relatives and friends sincere 
condolences from Lois and me today.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> In conclusion I thank all the 
members who participated during the past half hour in the tribute to 
the late George Hees.

compensation to public safety officers who lost their lives while on

<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I am honoured and pleased together with 
the hon. member for Mississauga East to introduce this bill to the 
House today, to establish a registered charitable trust fund for the 
benefit of families of police and firefighters killed in the line of 
duty.
<P>
	The fund will be administered by an independent board and will 
be set up to receive such money as appropriated to it by Parliament, 
or a legislature of a province, or as received by gift or bequest.
<P>
	Canadians are aware of the daily risks that face our police and 
firefighters as they serve our emergent needs. When one of them 
loses their life in the line of duty, all of us mourn that loss. This 
fund would be a tangible way for Canadians to honour their 
courageous service and to assist their loved ones in their time of 
need.
<P>
	I therefore hope my bill will have the strong support of all hon.

<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Anderson (for Minister of Finance, Lib.)</B> moved that the 
bill be read a third time and passed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak today on third 
reading of Bill C-36, the 1995 budget tax measures bill.
<P>
	As hon. members will recall, that budget focused not only on 
cutting program spending, it also focused on tax fairness which 
remains a priority of the government.
<P>
	On the spending reduction side, for the three year period on 
which last year's budget focused, 1995-96 to 1997-98, there were 
almost $7 in spending cuts for every $1 in new taxes. Spending 
reductions for this three year period totalled $25.3 billion with the 
burden being shared.
<P>
	On the tax fairness side, in the 1995 budget we introduced 
several tax measures which are all based on the principle of 
fairness and equity in the tax system. These measures accomplish a 
tightening of the administration of the tax system, a removal or 
reduction in a number of tax preferences, and an increase in 
fairness in the system.
<P>
	Since the time of the 1995 budget announcement the government 
has responded to the concerns of Canadians and members of the 
House about the impact of some of these measures, and changes 
have been made. The government believes in consulting with 
Canadians and taking action in response where it is warranted. I 
want to briefly highlight now some of the main measures of this 
bill reflecting that input.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3936"> 3936 </A></B>
<P>
	The government believes tax assistance should be provided to 
Canadians to encourage them to save for retirement and that the 
fiscal cost of this tax assistance should be shared fairly. Changes 
in Bill C-36 help to achieve this. Under this bill the contribution 
limits for registered retirement savings plans and money purchase 
registered pension plans are being reduced to $13,500 this year. 
They will rise incrementally to $15,500 in 1999 and 1998 
respectively. The 1996 budget subsequently froze these limits at 
$13,500 for another six years. These additional limits will be dealt 
with in legislation to be introduced at a later time.
<P>
	Bill C-36 also reduces the over contribution allowance to RRSPs 
from $8,000 to $2,000. Originally intended to help taxpayers who 
inadvertently make an over contribution error, this measure will 
now restrict those taxpayers who took advantage and made 
deliberate over contributions. However, over contributions made 
before budget day are excluded from this penalty.
<P>
	In addition, Bill C-36 gradually eliminates the tax free transfer 
of retiring allowances to RRSPs. Given other changes in the 
retirement savings system, this measure has outlived its usefulness.
<P>
	Another area affected by the bill is family trusts. As hon. 
members know, this has been an area of concern to many 
Canadians. In the 1994 budget the Minister of Finance referred the 
taxation of family trusts to the finance committee to review, among 
other things, the election to defer the 21 year deemed disposition 
rule allowed by the previous government. To ensure that capital 
property cannot be held for the benefit of successive generations of 
trust beneficiaries without tax consequences arising on death, there 
is a deemed disposition of a trust's capital property every 21 years. 
The previous government had changed this to allow for the first 21 
year deemed disposition date to be deferred until the death of 
beneficiaries who are no more than one generation away from the 
settlor.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	Bill C-36 contains two measures that affect the tax regimes of 
these family trusts. One deals with the undue deferral of capital 
gains. The other affects the splitting of trust income because of the 
preferred beneficiary election.
<P>
	The preferred beneficiary election allows trust income for 
income tax purposes to be allocated to preferred beneficiaries 
without any requirement that the beneficiaries actually receive the 
amount allocated. Bill C-36 limits the preferred beneficiary 
election to disabled beneficiaries. This will ensure trust income 
cannot be arbitrarily allocated to a beneficiary instead of being 
taxed at the trust level just because the beneficiary is at a low 
marginal tax rate.
<P>
	Bill C-36 also eliminates the election to defer the 21 year rule. 
This measure removes the possibility of this  election causing the 
undue deferral of capital gains. It also addresses the perception that 
family trusts are some sort of tax shelter.
<P>
	Trusts for which an election to defer the 21 year rule has already 
been made will be subject to a deemed disposition of trust assets at 
fair market value on January 1, 1999.
<P>
	The 1995 budget increased the corporate surtax from 3 per cent 
to 4 per cent of basic federal income tax. As a result, additional 
corporate revenues of $115 million to $120 million annually should 
be generated.
<P>
	In addition, the large corporations tax, which applies to all 
corporations with over $10 million in capital, is being raised from 
0.2 per cent to 0.225 per cent. An extra $150 million a year in 
corporate revenues is anticipated from this measure.
<P>
	Further, this bill includes a temporary surcharge of 12 per cent, 
levied under part VI of the Income Tax Act, on the capital tax paid 
by banks and other large deposit taking institutions between 
February 26, 1995 and October 31, 1996. These measures ensure 
these institutions contribute to deficit reduction.
<P>
	As hon. members will know, the surcharge was extended for 
another year in the 1996 budget. Again, this will be dealt with in 
legislation to be discussed in the House at some time in the future.
<P>
	Finally, an additional six and two-thirds per cent tax on the 
investment income of Canadian controlled private corporations 
will reduce their tax deferral opportunity.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In that regard, allow me to stress that Bill C-36 ends the tax 
deferral on business income.
<P>
	While businesses could previously choose the date on which 
their fiscal year ended, December 31 will now be the date set as the 
end of the fiscal year for all businesses.
<P>
	However, the government received a number of comments on 
this provision, and some amendments were made in order to 
address the concerns expressed by some businesses regarding, 
among other things, seasonal activities.
<P>
	A special ``alternative'' method of calculating income will now 
be available to some businesses that prefer an off-calendar fiscal 
period.
<P>
	These taxpayers will have to review their income to consider the 
money earned between the end of their fiscal period and the end of 
the calendar year.
<P>
	Bill C-36 also introduces the Canadian film and video tax credit, 
which will directly benefit Canadian film production companies. It 
replaces the outdated capital cost allowance tax shelter, which 
concerned producers of Canadian certified films.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3937"> 3937 </A></B>
<P>
	The film producer will now receive all the benefits from the 
new Canadian film and video tax credit. In addition, the credit will 
be available only to businesses whose main activity is the 
production of Canadian films or videos in Canada. This very 
specific clause should restrict credit applications aimed at 
avoiding taxes on income from other sources.
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Let me move on now to some of the other highlights of the bill. 
Bill C-36 provides special enhanced tax assistance for donations of 
ecologically sensitive land. When certified ecologically sensitive 
land is donated to a charity or municipal body, there will be no 
annual income restrictions on the donor. Currently the limit is 20 
per cent of donor's income.
<P>
	Bill C-36 eliminates the inflation of certain scientific research 
and experimental development measures, SR and ED tax credits, 
and improves that administration of these tax incentives.
<P>
	There will be restrictions on the expenditures on which SR and 
ED investment tax credits can be earned, and non-profit SR and ED 
corporations exempt from tax will now have to report their SR and 
ED work and expenditures.
<P>
	Another measure in the bill protects the collection of source 
deductions by making secured creditors who interfere with the 
remittance of source deductions liable for remittance along with 
any interest and penalty charges, just as the taxpayer is liable.
<P>
	As a result of Bill C-36, seniors with incomes over $53,215 who 
have to pay back some of their old age security benefits at tax filing 
time will now have tax withheld when benefits are being paid out.
<P>
	Finally, Revenue Canada will be extending the use of the 
business number, that is the one registration number for business 
dealings with government, to other departments and levels of 
government that have a legal right to this information. This will 
reduce overlap and duplication and increase efficiency for both 
business and government.
<P>
	I have summarized the highlights of Bill C-36. It contains 
straightforward tax measures that exemplify the government's 
commitment to fairness and equity in the tax system. I am also 
pleased the bill as it has now emerged reflects the input of 
Canadians and hon. members to which we have responded.
<P>
	I thank hon. members for their assistance through all stages of 
the bill. I strongly urge my colleagues to pass Bill C-36.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to take part in the debate at third  reading of 
Bill C-36, which primarily seeks to implement measures proposed 
in the 1995 budget, along with some from the 1996 budget.
<P>
	As is its habit with the majority of bills, the government included 
a series of scattered and ill-assorted measures in the same bill. Of 
course, there are some positive things in Bill C-36, including the 
provisions on tax deferral, gifts of ecologically sensitive land, 
business number and, in particular, the film tax credit, which we 
strongly supported during the proceedings of the finance 
committee, since it will benefit the whole industry.
<P>
	The problem with Bill C-36 is that, in spite of these positive 
measures, the government, true to form, introduces a few measures 
that are particularly harmful or not very meaningful, but all tied up 
in pink ribbon.
<P>
	Remember when the Minister of Finance delivered his budget 
speech and told us that, yes, the government had heard the plea 
made by the official opposition and that it would reform family 
trusts. The official opposition went through three different states of 
mind. First, we were pleased because, at last, the government was 
listening to us and would reform a totally unfair program. Second, 
we were disappointed, because the reform would only be 
implemented as of 1999.
<P>
	So, although some positive action was to be taken to correct the 
unfairness resulting from family trusts, the government was giving 
until 1999 to those who benefit from this program to transfer their 
assets into other tax planning vehicles which will be just as 
effective in terms of avoiding the payment of taxes.
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	I would like to take a look at two measures in the bill, the one 
involving family trusts, of course, with a recent example to 
illustrate my point, the one brought up by the auditor general, and I 
will conclude with the positive measure in Bill C-36 regarding film 
tax credits.
<P>
	First, I will look at family trusts. As I mentioned, we had been 
waiting a long time for this measure and the government 
disappointed us. Why were we disappointed? As early as the 1993 
election campaign, the official opposition, the Bloc Quebecois, 
pointed out the problem with the family trust system. We had two 
goals in mind: the first was to show, using this example, that there 
was a problem with the Canadian tax system, that it was in need of 
reform, not tinkering, but heavy duty reform.
<P>
	Our second goal was to show that there were people in Canada 
who were not paying their share, and that these people were not the 
poorest, nor are they today, but the richest. The people who have 
been able to use this family trust provision are not in the average 
income bracket, they are not people earning under $200,000 a year, 
or people earning $35,000. For the most part, those using family 
trusts as a tax planning tool are the rich and the ultra rich.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3938"> 3938 </A></B>
<P>
	What was the government's response? First it said: ``We will 
reinstate the 21 year rule''. What is the 21 year rule? The answer 
is very simple. The Conservatives, preceding the present 
government, had changed this rule, which had existed previously 
and which provided that, at the end of the 21st year of a family 
trust, the trustees had to realize their assets, in other words, 
estimate their assets and pay the capital gains accumulated over 
the 21 years.
<P>
	The Conservatives changed this rule so that the capital gains tax 
payable could be carried forward until the death of the last 
beneficiary. Therefore, if the trust beneficiary lived to age 80, no 
capital gains tax was paid for 80 years.
<P>
	This was really unfair, unfair to everyone. What we wanted was 
not just a return to the 21 year rule, as Bill C-36 proposes, but a 
review of all family trusts and not just the 21 year rule, because, 
with spreading tax over 21 years, let me tell you a tax dollar in the 
first year will not be worth the same as a tax dollar in the 21st year. 
We are already questioning the rule underlying this 21 year rule, 
never mind the 80 year rule.
<P>
	Second, not only during the 1993 election campaign, but at every 
opportunity in the deliberations of the Standing Committee on 
Finance, the official opposition called for an in-depth review of the 
Canadian tax system so that family trusts, in combination with 
other provisions of the Income Tax Act, foreign tax conventions 
and so on, could not provide an excuse for rich Canadian families 
to avoid paying their due to Revenue Canada.
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	The government did not listen to us. Instead, it introduced Bill 
C-36, which sets out slightly better realization of assets rules for 
family trusts by reducing the time period from about 80 years to 21 
years. But what we need is a comprehensive review, not only of 
family trusts, but also of the Income Tax Act, of some general tax 
provisions and of international conventions.
<P>
	We must ensure that each of these scattered provisions no longer 
allow the wealthiest Canadian families to avoid paying taxes to the 
federal government.
<P>
	To illustrate what the official opposition has been contending for 
almost two and a half years about family trusts and the need for a 
comprehensive review of the tax system, in his recent report, tabled 
on May 7, the Auditor General of Canada brought to light 
something we had been suspecting for a long time, a problem we 
had been raising almost every day in this House, at the Standing 
Committee on Finance and at the Standing Committee on Public 
Accounts presided by my hon. colleague from 
Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans.
<P>
	In his report, the auditor general reveals that, in December 1991, 
a family trust holder had transferred to the United States $2 billion 
in assets without paying a cent in taxes. This transaction took place 
in 1991, the  whole process, all the regulations and the analysis that 
made it possible to transfer billions of dollars to the U.S. tax free 
only came to light in March and in May of this year, when the 
auditor general blew the whistle on this.
<P>
	How could the transfer of $2 billion be pulled off? Exactly the 
way we said it could be done every time we stood in this House to 
question the Minister of Finance on family trusts. By using the 
family trust provisions. By using the capital gains provisions of the 
Income Tax Act. By using the lack of clarity of the non-resident 
provisions of the Income Tax Act. And fifth, by using the tax 
convention between Canada and the United States.
<P>
	It was a mix of all that and, to be able to afford mixing all that, 
you have to be a millionaire. Do you know why? Because you 
would have to hire the top tax experts in Canada to know how to 
use all these tax rules, how to use the family trust scheme, and to be 
on top of the latest decisions or the latest analyses made by 
Revenue Canada. What the auditor general tells us clearly 
illustrates what we have been saying ever since we were elected to 
this House. A Canadian resident was able to transfer $2 billion in 
assets to the U.S. without having to pay a penny in taxes now or in 
the future.
<P>
	This case did so much to illustrate the shortcomings of the tax 
system, as well as the relationship between the system and the great 
tax experts representing the families of Canadian millionaires and 
billionaires, that, after the auditor general published his report, the 
federal government felt it had to try to suppress this affair.
<P>
	This shows two things. First, that there is no political will on the 
other side to really correct the deficiencies of the tax system, in 
particular the links between family trusts, tax agreements and the 
tax system in general; and second, that the government has things 
to hide.
<P>
	Why do I say this? Because, if they wanted to correct the 
situation, I feel they should go beyond the little provision on family 
trusts in Bill C-36, which provides for two minor measures, by first 
getting to the bottom of these family trusts that were transferred to 
the U.S. A $2 billion trust means that someone got to keep a lot of 
money without paying any taxes on it. They should first get to the 
bottom of this and then quickly review the whole tax system openly 
and publicly, instead of behind closed doors.
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	There has been a slight improvement compared to what the 
Minister of Finance announced in his last budget. Although the 
group still consists of eight experts behind closed doors, it has to 
report to the Standing Committee on Finance at every step in the 
review of business taxes in particular. This is already a slight 
improvement but, as I will show you a little later, we must be 
vigilant, as there is no political will to review any part of a system 
that benefits those close to power, not to mention those in power.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3939"> 3939 </A></B>
<P>
	Why do I deplore the government's record in this regard? Let 
me explain. In the days that followed the release, on May 7, of 
the auditor general's report on family trusts, the Standing 
Committee on Public Accounts received, as usual, that report. I 
should point out that the committee is chaired by the hon. member 
for Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans and that another eminent 
member is the hon. member for Trois-Rivières. Normally, the 
committee analyses the report from A to Z.
<P>
	When the time came to look at chapter I, in which was 
mentioned the $2 billion scandal involving family trusts to which I 
just referred, the Liberal member for Brome-Missisquoi, the 
brother of the other one, said: ``We must analyze this case urgently. 
This is one of the worst scandals''. The member even conducted 
two major communication operations. He came out and made a 
statement before radio and television reporters, saying there was a 
scandal and that we had to shed light on the issue, because the 
whole thing was very mysterious.
<P>
	The member even wrote a press release from his office that said 
exactly the same thing. There was scandal behind this. Family 
trusts and the whole tax policy had to be reviewed and, in 
particular, we had to shed light on the tax free transfer of $2 billion 
in trust to the United States, thanks to existing loopholes.
<P>
	The member's determination to go to the bottom of things did 
not last two days. As soon as we heard a rumour to the effect that a 
very rich Canadian family might be involved and that, if we went 
back to before the 1991 decision made by the Conservatives, we 
might discover some Liberal involvement, there was a complete 
change of attitude. We did not see the member Brome-Missisquoi 
for over a week. He was very busy with the committee, we were 
told.
<P>
	During this time, the government launched into a rather 
impressive cover-up. The mandate, which would normally lie with 
the public accounts committee, which can act as a true commission 
of inquiry, was transferred. This committee has all the powers to 
act as a commission of inquiry, and it has the mandate to do so 
based on the auditor general's report. Only chapter I was 
transferred, not the entire report of the auditor general in which he 
puts his finger on the scandal of the billions of dollars that are 
being moved tax free out of the country to the United States.
<P>
	The mandate of the finance committee can pretty much be 
summed up as analysing fiscal policy in a general manner, with a 
particular emphasis on policy with respect to residents and 
non-residents, so that things which took place in the past will not 
happen again in the future. That is the mandate of the finance 
committee.
<P>
	If we listen to the government, we will never get to the bottom of 
the 1991 scandal. And the reason is because the system in 
place-we saw it last week-is being perpetuated by eminent tax 
experts-because only experts can understand the ins and outs of 
the tax system-who work hand in hand with Revenue Canada, and 
its senior officials, deputy ministers, assistant deputy ministers and 
senior analysts, in order to benefit a handful of privileged people, a 
handful of insiders.
<P>
	In the United States, it is a serious crime to be an insider; almost 
as serious as first degree murder. Today, as we are seeing, the 
auditor general is casting light on some things.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	He speaks of a process in which most of the deck is missing, 
nearly 95 per cent of the information is lacking. He tells us that, 
from one week to the next, there has been a total change of 
direction in the interpretation of taxation laws, which resulted in 
the transfer of two billion dollars to the US tax free. It started as a 
refusal by Revenue Canada, followed by pressures on the 
Department of Finance from who knows what quarter, and moved 
on to a final decision allowing this transfer of a trust to the U.S. 
without paying any tax.
<P>
	A situation like this is worrisome, and the reason why a bill like 
C-36, which does contain some good measures, but clouds the issue 
of family trusts, as they are attempting to do with chapter 1 of the 
auditor general's report, is no longer workable.
<P>
	Despite my tender years, I have followed the debates in the 
House, particularly on public finances, the auditor general, public 
accounts, even the business of the House. I must admit that I have 
never seen a situation like the one that has existed for the past 
month or so, in which government members, members of the 
finance committee, are attempting to run down the auditor general, 
to attack his attitude.
<P>
	The auditor general is the most respected and respectable man in 
the senior public service. Why is that? Because he is answerable to 
Parliament. He comes and reports to Parliament on behalf of the 
departments on the good or poor management of public funds. He 
also forces public servants to be accountable. Now, we have just 
been told-I heard it from the very mouth of the Chair of the 
finance committee-that the auditor general may have erred 
slightly. The Liberal members of the finance committee questioned 
the auditor general very closely, not to cast some light on the 
situation or on certain particularly complex points of taxation law 
relating to family trusts, but to trip up the auditor general.
<P>
	For those who are still interested in this matter, and I believe 
growing numbers are, because people have had enough of this 
business of golfing buddies going off to Florida together-last 
week, the committee heard six taxation specialists on the matter of 
family trusts, which ought to be our primary concern in Bill C-36. 
Of the six, one expert was invited by the official opposition, and 
another by the second opposition party.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3940"> 3940 </A></B>
<P>
	Believe it or not, the four tax experts invited by the government 
went round the table sometime in the middle of the evening to 
explain their analysis of the case criticized by the auditor general 
and of the whole system known as the advance rulings system at 
Revenue Canada, which provides analyses of certain tax 
provisions for taxpayers. The game continued. The tax experts had 
questions about the auditor general's analysis, tax experts who 
revolve around power, the department of revenue, the deputy 
minister of the department of revenue, his principal advisers and 
the advance rulings division, which, in December 1991, made a 
ruling on the transfer of a $2 billion family trust to the United 
States tax free. These are people who also revolve around the 
deputy minister of finance, Mr. Dodge, and Mr. Farber, a special 
adviser, who does more policy making than his minister.
<P>
	Last week we had laid out for us what we have always suspected 
as ordinary taxpayers. There are people who benefit roundly and 
they are not the low, middle or high income folks, but the richest 
Canadians, the millionaires and billionaires represented by these 
tax experts. We saw that the power lies here. The four tax experts 
criticized the man most respected by the federal public service and 
Parliament. These experts, who normally look at us with a certain 
haughtiness and say: ``Look, we understand a very complex tax 
system that you know nothing about. So, please do not ask any 
questions'', were itching to take on the auditor general, so much so 
that we are obliged to provide a clarification.
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	We asked tax experts whether we were right in our analysis of 
the tax provisions that made it possible to transfer $2 billion abroad 
tax free. We did not ask them to express a political opinion and to 
say: ``You should not ask questions about this. The auditor general 
should not have said this''.
<P>
	Mr. Goodman, a renowned tax expert, told us during committee 
proceedings, which were televised: ``These things are too complex. 
The auditor general should never have condemned this. He brought 
discredit on the process leading to Revenue Canada's advance 
rulings, which allows billionaires to transfer their money to the 
U.S. without paying taxes. You are generating-these are his 
words-a siege mentality against Revenue Canada, whose senior 
officials will no longer be willing to make such decisions''.
<P>
	That may turn out to be a good thing, because the $2 billion that 
was transferred to the U.S. represents hundreds of millions of 
dollars in taxes that were not collected here and that the people of 
Quebec and Canada will have to pay for.
<P>
	As I was saying, we have a case that was condemned by Martin 
Leclerc, a well-known journalist with the <I>Journal de Montréal</I>. On 
June 10, Mr. Leclerc wrote: ``They want the auditor general's head 
because he condemned the family trust scandal''. He even said: ``A 
Liberal  member-I will not mention him by name, but he chairs 
the finance committee-is trying to discredit him''.
<P>
	He is trying to discredit the auditor general. It was obvious to 
everyone. At the same time, the sub-heading read something like: 
``Gravelle, Dodge and Farber, three Revenue Canada mandarins 
who are not accountable to anyone, let a billionaire transfer $2 
billion to the U.S. tax free''. We are no longer the only ones to 
notice that tax inequity has been raised to the status of a system and 
may have been for decades.
<P>
	As I said earlier, some of the tax experts who testified before the 
committee last week on the subject of family trusts and who were 
supposed to give us tips on how to plug the loopholes in the tax 
system limited their remarks to putting down the work done by the 
auditor general and criticizing the poor parliamentarians that we 
are for trying to get to the bottom of the process which led to the 
decision made in 1991 to transfer $2 billion, possibly setting a 
precedent allowing hundreds of millions more to be transferred to 
the U.S since. They basically told us: ``Do not ask us any 
questions''.
<P>
	There is a big problem there. Just to give you an idea of how big 
the problem is, when we asked the tax experts before us: ``Were 
you in any way involved with officials or former senior officials 
who may have worked at Revenue Canada or at the Department of 
Finance at one time or another, who may have taken part in the 
analysis that led to the 1991 decision to transfer $2 billion to the 
U.S. tax free or may have known about the ruling made by Revenue 
Canada at the time but not made public until March 1996, this year, 
and could therefore have acted as insiders, making other persons 
benefit from a precedent set in 1991 but that only a handful of 
people knew about?'', these witnesses had nothing to say. And this 
was just one case that was uncovered.
<P>
	There was a tax expert representing Stikeman Elliott, a well 
known firm of tax consultants which provides advice to 
millionaires, billionaires and other very rich people. A Mr. Tilack 
worked until very recently for Revenue Canada's advance income 
tax ruling division, and may have been aware of the decision made 
in 1991 and may have made Stikeman Elliott benefit from it. When 
we asked Mr. Wilkie, who was Stikeman Elliott's representative, if 
he had had contacts with these people, he jokingly said yes, a 
former minister.
<P>
	However, when we mentioned Mr. Tilack's name, Mr. Wilkie 
was no longer laughing. The same thing happened to their financial 
special advisor, Mr. Farber, who was sitting behind and whose face 
looked quite drawn when he left the room.
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
	As we figure out the existing links between some well known tax 
firms and senior public officials, including deputy ministers, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3941"> 3941 </A></B>
<P>
assistant deputy ministers and others from Revenue Canada and the 
finance department, we hurt them a little bit.
<P>
	If we succeeded in breaking this system of privileged contacts 
and anticipated decisions for millionaires and billionaires, these 
firms might make less money than they do now by providing 
precious advice to help rich people avoid paying taxes.
<P>
	They might make less money than they do by giving complex 
advice, such as that which lead to the tax free transfer of $2 billion, 
based on five provisions in the tax conventions signed by Canada 
and the United States. These firms would make less money than 
they currently do if these provisions were understood. They would 
make less money if, as recommended by the auditor general in his 
1992 report, all advance rulings were made public.
<P>
	It is not right that, in the case of the 1991 family trusts, about 
five tax provisions were used; that Parliament was not informed of 
this possibility of transferring funds; that, according to the deputy 
ministers and the assistant deputy ministers, neither Revenue 
Canada nor the Department of Finance deemed worthwhile to 
inform in any way the elected representatives of the day of the tax 
loopholes that allowed for the tax free transfer of $2 billion. There 
is something wrong. We are in trouble if we allow this state of 
affairs to continue.
<P>
	When attention focusses on the system that has been in place for 
several years now between Revenue Canada and tax experts, things 
start to heat up and the government begins to panic. They do not 
know what to do next, so they gag the public accounts committee, 
which should normally have looked at this case, and transfer 
responsibility to the finance committee with as broad a mandate as 
possible, so that nothing will ever come to light.
<P>
	I have never seen such a case, nor have I ever seen the 
government so intent on hiding the truth, on keeping from 
Quebecers and Canadians all the inside information on this affair, 
which has been described by the auditor general, and by many 
others, since he brought it to light, as nebulous.
<P>
	I would say to you that this does not augur very well for the 
general review of taxation recently announced by the minister. You 
may recall that in the 1996 budget the Minister of Finance 
announced that he was forming a group of eight experts to review 
taxation, behind closed doors, and that this group would submit its 
report in the fall.
<P>
	When the family trust scandal hit, the finance minister had a 
slight change of heart and put us in the picture, as they say. The 
members of the Standing Committee on Finance will be able to 
follow the work being done by the eight experts and to have 
progress reports on all their discussions until the publication of the 
final report.
<P>
	Judging by the government's attitude in the family trust affair 
condemned by the auditor general, I wonder to what extent there 
will be a will to ensure that taxation in Canada is equitable for 
everyone and not just for a handful of people who can benefit from 
the same information, the same monetary support when dealing 
with tax experts who understand full well the complexity of 
taxation and who know how to turn it not just to the great advantage 
of wealthy families but also to their own advantage.
<P>
	That is what I wanted to say about family trusts. The provisions 
in Bill C-36 will not change in any way the scandal condemned by 
the auditor general, or the other scandals that are not known to us, 
but which probably followed in the wake of the precedent set by 
this case of $2 billion in assets transferred tax free.
<P>
	I will, if I may, conclude with a provision of Bill C-36, the 
wording of which we accept and support. I am referring to the film 
tax credit. I have the honour of informing you that the official 
opposition worked very hard to have this provision included.
<P>
<B>(1630)</B>
<P>
	I am thinking in particular of my colleague from 
Richmond-Wolfe, who is the opposition critic on heritage and 
who insisted that this provision, amended during consideration by 
the finance committee, be passed before the summer recess.
<P>
	We insisted because this provision will be of considerable 
benefit to the film industry and to others representing the world of 
culture, such as ADISQ or Mr. Rozon's Spectra. We are proud to 
have contributed to having the debate on this particular clause 
move forward.
<P>
	Unfortunately, as I said earlier, the government has the bad habit 
of bundling everything together-good and very positive measures 
with measures I consider particularly twisted like those involving 
the family trusts-and asking Parliament to vote on them. As I 
have been saying, there are good measures such as tax credits for 
film productions, but because of the bad measures, I must ask my 
colleagues to vote against the bill.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am here 
today to speak on Bill C-36, an act to amend the Income Tax Act, 
the Excise Act, the Excise Tax Act, the Office of the 
Superintendent of Financial Institutions Act, the Old Age Security 
Act and the Canada Shipping Act.
<P>
	First I will talk about the Liberal government and what it 
proposes in budgetary measures which this bill will enact. Second I 
will talk about what Reform has proposed in the area of taxation 
and what its members will do when they become the government.
<P>
	Three months ago I remember the finance minister saying to 
loud applause in his budget speech: ``We are not raising personal 
taxes. We are not raising corporate taxes. We are not raising excise 
taxes. In fact, we are not raising taxes''. I do not think many 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3942"> 3942 </A></B>
<P>
Canadians really believed what they were being told in that speech. 
A little later today I will go through a list of tax increases.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance seems to expect Canadians to thank him 
for appearing to hold the line on tax increases. I find it appalling 
that he should think it is good enough to be able to say what he said 
in the House, even if it were accurate, which it is not. It is appalling 
that he would think it would appease and please Canadians just to 
say, even if it were accurate, that there would be no tax increases.
<P>
	Canadians are looking for more than no tax increases. They are 
looking for fewer taxes. Canadians have been faced with tax 
increase after tax increase for the past 30 years. There has been an 
over 1,000 per cent increase in taxes in the past 30 years of Liberal 
and Conservative governments. Now Canadians are looking for 
fewer taxes. Their personal income tax rate is the second highest of 
any country in the G-7, second only to Germany. That is appalling.
<P>
	Between 1985 and 1993, the federal income tax bill of the 
average Canadian family has increased dramatically. Canadians 
simply did not have the stomach before this budget for tax 
increases.
<P>
	The finance minister chose to have no explicit increases but 
instead to try to sneak them in through the back door. In just a 
minute, I will go through the list of tax increases that occurred in 
spite of the finance minister saying that there were none.
<P>
	First I would like to summarize the list I have before me. This is 
a list of tax increases for the 1994-95 tax year through to the 
1998-99 tax year. These are lists, year by year, of tax increases that 
have been presented by the government and the finance minister.
<P>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
	In 1994-95 the list adds up to $575 million. In 1995-96 it gets 
worse. The total tax increase was $2.3 billion. The finance minister 
boasted that year that there were really no substantial tax increases 
and how many times more the cuts were than the tax increases.
<P>
	In 1996-97 the tax increases add up to $3.1 billion. In 1997-98, 
just through the budgets that this finance minister has put in place, 
the tax increases will be $3.2 billion. This will be more taken out of 
the pockets of Canadians. That is unacceptable.
<P>
	The budgets of the finance minister even go as far ahead as 
1998-99 and beyond. Already in 1998-99, just from past budgets, 
the finance minister has announced over $400 million in new taxes. 
We have a couple of budgets to go until we actually get to 1998-99.
<P>
	The finance minister preaches that he is against tax increases and 
yet the list of tax increases is too lengthy for me to go through in 
the time I have to present my speech today. It is unacceptable.
<P>
	I will go through the tax increases that have been put in place by 
this year's budget, a budget which was kicked off by the finance 
minister saying to loud applause: ``We are not raising personal 
taxes. We are not raising corporate taxes. We are not raising the 
excise taxes. In fact, we are not raising taxes''.
<P>
	I am going to talk about how the finance minister did not raise 
taxes in this year's budget. First, since the Liberals came to power 
they have squeezed an extra $9 billion to $11 billion or more out of 
the pockets of taxpayers. In the 1996 budget no explicit taxes were 
put in place, at least none that Canadians could see easily. There are 
none certainly along the line of the gas tax increase that we all saw 
at the pump last year. As far as that goes, the finance minister was 
accurate. However, I believe that Canadians expect more openness 
and accuracy from a finance minister than that.
<P>
	With the tax increases that have been put in place, the 
government will raise $145 million in the next three years by 
reducing the credit given for investment in labour sponsored, 
venture capital corporations by reducing the contribution limit to 
$3,500. This was in a year when the finance minister said no tax 
increases.
<P>
	A number of changes to the RRSP rules took place that will also 
yield revenue for the treasury by reducing the age of mandatory 
withdrawal to 69 from 71. The government will raise close to $100 
million by the year 2000. No tax increases? Figure that one out.
<P>
	Further, the government announced it would henceforth deny 
deductibility of the RRSP fees which would save another $10 
million. It also froze the RRSP contribution limit at $13,500 per 
year until 2003. The government is sending conflicting messages. 
On the one hand, it expects Canadians to take more responsibility 
for their retirement, but the government and the finance minister 
have said again and again that the Canada pension plan is not on 
sound footing.
<P>
	The finance minister in the budget this year ended universality of 
old age security, something that he criticized Reform for proposing 
during the last election campaign by saying his government would 
never do that. However, this government has ended universality. 
And it ended universality at a much lower income level than 
Reform ever proposed.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	Holding the line on the limit of RRSP contributions makes it 
very difficult for Canadians who are trying to look after their 
retirement because they know they really cannot count on old age 
security and the Canada pension plan the way this government has 
been operating. They know that the government does not have the 
resolve to hold the line on spending, eliminate the deficit and then 
start reducing taxes.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3943"> 3943 </A></B>
<P>
	The government will begin taxing non-residents on the income 
they receive from outside the country. This will yield $30 million 
in taxes in a year where there are no tax increases.
<P>
	The government plans to spend $50 million to step up the battle 
against the underground economy. Ottawa expects to gain $185 
million over the next three years by this move. Perhaps the 
government should take a good look at what causes the 
underground economy, the ever growing tax grab of the 
government, the ever increasing amount of money the government 
takes from the pay cheques of Canadians.
<P>
	I was in Hamilton East on Thursday and Friday of last week. The 
biggest complaint of the people of that constituency is that while in 
many cases they earn quite an attractive salary, their take home 
salary is quite another matter. There are simply too many 
deductions from their pay cheques for taxes and other payroll 
deductions which are getting larger and larger. There is really no 
end in sight as long as this government is in power.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance also announced the striking of a 
technical committee designed to study the business income 
taxation act and suggests measures that could be used to encourage 
job creation and investment. It is expected that this is simply 
window dressing, designed to offer the appearance that the 
government is actually doing something on the job creation front.
<P>
	How much will this committee cost? Looking at what has 
happened in the past, the committee will cost between $500,000 
and $5 million. That is a lot of money for a committee that is a 
sham. The record of the government of heeding the advice of 
committees that have travelled across the country is very poor. 
Often the government announces the changes that are going to take 
place even before the committee has reported. Then why is it 
wasting the time and spending this kind of money on the 
committee?
<P>
	The tax grabs in the area of business taxation are fairly 
innocuous when we look at the past history but they are still 
substantial. As was expected, the government extended the 
profitability tax on banks yielding about $65 million over the next 
two years. Although banks already pay about $4 billion annually in 
taxes, looking at 1993, the profit tax is another measure to force the 
most profitable in society to pay more and more.
<P>
	Most Canadians will not be too upset by the banks having to pay 
more tax. They are not going to be upset by a tax on high profits in 
the banking industry. But the precedent has been set. Will this tax 
next show up on convenience stores that earn a high profit? The 
precedents for an extra tax on high profits has been set. Where will 
it come down next? Will the corner store owner be next? This is a 
question Canadians must ask. The government is determined to 
grab money any way it can.
<P>
	I will continue through the list of grabs that have come about as a 
result of the last budget. The GST was essentially a non-issue in the 
budget. But the government has still not kept its promise to scrap 
the GST, although most Canadians would be happy if it simply did 
what was promised in the red book, to replace it with something 
else.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	Sheila Copps, the member who resigned her seat because the 
government had not kept its promise to get rid of the GST, is now 
fighting for her political career in a byelection. Canadians have not 
forgotten that the GST was not replaced, was not scrapped and will 
not be scrapped. I am not sure they will be satisfied with having it 
replaced. We will wait to see whether Canadians are willing to 
tolerate that.
<P>
	Something I heard in Hamilton during the byelection campaign 
was that Canadians expect politicians to keep the promises they 
make. The GST promise could well come back to haunt the 
government in the next election and beyond.
<P>
	The government has nothing to brag about on the tax front in the 
budget. Not only did it not offer tax relief. It raised taxes even 
though Canadians made it known they were sick and tired of tax 
increases.
<P>
	The budget affects taxation in an indirect way as well. By 
backing off from fiscal restraint the government has signed a death 
warrant for tax relief over at least the next three years. The finance 
minister and the government did not show the strength it would 
take to balance the budget very quickly. The finance minister still 
has no plan to balance the budget. Canadians can say with certainty 
that there will not be any meaningful tax decrease for some time 
down the road.
<P>
	I will talk in a while about what would have happened had 
Reform been elected in 1993 and had our zero in three plan been 
put in place at that time.
<P>
	To conclude my remarks with respect to what the government 
has done in the budget, in short the government has offered no tax 
relief. It has buried the hope of any tax relief in the foreseeable 
future. It has slapped Canadian taxpayers in the face by expecting 
gratitude for not openly raising taxation, even though it is clear that 
it has increased taxes by hundreds of millions of dollars in the 
budget. That is what the Liberals have done.
<P>
	What would the Reform Party have done had it gained power in 
1993? Reform campaigned on a zero in three plan. It was a detailed 
and sound plan to balance the budget in three years. What would 
that have meant? We would have been in the third year of the plan 
right now. Not only would Canadians have known the budget 
would be balanced by the end of this fiscal year. We would have put 
in place at least a token tax decrease, which Canadians are so 
desperately asking for.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3944"> 3944 </A></B>
<P>
	Canadians need to have more take home pay. They are tired of 
an ever increasing rate of deduction on their paycheques. They 
are tired of salaries which sound good ending up being too little 
for their families to live on comfortably. If our zero in three plan 
had been put in place by the finance minister they would have been 
happy. They could have been offered tax relief this year, 
something which Canadians desperately want.
<P>
	What have Reformers done recently in terms of tax decreases? I 
will explain four resolutions which were passed at our assembly in 
Vancouver by Reform members from across Canada. The finance 
minister should be listening to these resolutions because they 
reflect not only what Reform delegates at the assembly want but 
what Canadians across the country want.
<P>
	The first resolution states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Resolved that the Reform Party reaffirm its commitment for the introduction 
of a simple, visible and flat rate of taxation.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1650 )</B>
<P>
	Canadians want not only a lower tax rate but a simpler tax 
system. This resolution was ratified by 92 per cent of the delegates.
<P>
	The second one states:

<BLOCKQUOTE>Resolved that the Reform Party supports tax relief for families and married 
couples with one income earner.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This is a matter of making the system fairer. The finance 
minister talked quite a bit in this year's budget about making the 
system fairer. Yet in important areas like that one he did not do the 
job. Canadians really expect fairness, particularly when it comes to 
families being treated fairly in the system, and they are not being 
treated so now. That is what Reform has proposed for some time 
and that is what Reform will do.
<P>
	I will end with those comments although I would like to propose 
an amendment. I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That all the words after the word ``that'' be deleted and the following 
substituted therefor:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This House declines to give third reading to Bill C-36, an act to amend the 
Income Tax Act, the Excise Act, the Excise Tax  Act, the Office of the 
Superintendent of Financial Institutions Act, the Old Age Security Act and the 
Canadian Shipping Act, since it does not seek to address the issue known as 
flying flags of convenience which allows Canadian ship owners to avoid paying 
Canadian taxes.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	After the question and answer session I would like to rise on a 
point of order to explain why I believe the amendment is in order.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The hon. member for 
Vegreville has moved an amendment. I seek the counsel of the 
Table for a moment. I begin by apprising the member for Vegreville 
that at this stage of debate the first three interventions have 
40-minute maximums. The hon. member on behalf of the Reform 
Party was entitled to the maximum, and there is no question or 
comment period.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	I will ask for debate. There being no further debate I will take a 
moment to make ruling on the amendment and then put question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> I rise on a point of order, Mr. Speaker, before you 
make your decision on the amendment. If there is any doubt on the 
acceptability of the amendment I refer you to Beauchesne's sixth 
edition, citation 568, which states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It is an imperative rule that every amendment must be relevant to the question 
on which the amendment is proposed.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This omnibus bill deals with various tax acts including the 
Income Tax Act and the Canada Shipping Act. The registration of 
ships under foreign flag is in the shipping act which the bill 
amends. It is a matter of the Income Tax Act which the bill also 
amends. The bill deals with the closing of a tax loophole. I refer to 
the section of the bill that addresses the family trust issue. Flying 
flags of convenience is but another loophole of the rich that needs 
to be addressed.
<P>
	The government should not go ahead with this bill but come 
forward with a bill that addresses all loopholes and the flags of 
convenience issue in particular.
<P>
	I refer to Beauchesne's sixth edition, citation 733:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>There are limitations on the types of amendments that can be moved on third 
reading. They must be relevant to the bill which they seek to amend.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	My amendment is relevant to the Income Tax Act and the 
Canada Shipping Act which the bill seeks to amend. The citation 
goes further and says that the amendment:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-should not contradict the principle of the bill as adopted on second reading.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The bill addresses a major controversial loophole of the rich, that 
of the family trust. My amendment addresses a loophole of the rich 
as well. As I mentioned earlier my amendment addresses acts that 
are covered in the bill.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3945"> 3945 </A></B>
<P>
	Citation 670 of Beauchesne's outlines some criteria for a 
reasoned amendment. Section 2 of the citation states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It may not propose an alternative scheme.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	My amendment does not do this. In fact I want to expand on the 
closing of tax loopholes for the rich. Citation 670(5) of 
Beauchesne's states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It may express opinions as to any circumstance connected with the 
introduction or prosecution of the bill-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	While we are looking at the Canada Shipping Act and the 
Income Tax, we should be looking at the issue of flying flags of 
convenience and close that loophole for the rich and powerful.
<P>
	The amendment is in order because it relates to the bill. Yet it 
will open the debate on the issue of legally avoiding paying taxes. 
It may be legal but it certainly is not pro-Canadian. It is a loophole 
that must be looked at in the same light as the family trust issue.
<P>
	It is shameful that some people in the country are willing to reap 
the benefits that are-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. The comments that 
have been made are debate. Beyond the submissions from the hon. 
member for Vegreville with regard to citations 568, 733 and 670, I 
would only ask him if there are any others and to refer to them very 
succinctly and briefly. There are none.
<P>
<B>(1700 )</B>
<P>
	In consultation with our table officers, the Chair rules that the 
amendment is not in order.
<P>
	I draw the House's attention to Beauchesne's sixth edition, 
article 568:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It is an imperative rule that every amendment must be relevant to the question 
on which the amendment is proposed.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In my consideration the issue of flying flags is a new issue which 
goes beyond the scope of this bill.
<P>
	I equally draw to the attention of the House Beauchesne's sixth 
edition, article 671:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The following rules govern the contents of reasoned amendments. (1) The 
principle of relevancy in an amendment governs every such motion. The 
amendment must ``strictly relate to the bill which the House, by its order, has 
resolved upon considering''-</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
	Therefore respectfully I thank the hon. member for Vegreville 
who obviously took a great deal of time and effort in preparing his 
argument. In this instance the Chair is not in agreement and has 
ruled this amendment is not in order.
<P>
	Resuming debate on Bill C-36. Is the House ready for the 
question?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Question.

	<B>Mr. Jerry Pickard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
begin debate on the motion to refer Bill C-34, the agricultural 
marketing programs act, to committee before second reading.
<P>
	The Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food has asked the House 
to approve this procedure because he wants the committee to 
ensure that all members with any interest in this legislation have 
opportunity to be heard.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3946"> 3946 </A></B>
<P>
	During the 1993 election campaign we made commitments to 
give MPs greater influence in the legislative process. By moving 
to proceed directly to committee on this bill, we are following 
through on those commitments.
<P>
	Even though we consulted extensively across the country with 
this bill, we are following this procedure to make sure no thoughts 
or concepts are overlooked.
<P>
	The objective of Bill C-34 is to provide a common legislative 
base for financial marketing programs in agriculture and to 
reinstate provisions for interest free cash advances.
<P>
	Currently, the efficient and orderly marketing of agricultural 
commodities is supported and encouraged through four acts, one of 
which is the Prairie Grain Advance Payments Act, developed to 
assist producers marketing Canadian Wheat Board crops, wheat 
and barley by providing them with cash flow soon after harvest 
when marketing bottlenecks often occur.
<P>
	Second is the Advance Payments for Crops Act, which is to 
assist producers who market all storable crops other than Canadian 
Wheat Board wheat and barley. Third is the Agriculture Products 
Co-operative Marketing Act, designed to encourage producers to 
process their products co-operatively. Fourth is the Agricultural 
Products Board Act, used to facilitate intergovernment sales and to 
purchase products from domestic markets to be sold at a later date 
when the market is not under pressure.
<P>
<B>(1710 )</B>
<P>
	These acts were all developed at different times. They reflect the 
domestic, North American and world markets and marketing 
systems which were in existence when they were created. Although 
these different acts have served farmers well, many farmers and 
farm groups have found it confusing to have four different pieces of 
legislation.
<P>
	They have also expressed concern that the present legislation 
does not treat all producers equally. For these reasons the 
government is proposing to replace the four acts by one new piece 
of legislation called the agricultural marketing programs act.
<P>
	This legislation is the end result of extensive consultations 
throughout the sectors. The federal government consulted more 
than 80 producer groups directly for their input on Agriculture and 
Agri-food Canada's financial programs. We also asked over 160 
producer groups and other organizations including provincial 
governments to review a summary report from the consultation 
process and give us their comments.
<P>
	The proposed act takes into account as many of the suggestions 
expressed by producers as possible. It has received widespread 
support among the producer groups.
<P>
	The new legislation responds to the needs of producers. It will 
treat all commodity groups and all regions of the country alike. At 
the same time, the new act is flexible enough to meet the needs of 
producers who operate under different and diverse marketing 
systems throughout the country.
<P>
	Another important point is that the new act will tighten 
administrative controls, thereby reducing administrative costs. It 
will also eliminate inconsistencies and inequities between the two 
previous advance payment programs. This new act is thus in line 
with the government's commitment to increase budgetary 
efficiency and get the structure of government right.
<P>
	This new act also fulfils the promise we made in the last federal 
election campaign and repeated in the February 1995 budget to 
introduce a statutory interest free advance program to replace the 
current cash flow enhancement program which expires next year.
<P>
	I emphasize that the program will be statutory. It will eliminate 
the uncertainty that cash strapped producers faced in the past while 
waiting for government to announce whether interest free cash 
advances would be temporarily granted.
<P>
	Like any other industry that operates in a competitive 
environment, farmers need to sell their products in order to pay 
their bills. Cash flow problems sometimes force them to sell their 
crops and products right after harvest when prices are not generally 
favourable.
<P>
	The new act will provide cash advances to farmers, allowing 
them to sell their products not necessarily at harvest but at a later 
time. This allows producers to sell their output when prices are 
better instead of dumping the products on the market at the same 
time, a practices which depresses the prices.
<P>
	The agriculture marketing programs act will avail cash advances 
up to $250,000 to qualified producers. With the first $50,000 
interest free, the balance will be lent a preferential rate, generally 
less than the prime rate.
<P>
	The new legislation will also benefit co-operatives. The pooling 
provisions will be maintained in the new act but will be streamlined 
to encourage more producers to market co-operatively and to get 
into the value added processing so they can increase their revenues.
<P>
	The pooling provisions establish an anticipated selling price for 
the pooled product and offer a price guarantee of up to 80 per cent 
of that price. This will help co-operatives avoid serious losses in 
the event of a significant, unexpected downturn in prices. The price 
guarantee will also allow co-operatives to negotiate larger loans 
with lower interest rates from financial institutions.
<P>
	The new act will also deal effectively with compliance problems 
experienced under the Prairie Grain Advance Payment Act.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3947"> 3947 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1715 )</B>
<P>
	In recent years, the act has experienced a significant rate of 
defaults. Although an effective inspection campaign has greatly 
reduced the default rate, producers have asked the federal 
government to find a permanent solution to this problem so that 
they can have confidence that all other producers are complying 
with the law.
<P>
	The new act will reduce the number of defaults and thus restore 
producer confidence. The bill stipulates that producers who default 
will have to pay all reasonable costs of collecting that default. In 
addition, producers will pay interest on the default advance from 
the date the advance was issued until it is completely paid. Finally, 
they will not be able to get another advance under any other permit 
book or any other business organization until previous advances 
and any other defaults are fully repaid.
<P>
	It is only fair to the majority of producers who fulfil their 
commitments that these procedures be tightened up. In fact, many 
of these measures have already been implemented administratively 
and have produced positive results. Defaults have dropped from 
$64 million in the 1993-94 crop year to under $10 million in the 
1994-95 crop year.
<P>
	With the implementation of this bill, defaults will be kept at 
acceptable levels through legislative rather than administrative 
means. This will result in significant savings to the taxpayer.
<P>
	Since the majority of these changes in the Agricultural 
Marketing Programs Act are directed at the reduction of defaults, 
processors who participate in the program will probably not notice 
any changes compared to the Advance Payments for Crop Act or 
the Prairie Grain Advance Payments Act, programs of the last few 
years.
<P>
	In conclusion, I believe this new legislation represents real 
progress for our farmers who get a more stable operating 
environment and progress for our taxpayers who get a more 
effective use of their tax dollars.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak this afternoon in the debate on Bill C-34, tabled in 
this House on May 3 by the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food. 
This bill to establish programs for the marketing of agricultural 
products was a measure long awaited by both the producers 
themselves and the many agricultural product marketing boards.
<P>
	I would, therefore, like to provide some clarifications on the 
nature of my speech itself, with respect to the considerable impact 
of this bill. On the one hand, I wish to voice my support of this 
legislative measure, with its substantial favourable impact on the 
fate of producers as they make their way through the bureaucratic 
complexities which characterize the agricultural sector of this 
country.
<P>
	On the other hand, I seriously question whether the government 
is truly concerned about agriculture and agri-food. The minister 
himself could testify as to just how many legislative rectifications 
need to be made to the Canadian agricultural sector to bring it in 
step with the autonomist trends of this modern era.
<P>
	In this connection, Bill C-34 represents a praiseworthy effort by 
the minister to facilitate access by producers to simple and 
effective means of marketing their produce with a view to 
maximizing profits.
<P>
	An in-depth examination of the bill, however, has pointed out 
certain shortcomings in the very spirit of this draft of the bill.
<P>
	I want to point out one thing which strikes me as an out and out 
paradox, relating to a lack of analytical rigour on the part of the 
government. I will spare you the detailed explanation of the 
implementation of this bill in order to give you a brief indication of 
what the government will have to justify in order to have this 
legislation unanimously approved.
<P>
<B>(1720)</B>
<P>
	With regard to the budgetary aspect of Bill C-34, it should be 
noted that $120 million will be allotted to the advance payments 
program over three years. Needless to say, this element of the bill is 
the basis for a cash payment to all farmers in this country.
<P>
	However, there is a rather obvious inconsistency in the way the 
government markets these same crops. Let me explain. Agriculture 
and Agri-Food Canada will use huge sums of money to facilitate 
the marketing of annual crops. But this money comes from the 
income protection programs envelope. You will agree with me that 
this is a rather huge inconsistency. The government is simply 
hiding the cuts it is forcing on a category of taxpayers, who are 
already in a precarious financial position.
<P>
	In this context, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada's income 
protection programs envelope for the 1997-98 crop year will be 30 
per cent less than estimated, easily some $250 million, or a quarter 
of a billion dollars. I agree that the government should keep on 
putting its financial house in order, but not at any cost. In my 
opinion, this way of hiding cuts is shameful.
<P>
	Farmers from Quebec and western Canada are no fools. They 
have already been subjected to the deceitful actions of the 
department since 1992, but always in exchange for false hopes. If 
we really calculate the amounts that are to be allocated to the 
various programs in this bill, we get two results. First, we see there 
is a shortfall to really fund the government's initiatives.
<P>
	In the second case, we get the financial provisions that are 
outlined in Bill C-34, a bunch of details that are only meant to 
complicate the administrative framework and thus make its passing 
easier, because of the urgency of the situation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3948"> 3948 </A></B>
<P>
	However, I want to salute the government's initiative for 
wanting to update the programs for the marketing of agricultural 
products. I agree with the general thrust of this bill and I admit 
that, if it had not been for the deficient budgetary aspect that I 
have outlined earlier, I would support this piece of legislation 
without any hesitation.
<P>
	In that context, I hope the government will take into 
consideration the factual aspects I have mentioned. It is in the 
interest of its credibility toward a major segment of the population 
in this country, and particularly, in the interest of its honour and 
integrity. Recently, some farmers in my riding asked me with a 
totally disenchanted attitude: ``When the Minister of Finance tables 
his budget, does he do so with the intention of deceiving Canada 
and Quebec taxpayers? We often hear this question from farmers''.
<P>
<B>(1725)</B>
<P>
	Beyond all partisan considerations, it is important to legislate in 
the real interests of the people. Farmers must deal with a situation 
that varies with weather conditions. So, it is important to make sure 
they have a minimum of stability and, particularly, to ensure the 
numbers that are presented to them accurately reflect their 
circumstances.
<P>
	That is in essence the position we will defend here with my 
colleague, the member for Québec-Est. So, on the whole, we will 
give our support to the government for the quick passage of Bill 
C-34, since while there are some deficiencies, of course, by and 
large, the bill is acceptable.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak on behalf of the Reform caucus 
on the motion to refer Bill C-34 to committee prior to second 
reading. Bill C-34 is the Agriculture Marketing Programs Act. It is 
the replacement for several advance payment for crops acts that are 
currently on the books.
<P>
	This process is new to this Parliament. We have had good 
experiences and bad experiences when we have referred bills to 
committee prior to second reading. I would hope this would be a 
good experience. I have the assurance of the chair of the agriculture 
committee that we will be allowed to hear witnesses on this bill 
prior to going through clause by clause. I would like to presume 
that the committee will give us adequate time to hear witnesses and 
debate the bill clause by clause.
<P>
	Some chairmen have been rather autocratic and undemocratic 
but I have confidence that the chair of the agriculture committee 
will allow adequate input in this bill and if amendments are needed 
they will be given the due consideration they should have and 
perhaps receive the support of the committee to come back in an 
improved format.
<P>
	It is obvious this is not the most controversial piece of legislation 
facing the House. The fact that the introductory speech by the 
government side was made by the parliamentary secretary to the 
minister rather than by the minister indicates this is not an earth 
shattering change in legislation that will impact on agriculture.
<P>
	Rather than being controversial a better word for this bill may be 
that it is diversionary. It is trying to divert attention from some 
shortcomings of the minister of agriculture and his government on 
to ground that it is less controversial and may find broader support 
from the industry.
<P>
	It reminds me a little of the scene where some person is going to 
eat a cookie on his plate and the shyster sitting beside him points to 
something either real or imaginary out the window and says: ``Did 
you see that over there?'' Of course, when the potential consumer 
of the cookie looks out the window, the shyster grabs the cookie 
and quickly eats it.
<P>
	I believe the minister of agriculture is trying to divert some 
attention away from some problems he has by bringing forward 
legislation that is not of primary importance to the industry.
<P>
	Some might ask what are some of the issues that are being 
avoided? In a debate like this it would be appropriate to bring those 
forward at this time. Perhaps the bill we should be debating, rather 
than referring this to committee, is a bill to amend the Canadian 
Wheat Board Act. There is far more interest, certainly on the 
prairies, in reforming the Canadian Wheat Board Act than in 
reforming an Advance Payments for Crops Act such as what Bill 
C-34 is doing.
<P>
	One just has to look at what is happening in the prairies where 
normally law-abiding farmers are taking wheat and barley across 
the U.S. border without the permits they are asked to have by the 
Canadians Wheat Board. One may ask: ``Why is this happening?'' 
It is not because the Advance Payments for Crops Act is not 
adequately working under the Canadian Wheat Board. There have 
been some changes to the act depending on which administration 
has been in power over the past few years.
<P>
	Year in and year out there have been advance payments for crops 
on the books, yet farmers are still trying to move their products 
south into the United States without using a Canadian Wheat Board 
permit. We might want to ask: Why is that? Perhaps we need to 
make amendments to the Canadian Wheat Board Act which would 
alleviate some of this tension and alleviate the seizure of property 
by customs officials and the RCMP.
<P>
<B>(1730)</B>
<P>
	Why is this happening? Why is this not the priority of the Liberal 
government? Why is this not the issue we are debating rather than 
Bill C-34? Why are homes being  invaded by customs agents and 
the RCMP? Maybe this is a serious situation and we should be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3949"> 3949 </A></B>
<P>
looking at it but of course, the minister is in no hurry to look at the 
situation.
<P>
	The Canadian Wheat Board sponsored a conference in Saskatoon 
to try to stimulate diversification and the value added concept. It 
came up with a wonderful scheme of putting $10 million forward to 
help farmers diversify by implementing new business plans. Again 
it was a diversionary tactic, like Bill C-34, to get away from the 
real issue which is the fact that the government does not have a 
business plan. In the meantime, markets are being missed and 
producers are being miffed.
<P>
	Instead of debating Bill C-34 perhaps we should have been 
looking at the reform of supply management. That might be an 
issue which is front and centre with a lot more producers than the 
issues which are dealt with under Bill C-34.
<P>
	The Liberal government opposed NAFTA prior to the election. It 
actually goes all the way back to the 1988 election. Liberals said 
that NAFTA was a terrible deal and should not be signed. The 
Liberals said that if they ever got into power they would certainly 
fix NAFTA in a big hurry. That was their number one priority, a 
priority far greater than tinkering around with the advance 
payments act.
<P>
	The Liberals finally got into power in 1993, but they totally 
forgot their promise to change NAFTA. They did not even go back 
to the table to renegotiate NAFTA like they said they would. 
Instead they went to the GATT table and broke another promise. 
They did away with article XI of GATT. They indicated to the 
supply managed industry that they would not do that but they did it 
anyway. The supply managed industries are wondering whether 
Bill C-34 might be a diversionary tactic to get producers' eyes off 
some of the problems and uncertainties facing the supply managed 
industry.
<P>
	The Liberals even failed when they signed the GATT agreement 
to table an addendum to GATT indicating what their position was 
on the tariffs which had been agreed to as they regarded NAFTA. It 
certainly looks like a bit of a slip-up to me.
<P>
	Now we have a U.S. challenge to our tariffs under NAFTA which 
is going before a dispute settlement panel. We expect the results to 
be tabled sometime in August. That is a far more important issue to 
producers. They would like to see the government acting on that 
rather than on this issue.
<P>
	The Crow buy-out and some of its problems are far more of a 
concern to the industry than is Bill C-34.
<P>
	If Bill C-34 is passed in its current form, it will be another 
Liberal broken promise. I have in my hand a letter from the Prime 
Minister. It was written when he was Leader of the Opposition and 
is dated September 8, 1993. The letter is to the Ontario corn 
producers. He  talks about the advance payments for crops act and 
the changes which his government, if elected, would bring forward.
<P>
	The letter reads: ``In May we announced that we would bring 
back the interest free cash advance program by statute and we 
would make it a working capital program by providing half of the 
maximum $50,000 available to producers after seeding in the 
spring and the remainder in the fall''. That is not in the bill. I have 
looked through the bill and it is not there. It is all after harvest, after 
the crops are in the bin. There is no provision for half of the 
advance payment to be made after seeding.
<P>
	If the bill is passed in its current form, it will be yet another 
Liberal broken promise. Perhaps the Liberals will bring forward an 
amendment because of this oversight or perhaps they had no 
intention of keeping that promise. However, I suggest they look at 
it. I also suggest they should get their priorities straight as far as the 
industry is concerned.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Middlesex, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to lend my support to Bill C-34 and the 
motion to refer it to the Standing Committee on Agriculture and 
Agri-Food prior to second reading.
<P>
<B>(1735 )</B>
<P>
	Bill C-34 represents a commitment made in the red book and 
reiterated in the February 1995 budget to reinstate federal statutory 
authority to make interest free cash advances to farmers across 
Canada.
<P>
	The new law, which is long overdue, will be known as the 
agricultural marketing programs act or AMPA. It will among other 
things replace by statute the previous government's ad hoc 
cashflow enhancement program which is due to expire next year. It 
is very important to have this act in place by statute. In doing so we 
will be providing security for our farmers.
<P>
	Bill C-34 is an amalgamation of four existing acts: the Advance 
Payments for Crops Act, the Prairie Grain Advance Payments Act, 
the Agricultural Products Co-operative Marketing Act and the 
Agricultural Products Board Act and one ad hoc program which I 
have already mentioned, the cashflow enhancement program.
<P>
	Besides being confusing, producers were not being treated 
equally under the four acts. In order to overcome this confusion and 
unfairness, the new agricultural marketing programs act will treat 
all commodities groups alike. In this way, inequities and 
irregularities of the previous programs have all been eliminated. 
Simply put, cash advances give farmers the flexibility to meet their 
expenses after harvest and before crops are sold, despite what may 
be untimely market limitations or unfavourable prevailing prices 
when cashflow is desperately needed.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3950"> 3950 </A></B>
<P>
	In Canada these cash advances have traditionally been interest 
free until 1989 when the previous government removed that 
feature from the law and left interest charges to be decided on an 
ad hoc basis from year to year through the cashflow enhancement 
program. The results have been far from satisfactory, creating 
confusion, instability, anxiety and unfairness. In order to make this 
new legislation more effective, it has been divided into three 
particular programs: the advance payments program, the price 
pooling program and the government purchases program.
<P>
	Under the advance payments program, which is covered by 
clauses 4 through 25 of the bill, the maximum allowable advance 
payment to producers will be $250,000, the first $50,000 of which 
would be interest free. If there should be a crop disaster due to 
abnormal weather conditions or disease, an emergency advance 
payment of $25,000 could be paid but in such a case the minister 
would not be liable for the interest.
<P>
	This part of the bill is fairly similar to the Advance Payments for 
Crops Act but it would also make adjustments in order to take into 
account the specific situation of grain producers under Canadian 
Wheat Board jurisdiction. Under the bill and unlike the situation 
under conditions now in force, advance payments would be paid 
directly to producers, not the Canadian Wheat Board permit book 
holders. As well, clause 14 would allow the use of cash purchase 
tickets as advance payments to producers under CWB jurisdiction. 
This particular example illustrates just how flexible the new act 
will be to meet the needs of producers who operate under a wide 
range of diverse marketing systems throughout Canada.
<P>
	In cases where a producer who defaults on his obligations with a 
partner, a member or a shareholder of another association, the 
association would not be eligible for advance payments and vice 
versa. For greater clarity, the rule applicable to associations 
between spouses, parents or children would be the same rule which 
is applicable to Revenue Canada income tax returns.
<P>
	One important objective of Bill C-34 is to reduce defaults on 
repayments which have unfortunately cost taxpayers heavily over 
the years. Defaults on repayments under the Prairie Grain Advance 
Payments Act have reached several million dollars. The bill would 
provide that producers who defaulted on repayments would have to 
pay all recovered costs and interest on outstanding advance 
payments. As well of course they could not obtain other advance 
payments nor avoid repayment by setting up another company or 
business. Obtaining a new Canadian Wheat Board permit book 
would not allow a grain producer to avoid the obligation to repay 
advance payments which were obtained by using another permit 
book.
<P>
	Although eligible crops are listed in clause 2 of the bill, the 
following criteria would also apply: the crop would  have to be 
harvested and stored; it would have to be possible to store the crop 
in its unprocessed form; the producer would have to retain 
ownership of the crop; and the producer would have to be 
responsible for marketing the crop. In some sectors of agriculture, 
particularly horticulture, these criteria have been perceived as 
being overly restrictive since many products are difficult to store in 
their unprocessed form or are acquired immediately after being 
harvested.
<P>
	The Ontario corn producers were one of the three farm groups 
that had requested that advance payments be made at seeding time 
and that advance payments be set at 70 per cent rather than 50 per 
cent of the value of the crop.
<P>
<B>(1740 )</B>
<P>
	I must reiterate that this act is primarily based on equity among 
crops, regions and producers right across Canada.
<P>
	As for spring advances not being included in the act, it is 
important to remember that consultations for this bill involved over 
160 producer groups across Canada. Most of these groups were 
either neutral on the issue or opposed the concept of spring 
advances.
<P>
	The great majority of producer groups felt that spring advances 
would change the focus of the advance payments program in such a 
way that the current focus of marketing would be changed to one of 
simply supplying operating credit. The producers felt that this 
would ultimately reduce the benefits and increase the costs of the 
program to unacceptable limits.
<P>
	The act will establish a new risk sharing program where the 
delivery agent's liability for defaults will be based on the history of 
defaults. It will range from 1 per cent and 15 per cent instead of the 
current 2 per cent for the Advance Payments for Crops Act and no 
liability for the Prairie Grain Advance Payments Act. The act will 
also define more clearly the crops and eliminate potential overlap 
with the price pooling program.
<P>
	The new legislation will permit producers to continue to use 
price pooling mechanisms while the approval process for these 
provisions will be greatly streamlined. Since the bill in clauses 26 
through 30 would delegate authority to the Minister of Agriculture 
and Agri-Food subject to the annual concurrence on general terms 
and conditions by the Minister of Finance, it would thus remove the 
requirement for the appointment of auditors and professional 
accountants for each agreement.
<P>
	Having removed these layers of red tape, the federal government 
could much more easily establish a minimum guaranteed price for 
all products sold out of a pool by grade, variety and type of product. 
This guaranteed price would cover the initial price to producers and 
the operating costs of the pool.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3951"> 3951 </A></B>
<P>
	As for the government purchases program contained in Bill 
C-34, the act will incorporate the provisions of the Agriculture 
Products Board Act. The act will maintain the ability of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada to buy and sell agricultural 
products when unusual marketing conditions exist while removing 
another layer of bureaucracy, that is, the requirement for the 
agricultural products board.
<P>
	In closing, I would like to briefly summarize the benefits that 
would come about once the agricultural marketing programs act is 
scheduled to come into force January 1, 1997. There will be one act 
instead of four to deal with the financial agricultural marketing 
programs in Canada, thus reducing current crop and regional 
inequities, inconsistencies in program administration, and overall 
program costs. Financial marketing programs will be easier for 
producers to accept. All producers will be able to obtain cash 
advances under the same administrative requirement. Defaults will 
be reduced by better screening before issuing advances, by 
improved controls, improved collection methods and stronger 
penalties for defaulted advances.
<P>
	The act will be consistent with current government policy to 
recover administrative costs, increase risk sharing with 
participants, combine legislation which shares a common base and 
reduce program costs through less bureaucracy.
<P>
	An overwhelming majority of farm producers and their 
organizations across Canada have shown widespread support for 
the direction the government is proposing to take on these issues. I 
encourage members in the House to do likewise by supporting the 
motion to refer Bill C-34 to committee prior to second reading so 
that my colleagues and I can give this bill our undivided attention.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
it is with great interest and a strong sense of duty that I rise today to 
speak to Bill C-34, the Agricultural Marketing Programs Act.
<P>
	I am happy to see that the purpose of this bill is to combine four 
existing acts to make it easier to market agricultural products. 
These acts are: the Advance Payments for Crops Act, the Prairie 
Grain Advance Payments Act, the Agricultural Products 
Cooperative Marketing Act, and the Agricultural Products Board 
Act.
<P>
	Bill C-34 also includes the cash flow enhancement program. If 
my party, the Bloc Quebecois, generally supports the objectives of 
Bill C-34, it is because this bill is essentially consistent with 
farmers' demands and seems more in keeping with Quebec's 
values and agricultural development model.
<P>
<B>(1745)</B>
<P>
	There is, however, a major inconsistency in how payments are 
charged to the budget. Clauses 25 and 30  are financial in nature. 
Through these two clauses, the government hopes to pay farmers 
under the advance payments program and the price pooling 
program.
<P>
	We learned that, under the advance payments program, farmers 
would receive $40 million a year over three years, for a total of 
$120 million. What hurts the most is that Agriculture and 
Agri-Food Canada will take the money to be spent on the 
marketing program out of the budget earmarked for income 
protection.
<P>
	This transfer, this misappropriation of funds from the budget 
will reduce the amounts available to protect farmers' income. 
Unfortunately, by taking this action, the federal government will 
once again reduce Quebec's share even further.
<P>
	Whether you like it or not, Quebec's share of the funds allocated 
to income protection programs for farmers is already lower to what 
that province is in a position to demand and obtain, given the 
relative weight of agriculture in the ``belle province''.
<P>
	History seems to be repeating itself: Quebec is always more 
heavily penalized at the end of the day.
<P>
	The resource envelope for income protection programs at 
Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada for fiscal year 1997-98 is $600 
million, that is $250 million or 30 per cent less than the $850 
million allocated before the budget came down. If the federal 
government goes ahead with this misappropriation of public funds, 
by dipping into funds allocated to income protection programs, in 
three years, the shortfall in this envelope will be $120 million.
<P>
	To put it clearly and briefly, it is indecent to use part of the funds 
allocated to farming income protection to finance the advance 
payments program, which, must I remind the hon. members, is 
essentially an agricultural marketing program.
<P>
	What link, if any, could there be between the advance payments 
program and the income protection program? None.
<P>
	Let us be clear about something. When the Minister of Finance, 
the hon. Paul Martin, tables his budget, does he do so with the 
intention of deceiving the taxpayers in Quebec and Canada? Should 
the budget not reflect what was planned? That is what 
logic-others would say common sense-dictates anyway.
<P>
	Instead, following this government's reasoning, are we to 
understand that the figures provided mean nothing, since they no 
longer apply to what they were originally supposed to apply? This 
is terrible. I am dismayed.
<P>
	If the federal government, through the appropriate department, 
uses funds intended for the income protection program to finance 
the advance payments program, which is an agricultural marketing 
program, why should amendments not be made now to change this?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3952"> 3952 </A></B>
<P>
	First, a real political will is required to change the situation and 
make sure that the funds taken for the advance payments program 
come directly from the budget earmarked for agricultural products 
marketing programs.
<P>
	The government should allocate more money for marketing 
programs and it should stop cutting and diverting funds from one 
envelope to the other. This is a simple but vital solution.
<P>
	It would ensure that, in the future, Quebec farmers would enjoy 
better income protection. An amount of $120 million could also be 
subtracted from the budget for income protection. However, this 
would recreate the current situation, in that less money would be 
available to concerned Quebec farmers, in a proportion more unfair 
than for the other nine Canadian provinces. Others will also suggest 
the government should allocate new money for agricultural 
products marketing programs, along with a transfer of money from 
the budget for the income protection programs.
<P>
<B>(1750)</B>
<P>
	This would be a partially acceptable solution. These are the 
reasons why the Bloc Quebecois is asking the federal government 
to make the necessary changes. It must correct the situation and 
ensure a fair treatment to Quebec farmers.
<P>
	Simply put, the government is being asked to take the money for 
the advanced payments program from the budget allocated for the 
income protection programs. As you know, this is a major irritant 
for Quebec farmers.
<P>
	Moreover, given the new eligibility rules, Bill C-34 would 
exclude any form of collective Indeed, one of the eligibility 
requirements for producers must be rejected, especially the one 
that lets producers decide when they will sell their products, 
because the products subject to a pooling system would then be 
excluded. VEGCO Inc., from the province of Quebec, is among 
those that would be hard hit by such a measure.
<P>
	Finally, I agree with the federal government using the taxpayers' 
money to efficiently streamline its programs, provided that all 
farmers get the same benefits and meet the same requirements. 
However, there is something very wrong with the way the money is 
allocated and if the government of the current Prime Minister can 
get away with it, it will further reduce Quebec's share of the 
income protection programs.
<P>
	I think it is important to stand up for Quebec farmers and to point 
out that the government is trying to stifle the people and not only in 
agriculture. Quebec is losing money because the federal 
government is withdrawing its support from several programs and 
we wonder what is going on not only in agriculture, but in other 
areas as well, like shipping, the Tokamak project and other 
initiatives in Quebec from which the government is withdrawing its 
financial assistance and support.
<P>
	We have the feeling the federal government is withdrawing more 
and more money from its projects and facilities in the province of 
Quebec. Why? I wonder if the government does not have a plan B 
for the economy, where it would put pressure on all economic 
sectors.
<P>
	However, I feel better knowing that farmers, at least in the 
beautiful province of Quebec, are very well organized with UPA 
and are increasingly better able to develop and defend their 
marketing system, not only in North America, but also in Europe 
and throughout the world.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak to Bill C-34, the Agricultural Marketing Programs 
Act.
<P>
	As members before me have explained, the bill takes four acts 
and puts them together into one. We would think this would result 
in cost savings in administration. The departmental briefing 
claimed that putting the four programs together would result in 
administrative savings of somewhat over $1 million. We will have 
to wait to see whether those savings actually come about, but I do 
not have a lot of faith that there will be savings in administration.
<P>
	I have a concern with the administration of the bill. If the record 
of the government in administering its programs does not improve, 
the administration of the program will be a disaster. We could look, 
for example, to the Crow payout program that was put in place by 
last year's budget. Under that program 75 per cent of the money to 
be paid out should have been paid out by the end of January. We are 
still not up to the 75 per cent expected payout level. If the record on 
the administration of the programs does not improve, the program 
will be of little use to farmers.
<P>
<B>(1755)</B>
<P>
	When it comes to advance payments it is absolutely necessary 
for the administration to be simple and done very quickly, or it 
really defeats the purpose of getting cash into the hands of farmers 
in the fall before they can actually sell the crops. It is often a 
problem to sell crops in the fall to get cash to pay bills. The purpose 
of the program is to get the money into the hands of farmers more 
quickly. If the administration is slowed, as I suspect it might be just 
looking at the record of the government, it is a step backward. We 
will just have to wait to see what happens in that regard.
<P>
	The bill touches on changing the Canadian Wheat Board. The 
Prairie Grain Advance Payments Act is currently administered by 
the Canadian Wheat Board. With this change the program would 
become one of the four programs under the Agricultural Marketing 
Programs Act.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3953"> 3953 </A></B>
<P>
	We need an awful lot more than just tinkering with the Canadian 
Wheat Board Act. I remember back to the time when I was a very 
little tyke in around 1960. After harvest started my father, finally 
having grain to sell and desperately needing some money for 
school supplies and other things, lamented the fact that the 
Canadian Wheat Board did not provide a quick enough avenue for 
marketing his grain. Even back then, 35 or 36 years ago, he wanted 
a choice either to ship through the wheat board or on his own 
somewhere else so he could get the cash when he wanted it and 
when he needed it. That was denied him then. Here it is 35 years 
later and still western Canadian farmers are being denied what 
obviously should be theirs: the right to market their grain in any 
way they see fit whether it be through the Canadian Wheat Board 
or on their own in some other fashion.
<P>
	It seems to be absurd. It is so absurd I cannot understand it. Last 
Thursday and Friday I was campaigning in the Hamilton East 
byelection. I went to a door where someone asked about the 
Canadian Wheat Board and why farmers were not given the ability 
to market on their own. Even the people in the heart of Canadian 
cities are finally understanding how ridiculous the situation is 
when farmers cannot market their own grain, their own product. It 
is time some serious action was taken and not only tinkering.
<P>
	I remember when I left university in 1974 that there was talk 
in the agricultural faculty about changing the Canadian Wheat 
Board Act and the Canadian Wheat Board so that farmers would 
have more control. The wheat board was causing problems even 
then. The students at the university could see a need for change. 
Starting back then, 30-plus years ago, I actively started 
campaigning for changing the Canadian Wheat Board. I was not 
for getting rid of it and I am still not for getting rid of it. I want to 
change it so that it is accountable to farmers and farmers have 
the option to ship around it.
<P>
	Over all these years many of my friends and people I got to know 
have been very actively campaigning for change to the Canadian 
Wheat Board, and there has been no significant change whatsoever.
<P>
<B>(1800 )</B>
<P>
	Finally, this past year the Government of Alberta took the 
initiative to stand with farmers against the Canadian Wheat Board 
monopoly. A fair plebiscite was held and a very high percentage of 
commercial farmers turned out. The result was overwhelming. 
Two-thirds of farmers voted to support the removing of the 
monopoly on barley marketing and 62 per cent voted to support the 
ending of the monopoly on wheat.
<P>
	The farmers in Alberta have decided. They have made up their 
minds and the case is closed. It is now just a matter of the 
agriculture minister carrying out what these farmers want. They 
know it is their right. They voted for the ability to market either 
through the board or on their own.
<P>
	Still the agriculture minister fights by throwing out these minor 
changes to the Canadian Wheat Board which do not solve the
<P>
problem. He keeps saying: ``Wait for the results of the marketing 
panel''. I can tell the House what the results are going to be. They 
will be just as I said they were going to be before the panel began. 
The panel will not lead to changes to the Canadian Wheat Board 
that farmers want. There will be tinkering and there will be talk of 
substantial change. Still the wheat board monopoly on wheat will 
not be ended as a result of this grain marketing panel.
<P>
	It is a sad thing. Why should Canadian farmers be denied the 
right to market their product? They raise it. Nobody else pays the 
cost of putting the crop in, the sweat and the work it takes to seed 
and carry the crop through until harvest and then harvest that crop. 
Nobody else takes the incredible risks that farmers take to produce 
a crop.
<P>
	The government does not take risks for farmers, so why on earth 
are they being denied the right, and it is a right, to market their 
crops the way they see fit. It is time we got beyond the tinkering.
<P>
	There will come a time when farmers will be so upset and 
frustrated by the lack of action that they will say: ``Get rid of board. 
We do not want any part of it anymore''.
<P>
	Why will the minister not act before that happens and head off 
the complete elimination of the board? I do not believe that is what 
the majority of farmers want. They want the right to either market 
through the board or on their own. They want a choice. What other 
industry does not have that choice? I cannot think of one. What is 
the hold up? Why the resistance? Does it have something to do with 
what is going on inside the Canadian Wheat Board? Is there 
something going on inside the board which is not open to access to 
information? I have applied through access to information many 
times to get information about the Canadian Wheat Board. I cannot 
get it. Is that why? I cannot answer that.
<P>
	The agriculture minister had better act on this quickly or the 
Canadian Wheat Board will cease to exist. I think that would be too 
bad.
<P>

	<B>Hon. David Anderson (for the Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-38, an act to provide for mediation between insolvent farmers and 
their creditors, to amend the Agriculture and Agri-Food Administrative 
Monetary Penalties Act and to repeal the Farm Debt Review Act be referred 
forthwith to the Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Mr. Jerry Pickard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am pleased 
to begin debate on the motion to refer Bill C-38, the farm debt 
mediation act, to the Standing Committee on Agriculture and 
Agri-Food prior to second reading.
<P>
	The government promised to give MPs and parliamentary 
committees more influence. By sending bills to committee before 
second reading, something that was done very rarely in the past, we 
are delivering on that promise. This procedure gives committees a 
chance to make major amendments to bills. It also allows us to 
make doubly sure that no concern has been overlooked.
<P>
	The Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food has chosen to follow 
that route with this bill because he wants to ensure that 
stakeholders have every opportunity to be heard on this important 
piece of legislation.
<P>
	As a former chair of the Standing Committee on Agriculture and 
Agri-Food I share with him the confidence that committee 
members will be able to make positive contributions to the farm 
debt mediation process through their deliberations and hearings.
<P>
	The issue of farm debt is not a new one. It has been with us for a 
long time. Farmers must make significant investments in seed or 
stock, fertilizer or feed, machinery or buildings, long before they 
see a return on those investments. They are subject to the whims of 
nature and markets. When these turn bad farm debt can reach crisis 
proportions.
<P>
	That is essentially what happened in the 1980s. High interest 
rates at the beginning of the decade diverted large amounts of cash 
for debt servicing while low returns on sales reduced inflows of 
cash. In addition, market values of many assets, especially land 
values, depreciated over the same period.
<P>
	By the mid-1980s many farmers were in arrears on payments to 
their creditors. In response, the Farm Debt Review Act was 
proclaimed in 1986. That act established farm debt review boards 
in every province to provide impartial third party mediation 
between farmers and creditors.
<P>
	In our 1993 agriculture platform we promised to strengthen the 
farm debt review process. This legislation will do just that. It will 
create a new farm debt mediation service to replace the farm debt 
review boards as they are phased out.
<P>
	This new service will help farmers position themselves to better 
adapt to new income opportunities as well as helping those who are 
experiencing financial difficulties.
<P>
	It has been designed around three major considerations. It should 
build on the existing services and not duplicate them. It should be 
administratively efficient. It should cost less than the existing farm 
debt review board process.
<P>
	Funding for the new service will come from the $240 million 
Canadian adaptation and rural development fund announced in the 
1995 budget to help the sector make a transition to a more efficient 
and competitive market economy.
<P>
<B>(1810 )</B>
<P>
	This proposal was not drafted in an ivory tower by isolated 
bureaucrats. Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada consulted with 
representatives from major farm organizations, provincial 
departments of agriculture and lenders last summer. The 
department also held seven regional focus groups with farmers and 
farm management advisers.
<P>
	The purpose of these consultations was to identify the elements 
of a new farm income review service and possible ways to deliver 
it. The department then drafted a program design reflecting what 
emerged from the consultations as the most important elements of 
the new service.
<P>
	A national consultative review committee was set up with 
representatives from farm organizations, lenders and two 
provincial governments. The committee met last December to 
discuss the proposed program design and identify concerns and 
suggestions.
<P>
	In January, the Farm Debt Review Boards and all provincial 
governments were invited to comment on the proposal. Based on 
the input received, the government is proposing the farm debt 
mediation service. The new farm debt mediation service will 
provide insolvent farmers the same benefits as the current Farm 
Debt Review Boards, that is a stay of proceedings, a review and 
mediation.
<P>
	Essentially it will continue to allow them to undergo mediation 
and work out, with their creditors, a way to resolve their debts. One 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3955"> 3955 </A></B>
<P>
change from the current procedure is that farmers and creditors 
would be able to appeal decisions on stays of proceedings to an 
appeal board.
<P>
	The current Farm Debt Review Board members could be 
appointed to the new appeal board while qualified mediators would 
be selected through the regular government contracting process. 
Farm Debt Review Board members, who are currently mediators 
under the Farm Debt Review Board Act, could be put on the list of 
mediators under this new program. Mediators would act alone 
rather than in three-member panels as they do under the current act.
<P>
	These changes and the limiting of the new proposed act to 
insolvent farmers could reduce the program costs by more than $1 
million per year from an estimated $3.5 million in 1995-96 to $2.2 
million per year.
<P>
	The consultations also showed that farmers and farm 
organizations, provincial representatives and industry could 
support a consultation service that is not tied to a debt crisis. Such a 
farm consultation service would concentrate on financial 
assessments to help farmers who have cash flow problems and to 
identify income opportunities and reduce costs to develop more 
viable operations.
<P>
	Depending on their particular situation, farmers could also be 
referred to provincial extension staff, other federal or provincial 
programs or the private sector as appropriate for other types of 
services.
<P>
	Because referral to other services and programs will be a key 
component of the farm consultation service, it is important that 
delivery of this service be developed through further consultations 
with farm organizations and others such as lenders, Canadian farm 
business management program members and the provinces.
<P>
	It would also be important to have an up to date inventory of 
services in every province. Delivery costs for the farm consultation 
service would be kept to a minimum. This service could be 
delivered by the farm debt mediation offices or it could be 
developed and delivered in co-operation with the provinces or 
other existing programs where appropriate. The service would 
provide assistance to help farmers look at other income 
opportunities for diversifying, expanding and creating value added 
enterprises and to develop farm plans.
<P>
	I have just explained how the new farm debt mediation act would 
work. I would ask members of the House to approve the motion to 
refer this proposed legislation to committee now, prior to second 
reading.
<P>
<B>(1815)</B>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, my 
remarks in this debate at the second reading stage of Bill C-38 are 
essentially based on ethical and philosophical considerations as a 
result of my  parliamentary obligations as agriculture and agri-food 
critic for the official opposition.
<P>
	This statement may seem a bit obscure, but you will soon 
understand my point of view in light of the information I will give 
you.
<P>
	Bill C-38 to provide for mediation between insolvent farmers 
and their creditors will provide an important legal base for 
resolving conflicts of a financial nature. This new act will repeal 
and replace the Farm Debt Review Act, making administrative 
procedures easier for farmers and providing for a more equitable 
settlement for creditors.
<P>
	At first glance, we have to salute this initiative by the department 
which seems to show greater concern for all agricultural producers. 
Several agricultural groups, through their executive committees, 
have supported this piece of legislation. The Bloc Quebecois will 
probably do the same when Bill C-38 is sent to committee for 
clause by clause study.
<P>
	There are, however, some apprehensions on the part of producers 
who will inevitably find themselves in financial difficulty some 
day. Bill C-38 will replace the Farm Debt Review Act, which gave 
producers having financial problems the opportunity to benefit 
from the economic expertise of the Department of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food in order to avoid even more serious problems. In other 
words, the department offered an indebtedness prevention service, 
as well as the technical tools and the support needed to recover 
from these difficult situations.
<P>
	In this perspective, it looks like producers will benefit from a 
more complete support from the department, but only in cases 
where the producer will no longer be able to call the shots. In other 
words, the farmer using the provisions of Bill C-38 will be at the 
mercy of his creditors.
<P>
	To put it another way, in order for a farmer to benefit from this 
new bill, he will, to all intents and purposes, have to have his neck 
in a noose. At that point, he will be at the end of the road, whereas 
before he could start to look at the possibilities before being in debt 
up to his ears.
<P>
	This, then, is the ethical and philosophical dimension I was 
mentioning at the beginning of my speech. How can the 
government refuse, or at least limit, the recourse open to an 
individual faced with a potential crisis? It would perhaps be an idea 
to look more closely at this aspect of the bill, which on the whole is 
innovative and in line with the modern current that has 
characterized the agricultural sector in this country for a number of 
years now.
<P>
	We know for a fact that the government's initiatives to reform 
this sector of agricultural legislation are part of a move to put its 
fiscal house in order.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3956"> 3956 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1820)</B>
<P>
	In fact, this amendment will permit savings of a million dollars. 
This is a huge amount, given that in 1995-96 the government 
invested $3.2 million in this regard. One million over three million, 
or 33 per cent, represents a huge amount percentage- wise. For the 
size of the country, one million is not such a large amount, but still 
it is a beginning. It is a step in the right direction.
<P>
	However, it is vital to ensure that this savings is not achieved at 
the expense of citizens in dire financial straits. For if that were the 
case, this measure would no longer be laudable or profitable. In 
fact, one may wonder if the social costs of this measure would not 
be greater than the resulting savings.
<P>
	On another point, Bill C-38 calls for abolition of the offices 
responsible for mediating between the producer and his debtors, 
replacing them by a similar body of another organization. Looking 
at this in the precise terms of the bill, the mediator's responsibility 
would in future fall to a single individual appointed by a regional 
administrator, himself appointed by the department and responsible 
for implementation of the act at the regional level.
<P>
	Needless to say, this alternative opens up the possibility of 
another ethical problem of considerable scope, relating to the 
appointment of a public servant responsible for default mediation, 
and leaves the door wide open to a sort of latent patronage. It is 
logical to assume that certain hiring criteria might be formulated so 
as to work around the requirements of the Public Service 
Employment Act.
<P>
	In this connection, it is vital for there to be a public debate on the 
appointment of these administrators, so as to ensure that no 
advantage may be taken of the appointment. There must also be 
assurance that there will be a pool of mediators, to avoid the same 
people being used every time.
<P>
	The same logic applies to the designation of the appeal 
committees, also to be set up by the minister. Without becoming 
totally paranoid, the official opposition is entitled to call for more 
details on these specific aspects of the bill. We support the 
principle according to which Bill C-38 will give more 
responsibility to producers in managing their own affairs, 
particularly since this legislative measure will have the effect of 
generating a million dollars worth of savings.
<P>
	In closing, I would like to draw your attention to the way the 
mediator is appointed. Care would have to be taken to avoid 
repetition-and with this I shall close-of the often disgraceful 
actions taken in the Canada Employment Centres, particularly 
when it comes to appointing the chair and the members of an 
arbitration committee. Often people are appointed merely on the 
basis of their political opinions, people who have never been near a 
real live unemployed person.
<P>
	I trust that the mediator will have a better idea of what a 
producer is, what indebtedness is.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I will speak for 10 minutes to Bill C-38, the farm 
debt mediation act. As the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister 
of Agriculture and Agri-Food indicated in his remarks, which were 
similar to remarks he made to Bill C-34, my remarks could be 
similar as well.
<P>
<B>(1825 )</B>
<P>
	I expect we will have ample time to review the bill in committee 
since it is being referred to committee prior to second reading and 
amendments could be considered. Like Bill C-34, we believe Bill 
C-38 could be approved after hearing witnesses and after having a 
longer look at the bill. We might be able to put the bill in an 
acceptable form should the government agree to the amendments.
<P>
	This bill replaces the old Farm Debt Review Board Act with a 
mediation act. It is not an earth shattering measure. It will not 
change the farmscape a whole lot and is not terribly controversial. 
Similar to my comments regarding Bill C-34 which I suggested 
was a diversionary tactic, this bill could fall into the same category. 
Maybe we should call it a stalling tactic in this case.
<P>
	These are desperate times for the Liberals in rural Canada. They 
have snubbed the concerns and values of the rural areas with their 
lack of legislation since taking office in October 1993. One has 
only to mention Bill C-68 to know very quickly that Liberals are 
not very popular in rural Canada. Bill C-68, the gun control bill, 
was an insult to rural Canada. The minister in effect said: ``I do not 
trust you, rural Canada. I do not like your lifestyle and I think I 
should interfere with it''. The Minister of Justice proved that he did 
not understand rural Canada and the members of the rural Liberal 
caucus are desperate for some legislation they can put forward in 
order to say that they are concerned about rural Canada.
<P>
	Bill C-68 to rural Canada was like telling urbanites they could 
only buy a certain brand of car. It was like telling people they had 
to wear a certain style of clothes. This is middle ages stuff which 
certainly does not go over very well in rural Canada. Rural Canada 
is not very happy with this Liberal government. The Liberals are 
grasping at straws to appease some of the bad feelings they have 
created among the voters in the rural ridings right across the 
country.
<P>
	Another piece of legislation this Liberal government thought 
was a tremendous priority and rushed it through a few weeks ago 
was Bill C-33. That also did not go over very well in rural Canada. 
That was the bill the Liberals claimed would prevent 
discrimination against gays and lesbians but which Reformers said 
was actually a stepping stone to special benefits for a group in 
society. We are  justified in our criticism of that bill. Just the other 
day the human rights tribunal indicated that as a result of Bill C-33 
spousal benefits were required by employers.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3957"> 3957 </A></B>
<P>
	The Liberals say: ``We have to counteract this criticism 
somehow. Let us bring in Bill C-38, a bill to bring in a mediation 
act to replace the Farm Debt Review Board Act''.
<P>
	There seems to be some unhappy Liberal members when I talk 
about Bill C-33 so maybe I should mention a couple of statistics. 
Recently an Angus Reid survey showed what is happening in rural 
Canada as far as the issue of spousal benefits is concerned. I was 
going to move on but they seem to want me to talk about this issue 
some more.
<P>
	In Manitoba and Saskatchewan, 54 per cent of the people on the 
prairies, urban and rural-and I am sure it is even stronger in the 
rural parts of the provinces-are opposed to spousal benefits, and 
another 4 per cent are undecided. It is strong opposition. In Alberta 
it is even higher at 55 per cent opposed and 7 per cent undecided. It 
is a smaller minority that supported the actions of the Liberal 
government in Bill C-33.
<P>
	In trying to heal the wounds, the Liberals have brought forward 
Bill C-34 and Bill C-38. They can talk about the wonderful things 
they will accomplish with these two pieces of legislation as they 
simmer on the back burner over the summer. Then we will get into 
studying them in the fall when we come back.
<P>
	Why is farm debt a problem? And it is a problem. Farm debt has 
been a problem for quite some time. Let us look back to what the 
Farm Credit Corporation did a decade or two ago. It became the 
lender of last resort.
<P>
<B>(1830 )</B>
<P>
	It made some very foolish loans, loans it should not have made. 
It actually was the leader that got a lot of banks and credit unions 
pushed in that direction as well. It was making loans based on 
unreasonably high expectations in the farm sector.
<P>
	Then the farm sector was hit with high interest rates of 19, 20, 21 
up to 25 per cent interest rates plus falling farm commodity values 
which occurred during the 1980s. Suddenly a lot of farmers had 
lost their equity, had a high debt load and were not able to carry that 
load in their operation.
<P>
	The Farm Credit Corporation took ownership of the land. The 
banks took title to the land. The Farm Debt Review Board was put 
in place to facilitate agreements between the lenders and the land 
owners to ease the pain that a lot of farm producers were going 
through when they were not able to make their payments to the 
Farm Credit Corporation and the other lenders.
<P>
	The Farm Credit Corporation seems to be back in this business 
again of offering loans that perhaps it should not be offering. The 
minister has talked about expanding  the role of the Farm Credit 
Corporation. Again we see land values escalating. We have to 
wonder if we will retrace the steps we took during the 1980s. This 
farm mediation act may have more impact in the future than we 
might wish to believe at the current time.
<P>
	It is fine and good to look at bills like the farm mediation act as a 
way to facilitate some of the problems farmers find themselves in 
when they become cash strapped and unable to make their 
payments on loans they have taken out.
<P>
	Let us look at the industry in broader terms and determine why 
farmers and other businesses get themselves into problems in 
Canada and we have bankruptcies, foreclosures and land going into 
receivership. It is because the cost of doing business in Canada is 
very high.
<P>
	If the Liberal government would address that concern first 
before it replaces the Farm Debt Review Board Act with the farm 
mediation act it would be of far more benefit to producers who are 
feeling the cost-price squeeze than this piece of legislation which it 
is using to divert attention away from its lack of action.
<P>
	Canadian farmers pay high taxes. The Liberal government has 
increased taxes and seems bent on maintaining a high cost of doing 
business in Canada. Farm inputs are high. The committee looked at 
farm inputs. It realized that some of the input costs are high 
because of the regulatory burden placed on farmers.
<P>
	We recently had an ag-biotechnological conference in 
Saskatchewan where the premier of Saskatchewan said one of the 
high costs placed on that industry is that of high regulation. The 
pesticide registration act needs to be changed because of the 
regulatory burden passed on to consumers.
<P>
	While Bill C-38 may be well and good to debate in the House, 
and I am sure we will when we come back in the fall, it is not the 
key critical area that will prevent farm debt from being a problem. 
It is the high cost of doing business in this country. It is high taxes 
and high regulations that are the problem.
<P>
	The other concern we have with the bill is that we do not allow 
patronage as we saw in the form of patronage appointments to the 
Farm Debt Review Board. We want to make sure these mediators 
are appointed or chosen or based on their merit and their credibility 
rather than on the fact that they happen to hold a Liberal 
membership. I think that is extremely important.
<P>
	We look forward to making improvements to the bill when it 
comes back in the fall.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Marlene Cowling (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Natural Resources, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am more than 
pleased to have the opportunity today to speak on a very important 
piece of legislation for farm families, Bill C-38, the farm debt 
mediation act.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3958"> 3958 </A></B>
<P>
	This new legislation will replace the current Farm Debt Review 
Act with a new farm debt and mediation process. This is another 
example of how the Liberal government is putting the needs of 
rural Canada, of farm families and farmers first. It is one of a long 
list of initiatives we are undertaking to improve the system to 
better serve the agricultural sector.
<P>
	This new act addresses the problems that farmers have identified 
over the years with the Farm Debt Review Board system. It goes a 
long way to improving the farmer's position in insolvency 
proceedings.
<P>
<B>(1835)</B>
<P>
	The Farm Debt Review Act first came into being 10 years ago in 
response to debt problems in the farm sector at that time. It 
established farm debt review boards in every province to provide 
third party mediation between farmers and their creditors.
<P>
	With the passage of this new act, the Farm Debt Review Board 
would be replaced by a new broader based farm income review 
service. This new service will help farmers position themselves to 
better adapt to new income opportunities to help those farmers who 
may experience financial difficulties related to either income or 
debt servicing ability.
<P>
	This is a proactive approach. We are setting up a system to help 
farmers before difficulties become debt load problems with 
creditors. We are giving farmers more options and better 
opportunities to make their operations viable and stay on to do 
what they do best, to farm, to produce high quality food and to feed 
the world.
<P>
	The government developed the concept for this new service to 
compliment the other positive initiatives we have taken in the areas 
of agriculture and agri-food.
<P>
	This legislation is the result of cross-Canada consultations with 
farmers and their creditors as well as provincial governments. It is 
therefore not surprising that there is widespread support for the 
initiatives of the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food.
<P>
	In keeping with the Liberal government's strong record of 
consulting with Canadians, we are proposing to refer the act to the 
standing committee before second reading to give farmers every 
opportunity to add their input.
<P>
	The best solutions are found through consultation and 
co-operation. That is exactly what the government is doing with 
farmers for farmers. This new service is designed to be an integral 
part of an overall package of adaptation initiatives aimed at helping 
the sector adapt and take advantage of opportunities to build a 
strong rural Canada.
<P>
	The service will be funded out of the Canadian adaptation and 
rural development fund which was announced in the 1995 budget to 
help the sector make the transition to a more efficient and 
competitive market economy.
<P>
	The new legislation retains the stay of proceedings, review and 
mediation but now puts the mediation aspect into legislation. By 
placing mediation within the act, farmers are assured of an 
impartial mediation process and that the mediator is not advising 
the farmer or negotiating on behalf of the farmer or the creditor.
<P>
	Further, farmers will not have the opportunity to appeal 
decisions regarding the granting, extension and termination of 
stays of proceedings which do not exist under the existing act.
<P>
	By setting up an appeal process and a formal appeal board, the 
Liberal government is giving farmers a further recourse. In keeping 
with the government's commitment to reduce cost of government 
and to save taxpayer dollars, this new service would be less costly 
to administer with the current Farm Debt Review Board.
<P>
	Since it is less administratively cumbersome, there would be 
better opportunities to reduce duplication and to work within 
provincial mediation services. There would be two components of 
the new farm income review service, a debt mediation service and a 
farm consultation service not tied to a debt crisis.
<P>
	The new debt mediation service would also be based on a single 
mediator model rather than the current three-person panel. There 
would no longer be farm debt review boards and mediators would 
not be appointed by the minister.
<P>
	We are depoliticizing the process to the benefit of farmers. These 
changes would reduce the program cost by more than $1 million 
per year.
<P>
	The other component of the new farm income review service, the 
farm consultation service, would provide financial consultation to 
farmers facing emerging problems or when farm families are 
looking for opportunities.
<P>
	The service would be preventive in nature and would provide 
advice on cash flow problems as well as helping farmers look at 
options for diversification, expansion, downsizing and 
restructuring their operations.
<P>
	The bill will help farmers better manage their economic future 
and will help increase the overall prosperity of our agricultural 
sector and of our rural communities.
<P>
	There is more optimism in the agriculture sector than I have ever 
seen. That optimism is the result of the positive policies the 
government is putting place like new legislation to help farmers.
<P>
<B>(1840)</B>
<P>
	I saw this optimism this past weekend when I had the pleasure of 
attending a centennial farm celebration for the Dalgeish family in 
Grandview. Four generations of the Dalgeish family have toiled
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3959"> 3959 </A></B>
<P>
for long hours in very difficult conditions through the dirty thirties, 
through searing heat and bitter cold, through droughts and floods, 
through strong markets and world price wars. They have 
persevered and worked the same farm for 100 years, and that is 
certainly something worth celebrating. I am a third generation 
farmer and I know how important it is to ensure the farming 
tradition continues.
<P>
	I am pleased to be part of a government that is putting in 
proactive farmer initiative policies for long term survival and 
prosperity of family farms, policies to ensure we have many more 
centennial farms to celebrate.
<P>
	I have always been and I continue to be an ambassador for rural 
Canada, an ambassador for rural economic development. Never in 
Canadian history has the future of rural Canada looked so bright, 
and this is at least in part due to the very positive action the 
government has taken to enhance the agricultural sector. The 
government is putting in place the foundations needed to take rural 
Canada, farmers, into the 21st century. For this reason I 
wholeheartedly support the bill.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I would like right off to say hello to a friend of in North Bay, 
Ontario, named Jean Tanguay. He is perhaps watching, and I 
wanted not only to indicate his presence, but also to tell him that I 
cannot right now talk about francophone issues or the problems 
faced by francophones in Ontario, but am rising to speak to an 
agricultural issue, Bill C-38.
<P>
	It is in fact the Farm Debt Mediation Act. I am delighted to see 
that the Farm Debt Review Act is being spruced up. As you will 
recall, this act was passed in 1986, ten years ago, when an 
exceptionally high number of farm families were forced to give up 
farming, because they could not meet their debt obligations.
<P>
	Debt review offices were set up in each province at the time. The 
aim of Bill C-38 is to facilitate mediation between insolvent 
farmers and their creditors. It is also to amend the Agriculture and 
Agri-Food Administrative Monetary Penalties Act. Bill C-38 
repeals and replaces the Farm Debt Review Act and provides 
initially for a review of the financial situation of an insolvent 
farmer and subsequently for financial arrangements with creditors, 
hence the importance of mediation, and, as appropriate, the 
suspension of the creditors' right to take proceedings against a 
farmer in serious difficulties.
<P>
	Bill C-38 also provides for the Agriculture and Agri-Food 
Administrative Monetary Penalties Act to apply in the case of 
contravention.
<P>
	My party, the Bloc Quebecois, supports the objectives of Bill 
C-38 in general terms. It is not a controversial bill. It appears to 
respond satisfactorily to the concerns of farmers, with the 
exception of financial institutions.
<P>
	This bill is the result of extensive consultations involving all 
stakeholders, which showed that despite the need to maintain the 
stay of proceedings clause and to keep on helping through 
mediation, changes could be made to improve efficiency and lower 
costs.
<P>
	When we look closely at the proposed bill, we find that farmers 
in financial trouble will no longer qualify. They used to under 
section 20 of the Farm Debt Review Act.
<P>
<B>(1845)</B>
<P>
	Now, the way I see it, there will be only two categories of 
farmers who will qualify. First, commercial farmers, second, 
insolvent farmers, that is farmers who can no longer meet their 
obligations when they come due or those whose property, if sold, is 
not sufficient to pay off all their debts.
<P>
	Bill C-38, as it now stands, tightens up eligibility criteria. Under 
those conditions, we must wonder what would happen to farmers in 
financial trouble. Would they have to wait to be insolvent to qualify 
for help? I will point out that this is a rather strange kind of 
medicine. Personally I would choose to help farmers put their 
financial house in order before they become insolvent. Even though 
it might be a little late to act, better late than never. We must act 
while there is still time. This is the reason why I am asking the 
government to do something so that farmers in trouble might also 
get some respect from the government.
<P>
	We are told that the new service will be less costly and 
cumbersome. However, this is one of the particular aspects of Bill 
C-38 which bother me. Another one is the entrenchment of 
mediation in the legislation. Under the Farm Debt Review Act, 
there was a certain amount of mediation, of course. However, with 
Bill C-38, mediation will be an integral part of the legislation and 
will ensure a fair process since the mediator will be the mediator. In 
other words, the mediator will not be in a position to give advice 
either to the farmer or to his creditors. His title says so. He must 
remain a mediator.
<P>
	Another aspect of this bill which bothers me is the power of the 
minister to designate administrators, as it is stated in clause 4(a). 
Let me explain. Bill C-38 abolishes regional offices created by 
order in council since services will now be rendered by regional 
administrators responsible for the enforcement of the Farm Debt 
Mediation Act. These administrators will be appointed according 
to the Public Service Employment Act.
<P>
	What bothers me is that the minister will have the power to 
designate individuals who are not public servants under the terms 
of the Public Service Employment Act if these persons meet the 
requirements set by the minister. Are we to understand that some of 
these regional administrators will be appointed in accordance with 
criteria determined by the minister? If such is the case, I believe we 
should debate that point. If the minister can designate administra-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3960"> 3960 </A></B>
<P>
tors in accordance  with criteria different from those set out in the 
Public Service Employment Act, how can we be sure the present 
minister, or an eventual successor, will not use that clause for 
partisan purposes?
<P>
	As far as the choice of mediators is concerned, we just learned 
that they will be chosen through a bidding process and that a large 
pool of mediators will be established. There again, we can 
legitimately question the process for the choice of one or all 
mediators. Given the actions of this government in several 
instances, we have every reason to ask if there will be patronage 
involved. This government is clearly too prone to patronage. At 
one point, there even was a Tory member and minister, the member 
for Joliette, the Hon. Roch LaSalle, who said that patronage was a 
normal part of politics.
<P>
	This has been shown to be true in many instances. It is not only 
the case with Pearson airport, but also with Expressvu and others. 
This government indulges in a lot of patronage, particularly in the 
contracting out of public works. There is a lot of patronage there, 
and I daresay I would not want it to extend to agriculture, which is 
such an important sector for the future of many people. I believe 
the government, through its minister, must convince and reassure 
us that this will not happen.
<P>
<B>(1850)</B>
<P>
	Furthermore, we should pay attention to the standards to be 
applied to the salary of both regional administrators and mediators. 
On another level, the program administrator will be able to 
designate an expert to do the financial assessment or an expert to 
develop options to be considered in the course of the mediation.
<P>
	Once again, what are the criteria for the selection of these 
experts? We are told the government could leave it up to the farmer, 
by giving him the resources necessary, to hire of the expert or the 
financial counsellor of his choice. What are the criteria or the 
requirements? You know, when we say ``could'', this does not 
necessarily mean it is an inalienable right.
<P>
	Moreover, there are the twenty or so members who will at some 
point sit on the appeal committee. Once again, they would be 
appointed by the minister. We are told they would come from the 
farming community as much as possible. Again, this is perhaps 
only lip service, without any serious guarantee, I believe.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to make a few comments on Bill C-38, the 
debt mediation act.
<P>
	When I think back, only twice in history have farmers had to use 
this type of vehicle to stay solvent. The one vehicle I can barely 
remember as a child was called the debt adjustment board, 
something the government implemented shortly after the great 
depression.
<P>
	The debt adjustment board was designed to keep farmers on the 
land. It gave them a chance to restructure. It took the clout of 
creditors away. They could not foreclose for a certain amount of 
time. It gave farmers a chance to get back on their feet.
<P>
	Bill C-38, the farm debt mediation act, is probably a quick end to 
ending the misery of a farmer already in financial problems. The 
120-day period of grace for a farmer with serious financial 
problems is not even a glimpse of hope.
<P>
	When we look at the Canadian Wheat Board taking at least a 
year and six months to sell grain and to pay out final payments, 
how is a farmer supposed to reorganize his financial house in 120 
days or a third of the crop year?
<P>
	We have to look back at what created this big problem. I have 
heard many kind comments about the present Liberal government. 
I wish the past Liberal governments of the seventies and early 
eighties had been just as kind. They were the governments that 
allowed inflation to creep up to 15 per cent and 18 per cent, and 
interest rates up to 24 per cent. Bankers, accountants and financial 
planners told farmers they had to specialize and to redesign their 
farming operations so that they milked 100 cows instead of 25 
cows and raised 10 pigs and some chickens. They had all the 
answers for farmers. They were supposed to have a better 
livelihood.
<P>
	All of a sudden in 1981-82 when the crunch really hit interest 
rates rose to 24 per cent and it was only people like Mr. Gordon 
Sinclair who said there was no crisis or debt problem. Those people 
raked in huge profits and farmers suffered. They could not dig 
themselves out of their debt load.
<P>
	If it had not been for the Conservatives coming through in 1986 
with a number of huge payments to farmers, there probably would 
not be a farmer left in western Canada today. If it were not for 
FSAM I and FSAM II which doled out billions of dollars, not 
millions, farmers would not have survived to this point.
<P>
	Because the Conservatives organized the debt review board 
which helped a lot of farmers to restructure, the kind Liberal 
government is now trying to say that it will get the few guys still 
left in misery out in a hurry; in 120 days it will be over for them. I 
do not see the kindness from the government I have been hearing 
about tonight.
<P>
<B>(1855)</B>
<P>
	Why should a farmer who has suffered for 10 years have the final 
bell rung? Why should he be told in another 120 days the game will 
be over? Is that the nice, compassionate government we see in the 
House? Or, is it just another way of more or less getting into the 
type of farming system we see in communist countries?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3961"> 3961 </A></B>
<P>
	It bothers me when I have heard financial advisers and planners 
tell us for 10 years what we have to do and suddenly in the middle 
of the course they pull the plug and say we have to do something 
else.
<P>
	I wonder why farmers are put in jail or are fined thousands of 
dollars for trying to market their grain at a better price. I cannot see 
the kindness of the Liberal government.
<P>
	I will read a couple of words of a writer in the <I>Glenboro Gazette</I> 
in the centre of my riding: ``I don't care if you think the wheat 
board is a gift from God. If they are not held accountable they are 
going to go on filling their own pockets with the hard earned 
dollars of the farmer. And no government official deserves to live a 
better life than the people that elected him or her''.
<P>
	If that is the case, why not give farmers in financial problems a 
million dollar pension plan like the one members in the House are 
getting? That is the way to solve their problems. It would be a lot 
easier to farm from there on. The people who were elected to the 
House are now telling them the game will be over in 120 days. That 
does not seem to be a kind and rational solution.
<P>
	I will read a few lines from another article: ``Illegal grain exports 
earned farmers $302,000''. Two farmers who sold their own grain 
earned an $302,000. The Liberals are trying to tell me that the 
marketing system they think is more or less a godsend or a gift is 
keeping these farmers on the land. It is throwing them off. The 
$302,000 would pay a lot of debt.
<P>
	Mr. Brooks says the loss could have been bigger because some of 
the barley graded as feed sold as malt barley. What is happening? 
Do we have a Canadian Grain Commission that does not know how 
to grade grain? Why do the Liberals not restructure the Canadian 
Grain Commission so we can at least have grain graded properly?
<P>
	It seems strange where the kindness I have heard about this 
evening is coming from and going. It further amazes me when I 
read: ``Rebel farmers' plight against wheat board may not yet be 
over''. Mr. Sawatzky won his case. The judge said that there was no 
breaking of the law and that the Customs Act had not been violated. 
The kind Liberal government will take him for another ride.
<P>
	A wheat board counsellor said: ``An appeal is necessary because 
the order in council wouldn't apply to anyone charged before the 
loophole was closed. There are a significant number of charges still 
out there''. Why not fix those farmers, those poor farmers the 
Liberal government is going to give another 120 days to end it all? 
It seems to me the kindness I have heard about this afternoon is 
probably the kindness of putting them out of misery. The quicker 
the better. It is selective Liberal justice.
<P>
	When I look at a number of bills in the House they remind me of 
a flock of sheep. When a flock of sheep becomes discontented it 
runs around in the pasture looking for a better spot to graze. The 
sheep are not quite sure whether they should stop to graze or 
whether they should break out of the pasture and maybe get into an 
alfalfa field and kill themselves. This is what these bills seem to do.
<P>
	The Liberals are not really sure how they should handle it, but 
they are running around in the pasture trying to divert attention so 
that if they find a hole in the fence to get through nobody will 
notice. Eventually they will probably overeat, bloat and die. That is 
how I see the last two bills the Liberals have introduced.
<P>
<B>(1900 )</B>
<P>
	Every year it astounds me when I see the statistics and there are 
fewer farmers, not more. It is said that if government helps the 
farmer once, he can survive; if it helps him the second time, he is in 
big trouble; but if it helps him the third time, he is finished for sure.
<P>
	I wonder what the third bill will be. We have seen two here 
today. Probably the other one is that whenever a farmer grows a 
bushel of wheat, he should not have any control over it at all. He 
should not even be able to market it to the cattle producers or the 
hog producers. Maybe the government should take that away too, 
like it used to be.
<P>
	We have to start realizing that farmers are some of the best 
managers in the world, but the government still insists that it knows 
better and that it can help them. The only thing it can help them 
with is emptying their pocketbooks. After that has happened, 
usually then there are problems and the government gives them 
another kick in the butt and says: ``Here it is, 120 days and the 
game is over''.
<P>
	Maybe we should have another bill or something to complement 
these bills. Then we could do it all in one swipe. Bills C-34 and 
C-38 are doing a good job. The kindness of the Liberals will be 
well remembered into the future, as was the kindness of the 
Liberals in the 1970s and 1980s. Those days will be remembered as 
long as history stands: 24 per cent interest and inflation at 18 to 20 
per cent.
<P>
	I appreciated the opportunity to speak on this bill. It has been a 
pleasure. I can see the Liberals were listening from the expressions 
on their faces. They paid attention.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Malpeque, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, before 
speaking on Bill C-38 I have to respond to a couple of remarks 
made by the last speaker.
<P>
	The Reform Party continues to use every opportunity it can to 
attack the Canadian Wheat Board. It does so using selective facts. I 
want to underline those selective facts.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3962"> 3962 </A></B>
<P>
	Let me say that if one stacks up the record of the Canadian 
Wheat Board, the orderly marketing system versus the open 
marketing system, the Canadian Wheat Board over the past 20 
years has shone every year. When one takes all the facts and looks 
over the years, it will be found that the Canadian Wheat Board 
has maximized returns back to producers like no other agency 
anywhere in the world.
<P>
	I want the member to recognize that. I know it is hard for him to 
admit he is wrong on that point, but eventually he will have to. We 
will debate the issue at committee and I hope we can clear up his 
mind on that matter.
<P>
	I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on Bill C-38 which 
will repeal the Farm Debt Review Act and introduce a new act to 
facilitate financial arrangements between insolvent farmers and 
their creditors.
<P>
	Let me suggest up front, and I agree with my colleague from 
Lisgar-Marquette on this point, it is a sad commentary that we 
need such acts as the farm debt mediation act that will help 
insolvent farmers gain a settlement with their creditors. It implies 
that there are financial difficulties on the farms at times, and there 
certainly are.
<P>
	Some are caused by management difficulties and many others 
are caused by problems unrelated to the primary producer's ability 
to manage. It may be international monetary flows. It may be 
global prices in terms of commodities. It may be rapidly changing 
interest rates. Many of us, myself included, who are in the farm 
community have faced those kinds of times in the past.
<P>
	In debating this bill this evening thus far, very little has been said 
about the extreme trauma farm families go through when they face 
insolvency. I raise this point because the reason, in part, to change 
the act is that there are far fewer hard financial cases coming 
forward to the Farm Debt Review Board today than there were 10 
or 12 years ago, which is a good thing. When we deal with this 
issue, because times are a little better now, we in this House tend to 
deal with things in the abstract. Being in farm financial difficulty is 
very hard to explain. It is something people cannot understand 
unless they have experienced it.
<P>
<B>(1905)</B>
<P>
	For each farm family that is involved in a serious farm financial 
crisis, it is very troublesome and difficult for them, for the man, his 
wife and their children, in terms of the loss of pride and in many 
cases in terms of losing their heritage, in terms of loss of faith in 
oneself, even though it may not have been a management problem. 
It might have been an international marketing problem or some 
such thing that has put these people into financial difficulty. It is 
extremely painful and troublesome. There have been many suicides 
in the past in the farm community as a result of the farm crisis.
<P>
	Whatever we do with this bill, we have to ensure that the bottom 
line is that we protect those farmers, those families and those rural 
communities that find themselves in financial distress. We have to 
ensure there are ways and means within this bill to protect the 
human aspect beyond the dollars and cents from the difficulties 
caused by the financial problems.
<P>
	Eleven years ago, as president of the National Farmers Union, I 
led a farm finance lobby to lobby on this very issue on this very 
Hill. Yes, we asked for more power. We asked for an appeal 
process. We went far beyond where this bill takes us. But this bill 
does move us a step in a positive direction by putting in legislation 
some of the powers and by establishing an appeal process where 
formal appeals can be made.
<P>
	I said earlier that we must strive to ensure that farm returns 
continue to surpass farm expenses. In all the other legislative 
matters we pursue in this House we must ensure that marketing 
agencies, supply management, the Canadian Wheat Board remain 
strong to ensure that the government through its agencies is 
working the best it can to maximize prices and returns to producers 
from the marketplace.
<P>
	I mentioned that the government cannot knuckle under to a few 
law breakers who are trying to violate the laws of the land in terms 
of surpassing the Canadian Wheat Board. We cannot knuckle under 
to the few Reformers who are speaking out against the good 
marketing institutions we have in this land.
<P>
	Allow me to move to Bill C-38 itself. I agree with the general 
thrust of the bill. I certainly am in favour of this bill moving to 
committee to be debated further. Many of the points in the bill were 
outlined in the Liberal Party document ``Food Security for 
Canadians and a Fair Return for Canadian Farmers'' in which we 
talked about the commitments we would make with respect to farm 
debt review boards.
<P>
	The original and current role of the Farm Debt Review Board 
was outlined in the most recent Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada 
estimates on page 99. It said: ``Farm debt review boards were 
established in 1986 in each province to ensure that farmers in 
financial difficulty or actually facing a farm foreclosure are 
afforded an impartial third party review of individual farm 
circumstances''. That is important.
<P>
	As my colleague from Dauphin-Swan River said earlier, this 
bill moves us toward focusing on farmers in insolvent situations. It 
applies through legislation an impartial administrator and opens up 
an appeal process.
<P>
<B>(1910 )</B>
<P>
	On initial examination of the bill, the provisions would appear to 
limit rather than to expand access to the farm debt review process. I 
have concerns about that and I will be talking about this at 
committee.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3963"> 3963 </A></B>
<P>
	One question which should be addressed is that according to 
the estimates for the department on page 99, since 1986 there have 
been 24,000 applications to the Farm Debt Review Board. The two 
sections applied under were section 16, farmers in financial 
difficulty, and section 20, insolvent farmers.
<P>
	How many of these would have been excluded from the process 
had the insolvency rule applied since the inception of the Farm 
Debt Review Board? According to Agriculture Canada officials, 
approximately one-half of the applications under the former act 
were made for insolvency and the other half under the provisions of 
financial difficulty.
<P>
	However, some of those in financial difficulty were found to be 
insolvent. The point is that perhaps one-third of the applications to 
the Farm Debt Review Board would never have qualified given that 
they were not insolvent. I maintain that the fact they were able to 
go before the Farm Debt Review Board and get mediation services 
and assistance is why many of them were able to keep their farms 
and are on the land today.
<P>
	The bottom line as we debate Bill C-38 is it is important to 
remember that other things have to come into play as well. I 
believe we have to re-examine-

	<B>Hon. David Anderson (for Minister of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development, Lib.)</B> moved that Bill C-39, an act 
respecting the York Factory First Nation and the settlement of 
matters arising from an agreement relating to the flooding of land, 
be read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elijah Harper (Churchill, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
address the House on Bill C-39, the York Factory First Nation 
flooded land act.
<P>
	Hon. colleagues will remember back in June 1994 when this 
House gave second reading to Bill C-36, the Split Lake Cree First 
Nation Flooded Land Act. The flooded lands acts are part of my 
constituency in the  riding of Churchill. The bill before us, the York 
Factory First Nation flooded land act, is very similar to Bill C-36, 
the Split Lake Cree Flooded Land Act which we passed in 1994.
<P>
<B>(1915 )</B>
<P>
	The objective is to enact certain elements of the implementation 
agreement that has been negotiated with the York Factory First 
Nation to fulfil obligations under the Northern Flood Agreement. 
In order to put this bill into perspective I would like to quickly 
remind hon. members about the circumstances that have led us to 
this proposed legislation.
<P>
	In December 1997 the Northern Flood Agreement was signed by 
Canada, the province of Manitoba, Manitoba Hydro and the 
Northern Flood Committee who was acting on behalf of the five 
Manitoba First Nations: the Split Lake Cree, Nelson House, York 
Factory, Norway House and Cross Lake First Nations.
<P>
	The purpose of this agreement was to address the adverse impact 
of hydro-related projects on the Churchill and Nelson Rivers that 
resulted in the flooding of almost 12,000 acres of reserve land in 
northern Manitoba.
<P>
	This project also flooded more than 525,000 acres of non-reserve 
land, much of which was traditionally used by the five First 
Nations for hunting and trapping. The affected waterways were 
also used as a source of drinking water, for recreational pursuits, 
for food and commercial fishing, and for transportation.
<P>
	The flooding had an enormous impact on these communities. It 
has robbed many families of their traditional livelihoods and 
caused many people to leave their communities in search of work 
and a better way of life elsewhere. It resulted in the loss of homes 
and personal property. In total, about 9,000 First Nations people 
were directly affected by the flooding.
<P>
	The Northern Flood Agreement was intended to address the 
problems caused by the flooding, to compensate the five First 
Nations for loss of land and the negative impact on their 
livelihoods. The agreement identified financial compensation, 
community infrastructure programs, land and other benefits that 
will be provided to the affected parties.
<P>
	Hon. members will recall from the debate on Bill C-36 that the 
Northern Flood Agreement did not live up to its promises. The 
agreement is vaguely worded and did not anticipate all issues that 
have since arisen. It did not set out the roles and responsibilities of 
the parties as clearly as we would have liked. As a result, little or 
no progress was made in implementing many elements of the 
agreement.
<P>
	As the implementation process broke down, the affected 
Manitoba First Nations turned to the dispute resolution mechanism 
set out in the Northern Flood Agreement. Over time, more than 170 
claims 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3964"> 3964 </A></B>
<P>
were submitted for arbitration. Like many other elements of the 
agreement, this process turned out to be both inefficient and costly 
for all parties.
<P>
	An important breakthrough was achieved in July 1990, when the 
four parties to the Northern Flood Agreement negotiated the 
proposed basis of settlement as a means of addressing outstanding 
claims and obligations. This proposed basis of settlement is now 
finding a foundation for negotiating implementation agreements 
with the individual First Nations.
<P>
	One such agreement was signed with the Split Lake Cree First 
Nations in 1992, and is now being implemented. The settlement 
agreement provides for financial compensation, increases 
socioeconomic opportunities for the Split Lake Cree and releases 
Canada for all matters being dealt with under this agreement.
<P>
	Implementation agreements have now been completed with two 
additional communities. After ratification by the community late 
last year the York Factory First Nation implementation agreement 
was signed in January. I am pleased to report that these 
negotiations are proceeding with the two remaining First Nations 
affected by flooding, Norway House and Cross Lake.
<P>
	Bill C-39 will not enact an implementation agreement with York 
Factory. The agreement has its own legal force and the parties have 
already begun to implement them. However, as was the case with 
Split Lake, legislation is needed to execute certain provisions of the 
agreement. This is the purpose of Bill C-39.
<P>
<B>(1920 )</B>
<P>
	This bill is virtually identical to Bill C-40. Nevertheless it is 
important that separate legislation be passed to demonstrate 
positive closure of this heated issue in each community. Because of 
difficulties in implementing the Northern Flood Agreement, the 
passing of band specific legislation will be viewed as a significant 
achievement by members of each community.
<P>
	As I indicated a moment ago, Bill C-39 and Bill C-40 will enact 
certain elements of the Nelson House and York Factory 
implementation agreements. Specifically these bills will achieve 
four objectives. First, they will ensure that any lands provided to 
these First Nations in fee simple title will not become special 
reserves under section 36 of the Indian Act.
<P>
	The removal of section 36 application means that the York 
Factory First Nation-as is the case with the Split Lake Cree First 
Nation-will be able to sell their fee simple lands, develop them, 
take out mortgages, and address property taxes pursuant to the 
arrangements with the province. In effect, they can use and control 
these lands as they see fit within the parameters of the provincial 
land regime.
<P>
	Fee simple ownership will also protect the interests of the 
province by placing the land under the provincial land regime. It 
will reduce the administrative burden on the Department of Indian 
Affairs because it will not be responsible for managing these lands 
as it is for reserve lands.
<P>
	Second, this bill will provide that moneys owed under the York 
Factory implementation agreement are not payable to the crown 
and therefore will not be administered as Indian moneys under the 
Indian Act. Instead the moneys will be paid to and administered by 
First Nations trusts at the discretion of the York Factory First 
Nation.
<P>
	This is a very important provision. It will give the affected bands 
much greater control over these moneys than they would have 
under the Indian Act. This in turn removes a potential source of 
friction between the bands and the Department of Indian Affairs 
over how the money should be managed.
<P>
	From the government's perspective this provision will further 
reduce the department's administrative burden. The First Nation 
will have more immediate access to these funds to address their 
own priorities. Nevertheless there will be important controls in the 
form of trust provisions set out in provincial law.
<P>
	Third, this bill will provide that certain types of claims can 
continue to be made under the Northern Flood Agreement. 
However, if the applicable implementation agreement also 
provides for the matter to be settled or adjudicated, the provisions 
of the band specific implementation agreement will take 
precedence over the Northern Flood Agreement process which I 
noted earlier is costly and inefficient.
<P>
	This proposed bill will enable Canada to use the Manitoba 
arbitration act when dealing with any dispute between the parties 
submitted to arbitration under the terms of the Northern Flood 
Agreement. Currently Canada is the only party to the agreement 
that does not have access to these arbitration mechanisms.
<P>
	I want to assure hon. members that the proposed act will not 
establish a new program or provide new benefits to First Nations 
people. It does not include any commitments by the Government of 
Canada that do not already exist under the implementation 
agreements themselves. We are simply fulfilling commitments 
made by government to aboriginal people which is something we 
said we would do in the red book and which we have been 
progressively doing for the past two and a half years.
<P>
	I am pleased that this agreement, and particularly the elements 
we are proposing to execute through legislation, will take us further 
down the path toward self-government. Bill C-39 will empower 
First Nations' leaders and the compensation provisions of the  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3965"> 3965 </A></B>
<P>
implementation agreements will provide the means by which 
community conditions can be improved.
<P>
	The provisions for fee simple ownership of land and to place 
compensation moneys under First Nations control are both 
important steps to ward increased self-reliance and 
self-government.
<P>
<B>(1925 )</B>
<P>
	Under this approach, the First Nations' leaders will be 
accountable to their own members for spending, investment and 
land management decisions. This is a significant move away from 
the Indian Act and toward self-government, one that I 
wholeheartedly support.
<P>
	In terms of improving community conditions, we need only look 
at the Split Lake Cree First Nation, which has been implementing 
its settlement agreement since 1992, to see examples of positive 
progress.
<P>
	First and foremost, the agreement has put to rest a divisive issue 
in the community. As well, Split Lake now has the ability to 
manage water flows, which means that community members are 
better equipped and able to pursue their traditional lifestyles.
<P>
	Through the Tataskweyak Trust, the Split Lake Cree First Nation 
is using its compensation money wisely and for the benefit of its 
members. This money is being used for socioeconomic 
development, to support resource harvesting, to compensate 
members for certain types of losses as a result of the flooding, to 
build remedial works and much more.
<P>
	Chief Norman Flett, who negotiated the Split Lake settlement 
agreement, appeared before the Standing Committee on Aboriginal 
Affairs and Northern Development during the committee's review 
of Bill C-36. At that time, he told the committee that the 
implementation agreement had given his First Nation a huge lift in 
trying to improve community conditions.
<P>
	His comments were echoed by John Peter Mayham, another 
witness from split Lake, who told the standing committee:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The money and the benefits we receive from our settlement are mainly used 
to build the community. We are reinvesting the dollars in the community. 
Before, 60 per cent of the income on a reserve went off reserve. That's why 
we're trying to capture our own money from the reserve and invest it inside the 
community-we're encouraging individual band members to go into their own 
economic development, their own businesses.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The benefits of the settlement agreement are visible throughout 
the Split Lake Cree community. Settlement moneys have already 
been used to build an arena, housing units and a mini-mall. 
Programs have been established related to business development, 
trapping, culture and recreation.
<P>
	In the case of the business development program, any band 
member, whether living on reserve or off reserve, can apply for 
funding.
<P>
	When Mr. Mayhem appeared before the standing committee, he 
reported that the band was exploring major joint ventures with 
outside construction companies. For example, a $2.7 million 
Manitoba Hydro contract was entered into as a joint venture 
between Split Lake Construction Company and Comstock Canada 
Company Ltd. Another $640,000 Manitoba Hydro contract was 
awarded to Split Lake Construction Company.
<P>
	The Split Lake First Nation has also become one of the major 
shareholders of a company that manages capital projects for First 
Nations in several provinces. I am particularly impressed by an 
initiative of the Tataskweyak Environmental Agency, which has 
also been established by the Split Lake Cree First Nation. The 
agency's water quality monitoring program is so successful that the 
individuals responsible for the program have been invited to many 
other communities to provide information and guidance on water 
monitoring.
<P>
	As parties to the implementation agreements, the province of 
Manitoba and Manitoba Hydro support Bill C-39. In fact, the 
provincial government is now in the process of drafting companion 
legislation to this bill, as required by the implementation 
agreements. The provincial legislation will further protect the 
interests of the bands.
<P>
	This bill was developed in close consultation with the affected 
First Nations. Meetings were held only last month involving 
Canada, the province of Manitoba, Manitoba Hydro and the York 
Factory First Nations to discuss the proposed act.
<P>
<B>(1930 )</B>
<P>
	Minor revisions have been made to address First Nation's 
concerns. I want to assure hon. members these acts will in no way 
affect the other three Northern Flood Agreement bands, including 
the two that have not yet signed settlement agreements, Cross Lake 
and Norway House.
<P>
	I want to make it perfectly clear that the proposed act is not 
necessary to execute the implementation agreement with the York 
Factory First Nation. However, the act is necessary if we are to 
move away from the expensive and frustrating process of the 
Northern Flood Agreement.
<P>
	It is necessary if we are to give the First Nation control over their 
compensation money and fee simple lands. It is necessary if we are 
to continue to move away from the paternalistic Indian Act and 
toward increased self-sufficiency, self-reliance and 
self-government.
<P>
	By giving its approval to Bill C-36 several months ago, the 
House has already endorsed the government's approach to 
resolving outstanding issues related to the Northern Flood 
Agreement. I therefore urge my hon. colleagues to join me in 
supporting this legislation which will achieve the same positive 
objectives in other 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3966"> 3966 </A></B>
<P>
affected communities. I support the bill and thank you, Mr. 
Speaker, for letting me comment.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ): </B>Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise today to speak to Bill C-39. We are, in fact, treading 
familiar grounds, as a bill concerning Split Lake, which was passed 
by this House over a year ago, contained more or less the same 
provisions.
<P>
	York Factory is one of five Cree communities covered by the 
agreement under consideration today. We are therefore in familiar 
territory.
<P>
	As is my habit, I did a little research this afternoon because I like 
looking at things in context, rather than jumping straight into 
something that is very arid. I read about the customs and the people 
in that location, how long they have been there, and so on. I 
discovered that some 200 years ago, when the first Europeans 
arrived, they referred to the Cree as the ``Cristinos''. I do not know 
whether my hon. colleague from Churchill already knows any of 
this, but that was what they were called in those days. It appears 
that, over time, the ``Cristinos'' became the Cree.
<P>
	Let us say that these people have claimed an extremely large 
territory that I will be happy to describe for you. It could even be 
argued-as they do, probably with good reason-that the First 
Nations have occupied this territory for the past 15,000 years. They 
have been there for a very long time indeed. As I said, this territory 
is huge, extending from the east side of James Bay to all the rivers 
in the north leading to James Bay, to the northernmost point of 
Lake Winnipeg.
<P>
	Interesting discoveries were made there. Anthropologists and 
archaeologists have found, among other things, pottery at least 
1,000 years old, created by these people's ancestors. I mentioned 
earlier that the Cree claim to have been living on this land for 
nearly 15,000 years now. At the time of European contact 200 years 
ago, there were more than 15,000 Cree Indians here, who spoke 
Cree; today there are still 11,000 Cree in five communities who 
still use the Cree language.
<P>
	As for their culture and their art, which are still alive today, 
several pieces of embroidery were found, especially pieces made 
with moose and reindeer hair. Artefacts from that time were found 
and today still, the mark of their art is recognizable. Just by looking 
at Cree art and clothing, you can see how important embroidery 
was and still is in their culture.
<P>
<B>(1935)</B>
<P>
	I have also found how Europeans described the Cree at the time. 
Two hundred years ago, the Cree were said to be a dashing people, 
with elegance, great people skills and a way with words. These 
features were easy to recognize in Mr. Coon-Come and other Cree 
leaders from Manitoba, with whom I have regular contact. It is  
clear that these people are born diplomats who proudly speak up for 
their culture and the people they represent. They are indeed very 
eloquent.
<P>
	All you have to do to convince yourself is to listen to Mr. 
Coon-Come speak Cree, because that is the tradition at these kinds 
of meetings: they speak together in their mother tongue at first. I 
am always dazzled by how rich the Cree language is. We will be 
listening to what they are saying through the voice of an interpreter 
and, now and them, we will take off our earpiece, just for the 
pleasure of hearing this rich language. It is always very nice to see 
these people speak their own language at first.
<P>
	After these few words of introduction, allow me to move on. I do 
not wish to get into the bill per se right away, because this is not a 
very complicated bill, with its seven or eight clauses. I am more 
interested in what drives this bill.
<P>
	In the case of this bill, as with the one on Split Lake, we had to 
look at what is called the Northern Flood Agreement. This 
agreement was reached in 1977. It was signed a bit hurriedly, 
because Hydro Manitoba had started the project seven years earlier. 
At some point, someone thought: ``Maybe we should reach an 
agreement with the aboriginals who are claiming these reserves and 
who live close to the huge project going on''.
<P>
	So, the Northern Flood Agreement was signed in 1977 by a few 
parties, namely the Department of Indian Affairs, the Province of 
Manitoba and the Northern Flood Committee. At the time, the five 
aboriginal communities had appointed a group to represent them 
and to speak on their behalf. These communities were Split Lake, 
which has already reached the agreement regarding which a bill 
was passed here. Now, it is the turn of York Factory, to be followed 
a little later on this evening by Nelson House. I imagine the other 
two communities, Norway House and Cross Lake, are negotiating 
and have not yet reached an agreement.
<P>
	So, after signing the agreement in 1977, Hydro Manitoba 
quickly flooded 11,861 acres of land, or almost 10 per cent of the 
claimed Cree territory. Environmental studies showed that this 
measure had a rather disastrous impact on the traditional aboriginal 
land, including the land used for trapping and hunting.
<P>
	Let us not forget that we are dealing here with a mentality 
different from ours, particularly mine. Indeed, I come from an 
urban setting and, while I enjoy canoeing on the Richelieu River, I 
am not interested in hunting and fishing as a way of life. The 
federal government stopped the funding in May, an action that 
undermined the solidarity that existed between natives and the five 
communities against the federal government. Obviously, with the 
demise of the committee, things started to fall apart, and 
communities began negotiating on an individual basis. But on the 
aborigi-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3967"> 3967 </A></B>
<P>
nals' side, it must be understood that this is a way of life and an 
important  tradition for them. I have often said that what probably 
matters most now in our society is a happy marriage between 
modern life and aboriginal tradition.
<P>
	So a major portion of their traditional hunting, trapping and 
fishing activities was destroyed. All along, there were attempts to 
remedy that with all kinds of committees, but in the end what I will 
describe to you is not very pretty picture either because you have to 
see how the government proceeded.
<P>
	The government proceeded by looking at the main harmful 
impacts. It looked for a means of arbitration to do it. What was 
provided for initially in the convention was a form of consensus; it 
is traditional, among aboriginal people, to try to attain one's goals 
by consensus. By setting up an arbitration mechanism to decide on 
all the harmful impacts-which were not even defined as I will 
explain later on-we ended up with conflict instead of consensus. 
That was a very bad move.
<P>
<B>(1940)</B>
<P>
	It must be realized that once a convention is concluded, there 
should be some current implementation. The aboriginals were 
relying on the Northern Flood Committee which was looked on as a 
precursor to bring aboriginal nations together to face up to giants 
like Manitoba Hydro, the Manitoba government and the 
Department of Indian Affairs.
<P>
	So the Northern Flood Committee, in a sense, had an 
enforcement role for all aspects of the convention. Since there was 
now someone to ensure the day to day enforcement of the 
convention, it was quickly realized how important funding was. 
That is where things started to go wrong. I inform you that the 
Northern Flood Committee was disbanded in May.
<P>
	The government managed a breakthrough by slowly isolating the 
communities. Split Lake was the first to sign, not without a few 
skirmishes with other communities around these megaprojects. 
The Indian affairs committee summoned communities who told us 
they did not like the Split Lake agreement, and that the 
megaprojects would have an impact on them as well as on the Split 
Lake community, and that signing the agreement had broken up the 
five communities' coalition.
<P>
	The funding ended on April 1st, and the solidarity was 
undermined. I am not the only one making these allegations. 
Someone was asked to make a program review as part of the task 
force on program review. That individual said:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
``Internal DIAND reports indicate that from 1977 to 1983 NFA 
bands received $10,000 per capita in benefits while other Manitoba 
bands received $26,000 per capita''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The second quotation is much more important.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
``If one wanted to emasculate the terms of the agreement and deny 
the benefits of it to those entitled, all one would have to do is see 
that the NFC, the Northern Flood Committee, does not function by 
denying it operating funding or expertise''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	By and large, that is what happened. The funding was simply 
stopped, solidarity disappeared and the communities were trapped 
into negotiating on an individual basis, with the result we know 
today.
<P>
	Let me turn now to the scope and impact of the hydro 
development project. It is a major project. James Bay, in Quebec, is 
often talked about because it supposedly devastated the landscape, 
and disturbed the Cree traditional way of life. I do not deny those 
problems, but there is always something subjective in such an 
assessment.
<P>
	One thing is certain, the Manitoba Northern Flood Agreement 
project has had major environmental impacts. Concerning river 
diversions, Hydro Manitoba has diverted up to 90 per cent of the 
Churchill River into the Nelson. Why? Because the power stations 
along the Nelson River needed a higher water rate. So the Churchill 
River was diverted into the Nelson River and that had an impact on 
Lake Winnipeg.
<P>
	Extensive work was done in that area. It is understandable that 
this caused a disruption for the native peoples. The department 
itself recognizes the adverse effects of this project. As I said earlier, 
2,134 square kilometres of land where 10,000 Treaty Crees lived 
were flooded and some commercial and recreational zones 
deteriorated.
<P>
<B>(1945)</B>
<P>
	I talked a little while ago about the hunting and trapping 
territories. Thanks to their hunting and trapping activities, these 
people had developed commercial zones that were disrupted by the 
diversion I have just told you about.
<P>
	There was a decrease in the quality and quantity of fish, 
including higher mercury contamination. Of course, when rivers 
like these are diverted, huge surfaces have to be flooded, bringing 
out the mercury. And then the food chain becomes more and more 
contaminated.
<P>
	Drinking water is contaminated. I will come back to this a little 
later on. You will see that an extensive infrastructure was needed to 
stop this drinking water contamination.
<P>
	There was less and less wildlife to hunt and trap. I think I was 
very clear on that.
<P>
	It became more risky to travel by boat because of the lower water 
level.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3968"> 3968 </A></B>
<P>
	It became more risky to travel in wintertime, since it was now 
impossible to predict how safe the ice was because of the 
abnormal water levels.
<P>
	You see, natives who have been living there for 15,000 years 
know these rivers. They know exactly how to travel in the 
summertime and the wintertime, by canoe or on foot, on these 
waterways.
<P>
	In the wintertime, there is a danger that the ice will melt or that 
their usual ice bridges will no longer be safe. This was even 
recognized by the department. These were the department's words, 
not just mine.
<P>
	Therefore, through the Northern Flood Agreement, Canada 
recognized its responsibilities. In fact, you know that section 35 
recognizes a certain number of rights, and also authorizes a 
provincial body to take or to use Indian lands with the consent of 
the governor in council and under the conditions he sets down.
<P>
	Therefore, with the bill before us and the Split Lake bill, it was 
the responsibility of the federal government to act in this manner.
<P>
	In addition, the Government of Canada undertook to play an 
active role in implementing measures to ensure the viability of the 
communities affected. In this regard, I will describe to you a bit 
later the basis on which the government proceeded. I think that 
there were certain problems of application on the part of the 
government as far as any benefit to these communities was 
concerned.
<P>
	There was also a great deal of ambiguity in the provisions of the 
Northern Flood Agreement. What happened was totally bizarre. An 
agreement was signed, and then, some six years later, given the 
difficulty of application, it was decided to ask for a legal analysis. 
A legal analysis six years after the signing of an agreement is 
almost inexplicable. Furthermore, they hired legal experts to 
explain the different percentages of responsibility of each of the 
levels involved. The agreement itself contains close to a hundred 
pages, and is backed up by interpretation documents of close to two 
hundred pages which were more or less applied.
<P>
	Among other things, what is said about the water supply is far 
from accurate. Reference is made to Canada's obligation to provide 
a continuous supply of drinking water, and Manitoba Hydro's 
obligation to bear 50 per cent of the costs.
<P>
	There is nothing whatsoever about payment schedules, finishing 
projects, or routing the water. As we speak, Canada has footed the 
entire bill and Manitoba Hydro has not yet coughed up a single 
cent. So there are certain problems of application.
<P>
	The Canadian taxpayers are paying for Manitoba's 
infrastructures. I must tell you, moreover, that Quebec did not do it 
this way. Hydro-Québec's commitments concerning James Bay 
were respected to the letter. Representations were even made to the 
federal  government for it to pay its fair share in Quebec, because 
there have been several points of dispute recently, including the 
education of James Bay Cree children. In that case it was the 
Government of Canada which was defaulting on payments to the 
Government of Quebec, whereas this time it is the Government of 
Manitoba which is defaulting on payments to Canada.
<P>
<B>(1950)</B>
<P>
	So Manitoba Hydro gave nothing and we are even told further 
down that there was no expiry date to the agreement as such. It is 
therefore taken for granted that the agreement will come to an end 
once the five communities have signed. It is nevertheless strange 
that almost 20 years later, since the agreement was signed in 1977, 
the relevant legislation is still not completed and there is still no 
deadline for the Northern Flood Agreement.
<P>
	Furthermore, there has been many flaws in the implementation 
of the agreement as such. I raised earlier the issue of consensus 
versus conflict. It is easy to be full of good intentions at the outset 
and say that a consensus will be reached. The five communities 
agree with Manitoba Hydro. They speed things up a bit for the 
signature of the agreement because they know that work started 
seven years earlier. They say a consensus will be reached, they sign 
and there is consensus. Later, they find themselves in arbitration 
with 150 complaints. We can see, as I have said earlier, that 
consensus has been replaced by conflict. I believe this was not the 
intent at the outset but unfortunately the agreement was signed 
rather haphazardly and many problems ensued.
<P>
	You cannot even say that problems are resolved today as I will 
show later when dealing with environmental impacts. People still 
have to deal with the environmental impacts. There has been 
numerous allegations of non compliance with the agreement. The 
issue of damages due to mercury contamination was not specific 
enough so they decided to quarrel about costs, who should pay, who 
is responsible and who should do the environmental follow-up. 
There are also no environmental monitoring mechanisms and 
reports. There are shortcomings as regards the provision of 
drinking water and a lack of commitment to corrective measures.
<P>
	Therefore, even with the contribution of legal experts and legal 
studies, we are still wondering who is responsible for it, and the 
problems remain. Furthermore, Canada issued five complaints 
against Manitoba and Manitoba hydro. Earlier I mentioned the 
figure of $88 million, which was invested in a system to provide 
drinking water. The total bill in 1984-and I return to 1984-was 
$160 million. So the Canadian government has $160 million in 
claims against Manitoba. I mentioned the figure of $80 million 
earlier, but the Government of Canada has put a lot more money in 
this project. In the end, the taxpayers of Canada paid for the people 
of Manitoba.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3969"> 3969 </A></B>
<P>
	Naturally, the auditor general also criticized a number of things 
I think I ought to raise here. A number of problems arise from 
the fact that there was no acceptable implementation plan. Among 
other things, the agreement should have concerned slightly more 
strategic issues, that is, the priorities and time frames for its 
implementation. There is nothing like this in the Northern Flood 
Agreement. Agreements were therefore signed without time 
frames or priorities. So people began in one place, did not finish 
and carried on somewhere else. Since there was no time frame, 
there was no rush. There were certain problems in implementing 
the agreement. With no implementation plan, problems started to 
surface.
<P>
	As for the sources of funding for the various commitments, of 
course, in the terms of the agreement there were commitments by 
Canada, by Hydro Manitoba, the Government of Manitoba, the 
aboriginal people, but there was not enough put down in writing. 
As a result, there is now a free-for-all involving the various parties 
to the agreement, and people are coming up against difficulties 
because no one wants to pay the bills.
<P>
	The parties did not put in place an appropriate monitoring 
mechanism, or implementation evaluation criteria or procedure for 
that matter. So, we ended up with relatively serious problems, that 
the auditor general condemned on several occasions. He also 
indicated that there were deficiencies in terms of monitoring as 
well. There were environmental monitoring groups, among others, 
checking and looking at the impacts on the environment.
<P>
<B>(1955)</B>
<P>
	This impact could be seen but, as you know, this type of 
megaproject requires a rigorously monitored environmental 
process so we can detect problems that are not necessarily apparent 
at first sight. There have been many problems in that regard. We 
realized that a federal interdepartmental committee had been put in 
place and that various federal departments could consult one 
another, but that no specific follow-up was provided for.
<P>
	As for the burden of proof, the parties recognize that the lands, 
activities and lifestyles of the people living on these reserves may 
continue to be adversely affected. Manitoba Hydro was responsible 
for this jurisdiction. Manitoba Hydro has since refused to assume 
any responsibility, arguing that, because there is no definition of 
``harmful effects'', it did not have to pay for the effects that could 
be considered harmful.
<P>
	But these harmful effects can be seen. I made a few comments 
about this earlier. There is the effect of mercury contaminating the 
food chain. All this led to enormous problems.
<P>
	I must keep a few arguments in reserve as Bill C-40 will be 
before us in a few minutes. Bill C-40 is very similar to the bill now 
under consideration. These two bills deal with two neighbouring 
communities. Tonight's bill applies to York Factory, and Bill C-40 
to Nelson House.
<P>
	I do not want to go on and on about the agreement as such, but I 
would like to refer back to it during debate on Bill C-40. There are 
questions relating to the Northern Flood Agreement that must be 
raised. It is very easy to draft a bill with eight clauses. However, as 
the official opposition, we must say that certain things continue to 
be questionable. The fact that agreements are being reached with 
the five communities does not mean our homework is done. There 
are still many things that need to be corrected.
<P>
	The York Factory bill provides that land currently in fee must not 
become reserves under section 35 of the Indian Act. I will tell you 
about it in other speeches, but for each acre used, four are given 
back. Based on my information, the process is not yet completed, 
but we must make sure this land is not turned into Indian reserves.
<P>
	The bill also provides that the amounts paid will not be paid to 
the crown as stated in the Indian Act, but to an aboriginal trust. We 
fully agree with that. I remember making a speech on Split Lake 
and saying that the aboriginals were not people living on some 
southern islands. This was in response to what a Reform Party 
member had said. Personally, I believe aboriginal people are quite 
capable of being responsible for a trust.
<P>
	When these people gain financial independence, they develop 
their own businesses and they certainly do not need the 
authorization of the Department of Indian Affairs to build a house 
or a school. It is incredible to see what happens on a reserve when 
aboriginal people become financially independent.
<P>
	Last summer, I visited a reserve called Les Escoumins, in 
Quebec. Its people developed a beautiful hotel complex on the 
shores of the St. Lawrence River. During the summer, it is packed 
with tourists. There are also several outfitting operations. In my 
opinion, with this money, they are developing one of the most 
beautiful reserves in Quebec. They are even ready to expand and to 
purchase private land.
<P>
	Once financially self-sufficient and no longer subject to the 
Indian Act, natives can manage on their own with remarkable 
results.
<P>
<B>(2000)</B>
<P>
	Under this bill, Canada can also use the Manitoba Arbitration 
Act to settle all disputes. I was unable to study the issue further. I 
imagine the Manitoba Arbitration Act must be a model for 
arbitration. If York Factory and the government agree to ask 
Manitoba to act as a mediator, under the Manitoba Arbitration Act, 
the situation must be appropriate and the work done by this agency 
properly evaluated.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3970"> 3970 </A></B>
<P>
	I conclude on this, because I will have to come back later-as 
will my hon. colleague, I guess-on Bill C-40. The Bloc 
Quebecois members will vote in favour, even if they know that 
the agreement was ratified by the York Factory representatives last 
December, I think. It was ratified recently. We must pass the 
enacting law. Since everything has been concluded to the 
satisfaction of both parties, York Factory and the federal 
government, the Bloc Quebecois will vote for Bill C-39.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Comox-Alberni, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will 
be presenting the Reform position on Bill C-39, the York Factory 
flooded land act and Bill C-40, the Nelson House flooded land act, 
on behalf of my colleague, the member for North Island-Powell 
River.
<P>
	We are here today to debate the second and third in a series of 
five bills dealing with reserve land that belongs to five First 
Nations in northern Manitoba which were flooded in the 1970s.
<P>
	In June 1994 we debated the first bill in this series, Bill C-36, the 
Split Lake Cree First Nation Flooded Land Act. Bill C-36 was an 
enlightened agreement dealing with outstanding native grievances 
and it received support from the Reform Party. Bills C-39 and 
C-40, while dealing with similar subject matter, are unique to the 
York Factory and Nelson House First Nations and require some 
comment.
<P>
	In the 1970s hydro related projects on the Nelson and Churchill 
rivers, along with the Lake Winnipeg regulations project, flooded 
almost 4,800 hectares of reserve land belonging to the five First 
Nations in northern Manitoba. In addition, more than 208,000 
hectares of non-reserve land traditionally used by First Nations 
members for hunting and trapping were also flooded.
<P>
	To address the impact of flooding, the Manitoba Northern Flood 
Agreement was signed by Canada, Manitoba, Manitoba Hydro and 
the northern flood committee made up of the five Manitoba First 
Nations: the Split Lake Cree, Nelson House, York Factory, Norway 
House and Cross Lake First Nations. The agreement included 
financial compensation, community infrastructure programs and 
new land acquisition.
<P>
	Over the intervening years, implementation of the northern flood 
agreement broke down because the roles and responsibilities of the 
parties were not clearly defined and the agreement did not 
anticipate the complexities of concluding such agreements. In 1990 
the parties to the northern flood agreement negotiated a proposed 
basis of settlement. This provided the foundation for negotiating 
implementation agreements with the five individual native bands.
<P>
	Allow me to deal with the objectives of Bills C-39 and C-40 
which are before us. They are identical in scope and focus but not 
in compensation. The bills contain four basic elements which my 
colleagues have touched on.
<P>
	The first element is to provide that fee simple lands are not 
subject to becoming special reserves under sections 35 and 36 of 
the Indian Act.
<P>
	The second element is to provide that moneys allowed under the 
York Factory implementation act and the Nelson House 
implementation act are now payable to the crown as Indian moneys 
as defined in section 35(4) of the Indian Act, but are administered 
by a First Nations trust.
<P>
	The third element is to provide that the claims which may be 
made under either the northern flood agreement, the York Factory 
implementation agreement or the Nelson House implementation 
agreement be administered according to the terms of the applicable 
implementation agreement.
<P>
	The fourth element is to enable Canada to utilize the Manitoba 
Arbitration Act when dealing with any dispute between the parties 
submitted to arbitration under the terms of the York Factory 
implementation agreement or the Nelson House implementation 
agreement.
<P>
<B>(2005 )</B>
<P>
	Both bills are comprehensive and limit federal liability to their 
normal fiduciary responsibility. Ongoing or unanticipated future 
liability is placed upon the project proponent, Manitoba Hydro. 
Essentially the Government of Canada should never have signed 
such a loose agreement back in 1977 to cover these flooded lands 
and then foisted it on to the five affected bands.
<P>
	However, we now have enlightened legislation before us and it is 
time to move on as we did on Bill C-36, the Split Lake Cree First 
Nation, and as we will probably do in a year or two with the two 
remaining flooded land bills dealing with the Cross Lake and 
Norway House First Nations.
<P>
	One very comprehensive element of these bills is that settlement 
moneys will be administered by a trust company to guarantee 
accountability. To compensate these two First Nations for loss of 
reserve land, the federal government will contribute approximately 
six and one-quarter million dollars to the York Factory First Nation 
and about fifteen and one-quarter million dollars to the Nelson 
House First Nation.
<P>
	Both the Government of Manitoba and Manitoba Hydro will 
make additional contributions of land and money. The province of 
Manitoba is particularly satisfied with the agreements. In 
conversations with the ministers and officials, my colleague from 
North Island-Powell River is satisfied that the deals are fair and 
just and that the five First Nations have been patient and realistic in 
their negotiations.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3971"> 3971 </A></B>
<P>
	Bill C-39 and Bill C-40 will allow fee simple lands to be held 
by the respective native corporations outside the normal 
encumbrances of the Indian Act. The fee simple lands are subject 
to property taxation and any business originating from these lands 
is also taxable. Allowing these lands to be used for economic 
development purposes is both enlightening and allows for new 
independence of these First Nations.
<P>
	Bill C-39 and Bill C-40 enable the individual band members to 
appeal under the Manitoba Arbitration Act if unsatisfied with their 
own band decisions which affect them. Naturally these agreements 
have received band ratification. The province of Manitoba is 
comfortable with these agreements and is promoting them.
<P>
	As my colleague from North Island-Powell River said in his 
concluding remarks in second reading debate on Bill C-36, we are 
dealing with legitimate outstanding grievances. Bill C-39 and Bill 
C-40 are mirror images of Bill C-36, which passed a year ago, in 
scope and intent. Consequently, the Reform Party supports them. 
There are some finer points which may be clarified and elaborated 
on. However, this will best be done in committee.

	<B>Hon. Jane Stewart (for Minister of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development)</B> moved that Bill C-40, an act respecting 
the Nelson House First Nation and the settlement of matters arising 
from an agreement relating to the flooding of land, be read the 
second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robert Bertrand (Pontiac-Gatineau-Labelle, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to address the House on Bill C-40, the 
Nelson House First Nation flooded land act which is almost 
identical to Bill C-39 and to which my colleague from Churchill 
spoke so eloquently a few moments ago.
<P>
	By voting in favour of Bill C-40 we can address the longstanding 
and contentious issue of implementing the northern flood 
agreements for the Nelson House First Nation. In turn, the 
community can begin to build for the future instead of constantly 
working to have past wrongs corrected.
<P>
<B>(2010)</B>
<P>
	The hydroelectric plants on the Churchill and Nelson rivers are 
important projects that have brought many economic benefits to 
the province. Unfortunately they have also had a significant and 
lasting impact on the lifestyle and livelihood of thousands of First 
Nations people in northern Manitoba.
<P>
	The flooding caused by the diversion projects deprived many 
aboriginal communities of their traditional fishing, gathering, 
hunting and trapping areas. The flooding also disrupted or 
destroyed traditional water transportation routes and shoreline 
access points.
<P>
	In many cases personal property and community infrastructure 
were damaged or destroyed. At the same time the bands received 
few jobs or other benefits from the hydro projects. The northern 
flood agreement was a well intentioned undertaking to resolve the 
many problems and grievances of people living in the affected First 
Nations communities. It contained provisions for cash 
compensation, land management, resource development, 
community infrastructure, navigation and so on.
<P>
	Unfortunately, for various reasons the northern flood agreement 
did not meet expectations. That is why the parties undertook to 
negotiate band specific implementation agreements. That is why 
we have these two bills before us today. It is time to address these 
matters on behalf of the Nelson House First Nation which is asking 
only that Canada, Manitoba and Manitoba Hydro live up to their 
northern flood agreement commitments.
<P>
	The Government of Canada has a clear obligation, as do the 
other parties to the northern flood agreement, to help the 
communities to cope with the impact of the flooding. We are 
endeavouring through the implementation agreement and this 
legislation to ensure that those obligations will be dealt with once 
and for all in a manner that respects the letter and spirit of the 
agreement.
<P>
	It is clear the purpose of the proposed act is not to enforce the 
Nelson House implementation agreement. The purpose is to 
exempt certain aspects of the agreements from provisions of the 
Indian Act relating to land and Indian moneys, provisions that have 
the potential to impede implementation of the agreements as 
intended. We are all well aware the Indian Act is an outdated piece 
of legislation. This act will give the Nelson House First Nation the 
opportunity to escape some of its burdensome provisions.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3972"> 3972 </A></B>
<P>
	The proposed act will also allow Canada to use the Manitoba 
Arbitration Act in relation to the northern flood agreement. 
Finally, it will ensure that certain types of claims can still be made 
against Manitoba Hydro and that the adjudication process set out 
in the implementation agreements will take precedence over the 
process set out in the northern flood agreement.
<P>
	Great care has been taken to ensure that the proposed act is not 
prejudicial to the other northern flood agreement First Nations. In 
fact Bill C-40 has been drafted in such a way as to preclude it from 
affecting any First Nations except the one named in this bill. We 
are not, and I must emphasize this point, undermining the northern 
flood agreement. We are simply establishing implementation 
processes that will better achieve the intended results of this 
agreement.
<P>
	I also want to stress that the negotiation of band specific 
implementation agreements has been completely optional. All 
three First Nations that have implementation agreements, as well 
as the two that are currently involved in negotiations, have the 
option of continuing to implement the northern flood agreement 
without these agreements.
<P>
	These First Nations are satisfied, as is the government, that this 
new approach offers the best chance for success. Although there 
will always be some opposition to change, the prevailing mood in 
the affected communities appears to be in favour of moving 
forward quickly and effectively. These commitments have waited 
long enough. Hon. members should be aware that community 
consultation meetings were held in both the Nelson House and 
York Factory First Nations throughout the respective negotiations. 
The consultation process was an integral part of the 
implementation agreements. The leaders of these two First Nations 
were also consulted on the content of these bills. They support the 
bills and are eager to see the House proceed as quickly as possible.
<P>
<B>(2015)</B>
<P>
	It is worth noting that virtually all of Canada's obligations under 
the Northern Flood Agreements have been fulfilled. The 
implementation agreement signed with Nelson House earlier this 
year provides for a final release regarding Canada's obligations.
<P>
	A good part of Canada's responsibility under the agreement was 
to ensure that the five reserve communities have a continuous 
supply of potable water. This has required an investment of more 
than $88 million by the government. Today I am pleased to report 
that all houses in both the York Factory and Nelson House 
communities are served with potable water.
<P>
	Canada has also met its obligation under the Northern Flood 
Agreement, supporting the development of comprehensive 
community development plans contributing to the Nevanun 
Economic Development Corporation and sponsoring the five-year 
federal ecological monitoring program.
<P>
	The outstanding obligations under the Northern Flood 
Agreement are primarily shared by Manitoba in terms of providing 
land to the affected First Nations and Manitoba Hydro with respect 
to restitution for the adverse effects of the hydroelectric project. 
Further action by these parties is provided for under the band's 
specific implementation agreements.
<P>
	For example, Manitoba Hydro will continue to be liable for 
personal injury and death caused by or attributable to the project. 
As well, the utility will be responsible for safe operation of the 
water regime in the Nelson House and York Factory communities.
<P>
	In regard to the latter obligation, Manitoba Hydro is required to 
provide written forecasts of the anticipated static water level for the 
current and succeeding month, complete with details on anticipated 
changes and the estimated amount of change. These monthly 
forecasts must also be broadcast by Manitoba Hydro over a radio 
station that provides service to these communities.
<P>
	For its part, the province of Manitoba is required to provide 
provincial crown land to the First Nations to replace their flooded 
lands.
<P>
	Approximately 53,000 acres will be set aside for the use and 
benefit of the Nelson House First Nation under the terms of its 
implementation agreement. Much of this land will be added to the 
First Nation's existing reserves. In fact, the Department of Indian 
Affairs and Northern Development has already initiated the 
additions to reserve process to effect the transfer of these lands. 
However, as has been mentioned, some lands will also be held in 
fee simple title.
<P>
	The First Nation will establish a corporation to hold its fee 
simple lands on behalf of the band. The corporation will issue one 
common share which will be held by the chief of the band in trust 
for all members. The chief is required to sign the declaration and 
acceptance of trust.
<P>
	Under the terms of the implementation agreement, fee simple 
lands can be sold by the band subject to certain requirements. For 
example, a public meeting must be held to explain any transaction 
and to make decisions about the disposition of proceeds. The fee 
simple lands will be subject to property taxes at the discretion of 
the province of Manitoba.
<P>
	The implementation agreement will also provide the Nelson 
House First Nation with fair and reasonable financial 
compensation. Nelson House will receive a federal contribution of 
$15.25 million. The province of Manitoba and Manitoba Hydro, 
through a combination of cash, bonds and forgivable loans, will 
contribute the remainder of the package which will total over $65 
million for Nelson House. These funds will be paid out over several 
years. They are to be used for a wide range of purposes, including 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3973"> 3973 </A></B>
<P>
socioeconomic development, resource harvesting, compensation 
and remedial works. They will in no way affect the First Nations 
normal programming.
<P>
<B>(2020)</B>
<P>
	When past expenditures are taken into account, it might appear 
that Canada is providing the largest share in implementing the 
Northern Flood Agreement. However, other obligations in the 
implementation agreements, such as an enhanced land package by 
Manitoba, the continued responsibilities of Manitoba Hydro for 
personal injury and death, and an obligation to provide additional 
compensation if the established water regime is exceeded, are 
significant and have not been costed.
<P>
	Each First Nation will establish a trust fund to hold and manage 
the compensation moneys. I want to assure hon. members that 
these trusts will be administered according to generally accepted 
accounting principles and provincial trust laws.
<P>
	The trust provisions of the implementation agreements have 
been carefully drafted to satisfy the immediate compensation 
concerns of people who have suffered as a result of the 
hydroelectric project while ensuring that moneys will be available 
to meet the needs of future generations.
<P>
	Hon. members should also be aware that the implementation 
agreements give off-reserve members access to compensation 
through these trust funds.
<P>
	The Nelson House and the York Factory First Nations will 
continue to provide the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development with audited financial statements on an annual basis. 
As well, the trust indenture, which is a companion document to 
each implementation agreement, requires that an annual report of 
the respective trust's business be provided to all parties.
<P>
	I would like to take a moment to update hon. members on the 
status of negotiations with the two remaining Northern Flood 
Agreement First Nations: Cross Lake and Norway House.
<P>
	In the case of Cross Lake, a memorandum of understanding was 
signed in December 1993, followed by the signing of an interim 
implementation agreement in June of 1994. Formal negotiations 
between the First Nation, Manitoba, Manitoba Hydro and Canada 
were in abeyance during much of 1995 pending development of a 
realistic work plan and budget consistent with the federal mandate. 
I am pleased to report that preliminary discussions resumed on a 
four-party basis earlier this year.
<P>
	A memorandum of understanding and an agreement in principle 
have also been signed with the Norway House First Nation. In 
December 1995 a group of Norway House members sought and 
received an injunction to suspend negotiations. However, this 
injunction was vacated in early 1996 and discussions have since 
resumed with Norway House.
<P>
	Returning to the business at hand, this bill is clearly in the best 
interests of the Nelson House First Nation. It is also in the best 
interests of Canada and Canadian taxpayers.
<P>
	The proposed act will not impose additional obligations on 
Canada, but rather will ensure that the government lives up to 
commitments which have been made to the First Nations.
<P>
	I urge my hon. colleagues to recognize the many benefits of this 
short and simple act and to support it at second reading so that it 
can proceed quickly through the House.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ): </B>Mr. Speaker, I said 
earlier that I would talk some more about the dissension created by 
the Northern Flood Agreement.
<P>
<B>(2025)</B>
<P>
	My hon. colleague just explained in English all the positive 
aspects of this agreement, but as the official opposition, we often 
have to point out some facts that are more or less accepted by the 
people involved.
<P>
	I had begun by making some cautionary remarks and I have to 
continue, even if we are, in fact, supporting Bills C-39 and C-40. 
There are still some inexplicable steps in this process. I was 
addressing the environmental issues earlier on and I could have 
gone on and on, because they apply to York Factory as well as to 
Nelson House. So, I will focus on Nelson House, but everyone 
should understand that my comments apply to all five nations 
concerned here.
<P>
	Throughout the flooding, various committees had their hands 
full with what I call crisis management. Every time a specific 
environmental problem was noted, either by the government or the 
first nations, joint, tripartite or bilateral committees were set up, 
but these people never got adequate financial support. They did 
their work only to realize that there was no follow-up. That was 
decried by the auditor general and led directly to an arbitration 
procedure, because no consensus could be reached. So, the 
problems kept resurfacing and always led to arbitration, which was 
a time-consuming, very slow and frustrating process.
<P>
	Some of the studies even referred to the submission of annual 
reports to each band. And on that specific issue, the auditor general 
indicated that no annual reports were ever submitted. Even worse, 
for the Nelson-Churchill diversion project I mentioned, there was 
no global environmental impact assessment. Thus, crisis after 
crisis had to be managed. They decided to divert first and then see 
what the impact on the environment would be. Since then, commit-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3974"> 3974 </A></B>
<P>
tees have been created and abolished at the  end of their mandate, 
resulting in arbitration and the resulting red tape.
<P>
	My colleague also talked of the water supply system. Indeed, the 
whole thing disrupted the water consumption habits, and there was 
almost no drinking water any more. Thus, the government had to 
help these communities, at a cost of $88 million, as the hon. 
member also mentioned. He may not have said that the bill that was 
supposed to be paid by the province of Manitoba was not and that 
there may be still discussions or even court proceedings to get 
Manitoba to pay its dues to Canada.
<P>
	It must be understood that the system is composed of a drinking 
water system and a water distribution system. Approximately 
1,500 dwelling units are served. Then it is not surprising that the 
whole project cost around $90 million for the five communities, 
which are rather far from each other. So the water distribution 
system that was built to compensate the loss of drinking water 
resulting from this project was extremely costly.
<P>
	I have also briefly talked of the land exchange and I want to 
come back to this issue. It had been agreed that for each acre of 
damaged or flooded land, governments shall make compensation 
of four acres of land. So far, and maybe my colleague did not point 
it out strongly enough, only 10 per cent of the land has been given. 
Therefore, there are problems here also.
<P>
	The initial agreement provided for a 1:4 compensation, and not 
even 10 per cent have been given yet. Even though an agreement 
still has to be negotiated with two more bands, I do not think we 
will reach this famous 1:4 compensation and it is a pity for 
aboriginal people because-and I do not want to talk about it again 
as I explained it when I spoke about York Factory-the land 
submerged was extremely well-stocked in game and were 
important for the traditional way of life of the aboriginal people. I 
do not think they will get equivalent land.
<P>
<B>(2030)</B>
<P>
	The initial agreement also contained community development 
plans, since people probably had to move because of the flooding 
of their land, which somewhat disrupted their way of life. Some 
community development plans must have been devised to help the 
people restructure their life and their traditional way of life. The 
environment in which they had lived for centuries was completely 
shattered. Therefore, a certain amount of support was needed. 
Community development plans were drawn up. Unfortunately, 
there was no follow-up to these plans. Even the auditor general 
condemned it in no uncertain terms in the documents that I have 
here. The auditor general said that the governments did not respect 
all of their commitments, since they were to draw up community 
development plans and ensure a continuous follow-up to make sure 
that the dislocation could be controlled by the community as a 
whole.
<P>
	Nobody mentioned the price to pay, but I estimated the costs of 
the measure, not the costs already incurred, but the total cost of the 
agreement. I added up the costs of the Nelson House agreement and 
the York Factory agreement. They are not negligible. The federal 
government will contribute to help clean up this ecological disaster 
and compensate for the displacement of native communities. Its 
share of the compensation package will amount to $21 million. 
Manitoba's share will be about $19 million and Manitoba Hydro 
will pay $2.5 million, but will also give $54 million worth of 
Manitoba Hydro bonds, payable according to a schedule the details 
of which I will spare you. It seemed important to mention the costs 
of the operation.
<P>
	I am talking here about the costs from implementation date, 
from the day of the signature. The meter is already ticking. But the 
whole cost to the environment must also be added, including the 
$88 million water supply system I mentioned earlier. This 
adventure is costing a lot to the governments of Canada and 
Manitoba, but probably even more to the native communities 
whose life has been disturbed.
<P>
	I think it was appropriate for the opposition to set the record 
straight. Government members always insist on the positive 
aspects of a situation and say that everybody is very happy. But 
when we start looking into it, we see that this not the case. I did not 
hear anything to this effect from my friends from Churchill and 
Pontiac-Gatineau-Labelle. I did not hear my colleagues mention 
the criticism and the complaints expressed by the native people. 
We did hear criticism and complaints from people who came 
before the Indian affairs committee, but my colleagues made no 
mention of that in their speeches. The legislation before us is not 
entirely positive; there are a lot of negative aspects that I had to 
point out.
<P>
	However, as I said earlier, in York Factory as in Nelson House, 
Split Lake, Norway House and Cross Lake, from the moment these 
bands were separated from one another and the solidarity that 
united them was broken, they were forced to negotiate one by one 
with the government. It was David against Goliath and, in this case, 
Goliath won.
<P>
	We cannot object to the fact that agreements were reached and 
ratified, often through a referendum, by these native communities. 
So, we feel we really do not have much of a choice but to agree, 
because we cannot vote against it, and have the negotiation process 
start all over again. But I do think the communities have been made 
vulnerable and did not have a choice. Any resistance on their part 
would have involved years, decades of legal wrangling they could 
really not afford. They had to sign these agreements, with all the 
inherent dissatisfaction and bickering.

	<B>Hon. Jane Stewart (for the Minister of Finance, Lib.)</B> moved 
that Bill C-37, an act to implement an agreement between Canada 
and the Russian Federation, a convention between Canada and the 
Republic of South Africa, an agreement between Canada and the 
United Republic of Tanzania, an agreement between Canada and 
the Republic of India and a convention between Canada and 
Ukraine, for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of 
fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income, be read the second 
time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today and urge 
the House to give speedy approval to this legislation.
<P>
	The bill I am presenting today culminates some ongoing work of 
the last many months. It is legislation which does not generally 
command great public attention. However, it is legislation that does 
promote fair taxation and good international and trade relations.
<P>
	The purpose of Bill C-37 is to implement reciprocal tax treaties 
between Canada and Russia, Canada and Ukraine, Canada and 
South Africa, Canada and Tanzania, Canada and India. These five 
tax treaties, each of which is based on the OECD model tax 
convention, have two main objectives, to eliminate double taxation 
on income tax and to prevent income tax evasion.
<P>
	While this bill may not spur great public attention, let us not 
diminish the importance of tax treaties and their benefits. It is 
treaties such as the ones I am presenting today that are incorporated 
in this legislation which  encourage certainty and stability between 
international tax regimes and which enable the expansion of trade 
and investment.
<P>
	It is worth making special note of the treaties with Russia and 
Ukraine. Given the political shifts in that area of the world in the 
late eighties and nineties, it is more than timely that we abandon 
the 1985 Canada-U.S.S.R. tax treaty and adjust tax relations with 
these countries to ensure renewed and important economic 
relationships.
<P>
	The tax treaties I speak of today eliminate or alleviate double 
taxation in instances where international transactions are involved 
that may give rise to the same income being taxable in the hands of 
the same person in more than one nation. They also enact measures 
that counter income tax evasion in international transactions. This 
ensures those nations rightfully entitled to much needed income tax 
revenues will receive full compensation.
<P>
	I also wish to remind the House the treaties enacted by the bill 
are the latest in a longstanding process of renewing or evolving our 
tax conventions with newly emerging nations. The major reform of 
Canada's income tax legislation in 1971 required Canada to expand 
its network of double taxation conventions with other countries.
<P>
	Before I review the main elements of these new tax treaties, I 
wish to put to rest any revenue concerns that may arise as a result of 
these treaties. Simply put, the concessions contained in the five 
conventions should not result in any revenue loss for the 
Government of Canada. On the contrary, Canada should benefit 
from the reductions in various withholding tax rates and other 
concessions which have been ceded by the five countries concerned 
and from increased trade and investment resulting from the 
successful conclusion of these treaties.
<P>
<B>(2040)</B>
<P>
	There are some in the House who would at the very mention of 
tax treaties suggest that what we are talking about is an opportunity 
for tax evasion. What we are talking about is an opportunity to 
foster investment and the free movement of capital and people.
<P>
	Allow me to outline the key features of Bill C-37 which provide 
equitable solutions to the various problems of taxation between 
Canada and certain international partners.
<P>
	The treaties provide generally that dividends may be taxed in the 
source country at varying maximum rates. In Russia, Ukraine and 
South Africa this maximum rate will be 15 per cent. In the United 
Republic of Tanzania the maximum rate will be 25 per cent. For 
India the 1985 agreement with Canada set maximum rates of 15 per 
cent on direct dividends on interest and 25 per cent on other 
dividends. These rates will remain unchanged.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3976"> 3976 </A></B>
<P>
	In the case of inter-company dividends the rate is often reduced 
if the company receiving the dividends holds a certain equity 
interest in the company paying the dividends. Such a reduced rate 
has been set at 5 per cent in South Africa and Ukraine, 10 per 
cent in Russia and 20 per cent in Tanzania.
<P>
	Part of the main thrust behind the treaties is to ensure companies 
are unable to lower taxes by merely establishing branches in 
Canada or other countries. To accomplish this, branch tax rates 
have been set parallel to the rates for inter-company dividends.
<P>
	Regarding interest paid by a resident of one country to that of 
another, the rate set out in the bill is 10 per cent in the case of 
Russia, Ukraine and South Africa and 15 per cent in the case of 
Tanzania. There are, however, some exceptions.
<P>
	Maximum rates on interest paid on a bond or similar obligation 
by the national government will be reduced to zero in all 
participating countries. As well, these treaties contain a provision 
that will extend a zero rate of taxation on interest paid on loans or 
credits extended, guaranteed or insured by certain state entities in 
the source country. In Canada that would include the Export 
Development Corporation.
<P>
	These treaties also address the taxation of royalty payments. 
They provide for a general rate of source taxation of 10 per cent in 
Russia, Ukraine and South Africa and 20 per cent in Tanzania. The 
rate in India will be reduced within five years to 10 per cent or 15 
per cent depending on the types of royalties.
<P>
	The treaties with Russia, Ukraine and South Africa have gone 
further to recognize the world's borders are very much impacted by 
the information highway. South Africa has reduced the withholding 
tax on royalties for computer software to 6 per cent. Russia and 
Ukraine have eliminated these completely.
<P>
	Pensions are also dealt with in these treaties. For example, in the 
case of Russia, Ukraine and India pensions and other similar 
payments will be taxable only in the source country. South Africa 
will deviate slightly by stipulating that pensions will be taxable in 
the source country with no limitations. In this instance the country 
in which the recipient resides will provide a credit for the taxes 
paid in the source country.
<P>
	In Tanzania pensions and similar payments arising in one 
country and paid to a resident in another may be taxed by both 
countries. However, the tax rate of the country of source will 
generally be reduced to 15 per cent.
<P>
	In summary, the five tax conventions contained in the bill 
provide mutually beneficial solutions to many of the taxation 
stumbling blocks that exist between Canada and our international 
partners. The countries I have mentioned are preparing to 
implement the bilateral convention as soon as possible.
<P>
	I remind hon. members of the important role tax conventions 
play in fostering investment into Canada and out of Canada into 
other countries, such as the ones which are the subject of this bill, 
and also in fostering and promoting the fair treatment of taxpayers 
and ensuring taxes are collected. I commend the bill to the House 
and urge its speedy passage.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am always pleased, even at so late an hour as this, to 
speak on a bill as important as Bill C-37, an act to implement tax 
treaties signed between Canada and Russia, South Africa, 
Tanzania, India and the Ukraine.
<P>
<B>(2045)</B>
<P>
	Contrary to what my colleague said earlier, it is inaccurate to say 
that most opposition members are opposed to the signing of tax 
treaties. On the contrary, we encourage the signing of tax treaties 
between Canada and the United States. Why? Because it is in our 
interest to see Quebec and Canadian businesses pay tax only once, 
and not twice. This is how double taxation is avoided, by signing 
tax treaties setting out rules for the treatment of the income of 
businesses, and even of individuals and of Canadian diplomats 
versus foreign diplomats. It is to Canada's credit that it signs these 
treaties.
<P>
	Where it does not work, and we have always been clear on this, 
is when tax treaties are signed or when there is an attempt to avoid 
adopting rules with countries with much lower rates of taxation 
than Canada's. This no longer works, because by various 
subterfuges, by various ruses, companies with branch plants in 
so-called tax havens can apply the lower rates of taxation in these 
countries to the detriment of the taxes they would normally pay to 
the federal government.
<P>
	As it happens, in the case of the treaties in this bill, none of the 
five countries has tax rates appreciably different from Canada's 
with respect to business profits.
<P>
	Let us take the example of Russia. The Russian Federation taxes 
profits at around the 13 per cent level, while the federated states 
have rates ranging from 9 to 25 per cent. In other words, the 
combined rates of the federated states and the federation total 
between 22 and 35 per cent, which is more or less comparable to 
the Canadian range of 32 to 40 per cent.
<P>
	Looking at South Africa, we have no recent information for 
business taxes, that is to say for 1996, but in 1995-as of March 31 
1995, to be more precise-the corporate tax rate was 35 per cent in 
South Africa.
<P>
	The same thing goes for India. The Indian corporate tax rate is 
40 per cent, with a 15 per cent surtax if the taxable income exceeds 
75,000 rupees, or $3,200. Not only is the Indian taxation rate not 
lower than Canada's, it is in fact higher.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3977"> 3977 </A></B>
<P>
	Looking at Tanzania, the standard level of taxation on profits 
is around 30 or 35 per cent.
<P>
	Finally, with respect to the tax convention signed between 
Canada and the Ukraine, until 1992, the last year for which figures 
were available, the tax on business profits in the Ukraine was 35 
per cent. There has been a recent revision downward to between 20 
and 28 per cent, a bit less than in Canada, but still far from the 
differences that sometimes occur between countries that are 
considered tax havens-with a rate between 2 and 3 per cent-and 
Canada, with a theoretical level of 40 per cent.
<P>
	There is no problem in this area, then, but there is in some 
others. I take the opportunity provided by this analysis of Bill C-37 
to remind the government that it signed in the past tax treaties with 
countries that are considered real tax havens and that each year 
hundreds of millions, if not billions of dollars go through these 
countries and are lost to Revenue Canada because of the 
ridiculously low tax rates in effect there. Furthermore, since these 
businesses are taxed only once on their incomes under these tax 
treaties, they obviously use various means to have their profits 
taxed at a ridiculously low rate.
<P>
	They bring these profits back to Canada tax free and in so doing, 
save between 35 and 38 per cent on their taxes every year. Despite 
all the efforts made by the federal government in previous years, 
there are still eleven countries having signed tax treaties with 
Canada that are considered tax havens. The main ones are 
Barbados, Cyprus, Malta and even Switzerland.
<P>
<B>(2050)</B>
<P>
	Eleven other countries provide exemptions that considerably 
reduce their level of taxation in order to achieve certain economic 
and commercial objectives. With these countries, which include 
Barbados, Ireland, Malta and the Netherlands, Canada has to bang 
its fist and make it clear that, where conventions exist, they must be 
honoured. For conventions to be honoured, rates of taxation must 
continue to be comparable and not variable according to the whim 
of the countries signing these conventions.
<P>
	The difference is considerable, and it seems to me that being in a 
country like ours, which is facing financial difficulties, we cannot 
turn our nose up at the hundreds of millions of dollars in additional 
tax revenues that might be created if the federal government 
corrected the discrepancies in the tax conventions and other 
agreements it has with other countries which have extremely low 
rates of taxation.
<P>
	Let us look at three countries. First, Barbados. It taxes business 
profits at the rate of 2.5 per cent. This is some 36 percentage points 
less than the rate in Canada.
<P>
	The rate in Switzerland is less than 10 per cent. We have tax 
conventions with both these countries. Their rate of taxation is not 
comparable to ours, and that is where the rub lies in tax 
conventions. This is not the principle of tax conventions, which is a 
good one. Tax treaties are both desirable and necessary.
<P>
	However, they must be concluded with countries whose tax rates 
are comparable, otherwise a correction factor is necessary when 
profits are brought back after being taxed in those countries at 
reduced rates.
<P>
	In a third country, the Bahamas, the ideal tax haven, the cream of 
the cream, tax rate on profits is 0 per cent. In other words, a 
Canadian business with subsidiaries in the Bahamas could make 
profits, not be taxed whatsoever there, and bring those profits back 
to Canada totally free of taxes.
<P>
	I am still referring to a Canadian business, a business controlled 
by Canadian residents who normally should pay what is owing to 
Revenue Canada. But instead we are losing money because of the 
difference in tax rates between Canada and countries considered as 
tax havens. We are losing money and the fault is ours, in other 
words. For two years and a half, we have been asking the 
government to do something. Why did they not do it? One 
wonders.
<P>
	Tax havens are becoming so popular that some very well known 
companies in Canada are taking advantage of these loopholes. Take 
the six major Canadian banks, for instance. Do you know that the 
subsidiaries of the six major Canadian banks-half the 119 
subsidiaries they have outside Canada-are located in the 
Caribbean? Fifty-seven subsidiaries of the six major Canadian 
banks are located in the Caribbean, which is not known for its high 
population density.
<P>
	It is strange that Canadian charter banks have half their 
subsidiaries in the Caribbean. There must be a reason. It happens 
that the countries considered to be the most generous tax havens in 
the world are in the Caribbean.
<P>
	The same thing applies in the Cayman Islands, a famous tax 
haven: there are 28,000 businesses there, 28,000 corporations, 
most of them branches of Canadian, American or Japanese 
firms-28,000 firms for 30,000 inhabitants. It is permitted to 
imagine reasons for that. The 30,000 people in the Islands certainly 
do not hold all the shares of these 28,000 firms.
<P>
	The 16,000 corporations established in Turk and Caicos Islands 
are also said to be held by Canadian interests.
<P>
<B>(2055)</B>
<P>
	There is a reason for that and it is the fact that Canada is signing 
tax conventions with various countries. It does not care about 
taxation levels and, when there is no convention as such, there is 
nothing else. Consequently, when Canadian corporations make 
profits in these countries, they make up for the difference between 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3978"> 3978 </A></B>
<P>
their  absurdly low taxation level and the level in Canada which is 
about 40 per cent.
<P>
	This is quite something. People think only little amounts are 
involved and that this is why the government does not bother to 
remedy the situation, but the government knows perfectly well that 
these are huge amounts, tremendous amounts. But the government 
keeps on turning a deaf ear to our cries.
<P>
	In 1990 alone, investments outside Canada amounted to $92 
billion. I do mean $92 billion. These corporations, which are 
investing abroad, received $4.2 billion in dividends from foreign 
subsidiaries.
<P>
	Some of this $92 billion found its way into countries considered 
as real tax havens. For instance, according to the auditor general, 
$5.2 billion was invested in Barbados at a maximum tax rate of 2.5 
per cent, as I mentioned before. Barbados corporations paid 
Canadian corporations $400 million in dividends, probably tax 
exempt. We are not talking about peanuts here.
<P>
	Moreover, the Auditor General points out another case, where 
$10.9 billion was invested in Cyprus, Ireland, Liberia, the 
Netherlands and Switzerland, countries which are all considered to 
be tax havens. Over $200 million in dividends was paid out to 
Canadian corporations by corporations in those countries, probably 
without paying anywhere close to the taxes they should have if we 
had had proper tax conventions with those countries.
<P>
	When we brought this to the government's attention, about two 
and a half years ago, they said that we had to be careful because if 
we were too strict, too restrictive, we would be less competitive 
internationally. With the globalization of markets, the opening of 
borders, the disappearance of barriers, our planet has become a 
great big village and soon we will be conquering the universe. 
Every time we raised this issue, the government said that we had to 
be cautious because if we were too strict, these assets would leave 
Canada. If our tax conventions were too rigid or if we came to other 
arrangements with countries considered to be tax havens, it would 
be detrimental to the international competitiveness of Canada, its 
capacity to attract foreign investments, to keep them and to ensure 
there would always be direct foreign investment in plant 
construction and job creation in Canada. In other words, our 
millionaires would go elsewhere.
<P>
	The United States is our main competitor in North America. The 
Americans implemented a tax measure a long time ago. Since they 
could not control inflows and outflows, as is the case in Canada, 
they decided to impose an American tax rate on all profits made by 
American corporations abroad. They chose to literally tax these 
profits. But they looked at the taxes these same American 
corporations were paying to other countries, for profits made 
abroad, and granted a tax exemption for these taxes.
<P>
	In other words, the Americans make sure that U.S. corporations 
pay taxes on their profits, they check on a case-by-case basis what 
amount each corporation has already paid to another country and 
then subtract one from the other. It all seems very logical to me. As 
we say, you do not have to be a rocket scientist to understand these 
principles. You pay 2 per cent somewhere when the rate here is 40 
per cent. When you bring back your profits, you will have to pay 
the difference, that is to say 38 per cent, because you will be 
allowed a 2 per cent deduction for what you paid in the other place. 
Therefore, you will end up paying the same as every national 
business.
<P>
<B>(2100)</B>
<P>
	It seems to me that it makes sense. And that is what the United 
States is doing. We cannot say that Americans are socialists. You 
cannot say that Americans treat their businesses and corporations 
casually. You cannot say that the United States is not a paradise for 
private business. We have high officials here who can influence 
decision makers because, on the Liberal side, they are easily 
influenced, by telling them that they have to watch out not to 
mistreat businesses because if they do, they are going to move 
away. Well, let us be serious. When we are in a situation like the 
one we are experiencing in Canada now, it seems to me that we 
should take advantage of every opportunity to close loopholes, and 
these are big loopholes.
<P>
	The other way to collect what we should normally collect is to 
revise the tax conventions with the countries I was mentioning 
earlier. We know these conventions. We know that they are signed 
with countries which have a much lower tax rate than ours. We 
have to revise these conventions. It is easy. You just pick up the 
phone, call the representative in that country, redefine the 
provisions and tell him that it is not because we do not like his 
country, but because it is not normal, that otherwise we would have 
a capital drain due to the ridiculous taxation level in countries like 
his. Either you revise by tearing up the tax convention or you revise 
through a compensation mechanism which would make profits go 
from that country to Canada where they would be suitably assessed 
and where tax money would come into the government coffers.
<P>
	As I was mentioning, Bill C-37 deals with income tax 
conventions that have been signed between Canada, Russia, South 
Africa, Tanzania, India and Ukraine. This is finally an example of 
what should be used as criteria of comparison. These are income 
tax conventions that have already been signed between Canada and 
certain countries that are considered as tax havens. Taxation rates 
are fairly similar or, at least there is not a major difference, as in 
countries such as the Bahamas, for example. The conventions, or 
the tax treatment given by Canada and by these countries, seem 
fair, unless we did not do our work well.
<P>
	Finally, the offical opposition will support Bill C-37, but in 
hoping, as I was mentioning to you earlier, that the federal 
<P>

<B><A NAME="3979"> 3979 </A></B>
<P>
government will review, as we have been asking it to do for two 
and a half years, the eleven income tax conventions that have been 
signed with countries that are considered as tax havens. Second, the 
government should think about our proposal to establish a 
mechanism like the one that exists in the U.S., which would allow 
us to compensate for future losses, like the current tax losses, 
because the differences among the countries that do business with 
Canada are too great.
<P>
	As I was saying, the U.S. has done a great job on this. It taxes at 
the American rate and manages to give deductions to the 
businesses that have already paid 2 or 3 per cent in the Bahamas, 
Cyprus, Malta or elsewhere in the world.
<P>
	This is one option we could seriously consider because, as I say 
on a regular basis, Canada trails behind several industrialized 
countries in this respect. Canada also lags behind other countries' 
innovative, original business tax practices. I think the time has 
come for the government to wake up.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, Bill C-37 is 
designed to implement income tax conventions that have already 
been signed with Russia, South Africa, Tanzania, India and 
Ukraine.
<P>
	Tax treaties such as these have two main objectives: first, the 
avoidance of double taxation; and second, the prevention of tax 
evasion or avoidance. Since they contain taxation rules that are 
different from the provisions of the Income Tax Act they only 
become effective if an act giving them precedence over domestic 
legislation is passed by Parliament.
<P>
<B>(2105)</B>
<P>
	The conventions and protocols in the act are patterned on the 
model double taxation convention prepared by the OECD. This act 
sets out a system of taxation protocols and conventions with 
nations that previously had no such conventions with Canada.
<P>
	The act is designed to eliminate double taxation whereby an 
individual is taxed on income in his home country as well as in 
another country, and to restrict the ability to evade taxes by shifting 
income into other localities. The act reproduces tax conventions 
already signed with Russia, South Africa, Tanzania, India and 
Ukraine.
<P>
	Reform supports horizontal and vertical equity, and removing 
the ability to evade or avoid taxes is in keeping with this 
philosophy. The act basically simplifies the system of taxation as it 
applies to resident individuals and corporations in Canada as well 
as owners of income producing assets in Canada or one of the 
signatory states. Therefore, I am pleased on behalf of the Reform 
Party to support this bill.

<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 deemed 
to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="RAILWAYSAFETY">RAILWAY SAFETY</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, on June 12, I 
asked a question to the Minister of Transport regarding railway 
safety, following CN's decision to close the Joffre shop, in Charny. 
I am concerned because before this decision, there were three shops 
that repaired and maintained railroad tracks in Canada.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>

<B><A NAME="3980"> 3980 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(2110)</B>
<P>
	It was suddenly decided to concentrate these operations in 
Winnipeg. Since CN was privatized last year, I was concerned 
about the issue of safety and I told the Minister of Transport that it 
was asking a lot from a single shop located in Winnipeg to look 
after all the tracks in Canada, as far as Halifax. The minister said 
that he had reviewed the situation, that there would be no problem 
and that it would be safe.
<P>
	On March 28, 1995, the daily <I>Le Soleil</I> published the findings of 
a study on the state of railroad tracks in Quebec. In our province 
there are three to ten times more problems than in other regions of 
the country.
<P>
	For example, and I quote from the story published in the daily <I>Le 
Soleil</I>, ``For trains starting in the Quebec area, including Ottawa, 
but stopping before the Gaspé Peninsula, railroad inspectors 
counted 51 defects per 100 miles or 160 kilometres of main 
railroads owned by CN. They counted 31 per 100 miles of main 
railroads owned by Canadian Pacific. CN owns more than 80 per 
cent of the tracks''.
<P>
	As I was saying, elsewhere it is up to 10 times less. In spite of 
this, CN decided to set up the only repair shop in Winnipeg.
<P>
	I take advantage of the fact the minister is here. Now that he has 
been informed of the situation since last Thursday, I ask him if he 
can table reports that the railroads had improved over the last year, 
on which to base his claim that there is no threat to safety in 
Quebec. I would like the minister to tell us about these reports or, 
better still, to table within the few next days the reports on which he 
is basing his claim that railroads in Quebec are in top condition.
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is always a pleasure to answer a question from the hon. 
member for Levis. I thank him for this opportunity to make a few 
comments on railway safety.
<P>
	First, I can assure him that there are figures to prove there is no 
significant difference between the number of accidents and 
problems in the railway system of Quebec and in other provinces. I 
could give him the exact figures but unfortunately I do not have 
them with me at this moment.
<P>
	It is most unfortunate that people are losing their jobs in Charny 
but the House may rest assured that there is no problem linked to 
safety. The CN decided to centralize the main operations for repairs 
to track maintenance equipment, but routine maintenance will be 
done in the field. Finally, CN will step up routine equipment 
maintenance. Track maintenance, which is essential to ensure 
safety, will continue to be ensured using equipment in good repair.
<P>
	Transport Canada works together with railway companies to 
provide Canadians with the highest standard of rail safety. 
Railways are required to comply with the Railway Safety Act and it 
is up to Transport Canada to ensure that safety standards are 
complied with in accordance with the law.
<P>
	Transport Canada railway safety officers will oversee railway 
operations as well as the maintenance of tracks, equipment and 
railway crossings to ensure railway safety.
<P>
	The act enables them to limit railway operations when and if 
they discover unsafe conditions and to impose penalties on the 
companies in the event of a violation.
<P>
	The decision made by CN to centralize equipment maintenance 
is merely a business decision that does not affect safety.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> My collegues, the motion to adjourn the 
House is now deemed to have been adopted. Accordingly, the 
House stands adjourned until 10 a.m. tomorrow.
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 9.15 p.m.)
