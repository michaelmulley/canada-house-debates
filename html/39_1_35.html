      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deep in the heart of the Ottawa Valley, on the edge of Algonquin Park, Barry's Bay is located in beautiful Renfrew County, birthplace of the NHL. The Barry's Bay Hockeyville bid has been a team effort, with team captain Shaun O'Reilly ably assisted by a scoring lineup that includes Mike and Ann Papania, Patti Robertson, Glen Getz, Ron Tremback and Dave Shulist. This has been a community effort, with all of Barry's Bay in the stands cheering for the home team.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19346"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We want all of Canada to know that Barry's Bay is Hockeyville. Barry's Bay is a small community of 1,400, so we need Canada's help. We need Canadians' votes to make it possible. Everyone can dial 1-888-459-2006 for the choice of Barry's Bay. Canadians can vote the Bay and do it today, before midnight tonight, and Barry's Bay will be Hockeyville. Go, team, go.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The need for a national shelter program is critical. Ten per cent of women who seek shelter are turned away due to lack of space. This year, in Ontario alone, 12 women have died at the hands of their partners or spouses. Even one is too many.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the Liberal members on the committee mocked this. They claimed we were practising the “politics of fear”, saying that if we simply maintained a balanced approach to justice, society would be just fine. No sooner were these comments made when, later that week, we all listened closely to the TV as it was revealed that an 11-year-old girl from Armstrong, B.C. was abducted by a transient. </div>
    </p><a name="Para19368"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, due to the excellent police work of the local RCMP and the community, she was found alive. This story of an innocent child riding her scooter to the store to rent a video and being grabbed is not the “politics of fear”. This is reality today. </div>
    </p><a name="Para19369"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only ray of hope is that our justice system is about to change significantly under this Conservative government.

    </p><a name="Para19683"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last election my party was quite clear about the need for additional action on the part of all levels of government to try to eradicate the use of guns in our cities and towns from any illegal use whatsoever. My party will support the bill at second reading and then send it to committee. I have to make it very clear that we have severe reservations about the adequacy of the bill in combatting the specific problem of the use of illegal guns in crimes.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19684"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to credit the attorney general of Manitoba for giving what I thought was a very clear analysis of what is necessary to fight the use of weapons in the commission of crimes. Mr. Mackintosh drew a picture of a three-legged stool. I do not think I am putting words in Mr. Mackintosh's mouth, but he said there were three components to fighting this type of crime, the major one having programs in place to prevent the crime from ever happening.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19685"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have practised law for a long time, including criminal and family law. I saw a lot of victims. I can say honestly that never ran across victims who, if given a choice between not having had the crime perpetrated on them, which oftentimes resulted in severe injuries, or sending the perpetrator to prison for a long time, would not choose prevention. They want these crimes to be prevented from ever happening. No matter what the penalty might be to the perpetrator, they will not get their health back. They do not recover psychologically from the trauma of the abuse.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19686"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our number one priority for the governments, whether provincial or federal, should be to approach the issue of crime from a prevention standpoint. </div>
    </p><a name="Para19687"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second leg on that three-legged stool is enforcement. Criminologists will tell us that one of the greatest ways to prevent crime is for individuals to know they will be caught. That means in high crime areas, in particular, we need to step up enforcement and put more police officers on the street. They should not be put in offices or in a lot of cases even in cars. They are needed on the street. </div>
    </p><a name="Para19688"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provincial governments suffered significant cuts to their transfer payments by the Conservative government of Mr. Mulroney, the Liberal government of Mr. Chrétien and the member for LaSalle—Émard and the current government. They are still trying to recover from those cuts. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1525"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1525"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1530"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1520"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1525">(1525)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para19689"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provinces had to cut all sorts of services, including any that would have required the augmenting of police services at the provincial level. They passed a number of those cuts on down to the municipal level where most of the law enforcement in this country takes place.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19690"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to have more police officers on the street. It is interesting to see that in the government's budget this spring, although the government blew its horn about hiring 1,000 new RCMP officers, the budget does not address street crime at all for at least a number of years. We are probably short about 1,500 RCMP officers right now. We can only train, educate and prepare RCMP officers at the rate of about 1,200 a year. It is quite some distance before that will have any impact at all. </div>
    </p><a name="Para19691"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the real impact could be felt and be felt very quickly would be to move money to the provinces, which the government did not do in the budget, and allow the provinces to spend the money on enforcement by hiring more police officers and putting them on the street, particularly into areas where there are high crime rates.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19692"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third and, I have to say, the least important leg on that stool is the legislative one. I call it the denunciatory factor. It is society saying that they condemn serious crimes and proposing harsher penalties to convey that message. When that is done we must be very careful because in order for it to be effective we can only do it when there is a serious crisis and it is tailored to that crisis. We have two reasonably good experiences of this in Canada. One is the experience we have had with impaired driving.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19693"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we go back 20 years and look at the attitudes of the legislature, the courts and, yes, even the police and society generally, we were much more permissive about impaired driving as a result of alcohol or drug consumption and I think even more callous about the consequences.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19694"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, about 20 years ago we began to change. Over that period of time what did we do? We introduced the mandatory minimum penalties for impaired driving but, more important , groups such as MADD, our police forces and a number of non-profit agencies came together and spent money to convince society of the negative consequences. It did have an impact, as did, to a small degree, the additional penalties that we brought to bear.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19695"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had similar success with domestic violence. Most provinces over a period of about 20 years began to compel their prosecutors and police officers to treat domestic violence seriously, to lay charges and not withdraw charges, and to take control of the situation. By any standard that has had an effect.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19696"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corresponding with that, although it was not in the form of mandatory minimum, there was a change in attitude by the judiciary to impose more severe sentences. Together, that combined campaign had the desired effect of reducing the rate of domestic violence. We certainly have not cured it but it has had an impact.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19697"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe we can learn from those experiences when we look at the crisis that faces us with regard to gun crimes. We know the abuse of weapons is particularly concentrated in our major cities. The first thing we need to do is to do an analysis of why we have the problem and it needs to be concentrated in our major cities. For instance, the murder rate in our major cities runs anywhere from 200% to 400% higher than in the country as a whole for our suburban and rural areas.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1530"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1530"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1535"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1525"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1530">(1530)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para19698"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second thing we need to look at is the nature of the crime. In the case of Canada, what has changed over the last five or six years? We have had an increase in the number of guns, handguns in particular, but rapid fire guns. These are all restricted or illegal guns. They would never be registered as legal guns. Those guns are being smuggled into Canada in much higher numbers. We are getting this information from both our federal and provincial police forces.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19699"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in volume is particularly severe because organized crime, biker gangs in particular, have taken control of it. It is estimated to be running anywhere from a 100% to a 1,000% increase in guns coming into Canada illegally. </div>
    </p><a name="Para19700"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The RCMP tells us that the increase in guns has come about because organized crime gangs are smuggling drugs, marijuana in particular, from Canada into the United States. The organized crime gangs made a business decision, if I can put it that way, that it did not make sense to send the container to the U.S. full and then bring it back empty. About five or six years ago they began to fill those containers with illegal weapons, brought them back into our cities and sold them on the streets of our major cities. Smuggling at the organized crime level has had a very serious impact.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19701"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to look at the legislation and ask whether it responds to the crisis we are faced with. Does it target in a limited fashion where the real problem is? Does it draw too broad a scope? Is it driven, as I believe in terms of the specific provisions, more by ideology than by an evidenced-based approach?</div>
    </p><a name="Para19702"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me answer those questions. It does draw too broad a scope. Including the number of crimes where the government is imposing mandatory minimums, one has to suggest, would not be targeted well enough.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19703"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had a proposal in our platform in the last election to specifically target the smuggling, importing and exporting of illegal weapons. We presently have a mandatory minimum of one year on most of those offences, if not all of them. We were proposing in our platform to increase that to four years. We are now targeting directly the biker gangs and that conduct of smuggling weapons into this country illegally.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19704"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legislation is not targeted enough. It is so broad that the denunciatory factor gets lost. It is also limited, not only in that section but in others where the government has imposed mandatory minimums or is proposing to impose mandatory minimums where it will not have any impact whatsoever. </div>
    </p><a name="Para19705"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As parliamentarians and legislators, we must be careful in our approach to this issue. We can approach it ideologically by ignoring the facts and the evidence. We can make ourselves feel good and convince the country that we are doing something meaningful but that does not protect our society or individuals. We need to know that what we are doing will work but the bill does not take us there.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19706"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill has some real risks, which I will address fairly quickly, the first one being the effect of mandatory minimums, especially used in this scope. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1535"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1535"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1540"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1530"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1535">(1535)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para19707"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must appreciate that the Criminal Code already has mandatory minimums for about 60 to 70 crimes. The present bill would add about 20 to 30 more. We would be approaching close to 100 crimes involving mandatory minimums. All the studies I have seen tell us and should tell this legislature that if we do not target it or use it selectively it loses its impact. We are very close and, in fact, I think we have crossed over that line. </div>
    </p><a name="Para19708"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the NDP would support in a very limited scope of mandatory minimums is really minuscule compared to what is proposed in the legislation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19709"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us talk about the problems with mandatory minimums. It shifts the role that has traditionally been played by the judge in determining what is an appropriate sentence to the prosecutor. The prosecutor, by determining what charges will be laid and pushing for convictions, will determine the length of a sentence. </div>
    </p><a name="Para19710"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, because of the cost, a great number of our prosecutors are caught. Even if they want to pursue more severe penalties, they know the defence lawyers and the accused will hold the process up by seeking a long trial and the crown attorneys have limited resources. They can afford to take only so many 20-day to 60-day trials. </div>
    </p><a name="Para19711"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our system functions on the basis that somewhere between 90% and 95% of all criminal charges will be dealt with by way of guilty pleas. If that balance is upset, the costs are driven up dramatically. The crowns know that, the defence lawyers know that and most hardened accused know it. The process ends up with the lawyers plea bargaining so that the serious crime is not the one for which criminals plead guilty. The penalty imposed is less than what might have been imposed under a system where there were no mandatory minimums. Therefore, the extensive use of mandatory minimums is self-defeating. We end up with fewer convictions and lower penalties.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19712"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to look at how we use incarceration. I argue that the way we have to do that analysis is to look at societies that are similar to ours but which have lower crimes rates. We need to look at how they deal with their criminal law and the rate of incarceration.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19713"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should do an evidence-based analysis and forget the ideology, the feel good thing of, “Yes, I am out here. I am real macho. I am going to get tough on crime and send all these people to jail”. We hear that from the Prime Minister and the Minister of Justice. However, if they really understood the system they would get off the macho trail and just look at what actually works. </div>
    </p><a name="Para19714"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would look at other countries, such as those in western Europe which, overall, have significantly lower crime rates than Canada, both for murder and serious violent crime, and they have lower incarceration rates. Canada's incarceration rate, according to the last figures in 2002, was at about 116 per 100,000 population. In western Europe, Australia and New Zealand the average runs from a low of about 60 up to the high 90s. All the countries we would like to compare ourselves to, and we do regularly on all sorts of other social programs, have an incarceration rate that is 20% lower than ours and, in some cases, as much as 50% lower.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19715"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one country in our close allies that is the exception is the United States. Its ratio of incarceration is 702 per 100,000, almost seven times higher than ours, with a corresponding crime rate that is four, six and eight times higher than it is in Canada in spite of some of the figures we hear from the government party.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19716"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At committee, the NDP will be moving significant amendments to the bill to bring it into line with what we had promised to do during the election. We will be calling for support, although I am not really expecting any from the government, but from the opposition parties to get the bill into shape where in fact it would protect Canadians and obtains results for them.</div>

At the time, the Conservatives said that was nonsense, that those people were just criminals and should be put in jail, but I notice that the justice minister did say they have to work on that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19720"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to know if the member thinks there is evidence of support for that. When the Conservatives take away $1.8 billion from aboriginal education and the Kelowna accord, does that help? If there is no money for youth workers and if there is no more money for policemen on the beat to work with the youth, does that help? If the Conservatives remove $10 billion from early childhood development and take away the choice of those parents who want that extra developmental assistance for their child, and if they increase the tax rate for low income people from 15% to 15.5%, does that help remove the root causes of crime? If they remove the low income young child tax credit, does that help develop a good, healthy background where there is religious tolerance and a good family to grow up in?</div>
    </p><a name="Para19721"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like the member to talk about the root causes of crime and what can be done so that we never get to the situation of having to incarcerate people for long periods of time, which has been proven not to work.</div>

I indicated at the beginning of my speech that our party would be supporting this bill to go to committee at second reading.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19723"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To answer his basic question about the root causes of crime, I have to say that the government in some respects is repeating--and again, because of its straight ideological approach on this issue--the mistakes that have been made at the provincial level in a number of provinces.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19724"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think of the Mike Harris government in my home province. Immediately after he was elected for the first time, his government slashed social welfare spending. It slashed all sorts of programs, including a couple of programs that provided shelters for women and children who had been abused as a result of domestic violence. It was a wide sweep. </div>
    </p><a name="Para19725"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite frankly, to some degree what Ontario and Toronto in particular now are seeing are the consequences of that. The victims of those cuts were in their early adolescence. They were in their early teen years. In disproportionate numbers, they are committing those crimes on the streets of Toronto right now.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19726"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us go to the other major cities where the murder rate and the violent crime rate are so high, including your home city, Mr. Speaker, and Regina, Saskatoon, Calgary, Edmonton and Vancouver. Let us compare them to Montreal and Quebec City. We find that the juvenile crime rate, the young offender crime rate, is significantly higher in every one of those major cities and significantly lower in Montreal and Quebec City.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19727"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened? At the same time that the cuts came out in Ontario and from the Klein government in Alberta, the Province of Quebec did not cut. It stood up and in effect defended the use of legislation. It did not impose penalties. It put in place programs to head off those young people from getting into crime and drugs, and it worked.</div>

I noted his comment that our incarceration rate is 20% higher than that of some other countries. First of all, I wonder if he noticed the geographic differences. Australia and the United Kingdom are actually surrounded by water and do not have the United States right next door, which of course has the largest gun owner population in the world.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19729"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had an opportunity to attend law school in Australia and volunteered some of my time in Australian jails. I can say with certainty, after being a criminal lawyer in northern Alberta and spending considerable time in Australia, that they are very different systems. They are very different places, and indeed, the people are different. I am wondering if he would comment on that. </div>
    </p><a name="Para19730"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some years ago I had a client who had been caught with a loaded .357 Magnum under his car seat. When he was stopped by the RCMP, the weapon was found. He came before the court. He received a 30 day conditional sentence for carrying that loaded weapon under his seat. Would the member comment on whether or not he thinks that is sufficient time to deter that gentleman from doing it again?</div>
    </p><a name="Para19731"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a gun owner, but when the law came into effect, I turned in my .38 special, which had a short barrel, to the RCMP for destruction. I felt it was not appropriate to have it at that time. I was not a target practice shooter. I wonder if he would comment on that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19732"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are different countries and we require different things. We need to make sure that those people who are going to commit crimes and carry weapons such as these, which have only one purpose, do serious time in order to deter them from doing anything again.</div>

Regarding the .357 Magnum, I cannot answer that question, nor could anyone else, without knowing all the facts. Is two and a half years enough? Is four years enough? Is six months enough? I do not know. That is one of the problems with mandatory minimums. If we do not have a full assessment of the case in front of us, if we do not have all the facts, we should not be making a judgment call.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19734"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On deterrence as a whole, we know it does not work. If someone is high on meth, do we really think that person is going to think about getting a month, six months, two years or 10 years? People do not think of it. For most crimes involving guns, very little thought goes into it. Oftentimes it is a quick reaction, or passion, or is driven by peer influence, especially with the gangs in the major cities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19735"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one exception, and it is why we think we should concentrate on this, is the organized crime bosses, mid-level or up. They are the ones who understand that if they are involved and convicted of an organized crime they are going to jail for a longer period of time because of these changes in the law.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19736"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we do the same thing with regard to the importing and the smuggling of weapons, they are the ones we are going to go after. As for the mule who is carrying them across, it does not give us very much to catch that person. We have to get the people further up. They do understand. They do the analysis. It is a very small group of criminals. They are the ones we should be targeting because they are the only ones that this kind of legislation works against.</div>

I understand from his speech that it was because of his leader's position that he is now talking about four year mandatory minimums in regard to this very restrictive and ideologically driven piece of legislation.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this bill has seven year mandatory minimums and even 10 year mandatory minimums.

    </p><a name="Para19739"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also would like him to briefly discuss something he did not cover in his speech, which is the different use in this legislation between long guns and restricted or prohibited firearms, which generally are short guns although there are some automatic weapons that are long guns. In these terms, I am referring to shotguns and rifles that are not sawed off. Has he noticed any discrepancies in this piece of legislation that he would be concerned about?</div>

    </p><a name="Para19741"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the election, I was at the funeral of a young woman police officer outside of Montreal. She was killed by a long gun. This legislation does not impose mandatory minimums for the use of long guns in such crimes. It does so for restricted weapons only. The minister has tried to explain this to members of my party and to me, but it makes no sense.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19742"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take just this one statistic. Of all the police officers who have been killed in this country in the last 20 years, more than half of them were killed by long guns, not handguns. There is no question about the fact that in the last few years the use of handguns has gone up, but there is absolutely no explanation for or logic as to why we would not have that kind of provision in the bill extending to both, to the long guns as well, as opposed to just restricted weapons.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19743"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of the proportionality argument, again I did not have time to get to this in my main address, but I have serious doubts about whether the 10 year mandatory minimum would survive a test in our courts under the charter. The courts have made it quite clear in a number of decisions up to this point, including all the way up to the Supreme Court, that they would tolerate seven year mandatory minimums in very limited cases. That seems to be the top end. Ten years is over the top.</div>

    </p><a name="Para19745"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just about 40 years ago Canada espoused for itself the goal of building a just society, characterized by truth, fairness, equality of opportunity, and a high degree of social cohesion. </div>
    </p><a name="Para19746"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite 40 years of mostly progressive social policy at the federal level and a decrease in the general crime rates, we are today debating a piece of legislation meant to crack down on crime and to get tougher on criminals.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19747"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservative government does not expect this legislation to deter people from committing crimes. In his budget speech the Minister of Finance admitted as much when he allocated more money to the correctional system to accommodate “the expected increase in inmates” that would result from his law and order agenda.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19748"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, Bill C-10 is not going to prevent crime. It is not going to deter criminal activity. The government does hope it will take some criminals off the streets and keep them in jail longer. It hopes that removing the bad apples citizens will feel safer and less fearful.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19749"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general public is naturally fearful of violent crime, particularly when innocent bystanders are its victims, but that natural fear is exacerbated and extended by the culture of fear in which we live. On television most serious drama revolves around violent crime, whether it is <i>Law &amp; Order</i> or <i>Da Vinci's Inquest</i>, murder is usually at the centre of the plot. Even newscasts are filled with crime, terrorism, war and all the accompanying death. Journalists and editors admit making decisions about publication by the code “if it bleeds, it leads”. </div>
    </p><a name="Para19750"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to this encompassing fear, citizens are also caught in a clash of values as they teach their children not to shove or hit to solve a dispute. Adults are solving disputes by bombing and destroying whole cities full of people. As teachers lecture that each person is unique, special and deserving of respect, our own Chief of the Defence Staff states publicly that his soldiers are trained to kill and will go after the “scumbags”. It is hard to find respect in that statement.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19751"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contradictions are endless between the values taught by parents, teachers and clergy, and the behaviours observed by adolescents and young adults. Is it any surprise that they are confused about right and wrong? </div>
    </p><a name="Para19752"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They see many people whose lives are characterized by vice rather than virtue, and they see those people achieve great wealth and fame. Steroid using professional athletes, drug using entertainers, and money stealing business leaders seem to have lives of ease and pleasure and celebrity. And our media does seem to celebrate these lives of the rich and famous, no matter their route to fame.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19753"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We both celebrate wealth and we accommodate the wealthy with friendly tax policies. Between 1986 and 2000 the incomes of the wealthiest 1% of Canadians rose by a whopping 65%, an average increase of $157,000 a year. During the same period, welfare recipients in Alberta saw their incomes drop by 38%, from $14,000 a year to a shameful $8,800.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19754"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While young Canadians may be mainly unaware of these statistics, they do have eyes that see increasing numbers of homeless people begging on the streets and they see more monster homes at outrageous prices advertised in the newspapers. They question what they see. They ask, is this fair? Is this just?</div>
    </p><a name="Para19755"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask, will Bill C-10 help us create a more just society for all? Will the bill bring Canadians together to build supportive communities? I think not. </div>
    </p><a name="Para19756"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-10 is built on a faulty premise, that is the good versus evil vision of the world. In this world people whose behaviour causes harm are identified as evil. The role of justice is to keep our good society safe from this evil. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1555"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1555"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1600"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1550"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1555">(1555)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para19757"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in our good society there have to be some bad people who need to be corrected through punishment. This good versus evil theory encourages quick fixes, such as removing the bad apples to keep the rest of us safe. It leads us to think crime is only the result of a few evil persons and implies that we collectively bear no responsibility for what goes on in the hidden corners of our communities, and that individually we have no connection whatsoever to it. According to this theory we could eliminate crime by isolating all the bad people in jail.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19758"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last 30 years North America experienced a doubling and a tripling of incarceration rates, but this had absolutely no effect whatsoever on the amount of crime processed by the state. It appears that as we put away more and more bad apples, a constant stream of fresh apples spontaneously began to rot. Increased incarceration rates did not reduce crime, but did create a tremendous amount of suffering for a rapidly increasing number of prisoners, most of them young males.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19759"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government is obviously committed to the good versus evil vision of the world and the removal of the bad apples methodology, even though it has not been proven to bring about the desired result of safer streets and a more cohesive society. </div>
    </p><a name="Para19760"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead, the result will be more Canadians in jail for longer periods. Longer sentences will increase the rate at which released prisoners who have served their sentences are inclined to reoffend. The longer they have lived inside the unique and brutal culture of a prison, which some call criminal school, the more difficult it will be for them to adjust to the norms and expectations of mainstream society when they come out.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19761"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who will these new inmates be? Aboriginal people make up only 3.3% of the Canadian population but make up 21% of admissions to provincial custody and 18% of admissions to federal custody. I predict that with the 1,000 more RCMP officers announced in the budget that this overrepresentation of aboriginals in prison will at least continue but will probably increase.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19762"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another group I worry about is visible minority youths in cities. Why? Because one can predict the potential for criminal activity by examining the social determinants of criminal behaviour. </div>
    </p><a name="Para19763"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first determinant is family poverty. Family poverty results in a poorer health status, less optimism about life, less self-confidence and less resiliency to setbacks. The second determinant is a lack of parental involvement and supervision. Parents working very long hours to make ends meet and therefore are not around for the kids. Nobody is at home to help them with homework et cetera. This leads to the third determinant, a lack of success in school and little engagement with extracurricular arts or sports activities. Without classroom or sporting field success, these kids have little chance of feeling included in the school community.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19764"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Ontario the strict rules around behaviour in school expanded the social exclusion already felt by some who were struggling there as they were struggling in life. Once expelled, these children found there was still no one at home and no space for them at school. Everybody needs to feel included somewhere, and in Ontario, during the Harris government years, these abandoned young people found their somewhere on the streets.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19765"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we have Bill C-10 brought to us by the same sponsors who brought us the Harris education policies. When they would not put money into educational supports for struggling young people, they sewed the seeds for the crop of desperate young people we have today. Now Canadian taxpayers are being asked to pay for the harvest in more correctional spaces for the expected increase in inmates. The price tag for this? It will cost over $80,000 per year for one federal inmate.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19766"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Australia and in the southern United States mandatory minimum sentences overcrowded the prisons and required the building of new ones. After some years of experience taxpayers are lobbying their governments to end mandatory minimums as they have proven to be too expensive and they have not reduced crime rates.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19767"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When other jurisdictions have tried a justice strategy and it has failed, why would we try now? When it would result in more Canadian graduates of crime school re-entering our society later, why would we implement it? Have we learned nothing from the studies that show that punishment and retribution are less successful and more expensive than upfront social investment?</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-10 adds to the climate of fear. Its terms dictate that Canada will never achieve the just society envisioned by Trudeau. As one Canadian, I will never stop trying to build that just society and therefore I will be voting against Bill C-10.</div>

    </p><a name="Para19770"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a nephew who is an aboriginal Canadian, actually a treaty member of a band in northern Alberta and a good friend of mine. While I was practising criminal law in northern Alberta, he had occasion to put together about two pages of rap sheets, something in the neighbourhood of between 8 and 12 or 14 criminal convictions. Finally, thank God it happened, he went to jail for two and a half years for a simple assault. As anybody would know who has been involved in the criminal system, that is very serious time.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19771"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went in as a 120 pound crack addict and came out as a 200 pound strapping young man who today has a job, and a family of four beautiful kids living with him. Thanks to the day the judge who sent him away to jail for some serious time for a serious crime. so he has a life today.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19772"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I talk to that nephew of mine once every week or two and he is a totally contributing member of our society. I am so proud of that person. I am also proud of that judge for sending him to jail.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone who deals with human beings knows that addiction to illegal substances or mind altering substances is an illness, that once the addiction kicks in, these are people who need help.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19776"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very sad to think that the only place this particular individual could get help was in a jail cell. In my view, it is an indictment of our society that we do not provide the help and health restoring situations for people like that, so that they can come back and fulfill their promise without living in the misery of a jail, excluded from society and given little hope.</div>

    </p><a name="Para19779"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will incarcerate more people under this legislation. As the justice minister suggested, it would cost about $250 million out of the system, money that could be used for healing, for working on drug addiction and on anger management. </div>
    </p><a name="Para19780"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have visited our prisons. I hope all members will. There were inmates, young aboriginal people most of them, who wanted more services, more education, more anger treatments, and more treatment for drug addiction. </div>
    </p><a name="Para19781"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is already not enough treatment, how will taking another $250 million out of the system help, especially when prisons will be overcrowded even more by incarcerating more people? I just wanted to make that point.</div>

    </p><a name="Para19783"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our current Minister of Finance was part of the team that decided to remove from schools all the support, the psychologists, the social workers, the nurses, et cetera, so instead of having one of those professionals per school or per couple of schools, there was one for 30 schools. If a person seemed to have trouble in school and the teachers could not find out why, they could not get a psychologist to come for a full year. That meant the child slipped behind and could not be treated. That was in Ontario.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19784"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say this for the benefit of my colleagues from other provinces. I want to warn them about the placement of tax dollars into things like corrections because the investments have not been made upfront.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19785"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot help but mention, not to connect it to corrections, but the whole idea of social investments is to build the strongest and healthiest people who can reach their potential. That is one of the reasons why the people on this side of the House, actually the majority of the House, feel so badly that after 30 years of working to build a child care system, where every child could have early learning opportunities, the government chose to throw out those spaces. Not for every child, but for those children whose parents choose it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19786"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Brian Jean:</b> One in twenty.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19787"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms. Bonnie Brown:</b> No, there are many more waiting for those spaces.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19788"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government never gets in at the bottom level and puts the money in where it is needed for investments. Instead, it comes in at the rear end and puts money into correctional spaces when it could be too late.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19789"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy to hear that the member for Fort McMurray—Athabasca has one success story from our jails, but I think there are probably many more sad stories and many of those could be avoided by investments at the front end of a child's life as opposed to the back end.</div>

    </p><a name="Para19791"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I doubt that there is a member in this place who would not generally agree with the premise that the punishment should fit the crime as a general principle. Add to that the aspect of whether there are circumstances in an individual case which may distinguish it from another case which is the same crime but we have some different facts on the table. I think that members will be aware of a number of cases where there are some circumstances that may be exacerbating and some may even be mitigating. It is for this reason that I am not going to support this bill. I want to amplify some of the reasons.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19792"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former minister of justice will be addressing the House. We are going to hear that there are a couple of analyses of case studies which have been used to justify moving toward these mandatory minimum penalties to a greater extent and members are going to find it quite interesting that these were not interpreted correctly. In fact they would argue strongly against the implementation of stronger mandatory minimums. I hope that members will be present for that speech from the hon. former justice minister.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19793"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been some question, and I hope it is not the case, about whether or not the judiciary of the courts, the crown attorneys and our justice system generally have been doing the job for us. I hope that members do not believe for a moment there is a reason to be concerned or a suggestion that we have lost confidence in the judiciary and the Supreme Court, which has opined on most of these issues, including mandatory minimum penalties.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19794"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the things I found interesting in this debate is there seems to be this illusion that there are no mandatory minimum penalties under the current Criminal Code, and that somehow Bill C-10 is going to bring in these tough new mandatory minimums. I cannot count the number of speeches that have already been given that have listed the 42 mandatory minimum penalties that are already under the Criminal Code.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19795"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am not sure if Canadians really understand that there already are penalties. They deal with the full range of the areas about which probably most Canadians would be most concerned. They relate not only to things like impaired driving, betting and bookmaking, but also to high treason, first and second degree murder, the use of a firearm in an indictable offence, and the list goes on. </div>
    </p><a name="Para19796"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also 10 listed offences that include mandatory minimums related to firearms. Firearms is one of the areas which is emphasized in this bill, particularly as it relates to gang use. They include use of a firearm in the commission of an offence causing death, manslaughter, attempted murder, causing bodily harm with intent, sexual assault with a firearm, aggravated sexual assault, kidnapping, robbery, extortion and hostage taking. Certainly there is no debate with regard to these serious crimes.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19797"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I looked at some of the transcripts of the debate, the justice critic for the Liberal Party wrote a legislative summary which I would commend to all members of the House to look at carefully. It is a very difficult bill to read. We have to put it in some context and the context she has put this in would help all hon. members to understand where we might be going here. </div>
    </p><a name="Para19798"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the key points to know is that this bill is actually going to create new levels of mandatory minimum penalties. It is going to increase them, and with the first set of offences concerning serious offences which are committed with a restricted firearm, one of the things we learn is that under the bill, firearms will not include long guns. I do not know why that is the case. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1610"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1610"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1615"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1605"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1610">(1610)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para19799"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back in 1993 when I came here and registration of long arms became an issue, criminal offences committed with long guns were in fact almost as great as criminal offences with handguns and restricted weapons as they now exist. Since that time, the crime rate with long arms actually has gone down very substantially. That should be encouraging to all members with regard to the progress that has been made in terms of ensuring that firearms are used by people who are properly trained, know how to store them properly and transport them properly and use them in a responsible fashion.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19800"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also believe that kind of education process that has been going on for over a decade has led to a greater confidence level in terms of the general population knowing very well that owning a gun is a serious responsibility. This bill has a flavour of inflexibility and I must admit it was concerning to me to find out that in fact the Supreme Court itself has opined on mandatory minimums, particularly increases. </div>
    </p><a name="Para19801"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Supreme Court struck down a seven year mandatory minimum penalty for importing narcotics. The Supreme Court also upheld the constitutionality of a mandatory minimum penalty of four years for the use of a firearm and criminal negligence causing death. The case was the Queen v Morrissey. The Supreme Court commented in that decision on the negative effects of mandatory minimum sentences for introducing rigidity into the sentencing process. What it really gets down to is the issue of proportionality of sentencing. That is the issue we are really talking about.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19802"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot suggest there are no mandatory minimum penalties. I have not heard too many people talk about the deterrence side, but I am not sure whether that is totally relevant because we are talking about crimes for which there is a comprehensive approach to deterrence and certainly the potential penalties are not going to be something that we would rely on totally.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19803"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the remaining time that I have to speak, I want to cite one further example of a situation which I feel would cause me some concern with regard to the rigidity of introducing greater levels of mandatory minimum penalties. It has to do with the population in Canada's jails today.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19804"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A research study was done collectively by the provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta. They found that approximately 50% of inmates in provincial jails suffered from alcohol related birth defects. In fact, the former minister of justice of the past government actually confirmed that in federal institutions across the country, approximately 40% to 50% was reflective of the prison population.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19805"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I started off my speech, I talked about whether we should have the punishment fitting the crime. As a general principle, that is a starting point, but are there circumstances in which there would be some difficulty? In a situation where people have mental illnesses or alcohol related birth defects and are put into prison, especially for an extended period of time notwithstanding the crimes that have been committed, their affliction does not allow them to be rehabilitated. Rehabilitation of people with mental illness is not applicable. They should not be in the jails in the first place. They should be dealt with in proper institutions which are going to help them and their families to cope and to deal with their problems.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19806"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know the courts are becoming more and more educated about the incidence of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder. It is a very serious situation. It is a very significant portion of our population. Indeed, many of these people have committed some of the crimes for which this bill purports to have greater levels of mandatory minimum penalties. I am not sure that it is appropriate. I believe there are circumstances. I believe this bill should probably also cover long arms. I believe that the constitutionality of this bill is going to be challenged by the Supreme Court, if not by the Attorney General.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19807"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those reasons, I will not be supporting Bill C-10. Notwithstanding my belief that the punishment should fit the crime, the circumstances certainly must be taken into account.</div>

I was wondering if the member could table that in the House because that is not my understanding of the statistics.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19816"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, the NDP member who spoke earlier suggested that long arm guns had killed half of the police officers, or something like that. Automatic weapons are long arm guns. They are included in those statistics.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19817"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I worked in the trenches. I was a criminal lawyer. I worked for the other side of justice. I believe that this legislation is necessary and it is long overdue. It will solve some problems. It is not going to solve all of them and certainly we have more of an obligation to society than what we are putting forward as a culture, but this will be a good first step to solve it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19818"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was mentioned earlier by a member opposite that said TV has changed our culture. I remember when I was in Australia, and I mentioned it earlier, every day for the first week I was on the beach because I love the beach. Then all of a sudden within a month I did not go to the beach at all. Within three years I probably showed up there once every two or three months. </div>
    </p><a name="Para19819"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reality is people get desensitized. That is what happens with judges. We can see statistics that show when they become judges they are hard; they are fast. They make sure that the person does time for crime. Unfortunately when they hear that every day, just like when people see murders on TV, just like when people go to Australia and see the beach every day, they become desensitized. </div>
    </p><a name="Para19820"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why we as a group, as a body of Canadians, must represent those people back in the constituency who want some answers and want some changes. This bill will do that. This will set a template for judges to follow and make sure the judges follow the guidelines of Canadians.</div>

They already are there.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19823"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Supreme Court of Canada has opined on this issue. It takes away from the fundamental principle of proportionality of sentencing. It takes it out of the courts' hands.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19824"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the member has lost confidence in the judicial system, he should support the bill and take the sentencing out of the hands of the judges. If he supports proportionality, if he supports a system which takes into account the circumstances on a case by case basis, whether it be someone suffering from an alcohol related birth defect or other mental illness, and the member is shaking his head. When 40% to 50% of the people in the jails of Canada suffer from mental illness or other alcohol related birth defects, he cannot shake his head and say it is not applicable. There is nothing more applicable in this case than fetal alcohol spectrum disorder.</div>

    </p><a name="Para19827"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we on this side of the House know, the bill proposes to tackle gun violence in a manner that is specific. The specific focus is on gang and gang activity.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19828"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Canadians in my riding of Parry Sound—Muskoka, from Parry Sound to Dorset, from Port Loring to Honey Harbour are all too familiar with the reported stories of gangs engaged in turf wars, often in public areas where innocent bystanders are shot in the crossfire.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19829"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police also relate incidents of illegal gun trafficking, for example, handguns being rented out for the night from the trunk of a car and illegal guns traced back to the United States origins being smuggled into Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19830"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We recently discovered, on a farm outside of London, Ontario, eight murdered men who were reportedly members of a notorious biker gang, which brought to the forefront the whole spectre of organized crime in Ontario. However, that particular rural spot could have been any other place in Canada. It could have been just outside of Bala in my riding or just further south in the riding of my colleague from Simcoe North, somewhere out of Orillia.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19831"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While this particular crime has stunned all Canadians, communities and provinces have faced organized crime and the fear and terror it brings, unfortunately, for some period of time. For instance, the province of Quebec has long faced reported violence stemming from Outlaw motorcycle gangs, including biker wars over control of organized crime and the illicit drug trade.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19832"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gang and gun related crimes have an impact on the Canadian way of life, on the safety and well-being of our communities and on the livelihood of our businesses. This type of violence has absolutely no place in our children's schoolyards, in our communities, in our cities and throughout our great nation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19833"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-10 seeks to crack down on gangs and guns. It seeks to make gang members who use guns accountable, once and for all, for their crimes. The use of a gun in a crime that relates to a criminal organization would result in mandatory minimum penalties. I speak in favour of that. Police report that the firearm of choice for street gangs and drug traffickers are handguns or other restricted or prohibited firearms. This is supported by available data from Statistics Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19834"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the homicide statistics for 2003, the Canadian Centre for Justice statistics focused on the characteristics of homicide incidents in Canada and found that gang related homicides increased. While the centre explained that some of the sharp increases are due to changes in reporting practices, there has been a notable increase over the past decade since the collection of this kind of data commenced.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19835"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1993, for instance, there were 13 victims of gang related homicides, 13 too many. However, in 2003 there were not 13 gang related homicides, there were 84. Victims of gang related homicides accounted for approximately 15% of all homicides. We know the targets are not just gang members. Innocent bystanders killed as a result of gang and gun related crimes are victims as well. How can we forget the Toronto Boxing Day shooting spree that resulted in the tragic death of 15-year-old Jane Creba?</div>
    </p><a name="Para19836"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of us were on the campaign trail at the time but I am sure every member of the House heard people in our constituencies, at the door, at the coffee parties and at all candidates meetings expressing sorrow for Jane Creba's needless death and demanding that the next elected member of Parliament in each of our constituencies took this issue of gang related gun violence seriously.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1630"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1630"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1635"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1625"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1630">(1630)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para19837"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard the message at every campaign meeting I had in Bracebridge, Huntsville, Parry Sound and Gravenhurst, as I am sure every member heard it in their respective constituencies. This innocent girl was caught in the crossfire of a gun battle on the busiest street in Canada and on the busiest shopping day of the year in broad daylight. The most common motive underlying gang and gun related homicides was reported to be the settling of accounts. Drug debts, turf wars, revenge and arguments were other common motives.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19838"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The homicide survey also found that the proportion of handguns used in firearm related homicides continues to escalate and that the types of firearms used during the commission of a homicide have changed over the past three decades. This is what the hon. member was talking about earlier. These are the statistics. Prior to 1990, rifles and shotguns were more commonly used to commit homicide. However, beginning in the early 1990s, the proportions began to dramatically reverse. By 2003, 68% of firearm homicides were committed with handguns. The survey further reported that most handguns used to commit homicides were not registered. This should come as no surprise. </div>
    </p><a name="Para19839"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although these statistics relate specifically to homicides, Canadian crime statistics from the Canadian Centre for Justice statistics show similar proportions of handguns being present in other violent crimes as well.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19840"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not need to remind the House that handguns are restricted firearms. Few Canadians are authorized to possess handguns and yet they continue to be more prevalent in violent gun crimes. Handguns, illegal restricted firearms, are the first choice weapon for criminals who want to advance the interests of their criminal organization.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19841"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the overall firearm crime rates have decreased in Canada over the last three decades, it is not true when it comes to the proportion of violent crime committed with handguns or other restricted or prohibited firearms.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19842"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gang and gun related crimes are an issue for all Canadians. It happens too often. One life lost to gang and gun violence is one life too many.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19843"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come down on the side of my constituents in Parry Sound—Muskoka to say that it is time the House tackled this problem directly and Bill C-10 would do precisely that. The bill encompasses the firearms most commonly used in violent crimes and the offenders involved in gangs. The bill also targets other serious firearm related crimes of increased concern to law enforcement officials, such as the theft, trafficking and smuggling of guns, the illegal possession of a gun or if a person is already prohibited from possessing firearms.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19844"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bill C-10 sends a clear message to those who use handguns and illegal weapons to commit crimes that their actions will result in real penalties. These penalties would escalate in the event that a prior offender chooses to use a handgun or a restricted weapon for further crimes. The bill also assures Canadians and my constituents of Parry Sound—Muskoka that the government is committed to creating safer streets and stronger communities. </div>
    </p><a name="Para19845"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge all members of the House to support the bill.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the minister mentioned, people are shot in our country and are then met with the health care system. As the minister knows, the waiting lines in our emergency departments are extremely long.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19848"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have two questions for the minister. First, is he prepared to meet with his provincial counterparts on how the private sector and public sector can work together to support the public sector? </div>
    </p><a name="Para19849"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, will he work with various other health care professionals to establish a national medical manpower strategy for Canada?

    </p><a name="Para19850"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first question concerns working with his provincial counterparts to develop a national medical manpower strategy and the second one concerns developing a strategy to ensure the private sector supports the public sector and does not erode it.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We, on this side of the House, believe the first obligation of any government is to protect society from criminal behaviour, from gang and gun related crimes. This bill is about getting that protection in place because it is not there now. After that protection is in place, there are many tools available to us, as a society, to deal with individuals who are taken away from society and incarcerated to protect society. Then we can deal with the other questions of how this individual came to be in a life of crime. There are probably as many reasons as there are criminals.</div>

    </p><a name="Para19876"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First of all, I would never have dared to rise in this House and express my party’s position without having discussed it in advance with my colleagues, including the hon. member for Bas-Richelieu—Nicolet—Bécancour, who chairs our caucus and is a very learned man. He is so learned in fact that he has been given the important responsibility of sitting on the Standing Joint Committee on the Library of Parliament, a kind of crossroads for information. I want to take this opportunity to thank him, and I am sure that my colleagues will want to join me in doing so. </div>
    </p><a name="Para19877"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us get down to the matter at hand. I have consulted, of course, with my colleagues and read the jurisprudence. I even went and found information beyond what was available in caucus. The conclusion that we must draw, unfortunately, is that this is a very bad bill in every way. </div>
    </p><a name="Para19878"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am sure that, Insofar as crime is concerned, there is not a single member of this House who is not concerned about the safety of our communities. Not one member of this House wants to live in communities that fail to value safety, peace and civic-mindedness. </div>
    </p><a name="Para19879"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are various levels in criminality. Earlier, I was sorry to see the health minister, himself a former member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario, confusing certain levels. This causes misunderstandings, which I would like to clear up right away. </div>
    </p><a name="Para19880"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1995, the Bloc Québécois, this formidable instrument, was concerned about a new phenomenon: the fight against extremely well organized crime. The hon. member for Bas-Richelieu—Nicolet—Bécancour, who is a very learned man, as I said, will remember well. Back then, there were 33 outlaw motorcycle gangs in Canada’s big cities. Some of them were in Montreal, including the Bandidos, the Rock Machine and Hells Angels. </div>
    </p><a name="Para19881"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was an entirely new phenomenon: these biker gangs worked through delegation. It was not the gang leader, Maurice “Mom” Boucher, who would give the orders and do things for which he could be put on trial. There was a whole chain of delegation, with the result that it was impossible to dismantle these gangs. </div>
    </p><a name="Para19882"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time, Michel Bellehumeur of the Bloc Québécois worked with me and other members of our caucus. Since then, Mr. Bellehumeur has been elevated to the bench. The debate was non-partisan, since everyone shared the same concerns. At the time, the first bill was Bill C-95. It introduced a new offence, which was added to the Criminal Code, namely, membership in a criminal organization. This included all sorts of terms and conditions that need not be listed here. That is not what we are talking about today. We must not confuse the levels. </div>
    </p><a name="Para19883"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1995, Allan Rock was justice minister. I am not sure whether this conjures good or bad memories for my colleagues in this House. </div>
    </p><a name="Para19884"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. member: </b> Oh, oh! </div>
    </p><a name="Para19885"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Réal Ménard:</b> I believe my colleague has good memories, but it depends on one's outlook. At the time, Allan Rock tabled Bill C-68, which, all of a sudden, added minimum sentences for offences committed with a firearm. For example, a four-year minimum sentence was imposed for each of the following: manslaughter, using firearm in commission of offence; attempted murder, using firearm in commission of offence; causing bodily harm with intent, using firearm in commission of offence; aggravated sexual assault, using firearm in commission of offence. </div>
    </p><a name="Para19886"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, there are approximately 15 offences in the Criminal Code which have existed for the past decade and for which mandatory minimum sentences already exist.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1650"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1650"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1655"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1645"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1650">(1650)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para19887"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not dispute the fact that crimes committed with guns are something to worry about. The Bloc Québécois does not dispute the fact that we must curb, even eradicate, gun trafficking. What we have difficulty with is this.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19888"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Minister of Justice appeared before the committee that I am a member of to defend his interim supply, I asked him quite directly a very simple question. For a decade now, we have had mandatory minimum sentences for the use of firearms. I asked him whether he had any empirical or scientific studies that would show us the impact of implementing these mandatory minimum sentences in the Criminal Code. Amazingly, the minister, and I do not doubt his good faith, was unable to cite a single study. The same was true when I met with senior officials, who were all very nice. We are not trying to show bad faith or impugn motive. But why were they unable to cite any studies? Because the Department of Justice did not conduct any.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19889"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not mind being asked, as a legislator, to take what are considered the most effective means to address this phenomenon of committing any number of offences with guns. However, I would expect to be asked to do so on the basis of convincing and conclusive evidence.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19890"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the problem with this government. It is deeply ideological, but in an unhealthy way. We are all driven by ideologies. We all have convictions. There are some things in public life that are more important to us than others. However, we must show some scientific rationality or, at least, some rationality with a few scientific aspects.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19891"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot support the addition of mandatory minimum sentences simply for the principle of it. I want Bill C-10 to be fully understood. It affects the following eight offences in the Criminal Code: attempted murder, discharging firearm with intent, sexual assault, aggravated sexual assault, kidnapping, hostage-taking, robbery and extortion. Minimum sentences already exist for these offences, whether for three years, five years or whatever. It is already in the Criminal Code. Anyone who reads the Criminal Code will see that minimum sentences exist for each of these offences.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19892"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-10 proposes that three year sentences be increased to five, five year sentences to seven, and seven year ones to ten. Thus, mandatory minimum sentences are being made stiffer for no reason other than wanting to crack down on criminals. That is what is unhealthy. Naturally, we want offenders to be prosecuted and we do not want them to use firearms to commit crimes. </div>
    </p><a name="Para19893"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to begin with three comments. Such an ideology suggests that we are living in a more violent society. When the hon. member for Laurier—Sainte-Marie appointed me as justice critic, after thanking him and vowing to do my best to be equal to the task, the first thing I did was to look up the crime statistics. I was listening to the speeches of ministers and other members of the Conservative Party, and I had even read their electoral platform. To listen to the Conservatives, one would think that society is more violent than ever, that crime has never been so widespread and that crime rates are on the rise.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we make the effort to look up the statistics, however, we can see that overall, from 1991 to 2000, the crime rate dropped by 26%. And these are not statistics compiled by researchers for the Bloc, the PQ or some lobby group. These are statistics from Statistics Canada or Juristat.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19895"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving to what is termed violent crime, for the sake of clarity, for Statistics Canada, violent crimes include murder, attempted murder, assault, sexual assault, kidnapping and robbery, all of which are intrinsically worrisome. Hon. members will agree that these are no small crimes. The fact of the matter is that, from 1992 to 2004, the number of violent crimes diminished from year to year. It was simple enough; I made a table. So, from 1992 to 2004, violent crime diminished, 2003 being the exception, since nationally, three provinces which shall remain unnamed saw their crime rates increase. Nevertheless, from 1992 to 2004, violent crime overall diminished.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19896"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the minister appeared before the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights, I asked him to table his statistics. I told him that we are all intellectuals, well-educated, open and pretty nice, so surely we could compare our statistics. I told him that perhaps I was mistaken and had interpreted them incorrectly. The minister did not table them. Yesterday I rose on a point of order and asked the minister to table them. When he appeared, he had the statistics with him and could have tabled them there and then. Three weeks after he appeared, members of the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights are still waiting for those statistics. The Minister of Justice had the clerk tell us that it was a big job and would take a lot of time. But the minister had them in hand.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19897"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am going to use the conditional. I have some doubts. I would suspect that the minister does not wish to table his statistics because they do not support his point of view, which is purely ideological. I can assure you that the Bloc Québécois will not allow the Minister of Justice to masquerade as George Bush just to please his constituents. We will be a little more demanding than that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19898"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That said, we do not support Bill C-10. I would remind the House that in 1995, a certain number of minimum sentences were already added in the case of offences for which the minister would like to see increased sentences. More fundamentally, this leads us to consider carefully and decide whether, in our justice system, the use of mandatory minimum sentences has a deterrent effect. We must ask ourselves what a minimum sentence is.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19899"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A minimum sentence means that, during a trial by jury, nothing is left to the judge's discretion. In fact, the jury decides whether the defendant is guilty, but who decides on the sentence? Unlike the French system, it is not the jury but the trial judge. The judge has heard and seen the evidence and heard the witnesses. A criminal trial can last up to four weeks. It is very meticulous. The rules regarding evidence are very strict. This bill sends a message to trial judges that, although they are responsible for administering the sentence, we, as legislators, want to force them, with their hands tied, in one direction or another. </div>
    </p><a name="Para19900"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, with some notable exceptions, we have not supported minimum sentences. My predecessor, the member for Charlesbourg—Haute-Saint-Charles, was well-liked in this House.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1700"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1700"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1705"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1655"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1700">(1700)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para19901"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was our justice critic. I hope one day to be his equal in terms of his knowledge and dedication. Everyone liked the member for Charlesbourg—Haute-Saint-Charles. He was the one to suggest to our caucus that minimum sentences be imposed for cases of child pornography, for example. However, the Bloc Québécois is generally not in favour of the idea of establishing minimum sentences. We are not convinced that they are effective.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19902"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the mid-1980s, the government established a commission of inquiry, the Archambault commission, mandated to review the principles of sentencing. It is quite significant that this commission did not recommend minimum sentences, except in the case of murder which carries a sentence of life imprisonment. The Archambault sentencing commission did not recommend mandatory minimum sentences for any other crime.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19903"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I repeat: it is somewhat pathetic and somewhat sad. I have friends on the government side. In fact, I have only friends and no enemies in this House, and I am proud of that. However, I must remark that the Conservatives find themselves on the slippery slope of ideology. Once again, this bill is the direct result of the government's desire to please its electoral base—western Canada—which finds security in the idea that the longer the sentence, the safer our society. Unfortunately, it is an intellectual trap.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19904"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I use the example of the United States which resorts to incarceration quite a bit. In Canada, according to the latest statistics I consulted, 116 individuals per 100,000 inhabitants are jailed. Do you know what the rate of incarceration is for the United States? Over 700 per 100,000 inhabitants, compared to 116 per 100,000 in Canada. Yet, when we look at the rates of homicide and violent offences we realize that the number of prison sentences is higher.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19905"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like the cabinet to think about that. I am asking the President of the Treasury Board to reflect on this issue. I know that the latter, in his own way, is a humanist. He is conservative, very conservative, overly conservative, excessively conservative. However, he is my friend. I am asking him to think about it. Is there a relation between incarceration and the safety that our communities wish to achieve? All criminologists and academics have reflected on this question. </div>
    </p><a name="Para19906"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As recently as last week, I had an initial meeting with representatives of the defence attorneys association. This is not a group that could be accused of being partisan. It is made up of lawyers who study the law and sentence administration as objectively as possible. Did you know that the association strongly opposes bills C-9 and C-10? I must say that if we listed all the people who oppose these bills, we would see, as I have seen, that it is much longer than the list of people who support the bills. </div>
    </p><a name="Para19907"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone in this House knows what I am like and that I am a cooperative sort of person. But I will not be able to push this bill through quickly in committee. The Bloc Québécois will have to do its work. Unfortunately, we will ask to travel, to hear witnesses and to investigate. Amending the Criminal Code is no small matter. It must always be balanced. We cannot take it lightly.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was told that in the government back rooms, they wanted the bill passed before St. Jean Baptiste Day. That is certainly foolhardy. It presents a problem, because I do not think that the committee can work under pressure, as that would be totally incompatible with the seriousness expected of parliamentarians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19909"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Québécois will therefore be unable to work so that the bill is at the report stage by St. Jean Baptiste Day. We know that this year, June 24 will reflect Quebeckers' hopes and aspirations. It is not only an opportunity to hold a cabinet meeting, but it is also an opportunity to remember how Quebec is a nation and how Quebec will one day be a sovereign country, on an equal footing with English Canada. That is the meaning of our national holiday. And that is what all Bloc Québécois members will have in mind as they celebrate on June 23 and 24. Of course, we will remain very open to any wishes anyone might want to extend to us on that occasion. But let us not digress from the meaning of the bill. Let us stick to the basics.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19910"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the eight offences that the government proposes to create with Bill C-10—and for which there are already minimum sentences that the government wants to increase from three to five years, from five to seven years and from seven to ten years—it is creating two new offences.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other thing I keep hearing all the time is that we are seeking a balance. I would like his definition of a balance. I will give him mine.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This being said, it is not westerners who are being called into question but the electoral base that the Conservative Party wants to win over by creating the impression, with no scientific evidence, that there is a connection between sentencing and recidivism rates.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second is the reason that should most give us pause to think things over, and it is that the economy is doing rather well. In general, there is a correlation between economic downturns and crime: when the economy is doing well, there is less crime. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Systematically increasing sentences will result in additional costs to the penitentiary system. In turn, this will mean less money available for rehabilitation. So, this will strengthen the vicious circle of crime school.</div>

He is totally right. Keeping someone in detention costs a minimum of $100,000, as compared to between $12,000 and $13,000 for those allowed to serve their time in the community. This is something we have to think about. My colleague from the Quebec City area will probably want to give it some thought.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very important to point out that many people view prison as a great school for crime. I am not saying that it is necessarily so, but that is certainly a very wise statement. The greatest contradiction in the Conservatives' position is that they want to combat crime, but they want to do so by ensuring that there is a maximum of weapons in circulation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19936"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the best ways to combat organized crime is probably with a functional, controlled gun registry. That is what my colleague from Marc-Aurèle-Fortin and the leader of the Bloc Québécois have called for repeatedly.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If somebody tried to kill one of my loved ones, or hurt them in any way—obviously I would never want that to happen, but it has nothing to do with the bill before us. What we are saying is that the Criminal Code already contains provisions for incarcerating people who commit crimes with firearms. Mandatory minimum sentencing does not stop people from committing these crimes. When a person commits a crime, they are not deterred by minimum sentences, but by the real possibility of ending up in court. This is not about innocent victims.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19942"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is my colleague holding American society up as an example? Does he think we should resort to incarceration as much as they do? In the past two years, Americans have jailed 717 people and 723 people per 100,000, yet there are three times more murders in the United States than in Quebec. Does the member agree that his logic breaks down completely here? Mandatory minimum sentences and more people in jail do not make for a less violent society.</div>

    </p><a name="Para19948"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Safe streets and safe communities are the shared aspiration of all Canadians and the common objective of all parliamentarians and parties. No political party can claim that it alone speaks or cares for the safety of all Canadians or that it alone is legislating for that purpose.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19949"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, in the matter of combating gun and gang related crime, the Liberal government tabled legislation in November 2005, then known as Bill C-82, that proposed 12 amendments to the gun control provisions of the Criminal Code and which was part of a five point strategy to combat gang and gun related crime, including: first, tougher laws and proportionate penalties; second, more effective law enforcement; third, heightened recognition of the needs and concerns of victims; fourth, the prevention of crime through a hope and opportunity package; and fifth, civic engagement. </div>
    </p><a name="Para19950"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government's crime control policy contains some of these features, but it mentions nothing about civic engagement and it understates the case with respect to a hope and opportunity package and crime prevention. I intend to focus my remarks on the legislative remedy the government proposes, Bill C-10, and the exaggerated and excessive mandatory minimums around which it is organized. </div>
    </p><a name="Para19951"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to note that there are already 20 gun related mandatory minimums in the Criminal Code. Those who argue that mandatory minimums were an electoral deathbed conversion of the Liberal government ignore the fact that it was a Liberal government which in 1995 initiated these very 20 gun related mandatory minimums, and that in November 2005, on behalf of the government and pursuant to the recommendations of the provincial and territorial attorneys general--what I might say was an exercise in open federalism--we then recommended modest increases to mandatory minimums in matters relating to trafficking and smuggling of firearms and the like.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19952"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question, then, is this. What legislative remedy constitutes an evidentiary based, principled and effective approach to combating gun related crime and helping to secure safe streets and safe communities and, in that context, is distinct from what might otherwise be regarded as an ideologically based, politically motivated and ultimately ineffective approach to crime control?</div>
    </p><a name="Para19953"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us begin by looking at the evidence, indeed, looking at the particulars of the alleged evidence that was invoked by the justice minister himself with respect to justifying this legislation. I am now citing from the justice minister's remarks on May 7:</div>
    </p><a name="Para19954"></a><p>
      <div>
        <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
          <tr valign="top">
            <td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>Gun crimes have been reduced dramatically in those jurisdictions that targeted those gun crimes through mandatory minimum prison sentences. The experience of a number of states, a number of studies, demonstrate that--Boston, [Massachusetts] Virginia, Florida, New York and other jurisdictions consistently demonstrate that.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
    </p><a name="Para19955"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us now look at the facts, because the facts have evidence to the contrary. With respect to Massachusetts, in his 2003 testimony concerning sentencing reform proposals, William J. Leahy, Chief Counsel for the Committee for Public Counsel Services for Massachusetts, said that mandatory minimum sentencing “has proven to be a public policy nightmare: ineffective at preserving the public safety, and recklessly wasteful as fiscal policy”. A 2004 report from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Governor's Commission on Corrections Reform, in a section on minimum mandatory sentences, states, “Quite simply, based on what we now know about reducing re-offense, this is a recipe for recidivism rather than a recipe for effective risk reduction”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19956"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to Florida, the minister appears to have based his conclusion on a 2005 press release from the Florida Department of Corrections claiming that the state's 10-20-life program has had impressive results. The facts, however, are otherwise. A 2005 study by the University of Florida attributes any decrease in crime to the national decrease in crime that began before the law took effect, noting also that there was a greater drop in crime before the law went into effect. </div>
    </p><a name="Para19957"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We find the same thing with respect to Virginia and with respect to New York state. Time does not permit me to go ahead and cite in both those matters, but the principle remains the same. There is no evidentiary based justification for the kind of excessive and exaggerated mandatory minimums as are set forth in this bill.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1720"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1720"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1725"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1715"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1720">(1720)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para19958"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me to look at the situation in terms of other evidentiary approaches. It is not only that the evidence from the very American jurisdictions that the justice minister relies upon demonstrate the exact opposite, but even the academic studies that he relies upon, such as the highly regarded work by Thomas Marvelle and Carlisle Moody, also conclude otherwise than that of the justice minister, who sought to rely on this study for his evidentiary based approach.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19959"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, the vast preponderance of studies in every jurisdiction have concluded that mandatory minimums are neither a deterrent nor are they effective. That includes the American Sentencing Commission and the Canadian Sentencing Commission, the American Bar Association and the Canadian Bar Association, the early comprehensive study by the Royal Commission for the Revision of the Criminal Code in 1952 and the more recent studies by the Law Commission of Canada; and includes comprehensive studies by the international expert, Professor Julian Roberts of Oxford University, the exhaustive comparative study by Professor Thomas Gabor, University of Ottawa and Nicole Crutcher, Carleton University, as well as the 1999 research report to the then Solicitor General of Canada, which after surveying 50 studies involving 300,000 offenders, concluded that longer incarcerations were not associated with reduced recidivism. In fact, the opposite was found. Longer sentences were associated with a 3% increase in recidivism.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19960"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-10 is not only not evidenced based legislation, but it also marginalizes the principled approach to sentencing policy introduced by the enactment of section 718 of the Criminal Code, the most comprehensive sentencing reform ever enacted, which includes a composite set of sentencing objectives, and is organized around the proportionality principle, namely, that the sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and to the responsibility of the offender; and which incorporates, by reference, the individualization principle, the appreciation that every crime has a different set of circumstances and every criminal is different. The judiciary must be allowed the necessary discretion, which Parliament intended, to invoke and apply this principled and just approach to sentencing, including also the principle of restorative justice in that regard.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19961"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This leads me to the third consideration, and that is whether mandatory minimums are in fact effective. When we look at it, what we now know, as a result of all the evidence based inquiry, is that mandatory minimums also have adverse and prejudicial fall-out for the criminal justice system. One might call it the law of unintended consequences, which includes that they increase the prison population, resulting in increased prison costs to the taxpayer, and opportunity costs, as less funds are available for law enforcement, community programs and crime prevention while not bringing about the desired objective of safe streets and safe communities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19962"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The prosecutors may stay or withdraw a charge or negotiate for a lesser charge because the MMs are too harsh. The decisions may move from the judiciary to the prosecution and result in fact in lower conviction rates. Where a mandatory minimum charge is maintained and the accused has less incentive to plead guilty could lead to increased trials and more costly trials. Arrest rates, charges, plea bargains and convictions have actually declined with mandatory minimums while the trial costs have increased. </div>
    </p><a name="Para19963"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mandatory minimums have an adverse impact on minority defendants, in particular on aboriginal defendants who are already overrepresented in the criminal justice system, and on aboriginal women who have been increasingly overrepresented in the criminal justice system. Mandatory minimums become the sentencing ceiling for the offence rather than the minimum, achieving the exact opposite of what sound public policy would wish.</div>
    </p><a name="Para19964"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Canadian Bar Association summarized in 2005 in that regard after a survey of all the evidence:</div>
    </p><a name="Para19965"></a><p>

            <td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>Mandatory minimum penalties do not advance the goal of deterrence...do not target the most egregious or dangerous offenders...have a disproportionate impact on minority groups...and subvert important aspects of Canada's sentencing regime.</small></td>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not surprising that Professor Anthony Doob asked plaintively in 2001, “Why are we still discussing whether Canada should have mandatory minimums?” He repeated that again recently. Professor Marie-Andrée Bertrand, referring to Bill C-10, after examining it, said:</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not, however, simply urging more dollars be spent. Those dollars must also be spent effectively and in ways ensuring more accountability. In our view, this legislation should include an unequivocal statement of purpose that poverty reduction is the central lens through which Canada's aid program should be delivered. Key elements of a legislated mandate must include mechanisms for monitoring; accountability and reporting to Parliament; and enhanced public transparency. Such legislation would increase the effectiveness for Canada's aid contribution of aid spending, a more focused accountable approach to more and better aid.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bill cannot be about more aid as that would require a royal recommendation, but it can be about better aid, more focused aid. I respectfully submit that is exactly what this bill is about.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><a name="Para20002"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bill cannot deal with an increase in development aid as this requires a royal recommendation. However, this bill does deal with improving development aid.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para20003"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scheme of the bill is to set up an advisory committee which shall advise the minister of his or her development assistance. The committee will hold a candle, so to speak, to the ODA proposals and ask the minister three questions. The first and most important question is, does the ODA contribute to poverty reduction? The second question is, does it take into account the perspectives of the poor? The third question is, is it consistent with Canada's international rights obligations?</div>
    </p><a name="Para20004"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea of this bill is to bring focus to poverty reduction consistent with Canadian values, foreign policy and international human rights standards.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><a name="Para20005"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this bill is to concentrate on reducing poverty and promoting compatibility with Canadian values, foreign policy and international human rights standards.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para20006"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At one level it may be argued that this bill is so vague that one could drive a Mack truck through it. On the other hand, one could expect that the government, or more accurately the department, would probably say that it hamstrings the minister.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><a name="Para20007"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It could be argued that the bill is too vague to carry out the changes required to improve development aid. For its part, the government, specifically the department, will attempt to show that the bill will handcuff the minister needlessly.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para20008"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My argument is that it does neither. It does not hamstring the minister and it is not so vague as to be useless. I am trying to ensure that our ODA is not merely flavour of the month. It seems to me that if the committee were to force the minister to justify his or her proposed aid in light of the three questions I read, it would actually help the minister avoid the flavour of the month pressures.</div>
    </p><a name="Para20009"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any minister, whether a Liberal minister or a Conservative minister, has all kinds of requests for ODA. Every request seems to be more compelling than the last request. In my view, the minister now has the perfect response and the perfect response is this legislation. Effectively, ministers would be able to say that they are legislated by this bill to answer three questions before this advisory committee. They, therefore, cannot divert their ODA money to things such as security interests, anti-terrorism initiatives or other foreign policy initiatives no matter how worthy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para20010"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada cannot be all things to all people at all times. From time to time others have made the observation that from time to time we are frequently nothing to everybody. From time to time we have depleted our budgets on peripheral issues and not been as effective as we could have been or should have been.</div>
    </p><a name="Para20011"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that civil society is crucial to the delivery of aid. If it were not for organizations such as World Vision Canada raising matching funds and developing donors, our effectiveness would diminish substantially. That is why Bill C-294 has received such wide support.</div>
    </p><a name="Para20012"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Council for International Co-operation and my friend Gerry Barr have been of tremendous help. Literally dozens of letters and dozens of e-mails testify to the importance of the bill. In fact, quite a number of my colleagues over the course of this day and previous days have come up to me and said that they support this initiative in part because of the letters, e-mails and telephone calls that they have received. </div>
    </p><a name="Para20013"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-293 is at the top of mind for many Canadians and many Canadian organizations. There are 178 MPs in this House who signed the reduction of poverty initiative, making poverty history. They signed a much more comprehensive document. One element of that comprehensive document had to do with accountability for aid. The are 178 MPs that appear on the face of it to be behind this initiative. Behind those 178 MPs are literally thousands of Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para20014"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-293 also enjoys the support of the NDP. The hon. member for Halifax has a similar bill and I assume she will be speaking in favour of this bill. The member for Prince Edward—Hastings of the Conservative Party has a bill of similar nature and principle which tries to achieve the same purpose. I am given to understand that the Bloc may also have a similar bill for consideration shortly.</div>
    </p><a name="Para20015"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also have the report of the foreign affairs committee and the concurrence of the House in the last Parliament. Finally, we have a letter sent to the former Prime Minister signed by all three opposition party leaders including the current Prime Minister.</div>
    </p><a name="Para20016"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where is the resistance? I think we would find some bureaucratic resistance to this private member's bill calling for transparency and accountability. Clearly, it limits bureaucratic ability to direct aid, aside from an accountability to this committee.</div>
    </p><a name="Para20017"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be arguments that it requires a royal recommendation to give a per diem to committee members. God forbid that we should offer to pick up the expenses of these self-sacrificing Canadians.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1815"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1815"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1820"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1810"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1815">(1815)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para20018"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we will hear bureaucratic-speak such as “We need to get this right and we need to do this carefully”. That is bureaucratic code language for “Let us bury this private member's bill in la la land in the hope that Parliament will dissolve prior to royal assent”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para20019"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we will hear arguments like “We do not like petitions from non-citizens telling us that aid is being given in a fashion inconsistent with the purposes of this act”. Heaven forbid that the recipients of the aid should actually have some say about how it is being used.</div>
    </p><a name="Para20020"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we will hear arguments about the definition of aid, whether we should use the OECD definition or a made in Canada definition. I can just see Stephen Lewis rolling his eyes as we speak saying something like, “Oh my goodness, people are dying and you are arguing about definitions”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para20021"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be other arguments, some even sincere and frankly would lead to an improved bill, but mostly the arguments from the government's side will be designed to sideline the bill. It seems to me that a government that prides itself on transparency and accountability is being supremely hypocritical by not supporting this bill.</div>
    </p><a name="Para20022"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to end by quoting from a report called “Establishing a legal basis for Canada's official development assistance”, written by Vicky Edgecombe in January 2005. She ends her report, which I would recommend for members to read, in this fashion:</div>

On Wednesday you invited comments on whether Bill C-293 requires a royal recommendation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para20026"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a separate matter from the stated purpose of the bill, which all members would agreed, that foreign aid should support international development and the values of freedom, democracy, the rule of law and human rights abroad. However, the bill as drafted raises important procedural issues.</div>
    </p><a name="Para20027"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 would oblige the Minister of International Cooperation to establish an advisory committee for international development cooperation. Subclause 6.(3) states that the committee shall consist of up to 20 members. Subclause 6.(7) provides that the members will be paid remuneration and expenses for their services in amounts that the minister may set. These provisions have financial implications.</div>
    </p><a name="Para20028"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On February 8, 2005 the Speaker ruled on a similar case in which additional commissioners were added to an existing commission. In particular, Bill C-280, in the 38th Parliament, which provided for additional appointments to the Canada Employment Insurance Commission, was found by the Speaker to require a royal recommendation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para20029"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-293 would create an entirely new committee and the appointment of its members would similarly require a recommendation. I note that in the February 8, 2005 ruling the Speaker stated:</div>
    </p><a name="Para20030"></a><p>
      <div>
        <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
          <tr valign="top">
            <td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>Where it is clear that the legislative objective of a bill cannot be accomplished without the dedication of public funds to that objective, the bill must be seen as the equivalent of a bill effecting an appropriation.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
    </p><a name="Para20031"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note that clause 7 of Bill C-293 would provide for any resident of a developing country to petition the committee outlining the deficiencies in Canada's development, seeking corrective action, and require the committee to process that petition. It would also require the minister to respond to that petition stating:</div>
    </p><a name="Para20032"></a><p>
      <div>
        <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
          <tr valign="top">
            <td width="30" align="right"></td>
<td><small>--any corrective action required by the competent minister and the period within which the action shall be taken as well as the facts and reasons on which the competent minister’s decision was based.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
    </p><a name="Para20033"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that in addition to the remuneration of the advisory committee members, Bill C-293 would cause new expenditures in two ways.</div>
    </p><a name="Para20034"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, a new advisory committee, and the support of that committee, would be an entirely new function not authorized under existing legislation. </div>
    </p><a name="Para20035"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The committee would clearly require funding in order to fulfill its statutory responsibilities, which would include: receiving, recording and forwarding petitions, in subclause 7.(2); making any examinations and enquiries necessary to monitor ministers' replies to petitions, in subclause 7.(6); and preparing and submitting annual reports to the minister, in clause 8.</div>
    </p><a name="Para20036"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the bill would impose new statutory responsibilities on ministers, which would require new expenditures, including: sending an acknowledgement and reply to the petitioner and the committee, in subclauses 7.(3) and 7.(4); and creating and submitting reports which are newly required by this legislation, in clauses 9 and 10.</div>
    </p><a name="Para20037"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Speaker has, in past rulings, emphasized that a royal recommendation is required for a new and distinct expenditure which falls outside existing departmental responsibilities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para20038"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I submit that Bill C-293 would create a new statutory requirement for monitoring ministerial decisions on development assistance through petitions and for legislatively required responses.</div>
    </p><a name="Para20039"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would note that Canada currently provides development assistance to over 150 countries. Creating an advisory committee allowing any resident of those countries to petition the government and requiring the Minister of International Cooperation to provide a detailed response to such residents would mean significant changes which would have important financial implications for the government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para20040"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the statutory requirement for the Minister of International Cooperation and the Minister of Finance to prepare reports on their activities and operations under this bill would be an entirely new function as some of those reports would be on activities newly required by Bill C-293.</div>
    </p><a name="Para20041"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government supports the use of international development assistance in reducing poverty abroad and improving international human rights.</div>
    </p><a name="Para20042"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as I have indicated, the bill as drafted has financial implications which require a royal recommendation and, therefore, the bill is not procedurally in order.</div>

    </p><a name="Para20063"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Minister of Finance also delivers aid in a certain manner as well. His ODA deliverables have to flow through them.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second issue has to do with the OECD and it has a longstanding definition of what constitutes poverty, which is the definition we adopted.

If the gut purpose of the bill is poverty alleviation, then I do not want to use definitions to effectively circumvent that issue as well.</div>

    </p><a name="Para20066"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Development assistance is an integral part of our international policy and the government places a very high priority on ensuring its effectiveness and efficiency and increasing accountability for results.</div>
    </p><a name="Para20067"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an early demonstration of our commitment to international development assistance, the government has already increased Canada's international assistance budget by $320 million in the budget of 2006.</div>
    </p><a name="Para20068"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Development is a unique challenge and success requires vision, long term programming and the careful management of programs for country-wide improvements. It also requires support for change, strengthening governance, respect for the law and human rights.</div>
    </p><a name="Para20069"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada is recognized as a leader in the development community. To continue to lead, we must ensure that real results from our assistance flow to poor people in developing countries.</div>
    </p><a name="Para20070"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We need clear and precise objectives for Canada's development assistance program. In addition, we must provide clear direction for all government departments and agencies involved in disbursing Canadian development assistance and ensure coherence across government so that we speak with one voice and deliver one coordinated development assistance program.</div>
    </p><a name="Para20071"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I congratulate the hon. member for tabling a bill that focuses on the reduction of poverty and sustainable development. However, while Bill C-293 is well intentioned, it does not adequately address the issues to which I have referred. In fact, Bill C-293 would undermine Canada's ability to set its own agenda for its development assistance program. </div>
    </p><a name="Para20072"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It does that in several ways. First, under clauses 3 and 4 of the bill, it clearly states that development assistance is defined by the development assistance committee of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. While Canada is a proud member of the OECD and respects internationally agreed upon definitions for development assistance, any definitions to be legislated must be wholly Canadian.</div>
    </p><a name="Para20073"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, Bill C-293 would require the government to establish an advisory committee that would provide advice to the Minister of International Cooperation, as well as review and report on Canada's development assistance program. However, the advisory committee is flawed. </div>
    </p><a name="Para20074"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mandate of the committee would place it in an unavoidable conflict of interest. For example, the committee is to advise the Minister of International Cooperation on the exercise of his or her power and then subsequently review and report on its own advice. This is a conflict of interest.</div>
    </p><a name="Para20075"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the government is committed to increasing accountability for all of its programs and it is essential that any organization, body or individual with authority or influence over government programs be held accountable, especially to Parliament as the final custodian of accountability for the Canadian people. The proposed committee demonstrates no such accountability.</div>
    </p><a name="Para20076"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the bill establishes a formal process for individuals in developing countries to petition the Government of Canada directly should they believe that the development assistance being provided to their country is inconsistent with the purposes of the act. To formalize in legislation such a petition process would be costly, complex and cumbersome.</div>
    </p><a name="Para20077"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We currently have systems in place to address concerns that foreign citizens may have, either directly to our ministers or through our missions abroad. </div>
    </p><a name="Para20078"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legislation would not only undermine Canada's sovereignty, but it would escalate administrative and financial costs and lengthen the time between consideration and approval of projects and programs and their actual implementation.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1840"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1840"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1845"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1835"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1840">(1840)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para20079"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are likely to be hidden costs, both in time and in money, associated with the establishment of the advisory committee, the petition system and the reporting requirements. The impact of these arrangements on programming within developing countries is real. The impact on aid effectiveness could only be detrimental.</div>
    </p><a name="Para20080"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This government is committed to working with developing countries to give them and their citizens the tools they require to address their development needs. To this end, we are embarking on a process to renew partnership programming. Through their linkages with the citizens of developing countries, Canadian non-state actors from civil society and the private sector have provided a bridge to the ultimate beneficiaries of Canadian aid.</div>
    </p><a name="Para20081"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This initiative aims to: first, clarify the role and contribution of Canadian partners to international development; second, examine aid effectiveness principles; third, strengthen accountability and results in partnership programming; and fourth, reflect Canadian values in international development cooperation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para20082"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This government recognizes the value and the expertise that Canadians have and can provide in our efforts to help the world's poor. This minister is working to ensure that they play a significant role in Canada's development assistance policy. In addition, we are looking at mechanisms to strengthen accountability and transparency and will ensure that they are consistent with the federal accountability act that is currently before the House.</div>
    </p><a name="Para20083"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We welcome the spirit and the intent of Bill C-293, but the bill will fail to deliver what is required: a clear focused mandate for Canada's development program, a well-defined accountability for those charged with delivering that mandate, and the ability of Canada to work directly with our developing country partners to set an agenda that meets their needs and respects the wishes, desires and trust of the Canadian people. This is a flawed bill put forward for good reason and we recommend to the House that it not be adopted.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;International assistance is a major issue and a daunting challenge. The Bloc Québécois has always been in favour of a greater and more effective increase in development assistance.

    </p><a name="Para20089"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is obvious that in a context of increasingly serious and persistent needs, international assistance must be allocated fairly, but must also be allocated in a way that is maximized, effective and sustainable.</div>
    </p><a name="Para20090"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There must also be greater transparency in how assistance is managed. Indeed, in her February 2005 report, the Auditor General of Canada raised some shortcomings in CIDA's management, namely in the verification and transparency of the assistance allocated.</div>
    </p><a name="Para20091"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more effective the assistance, the greater the chances of reducing poverty and achieving the UN Millennium Development Goals, to which Canada is a signatory.</div>
    </p><a name="Para20092"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have often pointed out in the House of Commons that one of the ways to fight terrorism is to intensify cooperation and more specifically international assistance. Poverty is the most significant weapon of mass destruction on the planet. It is also fertile ground for terrorists, which is why it is so important to increase international assistance and to promote solid and effective cooperation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para20093"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this assistance has to be used for humanitarian purposes and not for national security purposes. Since the events of September 11, 2001, there seems to be some pressure on countries to allocate some of the assistance they receive to security measures and to fighting terrorism. These objectives are highly commendable, but international assistance is not the right vehicle.</div>
    </p><a name="Para20094"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the Canadian Press reported recently that if Afghans want to receive Canadian aid, they have to cooperate with national and military forces to protect their village. Imagine, we are in effect asking the civilian population to take up arms, and we are blackmailing them to boot.</div>
    </p><a name="Para20095"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CIDA projects were not created for these purposes. The funds must be used to rebuild Afghanistan and provide the people with a livelihood.</div>
    </p><a name="Para20096"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other examples of aid projects that are not meeting their intended objectives. Take Palestine, for example. Much of the money intended for the Palestinians is being withheld by Israeli banks, which deprives the population directly.</div>
    </p><a name="Para20097"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the ministers of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation withdrew Canadian aid from the newly elected government of the Palestinian territories, the agreement was that the Canadian government would keep on providing humanitarian aid to the Palestinian people through UN agencies and non-governmental organizations. Only direct aid to the new government was to be suspended. But the reality is quite different. Aid to NGOs is being maintained, but evidence suggests that it is not reaching its destination.</div>
    </p><a name="Para20098"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An entire population is being held hostage. Not only do the Palestinians live in a very difficult political situation, but they also have serious problems making a living. Many young people cannot even go to school anymore. Canada is helping to mortgage future generations.</div>
    </p><a name="Para20099"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Québécois denounced the Canadian government's position, deeming its decision premature.</div>
    </p><a name="Para20100"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all agree that we need to take a cautious and strict attitude toward Hamas, but we have to honour our commitments of humanitarian aid to the Palestinian people.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1845"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1845"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1850"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1840"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1845">(1845)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para20101"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We stigmatize everyone working directly or indirectly for the Palestinian government, but that does not make them terrorists. We must distinguish between those who live in Palestine and those who live for terrorism. </div>
    </p><a name="Para20102"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Québécois believes it is vital to be certain that aid is really being used efficiently and for the purposes for which it is given. </div>
    </p><a name="Para20103"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-293 attempts to correct these problems by giving any resident of a developing country who believes that the development assistance being provided to that country is inconsistent with the purposes of this act the opportunity to make a petition in writing to an advisory committee specifying the deficiencies to be corrected. These two parts of the bill should be subject to in-depth analysis by the parliamentary committee.</div>
    </p><a name="Para20104"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am concerned about the mandate, the composition and the cost of setting up and running this advisory committee. I am also concerned about the role of parliamentarians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para20105"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to petitions, I am somewhat puzzled as to how useful this provision would be and exactly how it would be used. As worded, the provisions in the bill require the advisory committee and the minister to follow up on such petitions. That is fine.</div>
    </p><a name="Para20106"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, returning to my two previous examples, this means that several millions of people could technically complain, all at once, about the misuse of Canadian aid, since it clearly indicates “a resident”. That also means that, between the time when the petition was sent, when the minister replied and indicated the corrective action he intends to take, and the time when any action will actually take place, several months will have gone by and several thousands of people will likely die in the meantime. Malnutrition shows no patience with young children, nor does an epidemic, not to mention other the other problems they face.</div>
    </p><a name="Para20107"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not at all convinced that the use of petitions is appropriate. Would it not be preferable for CIDA to respect its commitments and to take the necessary measures to ensure close follow-up of the projects and their effectiveness? That agency already has the structure in place to fulfill that role. Someone will have to convince me that this is the best possible way to help these people and to ensure the effectiveness of aid.</div>
    </p><a name="Para20108"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, I would like to underscore the importance of subjecting all forms of aid to international standards in terms of human rights, another fundamental aspect of international cooperation. We must also apply the principle of sustainable development. If we want to eliminate poverty, we must do so with a sustainable, long-term vision. </div>
    </p><a name="Para20109"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to turn to the crux of the matter, namely the budget for humanitarian aid. In the past, we asked the previous government several times what it really intended to do to bring the amount of aid to the level required to meet the millennium development goals.</div>
    </p><a name="Para20110"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One might agree with the principle of a bill to enshrine poverty reduction as the ultimate purpose of international aid, but that is not enough. We must ensure that all millennium development goals are addressed and met. The word “poverty” therefore has to be interpreted in the broadest sense, which also implies being able to obtain health care, get an education and live in a healthy and sustainable environment.</div>
    </p><a name="Para20111"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, for all the millennium development goals to be met, in addition to legislation, we need to substantially increase the budget for development assistance. Unfortunately, the first Conservative budget did not fill the bill and failed to show any real intention to meet the international aid target of 0.7% of GDP by 2015.</div>
    </p><a name="Para20112"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will remind the hon. members of this House, and the Prime Minister in particular, that, in February 2005, a letter signed by the three opposition leaders was sent to the Prime Minister of the Liberal government, asking him to pass legislation making poverty reduction the ultimate purpose of government development assistance and urging him to implement a strategy promoting a steady and foreseeable increase in development assistance. They were also calling for a substantial and immediate increase of the aid budget.</div>
    </p><a name="Para20113"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is apparent that the Prime Minister has difficulty putting his words into action. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, this bill's goal is fundamental. However, some aspects of the bill will need to be considered in greater detail at committee.</div>

I congratulate him for having introduced this bill entitled “an act respecting the provision of development assistance abroad”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para20116"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will be supporting the bill. This will not surprise anybody because it is a replication of a bill that I had already introduced six weeks ago in the House.</div>
    </p><a name="Para20117"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am profoundly disappointed, actually very dismayed, by the way in which the government has chosen to deal with the bill before us. It is a huge violation of the spirit of cooperation and collaboration that was shown both in the foreign affairs committee over a period of more than two years of work around overseas development assistance issues and in the House. On June 28 last year, members voted unanimously to support a recommendation from the foreign affairs committee. I want to read part of that it into the record. It stated that Parliament:</div>

</div>
    </p><a name="Para20119"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was a genuine expression of a point of view brought forward again and again by witnesses before the foreign affairs committee, literally over a period of two and a half years. The first of those witnesses to appear was on April 1, 2003. It was the special envoy for HIV-AIDS in Africa, Stephen Lewis, who serves under the UN Secretary-General. We had a continual flow of recommendations around this essential topic.</div>
    </p><a name="Para20120"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is very disappointing is that we have not seen tonight in this debate a reflection or a continuation of that spirit of cooperation. It is absolutely in order. In fact, it is the responsibility of each and every one of us as private members to bring forward the different points of view that one will reflect upon and express on any bill that comes before us. It is heart-breaking, if we look at all the work done by NGOs, particularly the umbrella organization for the 100 or more NGOs, the Canadian Council for International Co-operation. Also many witnesses came before the committee in the belief that Canada wanted to re-establish itself as a leader with credibility around overseas development assistance.</div>
    </p><a name="Para20121"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CIDA minister appeared before the foreign affairs committee yesterday. I received a letter from the her yesterday, after a four month delay since I wrote to her urging urgent action on this matter. All indications from the government on this are very disappointing, in fact I would say alarming. It is its intention to take us backwards instead of moving forward on something around which there was an astounding consensus at the foreign affairs committee and in the House.</div>
    </p><a name="Para20122"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A constructive action that could have been taken tonight would have been to indicate that this matter is worthy of examination by the foreign affairs committee, with a sense of urgency that is appropriate given that a whole year has passed since Parliament spoke with one voice to say that we should move forward on this.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1855"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1855"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1900"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1850"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1855">(1855)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para20123"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead, what we have heard is a bunch of procedural argument, all of which could have been addressed in a meaningful debate at the committee level. Frankly, it was even more disappointing to have heard from the minister that she would begin to look at some of the ways that we could improve our aid delivery and our accountability. At some future date, heavens knows when, we might actually begin to see some progress from the government. It is very disappointing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para20124"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I meant what I said on this floor on May 1 when I introduced the companion bill to one now before us. I pleaded with the government to make it its own and scrap the private member's bill if it were so inclined. However, for heaven's sake, move on this issue. Millions of people are dying unnecessarily of hunger and disease because of the grinding poverty in which they are living.</div>
    </p><a name="Para20125"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada is a contributor to those killer conditions. Instead of the Liberal government moving us forward with a level of overseas development assistance that would allow Canadians to hold their heads up high, it took us from 0.5% of ODA assistance, which was in place under the previous Conservative government, back to where it was at .23%. </div>
    </p><a name="Para20126"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have no indication whatsoever from the government that it intends to move on any of the recommendations that were brought forward unanimously by the foreign affairs committee and unanimously endorsed in the House on June 28, 2005. </div>
    </p><a name="Para20127"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I still plead with the government to realize that the appropriate sense of urgency with which this matter should be addressed would be for the bill to go to committee at the earliest possible time, where it could be debated and amendments proposed. I know the member for Scarborough—Guildwood has indicated, as have I, that each of the points raised are legitimate points that can be addressed and around which some flexibility is appropriate.</div>
    </p><a name="Para20128"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I think it is clear that an advisory council is an important part of this, the bill does not require a royal recommendation. It says the advisory council “may” receive remuneration. It is up to the minister to decide on that. Therefore, that could be addressed.</div>
    </p><a name="Para20129"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been another issue raised, but I am will not go into the obstructionistic procedural posturing that we have heard from the government side tonight. It is extremely disappointing. I think Canadians applauded spirit of cooperation, which is desperately needed by people around the world who are suffering from the most degrading poverty on earth. We owe it to Canadians and to those suffering from global poverty, in the spirit of the make poverty history campaign and in the spirit of the work done over a two and a half year period, to move ahead and deal with the bill at committee at the earliest possible date.</div>
    </p><a name="Para20130"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the government cannot bring itself to do that, because it wants to be the sole author of an appropriate bill, then in the name of heaven let us agree and commit ourselves to fast track a bill that the government would introduce so we could then get on with taking action.</div>
    </p><a name="Para20131"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know how else to do this but to plead with the government not to make all Canadians and parliamentarians look ridiculous by obstructing and blocking progress on something so urgent to the most desperately poor people of the world.</div>

    </p><a name="Para20133"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank the hon. member and my colleague, who once shared part of my riding or I shared part of his, the member for Scarborough—Guildwood. He has taken a very important step toward focusing Parliament toward commitments that have been made, not only by colleagues in my party, but very clearly, as suggested by the hon. member for Halifax and earlier by the member himself, by Parliament. Parliament should proceed at the earliest opportunity.</div>
    </p><a name="Para20134"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Based on the letter from February 17, 2005, all three then opposition leaders, now one Prime Minister and two opposition leaders, made it abundantly clear where they stood on ensuring that CIDA moneys were focused on poverty elimination. It is not lost on Canadians, on civil society and on the efforts made in the past that on this day alone one-third of the people who will die in this world will die as a result of poverty, the result of neglect and starvation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para20135"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is extremely important that Canadians understand what this debate is about. It is not at this stage increasing the funding. It is targeting the funding.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also want to compliment not only my colleague, the member for Scarborough—Guildwood, but also the hon. member for Halifax who quite rightly, in what was a tornado of events in June 2005, brought Parliament together to ensure that the government and Parliament would agree to the target of .07% in terms of our obligations of international development. We know where this Parliament stands.</div>
    </p><a name="Para20137"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to point out that the letter was signed by the leader of the Bloc Québécois, who is still here, the leader of the New Democratic Party, who is still here and the leader of the opposition of the Conservative Party, who is now Prime Minister. There are two points that the now Prime Minister, then opposition leader, made. I will read this into the record.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That does not just bind us in the House of Commons. I respectfully submit that it binds the Prime Minister. Regardless of the procedural tactics not to deal with this and concerns about who is going to handle this or that, I can tell the hon. parliamentary secretary this. He sat on the same foreign affairs committee that recommended this a little earlier and he is now the parliamentary secretary responsible for CIDA. He will remember the RADARSAT issue in which we could not figure out who would be responsible for making decisions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para20142"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those are decisions that could be made with the expertise that we have in committee and the engagement of civil society and of witnesses. it seems to me to be abundantly clear and plain to everybody who is listening today that all parties have agreed in one form or another to the need to pass the bill. It is my view that the initiative by the member, supported by so many members of the House of Commons and now supported by the right hon. Prime Minister, make it incumbent on the Prime Minister to accept this. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, let me go one step further. The Conservative Party in a number of initiatives agreed, not only obviously with their leader, but if I am not mistaken with their own policy platform, their resolution of March 2005, a mere month after. I know many hon. colleagues in the Conservative Party, who are here today, will remember that they voted for the following:</div>

It has become abundantly clear, certainly in my time in foreign affairs, that our greatest talents, our greatest efforts, and ones which we are greatly acknowledged for, lie in our ability to help the people in the world who are vulnerable, regardless of their circumstances, and who, through no fault of their own, may very well die today or in the next few days, poverty being the basis on which other diseases and problems occur.</div>
    </p><a name="Para20148"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It seems to me that Parliament must debate but it must also act. The wisdom provided by my hon. colleague, the member for Scarborough—Guildwood, cannot be gainsaid. I think we all have an obligation to remind Canadians of the things we want to accomplish. Considering the spirit of the bill, not only is it about focusing, but it is also about transparency, accountability and input from the NGOs and organizations that do so much. </div>
    </p><a name="Para20149"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can obviously take time to amend this bill in committee, as that is of course the purpose of committee, but I would launch a challenge to all members of Parliament to find it within themselves to see this bill for what it is. It is a true testament to an issue whose time has come, not in terms of engagement of hostilities but in fact to offer to the rest of the world, as some other leading nations are today, the issue of putting a priority on the reduction of poverty first.</div>
    </p><a name="Para20150"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not nine months ago, Parliament did indeed do that. Regardless of the political circumstances that existed at the time, we made it abundantly clear on all sides of the House that it was important, thanks in many measures to the member for Halifax, to support a resolution to ensure that we look at global poverty reduction but that Canada also respect its commitment. </div>
    </p><a name="Para20151"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for working in the department, I understand that there may be concerns about protecting certain interests within the department and having the flexibility of saying that we use CIDA to obtain different policies which might have the effect of furthering Canada's interests. One person talked to me a little earlier about the questions of security. Some talked to us about questions of Canada's priorities, which have nothing to do with poverty reduction or security, necessarily, but which might somehow encumber the government in terms of its flexibility. </div>
    </p><a name="Para20152"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I realize that this is an important imperative, but it is not an imperative that stands in the face of dying children and people who, through no fault of their own today, by the misfortune of living in another part of the world as a result of war or strife, or as a result of nations that fail to protect people's human rights and dignity, are left in the position where they have no alternative but to hope that the Parliament in Ottawa, Canada, today will get it act together collectively and make sure that its best efforts in terms of resources are placed on the people who need it most.</div>
    </p><a name="Para20153"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know what credos we share, and I do not know what backgrounds we have, and I am not exactly sure of differences in terms of our policies and philosophies, but helping the most vulnerable and ensuring that Canada puts its best foot forward is, I believe, something that we all share in common and that we as a Parliament have a duty to do and to enact.</div>
    </p><a name="Para20154"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to say this and I encourage members on this side of the House to do the same. I agree with what the Prime Minister said on February 17, 2005. I agree with the leader of the Bloc Québécois. I agree with the leader of the New Democratic Party. It is good to talk about these things, but I think we have come to a point where we must act now, we must act purposefully and we must act in the most important crisis facing the world today, which is clearly the reduction of poverty.</div>

It accepted Bill C-66, which extended the EnerGuide program to help individuals, particularly those on low incomes and seniors, like my constituent Maggie Robertson who, over a month after the announcement was made, had been told she would not be eligible for the program as a result of a cut in the budget. It has still not been confirmed whether she has in fact received this.</div>
    </p><a name="Para20157"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find it unacceptable that a government that campaigned on transparency and accountability would be so callous as to axe the EnerGuide program for low income households of $550 million as well as deep cuts to the EnerGuide house retrofit incentive program.</div>
    </p><a name="Para20158"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important for people to understand that this is not just a question of helping people make the updates that are good for them in terms of bringing their costs down as a result of energy costs that are spiralling out of control. It is also about putting these individuals in a position where they can actually contribute to reducing greenhouse gases and to try to find ways in which to help Canadians who have done so much to build this nation. </div>
    </p><a name="Para20159"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me that for the minister to somehow suggest that because of the audit process being some 50%, which it is not--it is 12%--that we should not have some kind of accountability to measure what is being invested, is, in my view, an abdication of the government's responsibility to taxpayers. </div>
    </p><a name="Para20160"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am waiting for the Minister of Natural Resources to tell the House if he is prepared to live up to the commitment and tell Canadians why, in the first instance, he broke a promise and why he was not prepared to stand up for Canadians and, despite the unanimous consent of the hon. members in the Conservative Party, why the government felt it was important to cut this program.</div>
    </p><a name="Para20161"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have more items I would like to introduce which go hand in hand with the 85¢ a litre and the cut in the GST but I will give the Minister of Natural Resources or his representative, the hon. parliamentary secretary, the opportunity to answer. I think they have some explaining to do and they have to explain that to the 150,000 Canadians who are basically left in the dark and left in the cold.</div>

    </p><a name="Para20163"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The honourable member was concerned about the EnerGuide program and other programs implemented by the previous government to deal with climate change. </div>
    </p><a name="Para20164"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to remind the honourable member that the Minister of Finance has committed $2 billion to the environment and energy efficiency in the budget tabled a few weeks ago. In that budget $380 million is allocated to the climate change program. It is a significant investment.</div>
    </p><a name="Para20165"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that such an investment would be put to better use and give better results than the moneys spent by the previous government. Our government is committed to pursuing new avenues in the area of climate change policies. We want to establish a plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, a plan that will take into account the economic, social and environmental context of our country. We want to establish a plan to ensure that we have clean air, water, soil and energy for Canadians, and an effective and realistic approach to climate change issues for Canada. It is not enough to follow in the footsteps of the previous government, that is, to make an international commitment without adopting a plan to implement it and without determining the repercussions for Canada. We have seen the results of that approach.</div>
    </p><a name="Para20166"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several years after the Liberal government brought in programs and spent hundreds of millions of dollars on climate change initiatives, we are still a long way from producing meaningful results and honouring our commitments.</div>
    </p><a name="Para20167"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberals were aiming at a 6% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Today, Canada's emissions are 35% above that target. It is time to restructure our climate change programs. It is time for practical solutions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para20168"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The budget contains $380 million for climate change initiatives. This is the same amount the previous government allocated. But now we have to find the best way to use that money to have the greatest impact on climate change. Some existing programs can be tailored to our strategy. In other cases, though, we will have to see whether taxpayers' money can be better used to support the new strategy. All the climate change initiatives are being reviewed to ensure that they produce real results for Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para20169"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After examining the EnerGuide for houses retrofit incentive program, the government concluded that taxpayers' money could be better used and allocated to initiatives that will have a greater impact on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. </div>
    </p><a name="Para20170"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, the program ended at midnight on May 12, 2006. Homeowners who had an evaluation performed under the EnerGuide for houses program still qualify for a grant provided that they make the residential energy upgrades and meet all the program requirements by March 31, 2007.</div>
    </p><a name="Para20171"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government is working on a new strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The various ministers responsible will announce specific initiatives in the weeks and months to come. The House will see the wisdom of investing in programs that will have a real impact on air and water quality and energy efficiency for Canadians.</div>

That party supported this program. Those members supported it unanimously. This has saved Canadians over $650 million net. It is a program that has proved to be successful on a number of ideas for Canadians, with average help of $750 a year for people who truly need it. </div>
    </p><a name="Para20173"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the member for St. John's East, back in 2003, said in a question to the House:</div>

</table>
</div>
    </p><a name="Para20175"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservatives knew about it, but what has happened is that there has been a bit of a bait and switch program going on here. They did not cost out their election promises, and as a result, they have cut a very good program. They have cut it deeply and have hurt the very Canadians who not only are making a contribution to energy reduction, but are helping to stave off cold winters. This program was able to help them during difficult times. </div>
    </p><a name="Para20176"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very callous idea from a minister who clearly cannot articulate why he did it. He was told to do it and unfortunately many Canadians are suffering as a result of it. Shame on that. When is the minister going to stand up and tell us when this program is going to be reintroduced immediately to help those he has left high and dry?</div>

    </p><a name="Para20182"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members have had the privilege of acting on behalf of their constituents when they needed urgent passports. These urgent passports were normally required when there was a sickness or death in the family and the passport was needed within a 10 day period. Individuals living in northern and rural areas however have no ready access to a passport office. </div>
    </p><a name="Para20183"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that individuals living in an urban area would normally receive their passport in 20 days, but this service is not available to those individuals living in remote areas. The government has set up an office through Service Canada in my own community. I am really concerned about individuals living in northern and remote areas who have to drive sometimes 8 to 12 hours to get to the closest passport office. These individuals can no longer get support from their members of Parliament. </div>
    </p><a name="Para20184"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not understand the change in policy that the government has brought forward. I wonder if the government understands the impact this policy is having and its discriminatory nature. I believe this is now creating a two tier system, one for constituents who live in large centres where there is a passport office nearby and one for constituents who live in northern and remote areas who do not have a passport office. Somebody in a big centre like Toronto can just jump on a subway, catch a bus or take a taxi to a passport office, whereas those individuals living in remote areas face greater difficulties. </div>
    </p><a name="Para20185"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder if the parliamentary secretary could inform me as to whether or not the government understands the difficulty this has created. I wonder if it has come up with any resolution to this problem. </div>
    </p><a name="Para20186"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister suggested that I bring all of my cases to him, and I have brought a couple in the last few weeks. I was hoping, in the weeks since I asked my question, that perhaps there would be some clearer understanding and some policy changes made. I was also hoping some direction would be given to members who want to serve our constituents in this way. </div>

    </p><a name="Para20188"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last April the Auditor General in her report on passport services, which was tabled in Parliament, specifically raised the importance of further analyzing security and privacy issues in regard to the services provided by members of Parliament.</div>
    </p><a name="Para20189"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In direct response to this observation, a new policy guideline regarding the roles and responsibilities of members of Parliament and the passport office were introduced on April 1, 2006 to address increased security and privacy requirements.</div>
    </p><a name="Para20190"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since September 11, 2001 we all know that security has been highlighted due to the threats from terrorists. As Canadian passports have become attractive to those people, we naturally have had to introduce these new security measures, as has been pointed out by the Auditor General.</div>
    </p><a name="Para20191"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Passport Canada values the services provided by members of Parliament and is committed to working with MPs to provide services to Canadians. Passport Canada has a section dedicated to ensure that service requests from members of Parliament are actioned effectively and efficiently. </div>
    </p><a name="Para20192"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The normal standard of service for an application submitted through the office of a member of Parliament is 20 working days. For exceptional cases where a passport is required in less than 20 working days for humanitarian and compassionate reasons or imminent travel business, members of Parliament are to contact the MP section of Passport Canada during normal working hours. After hours, emergency services are available through a network of duty officers. </div>
    </p><a name="Para20193"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Passport Canada will take appropriate action on a case by case basis to assist any Canadian who legitimately requires a passport on an urgent basis regardless of where they reside. These cases are exceptional and will be dealt with accordingly. Past history has shown that these cases represent less than 1% of requests received through members of Parliament.</div>
    </p><a name="Para20194"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to bear in mind that even in exceptional cases, a personal appearance before a Passport Canada officer is an integral part of the security and integrity of the passport issuing process. This measure is intended to authenticate the identity of Canadians applying for a passport and to reduce the risk of identity fraud by allowing for an immediate and thorough verification of the identity.</div>
    </p><a name="Para20195"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each member of Parliament has been provided with a comprehensive guide to assist with processing passport applications.</div>
    </p><a name="Para20196"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Passport Canada guide for members of Parliament is available. Detailed information of the service locations can be found in this guide. Information on passport services provided by members of Parliament is also available on the Passport Canada MP website. An information session hosted by Passport Canada for members of Parliament and their staff has been held and more sessions will follow.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to assure the member that our objective is to improve security while maintaining the level of client service through multiple business channels. Passport Canada continues to be committed to--</div>

It does not sound like the government fully understands the inconvenience that this will create for literally thousands of people, particularly constituents in the rural, northern and remote areas that many of us in this place represent. We are trying to help our constituents get the services that are available to literally millions of Canadians who happen to live in larger centres where there is a passport office.</div>
    </p><a name="Para20200"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand the security issues. We hear about them here all the time. However, security should not always trump our need to provide service to our constituents who are upstanding law-abiding Canadian citizens who simply want the same service that others are getting.</div>
    </p><a name="Para20201"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The requirement that a person appear in person before a passport officer to get an urgent passport is inconsistent with the process that is in place. Every year thousands of people mail in their applications and documentation and receive their passports through the mail and there is no requirement for a face to face meeting with anybody. I do not understand where in that instance it is okay, but in the instance where--</div>
