	<B>The Speaker:</B> We are beginning a new tradition today which has

	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is with 
sorrow that I report on the passing on Monday of Gary Herrema, 
chair of the regional municipality of Durham.
<P>
	Mr. Herrema, who was a long time resident and farm operator in 
Uxbridge, was first elected in 1969 as councillor for what was then 
Scott township. As a testament to his leadership abilities, Gary 
Herrema became Durham regional chair in 1980 and remained in 
that position until his death just this last Monday.
<P>
	Durham, for the edification of the House, represents 425,000 
people.
<P>
	I am proud to note that not only was Gary Herrema a Liberal 
candidate in the 1984 federal election, he was also an active and 
long time supporter of his community, of Parliament and of 
Canada.
<P>
	Today, Durham residents and their fellow Canadians are 
saddened by the loss of Gary Herrema. On their behalf, I convey 
my heartfelt sympathy to his wife, Helen, and to his family.

	<B>Mr. Gary Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the senators held hearings in western Canada on Bill C-68 giving 
many Canadians the only chance they had to be heard.
<P>
	The senators heard testimony from retired town councillor Jim 
Barker in Dauphin, Manitoba. He estimated that by the year 2003 
the town of Dauphin will have to hire two more RCMP constables 
and two police clerks to handle the additional workload to 
implement the Liberal government's flawed firearm registration 
scheme.
<P>
	Barker testified: ``The ratepayers of this town will have to 
budget a minimum expenditure increase of $200,000 per year. It is 
interesting to note that if these costs are at or near average, then the 
total cost to the lower levels of government in Canada for firearms 
registration would be around $540 million per year''.
<P>
	This new evidence had never been heard by Parliament before 
and justified the senators' decision to take their hearings on the 
road. Why is it that senators in Ontario, Quebec and Atlantic 
Canada did not give their citizens the same opportunity to be heard 
as voters in the west?
<P>

	<B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, thanks to the 
hon. member of the Conservative Party from Sherbrooke who 
wrote to the auditor general, the death valley diversion in Nova 
Scotia became a national issue.
<P>
	In turn, the auditor general is very critical of the government for 
diverting $26 million from a federal-provincial agreement for work 
on a dangerous stretch of the Trans-Canada Highway to a tourist 
trail in the riding of the minister of public works.
<P>
	The auditor general noted in his report that ``the agreement 
assigns a duty of project review and approval but in this case, such 
a review was pre-empted by ministers who presented the matter as 
a fait accompli to officials who, in the circumstances, could only 
implement the decision''.
<P>
	Although they were forced to reverse their decision in August, 
upgrades to death valley will still be paid for by toll fees.
<P>
	The public works minister, agreeing with the leader of the third 
party, once said the province was showing real leadership by 
making people pay user fees for their highways. The people of 
Nova Scotia and my party certainly do not feel that way.

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="HUMANRIGHTS">HUMAN RIGHTS</A></H3>
	<B>Ms. Colleen Beaumier (Brampton, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, Canada 
has a long tradition of active involvement within the UN field of 
human rights. This tradition started with the late John Humphrey, 
one of the architects of the international bill of rights and the first 
director of the UN human rights division.
<P>
	Canada continues to play a prominent role in promoting 
universal human rights and in strengthening international human 
rights mechanisms.
<P>
	Since the establishment of the UN High Commissioner for 
Human Rights in 1993, Canada has sought to integrate the 
activities of the high commissioner and other human rights 
institutions into the UN's political, security and developmental 
activities and into the early warning and preventive work of the 
organization. This is an indication of Canada's overall emphasis on 
addressing root causes of instability which is consistent with the 
vision UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali outlined in his 
``Agenda for Peace''.
<P>
	As we welcome the UN Secretary-General to our nation's 
capital, let us reaffirm Canada's commitment to promote human 
rights in the community of nations and to strengthen the United 
Nations.

	<B>Mr. Walt Lastewka (St. Catharines, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
members of the Lincoln and Welland Regiment from St. Catharines 
have recently received two additional and long overdue battle 
honours from World War II.
<P>
	The medals are in honour of the exceptional conduct and courage 
of the members of the Lincoln and Welland Regiment while part of 
the 10th Infantry Brigade of the Canadian 4th Armoured Division 
during battles in Kustan Canal and Bad-Zwisch, Germany in April 
1945.
<P>
	Colonel Don Muir, a major in command of a rifle battalion 
during both battles, noted that fighting was very intense in those 
last weeks of the war. Roy Adams, the regiment's president and 
also a veteran of those battles noted that his only regret is that many 
of the men who helped them earn these honours have passed away.
<P>
	I would just like to say how proud I am and all Canadians are of 
our veterans. Their dedication, discipline and sacrifice made an 
allied victory possible in the second world war.
<P>
	Congratulations to the Lincoln and Welland Regiment on this 
well earned, overdue honour.

	<B>Mr. Allan Kerpan (Moose Jaw-Lake Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, western Canadian farmers are frustrated by the manner in 
which the WGTA payout is being handled. The lack of direction in 
providing formulas for sharing of the payment by landowner and 
tenant producer has caused confusion, tension and in many cases 
bitterness at the farm gate. Farmers who have financial agreements 
with the Farm Credit Corporation are particularly upset with its 
handling of the WGTA payout.
<P>
	The minister instructed the FCC in March 1995 to pass along the 
benefit to producers. That benefit has mysteriously shrunk over the 
last eight months to a whopping 25 per cent of the benefit. Their 
questionable rationale was that holding back 75 per cent of the 
benefit would result in lower lease and sale agreements. The fact is 
the Farm Credit Corporation lease agreements and buyback asking 
prices have actually increased by as much as 20 per cent.
<P>
<B>(1405 )</B>
<P>
	Farmers are demanding that the agriculture minister and the 
Farm Credit Corporation honour their original commitment to the 
producers of prairie grain.

	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Prime Minister's thinly disguised threats to the CBC, which he 
accuses of not fulfilling its mandate as a promoter of Canadian 
unity, are an attack on the freedom of the press.
<P>
	It is therefore not surprising that the Fédération professionnelle 
des journalistes du Québec has launched a petition aimed at 
preserving the independence of that crown corporation. The FPJQ 
feels that the Prime Minister has questioned the corporation's 
independence from the government.
<P>
	For the Bloc members, there is nothing ambiguous about the 
message between the lines of what has been said by the Prime 
Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister and the minister of fisheries: 
the CBC is vulnerable to government pressure.
<P>
	Now one wonders whether the scope of the budget cuts is not a 
form of reprisal by the Prime Minister, who has never accepted the 
change in the CBC's mandate and sees it as nothing more than a 
propaganda organ.

certainly not by scaring away investors, as the PQ has done for the

Liberal candidates by almost half a million dollars.
<P>
	That is right. The party that likes to point fingers at others about

	In this House there is a separatist party that is quite open about 
its desire to break up Canada. We may not like its beliefs but its 
mandate is clear.
<P>
	However, we have another party, the Reform Party, that does not

not like the Canada pension plan and criticizes every attempt to end 
duplication. Time and time again that party has shown its contempt 
for Atlantic Canada. Now it says it will be the voice to represent 
Atlantic Canadians. I tell this House that Atlantic Canadians will 
not support a party that cannot decide what to support itself.
<P>
	The Liberal Party agenda has always been clear. The Liberal 
government believes that all Canadians are born equal and deserve 
equal rights. We believe in offering a hand up to those in need and

<P>
	The Liberal solution to unemployment in Cape Breton is simply 
to airlift people out to Ontario. They cling to the belief that

development resources are spent. They ridicule Reform's proposal 
to give citizens at the provincial and community levels the tools 
needed to develop self-reliance and a strong economic future.

<P>
	Rather than make the operations of the fisheries department

	On November 23, 1837, the Patriotes defeated British troops at

motion officially recognizing the historic contribution of the

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="THECONSTITUTION">THE CONSTITUTION</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in the final stretch of the referendum campaign, the Prime 
Minister made a commitment to respond to Quebecers' desire for 
change. In the days following the referendum, the government set 
up two committees. One, chaired by the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, is to propose changes to the federal 
system by Christmastime. Yesterday, outside the  House, the 
government 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16663"> 16663 </A></B>
<P>
leader postponed the tabling of the committees' proposals by 
several months.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister. Are we to understand that 
the extension of the deadlines of the ministerial committee on 
constitutional change announced yesterday by the Prime Minister 
means he has been unable to rally the premiers of English Canada 
round a proposal for constitutional change?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, first let me say we are very sorry to see the Leader of the 
Opposition leave the federal scene.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> Over the past two years I have 
really enjoyed meeting him daily and answering his questions. I 
therefore wish him all the luck in the task he set for himself 
yesterday of dealing with Quebec's real problems-good 
management and putting Quebec's public finances in order. 
Obviously, someone else will be here across the way, in a few 
months.
<P>
	However, to answer the hon. member's question, first, we have 
always said we were prepared to make changes. But we never 
promised to make constitutional changes, particularly since I 
promised during the referendum campaign that I would make no 
constitutional changes and that the House would not debate 
constitutional change if the Government of Quebec did not 
approve.
<P>
	Yesterday, I got an answer from the Leader of the Opposition, 
who said he absolutely did not want any constitutional change. 
Therefore I am in no hurry, since he does not want any, and we said 
would not make any without their support.
<P>
	However, some administrative changes may be made. There are 
signs of willingness on the part of the federal government, which 
could be debated and voted on in the House. I said that we would 
proceed with certain items between now and Christmas and I asked 
the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and his committee to 
report back by Christmas. We are not talking about several months. 
This is November 22, and in a month from now it will be three days 
before Christmas. So we are not talking about months, but weeks, 
Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I note the profound sadness overcoming the Prime 
Minister at the prospect of my leaving the House of Commons, 
should the members of the Parti Quebecois so wish it. But he 
should not worry: I will not be far away.
<P>
	I listened carefully to the Prime Minister's response on the 
changes he is not planning to make any more. Am I wrong, or did 
the Prime Minister say that he is backing down on the promise of 
constitutional change he made less than a month ago, that he is 
contemplating merely minor administrative changes and that his 
committee will now be called the ministerial committee on 
administrative change?
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition has gone back to his old 
habits of commenting on what we have said. He made absolutely 
gratuitous statements during the referendum, and we will not let 
him get away with it any more.
<P>
	I never said we were going to change the Constitution. He should 
read the speech I gave. I said we were going to make changes to the 
federation, constitutional changes, if necessary, but I never said 
they were going to be constitutional. I also said there would be no 
constitutional change without Quebec's approval. The Leader of 
the Opposition said yesterday he did not want any. He wants to 
remain a separatist-good for him. So we will bear this in mind, we 
will do what has to be done to keep the federation running and we 
will get on with the real problems, as the Leader of the Opposition 
put it, we will be concerned with job creation, good government 
and the deficit problems of both the federal and the provincial 
governments.
<P>
	If the Leader of the Opposition really wants to work on these 
problems, we are prepared to co-operate with him.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, what a sorry about-face. If I ever do go to Quebec City, I 
will tell Mr. Johnson not to hold his breath for the changes he is 
expecting from the Prime Minister.
<P>
	Should we conclude, and this question is clear-if there is one 
thing I have learned in this House, it is how to answer 
questions-are we to conclude that, as of today, less than a month 
after the referendum, after the speech we all heard in which the 
Prime Minister promised Quebec everything anyone could ever 
want after the referendum campaign, are we to understand that he is 
reneging on these changes he made hastily at the time and that he is 
going back to his old strategy of putting English Canada to sleep 
and offering Quebec nothing?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, what I said in my speech was very simple. I said that my 
party and I had been, are currently and would be in favour of a 
distinct society for Quebec, something the Leader of the 
Opposition and his party fought against in the Charlottetown 
accord.
<P>
	Furthermore, during the referendum, he criticized us for not 
having supported that, when they voted against it in the 
Charlottetown referendum and all the PQ members voted against 
the Meech Lake accord in the National Assembly. We are still in 
favour of a distinct society, as we indicated in Charlottetown and in 
this House. In order to add it to the Constitution, we require the 
approval of the Government of Quebec. The Leader  of the 
Opposition has said he 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16664"> 16664 </A></B>
<P>
does not want it written into the Constitution. So we will not do it 
against the wishes of Quebec.
<P>
	Secondly, I said that we did not want any constitutional changes 
without the agreement of the Government of Quebec or the people 
of Quebec, as has happened in the past. Sometimes referendums 
can be held. Here again, we cannot act without the approval of 
Quebec. We can, however, impose certain restrictions on ourselves, 
if we wish. This is perhaps what we will do.
<P>
	As for sharing responsibilities, the minister responsible has 
signed nine agreements with the provinces to improve the system 
and put an end to duplication. The current PQ government is not 
interested in such an agreement. I hope that, as government leader, 
the Leader of the Opposition will make good management a 
priority and help us determine which jurisdictions are in 
competition so we can ensure that taxpayers in Quebec as in the 
other provinces receive the most for the taxes they pay annually to 
the two levels of government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, what a 
regrettable performance by someone wanting to renege on his 
commitments and not able to find a way to get out of those he 
cannot keep.
<P>
	The Prime Minister of Canada was one of those who loved us so 
madly three days before the referendum that he promised 
recognition of a special status for Quebec. He promised us a right 
of veto, as well as decentralized powers. That is what he promised 
us just before the referendum, when he loved us.
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister be frank enough to admit that he then 
heeded his mentor Pierre Trudeau's admonition of several weeks 
ago, and that his about-face is the result of the word from Trudeau?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I told Quebecers there would be no constitutional change 
without the consent of the government of Quebec.
<P>
	Yesterday the man who wishes to head the Government of 
Quebec said that this was impossible, that he was a sovereignist, 
that he did not want any changes to the Constitution. I was not the 
one who said this, it was the Leader of the Opposition himself. As I 
have said, I will not make any changes against his wishes; let no 
one blame me for heeding the wishes of the Government of 
Quebec.
<P>
	Second, as for the distinct society, we have affirmed this and will 
have other occasions to affirm it, and I hope that the hon. member 
for Roberval will get up in this House and state that he is in favour 
of a distinct society if that is what is wanted. I can hardly wait for 
that day to come.
<P>
	Then we shall see what really happens. During the referendum 
campaign, they said that in their hearts they were opposed to a 
distinct society because they are sovereignists, and still 
unfortunately separatists.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, are the 
words of the Prime Minister, who is getting caught up in an 
increasingly tangled web, not an admission of his powerlessness, 
his inability to fulfil his commitments toward Quebec made within 
three days of the referendum, when he was in love with Quebec?
<P>
	Is this not an admission of powerlessness? Does the Prime 
Minister realize that mere cosmetic changes will never satisfy 
Quebec, and that he is incapable of an in depth solution to the 
problem?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my speech is recorded and is clear. I said that the party I 
represent was in favour of a distinct society and that we were going 
to affirm it. We will have the opportunity to affirm it, even if the 
Bloc Quebecois does not want us to.
<P>
	Second, I have said and I have committed to it, that we would not 
make any constitutional change without the consent of the 
Government of Quebec or the people of Quebec, and we are going 
to keep our word. Nothing can be clearer than that, and I repeat it 
today in this House.
<P>
	As for better administration and shared responsibilities, we are 
working on this at the present time and I trust that we will have the 
co-operation of the new Government of Quebec, unlike the current 
one, which has never wanted to discuss it seriously with the 
minister responsible for federal-provincial relations.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, all of us are familiar with the principle that those who do 
not learn from the mistakes of the past are bound to repeat them.
<P>
	In the Quebec referendum campaign the biggest mistake the 
Prime Minister made was to grossly underestimate the demand for 
change in his home province. It was only in the last week of that 
campaign that he mentioned change at all, and when he did so it 
was so vague as to have no positive consequence on the campaign.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister repeat that mistake again by putting 
change on the back burner or will he present Canadians with a 
substantial plan for showing the way this federation ought to 
operate?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the leader of the third party always refers to the fact that 
we do not need any constitutional change. He said that in the House 
not long ago. He says that he does not want to weaken the federal 
government but whenever he makes a speech he asks us, for 
example, to dismantle medicare.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16665"> 16665 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> They are changing their minds 
because the people of Alberta at this moment are telling the 
provincial government that they do not want to see medicare 
destroyed.
<P>
	We are working to make sure there is less duplication and a 
better sharing of responsibilities between the provincial 
governments and the federal government. We are working on that.
<P>
<B>(1430)</B>
<P>
	However, if the goal is to destroy the central government in 
Ottawa so that we will have a community of communities, this 
Prime Minister is not for that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister speaks of destroying the country and 
dismantling federalism. I remind him he is the one who allowed the 
country to get within .6 of 1 per cent-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order. The hon. member for Calgary Southwest.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manning:</B> Mr. Speaker, we are talking about mistakes. The 
worst mistake the federalists can make in preparing for the next and 
final contest with the separatists would be to use yesterday's 
tactics. Yesterday's tactics are for yesterday's federalists, not the 
new federalists of the 21st century.
<P>
	That means it would be a profound mistake to go back to the 
contents and tactics of the Meech Lake or Charlottetown accords, 
with their talk of special status, distinct societies or vetoes for 
Quebec.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister assure the House and all Canadians that 
he will not be marching backwards into the future, that he will not 
go back to Meech or Charlottetown for solutions to the current 
struggle between federalists and separatists?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, here again we see the leader of the third party in bed with 
the separatist party in the House of Commons.
<P>
	When we were fighting in Quebec the leader of the third party 
was in the House shooting at us, contrary to what the leader of the 
Conservative Party was doing; in the campaign, working for 
Canada. The leader of the Reform Party was always on his feet 
trying to ensure he might some day become the prime minister of 
the rest of the country, because he will never be the prime minister 
of the whole country, Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is obvious the Prime Minister will not listen to me. 
Maybe he will listen to someone from Quebec.
<P>
	One of the most telling letters I received during the referendum 
was from a soft sovereignist who said he would probably vote yes, 
but who added this explanation: ``The matter at hand is not really 
the separation of Canada and Quebec, but the separation of Quebec 
from the present form of federal government. You as a Reformer 
said you want decentralization, which necessitates serious change 
to the present form of federal government, but negotiations in good 
faith with the Liberals will not accomplish this''.
<P>
	This Quebecer does not want to separate from Canada but from 
an overcentralized federal government. He is one of the 80 per cent 
of Quebecers who want a realignment of federal-provincial powers.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Order.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I know the hon. member for Calgary Southwest 
will now put his question.
<P>
<B>(1435 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manning:</B> What is the Prime Minister's response to this 
demand for change from a Quebecer who really wants to stay in 
Canada?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the person is a soft sovereignist. Perhaps the leader of the 
third party, who hopes some day to be the leader of the opposition, 
although he might not succeed if he does not become better than he 
is, should stop quoting from separatists or quasi-separatists and 
start to really work with us to make sure Canada is a good country 
with values and a social system that binds all Canadians together.

	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is directed to the Prime Minister. After 
hinting that he would not respect the democratic results of the 
referendum, the Prime Minister said he wanted to prevent another 
referendum from being held in Quebec and then went on to criticize 
the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation which, according to him, 
did not show sufficient support for national unity during the last 
referendum campaign.
<P>
	Does this mean that the Prime Minister not only wants to prevent 
Quebecers from voting again on their future at the appropriate time 
but also wants to control the news coverage they get through the 
CBC?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, certainly not. I made certain comments. I said that some 
people complained about the way the CBC behaved during the 
referendum campaign. Someone also said that the CBC was 
jeopardizing its reputation and should be lumped in with all the 
other lackeys and puppets of the government.

	Even the Leader of the Opposition criticized the CBC during

people who were not satisfied with the CBC's performance, 
including the Leader of the Opposition.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to set the record straight. The Leader of the 
Opposition criticized the CBC when the network refused to 
broadcast the Yes committee's message, not because of its news 
coverage.
<P>
	Is the Prime Minister saying that he intends to put back into the 
Broadcasting Act the obligation to promote national unity and thus 
force the CBC to be its master's voice instead of an independent 
news broadcaster?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I think that what we want is objective news coverage. As I 
said at the time, I am hardly in a position to complain, because 
since I want a good night's sleep, I do not listen to the CBC before I 
go to bed. That is why I am healthy. I get a good night's sleep.
<P>
	However, we want our news coverage to be objective. But the 
funny thing is that when the opposition criticizes the CBC, there is 
no problem. But when the government party does, it is not fair. 
What I had to say, I said publicly. I have never spoken to the 
president of the CBC since he was appointed. I let him get on with 
his job. However, I will not refrain from expressing my opinion as 
party leader, like the Leader of the Opposition did during the 
referendum campaign.

	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the auditor

returns has serious flaws and is therefore open to substantial abuse, 
while the Minister of National Revenue says the system just needs 
a little fine tuning.
<P>
	Canadians will quickly lose confidence in a system that 
penalizes honest taxpayers by letting others off the hook while this 
minister wants to squeeze every taxpayer until it hurts.

<P>
	What commitment do we have today that the minister will fix the 
problems raised by the auditor general?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, we are happy at Revenue Canada to have the 
comments of the auditor general. However, the hon. member has 
exaggerated and used figures which are simply not accurate.
<P>
	The auditor general said: ``Although our analysis is insufficient 
to draw firm conclusions about cause and effect-more years of 
data are required to determine if this movement is temporary or 
permanent in nature''.
<P>
	Electronic filing provides substantial improvements in service to 
Canadians, to the taxpayer and to the government in terms of 
reduced costs. It improves the opportunity for effective 
surveillance to prevent fraud by people who might cheat the 
system. It also dramatically increases the speed with which 
cheques get out to the public.
<P>
	It is a new system introduced in 1990. It is a system on which 
there are not full information years on which we can base 
substantial comparisons, but every indication is that the system is 
working absolutely as well as the previous paper system, except for 
the advantages I outlined.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the minister 
is asleep, like most of the others.
<P>
	The government squeezed another $7.3 billion out of Canadians 
in the last fiscal year. It is obvious the government intends to 
balance the budget through increase taxation, not cuts in spending. 
Last year it collected $7.3 billion more in taxes while it reduced the 
deficit by only $4.5 billion.
<P>
	Will the minister admit he does not have a tax cutting policy that 
works or a taxation collection policy that works, and that he does 
not know how he will fix either of them?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member has correctly pointed out the tax 
system is generating more revenue. The basic reason is the 
confidence the business community has in the Minister of Finance. 
However, if I may modestly add, another reason is that Revenue 
Canada is working more effectively than ever before.
<P>
	New developments in technology and the information highway 
are particularly difficult for Reformers to understand. We must still 
tell them the old system of inefficiency, time consuming as it was, 
which cost the taxpayer money and which led to more abuse and 
fraud, is not the way we will be going in the future.
<P>
	We have over the last two years picked up $7 billion through our 
enforcement programs. We are doing this in a manner which 
recognizes that the client, the ordinary Canadian taxpayer, is in

Development. In his report released yesterday, the auditor general 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16667"> 16667 </A></B>
<P>
made it clear that manpower training  programs are poorly adapted 
to the requirements of Canadian businesses.
<P>
	Would the minister agree that the auditor general's harsh 
assessment of federal manpower training programs is further 
evidence it is high time the federal government withdrew 
altogether from manpower training and left this up to the 
provinces?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, to set the record straight, I 
listen to CBC radio.
<P>
<B>(1445 )</B>
<P>
	The auditor general said something we have been saying for the 
past two years: that we have to substantially revamp training 
programs to ensure that the private sector takes far more 
responsibility, invests far more of its dollars to help young people 
in particular get jobs, and that people in the existing workforce 
upgrade and get the kinds of skills required within the area.
<P>
	Since 1993, as we have begun to make the changes the auditor 
general observed, we have been able to leverage over 77 million 
additional dollars from the private sector for training young people. 
It shows that while the auditor general was observing what should 
be done we were already doing it.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, will the 
minister stop being so stubborn and acknowledge that, if manpower 
training programs are to reflect the requirements of the private 
sector in terms of training and jobs, the minister should respond to 
a consensus in Quebec among government, business, unions and 
interest groups, all of whom want to see responsibility for 
manpower training patriated to Quebec?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is unfortunate the hon. 
member did not do her homework before she asked the question. If 
she had, she would know that in July 1994 we signed an agreement 
with the province of Quebec, with the SQDM, in which we have a 
basic agreement and partnership on the supply of training. The 
SQDM advises on labour market demands, approves course 
selection, identifies qualified training institutions, determines 
course curriculum, confirms that training responds to skills. We are 
working in partnership with the SQDM to make sure we get full 
dollar.
<P>
	I agree that we have to go beyond that. That is why in the reform 
we are developing we intend to give far more space to the 
provinces in the training area so they can make those choices and at 
the same ensure that clients  under the unemployment insurance 
program are properly and effectively served and getting back to

	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, five years 
ago the Treasury Board approved a policy to make all government 
contributions to businesses repayable. In the finance minister's 
1995 budget speech he confirmed that policy. Yet at FEDNOR only 
92 per cent, at ACOA 83 per cent, and in his own FORD-Q only 76 
per cent of the loans are being made repayable.
<P>
	Why is the finance minister not enforcing his own guidelines 
within cabinet?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in all regional 
agencies a series of loans were outstanding that are in the process 
of running. The policy applied to new loans. There was to be a 
phase in process; one was not to impose this immediately so that 
business would be able to adjust.
<P>
	When one looks at those loans within the regional agencies, it is 
the commercial loans that are repayable. As well, the regional 
agencies have activities in non profit making areas, structural areas 
that may well help the economy or a particular region. Those are 
not repayable.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, despite 
the minister's fine words there is no real accounting in regional 
development. I point to his department. Over a quarter of the loans 
approved by his department did not even need government 
assistance in the first place, according to the auditor general's 
report. Those approvals amounted to $65 million for FORD-Q.
<P>
	Will the minister commit today to stop this hemorrhaging of 
Canadians' hard earned tax dollars? In other words will he do his 
job?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the vast majority of 
the criticisms levelled by the auditor general as far as the regional 
agencies were concerned were levelled in terms of activities that 
took place prior to the election of the government.
<P>

<P>
	In addition to the loss of 710 jobs in Montreal, CP Rail's 
decision to move its headquarters will further diminish the city's 
position within Canada's transportation sector. The decision to 
move CP headquarters is a direct result of federal railway policies 
which, thanks to enormous subsidies and protected branch lines, 
have caused a shift in railway activity to Western Canada.
<P>

jobs lost in Montreal as a direct result of federal policies that 
provide massive subsidies for the railways in Western Canada?

	If he wants to ensure that we have good transportation he will

<P>
	Recently, the Information Highway Advisory Council tabled its

since it calls for an information highway serving a single so-called

which Quebec is already fully exercising its responsibilities, health

	The petitioners would like to draw to the attention of the House 
that managing the family home and caring for preschool children is

	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House condemn the government for failing to make progress in 
reforming the criminal justice system in terms of introducing measures to 
ensure that the rights of the victim are protected and that these rights supersede 
the rights of the criminal and in terms of changing the name of the week of 
November 19 to 26 from Prisoners' Week to Victims' Rights Week.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Madam Speaker, I will be dividing my time. It is an 
honour and a privilege to lead off the debate on this Reform 
motion.
<P>
	On March 17, 1994 I had the pleasure of participating in our first 
debate in the House on victims' rights. The example I will use 
comes from my home province of Saskatchewan. It illustrates the 
government's preoccupation with criminals' rights rather than 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16672"> 16672 </A></B>
<P>
victims' rights. It is the case of Gregory Fischer, a convicted cop  
killer. He was sentenced to life imprisonment with no chance of 
parole for 25 years.
<P>
	Fischer had just applied for early release under the Liberal 
government's faint hope clause, section 745 of the Criminal Code. 
Mrs. Marie King-Forest, the wife of RCMP Constable Brian King, 
had to fight hard for her right to be heard at these hearings. She had 
the support and sympathy of many friends, the police, the public, 
the media and many MPs in the House.
<P>
	How did the Liberal government respond to this one victim's 
lonely struggle? What was her family's reward for reliving the 
nightmare of her husband's mindless murder by two cold-blooded 
killers? The Liberal government rewarded Mrs. King-Forest with a 
small change to Bill C-41, giving victims the right to introduce a 
victim impact statement in the judicial hearings that decide to 
release these killers early. The court rewarded Mrs. King-Forest's 
efforts by cutting two years off Gregory Fischer's sentence. That is 
Liberal justice.
<P>
	The Liberals are poised once again to drag Mrs. King-Forest 
through the same ordeal because now Darrel Crook, her husband's 
other murderer, is applying for early release under the same Liberal 
loophole in the Criminal Code.
<P>
<B>(1515 )</B>
<P>
	If the Liberals had accepted our amendment during the debate on 
Bill C-41, section 745 of the Criminal Code would have been 
repealed and Mr. Crooks and the hundreds of other killers who 
were serving life sentences with no chance of parole would have 
served their full sentences. If our amendment had been accepted, 
Mrs. King-Forest and her family would not have to endure another 
senseless judicial hearing.
<P>
	Under a Reform government, when the court says no chance of 
parole for 25 years, that is exactly what the heartless criminal will 
get. If do-gooders are concerned about killers' rehabilitation, let 
them play their games after the full sentence has been served. 
Certainty in sentencing, protecting society and giving the relatives 
of the victims some peace and closure are more important than 
letting a killer back on the streets a couple of years early.
<P>
	Everything our party has done with respect to the criminal 
justice issue has been governed by our fundamental principle that 
the rights of the victim should supersede the rights of the criminal.
<P>
	During the debate on Bill C-37, the Young Offenders Act, we 
proposed changes that would better protect victims rights. We 
proposed changes that would place more emphasis on victim 
compensation as part of the sentencing. We proposed that the 
parents of young offenders be held legally responsible for the 
crimes committed by their children, if it could be demonstrated that 
the parents failed to exercise reasonable parental control. Under 
these proposals parents would be required  to compensate victims 
for property crimes committed by their children.
<P>
	Unfortunately, the Liberals ignored our advice and 
recommendations. They voted against our amendments and against 
giving victims more rights than the criminals.
<P>
	During the debate on Bill C-41, the sentencing bill, Reformers 
proposed changes that would ensure victims were protected. We 
proposed that victims be given the right to express their views on 
whether the use of alternate measures were appropriate for the 
crime against them. We proposed measures which would ensure 
sentencing would be proportionate to the gravity of the criminal 
conduct and to the actual harm done to the victim. We proposed 
changes which would give victims the right to give verbal victim 
impact statements.
<P>
	As stated previously, we proposed the repeal of section 745 of 
the Criminal Code, which would ensure killers stayed in jail for the 
full term of their sentence. For Reformers, life means life. 
Unfortunately, the Liberals ignored our advice and 
recommendations and voted against our amendments and against 
giving victims more rights than criminals.
<P>
	During debate on Bill C-45, the Corrections and Conditional 
Release Act, Reformers proposed changes that would give victims 
more rights. We proposed amendments that would ensure victims 
received direct financial compensation from the offender's income 
while incarcerated. We also proposed that violent criminals be 
denied parole and statutory release thereby protecting the rights of 
victims to life, liberty and security of the person.
<P>
	We proposed that criminals who commit criminal acts while on 
parole or conditional release be sent back to serve the full sentence 
of their crime and then the full term of the sentence of their second 
offence. Two plus two is four consecutive sentences, not 
concurrent.
<P>
	To protect victims of child sexual abuse, we proposed a child sex 
offender registry and that this registry be made available to police 
investigating a child sexual offence. We proposed that all persons 
convicted of sexual assault would serve the full term of their 
sentence. Once again, the Liberal Party ignored our advice and 
recommendations and voted against our amendments and against 
giving victims more rights than the criminals.
<P>
	Reformers have gone to great lengths to introduce and enhance 
victims rights every chance we get, but the Liberals simply ignore 
them. They do not seem to get it. They seem locked in the Liberal 
thinking of the 1970s. Liberal ideas are socialist concepts that have 
failed and failed miserably. Reformers give their ideas freely 
because they have come from the common sense of the common 
people.
<P>
	The Liberals across the aisle seem to ignore these ideas at their 
own peril. In the next election common sense will prevail and 
common people will only re-elect  members who best represent 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16673"> 16673 </A></B>
<P>
their views in the House. That means voting the constituents' 
wishes and not the Liberal cabinet's wishes.
<P>
<B>(1520)</B>
<P>
	When criminals are arrested, the police read them their rights. 
Victims are never informed that they have rights. They are treated 
just like another piece of evidence. If a criminal has rights then so 
must the victim and if the victims have rights, should they not also 
be entitled to know what those rights are?
<P>
	I have been working on a list of victims rights since the day I 
arrived on the Hill. Here is what I have come up with so far. I do not 
know if I will be able to finish the list, but this will give an idea.
<P>
	Victims have the right to be informed of their rights, to be 
informed of services available, to be informed about the 
investigation, to be informed about the court proceedings. They 
have the right to receive notice of any hearing and have a right to 
receive notice of the release of an offender.
<P>
	Victims have the right to legal counsel, the right to be heard by 
the crown before the trial, a right to be heard in the judicial process, 
a right to have their case prosecuted and a right to prompt 
disposition of prosecution. They have the right to restitution from 
the offender, and a right to prompt return of private property. 
Victims have a right to privacy, a right to protection from 
intimidation and a right to defend themselves, family and property. 
Victims have a right to exercise all of these rights.
<P>
	Now that we have an idea what victims rights are, it is time for 
the federal government to start codifying these rights and working 
with the provinces to build legislative guarantees and 
administrative mechanisms to ensure that victims can properly 
exercise these rights.
<P>
	There is a cruel irony that we are having this debate this week, 
for November 19 to 26, 1995 has been proclaimed by the Liberal 
government to be prisoners week. The Liberal prisoners week 
clearly demonstrates where this government's priorities are.
<P>
	Do members know that there is no week of the year, not even a 
single day of the year dedicated to the victims of crime? We have a 
week dedicated to prisoners, but not one for their victims.
<P>
	The federal government has proclaimed a week for brotherhood 
and sisterhood, a week for waste reduction, a week for international 
archives, a week for dental hygiene, a week for disarmament and 
on on the list goes. There is a week for earth and a week for 
professional secretaries but there is no week for victims of crime. It 
is time to correct this colossal oversight. I urge members of the 
House to support our motion to declare this week victims rights 
week.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
it is a pleasure to speak to this issue today.
<P>
	We are making every attempt to reflect exactly what happens in 
the Liberal government's agenda concerning victims. We want to 
reflect that the government's failure is in effect a failure to address 
the rights of victims.
<P>
	I am going to demonstrate that with a small story. When I raise 
these stories in the House of Commons, I am accused at times, in 
fact a number of times by the minister of immigration as picking 
out and isolating certain cases which are not really reflective of 
what happens in Canadian society. That is a lot of hogwash. The 
fact is that the kind of case I am going to talk about this afternoon 
happens virtually every day in Canada.
<P>
	I was in a hospital about 11 weeks ago and I met a lady who was 
quite despondent. She was crying because her 19-year old son 
Allen had been hit by a car at an intersection. He is in Royal 
Columbian Hospital. He had broken legs, a broken arm and his 
pelvis was broken in seven places, I believe. His head was basically 
crushed. He has a 20 to 25 per cent chance of living. Allen's mother 
Debbie does not believe that the system looks after her as a victim. 
Her husband Allen senior, feels the same way. I asked her to 
explain what happened.
<P>
	A young offender stole a four by four truck. He drove it through 
the streets of Surrey, British Columbia, and toppled the four by four 
truck over Allen's Fiesta.
<P>
<B>(1525 )</B>
<P>
	Right away, the young offender was read his rights and I will 
read those in a moment. He was whisked away. The other young 
fellow who was with the young offender was let off. He was only an 
accomplice sitting in the same vehicle they stole.
<P>
	Mr. and Mrs. Wayne asked the crown prosecutor to make sure 
the guy who was charged with eight counts was sent to adult court, 
just like the Liberals said would happen. They also asked to be 
informed of any plea bargaining that took place. Guess what? Plea 
bargaining took place and they did not know it. I found out about it.
<P>
	Of the eight charges, five were dropped in the plea. Three of the 
minors were presented and brought forward. Why the minors? That 
is obvious. Why was it so fast? It took about five or six weeks to 
run this young offender through from the time of the accident to 
sentencing. Five weeks is almost unheard of. The reason in all 
likelihood is that the young offender would have been charged with 
manslaughter had young Allen Wayne died. That is why they 
rushed him through, which is another protection for the victim. 
Now what happens?
<P>
	Let us go to the sentencing. What does the judge give him? This 
is where victims and parents do not understand what is wrong with 
this Liberal government. This guy gets 15 months open custody, go 
home. He gets three years prohibition from driving. However he is 
already on prohibition from driving and gets charged with that 
count. Prohibition from driving means nothing to this fellow. What 
does he get for prohibition from  driving? He gets one day 
concurrent open custody. One day. What is being told to young 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16674"> 16674 </A></B>
<P>
offenders here? He just about killed somebody-he may die 
yet-and for driving while prohibited he gets one day.
<P>
	This happened. It was not dreamed up. The Waynes have a right 
to feel the way they do because the laws, the rhetoric and all this 
hogwash which is brought into the House by the Liberal 
government is nothing more than that. It is rhetoric and hogwash. 
Most victims, if not all of them, know that. The government will 
not go very far pushing hogwash.
<P>
	Let us hear what is read. I asked the police for this recently after 
watching the television show ``To Serve and Protect'' one Sunday 
night. During the show a lady was sitting on the street crying and 
bleeding. The police had the guy who obviously did it and were 
reading him his rights. She was sitting there unattended.
<P>
	The police said he was being arrested for whatever he was 
charged for. ``It is my duty to inform you that you have the right to 
retain and instruct counsel without delay. You may call any lawyer 
you want. A legal aid duty lawyer is available to provide legal 
advice to you without charge and can explain the legal aid plan to 
you. If you wish to contact a legal aid duty lawyer, I can provide 
you with a telephone number''. The victim was sitting on the street 
bleeding and crying, wondering what rights she had. Very little.
<P>
	We will present some victims rights shortly. We will see if the 
government has the courage, particularly the backbenchers, to 
adopt some of those rights. My guess is they will not. They will 
find some small thing in the victims bill of rights to oppose it 
thereby throwing it out.
<P>
	How much time do I have, Madam Speaker?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Three and a half minutes.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Too many.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Good. Too many, he says. 
That is what is wrong over here. We have too much time to talk 
about victims rights. That is what is wrong with the Liberal Party.
<P>
<B>(1530 )</B>
<P>
	Victims should have the right to be informed of their rights at 
every stage of the process, including those rights involving 
compensation from the offender. They must also be made aware of 
any victim services available. Is that too much to ask?
<P>
	Victims should have the right to be informed of the offender's 
status throughout the process, including but not restricted to 
location of the accused from time of arrest, notification of any 
arrests, upcoming court dates, sentencing dates, plans to release the 
offender from custody, including notification of what community 
the parolee is being released into, parole dates and on and on it 
goes.
<P>
	All information is to be made available on request. What is 
wrong with that? What is wrong with people having those rights 
today? Bonnie Lucas in my riding would say: ``That is what I 
wanted when my estranged husband came home and burned our 
house down with our kids in it. We just escaped from it''.
<P>
	All she asked the parole board was: ``Would you mind telling me 
when he is getting out, because he is going to come after me 
again?'' That is all she asked. What happens? We find out he is out 
living very close by, and on and on it goes.
<P>
	Victims should have the right to give oral and written victim 
impact statements before sentencing, at any parole hearings and at 
judicial reviews. What is wrong with that?
<P>
	Victims should have the right to be informed of details of the 
crown's intention to offer a plea bargain before it is presented to the 
defence. Allen and Debbie Wayne are appalled, as everybody 
should be, that this young offender had five of the eight charges 
against him dropped conveniently. He was out on the street the next 
day while the police were still filling out their forms.
<P>
	Victims should have the right to know why charges were not laid 
if that is the decision of the crown or the police. So often we hear 
they are going to lay some charges but no charges come. They 
wonder why. It happened in my office. My secretary had her house 
ripped off three times in a row. She did not know why charges were 
not forthcoming. To this day she still does not know, except we 
hear these guys are into bigger things: ``You are kind of a zero and 
we are after the bigger stuff''. She does not know why charges were 
not laid yet they know who did it.
<P>
	Victims have the right to protection from anyone who 
intimidates, harasses or interferes with the rights of the victim. I 
can speak to that one with Joan Cave who was sexually assaulted. 
The guy was sent into Vancouver remand, writing her threatening 
letters from remand while we paid the postage. Surely there is 
something better we could do.
<P>
	The government has been an absolute disaster on criminal justice 
programs.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
listened to the member's discussion. Simple solutions for complex 
problems seems to be the agenda of the Reform Party. If we have 
problems with taxes, flat taxes will solve the problem. If we have 
problems with debt, just cut government in half and they will al go 
away. If we have a problem with the criminal justice system, 
rename a day, rename a week; that will make it better.
<P>
	The reality is the problems with crime in this country are deep 
seated. I do not hear the Reform Party talking about how to solve 
the real issues of crime in our society.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16675"> 16675 </A></B>
<P>
	I have some statistics on violent crime in Canada which include 
all categories: crimes of violence, property crimes, Criminal Code 
offences, drugs. From 1991 to 1992 there was a 6.3 per cent 
reduction in total crime. In 1993 there was a further 5 per cent 
reduction in crime. In 1994 there was an almost 5 per cent 
reduction in crime. Remarkably these are periods of a Liberal 
government. During the entire period of time this government has 
been in office crime has been and is being reduced in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1535)</B>
<P>
	This will not make headlines in local newspapers but the reality 
is crime is being reduced. I know the hon. member on the other side 
does not want to hear that, but these statistics are factual.
<P>
	I will address what I consider some aspects with the problems of 
crime in our society. We have gone through a whole generation of 
young people whose only access has been the electronic media. 
Often the only babysitter of choice for a whole generation has been 
the electronic media, the television. We have glorified crime on 
television and a lot of these young people today cannot distinguish 
between pretend crime and real crime.
<P>
	How do we want to address these real factors? The government, 
through the CRTC, is now trying to find ways to use the V chip to 
take violent acts in programming out of the home environment and 
allow parents to have the ability to filter out violent programming 
within their houses.
<P>
	The hon. member is saying the Liberal government is doing 
nothing. I think this is a very profound thing which affects over a 
long period the attitudes and conduct among young offenders. Just 
by doing away with the Young Offenders Act we will not do away 
with crimes by young offenders.
<P>
	It is time the Reform Party started talking about real problems 
and real solutions instead of just saying hang them and they will go 
away.
<P>
	I wish the member would address some of those real problems.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Madam Speaker, I read seven 
solutions and within each one there were other issues. It has taken 
us months and months of research and some guy stands up and says 
we have simple solutions and he does not hear how Reform will 
solve problems. The members on the government side are not even 
listening to what is being said. That is because the front bench tells 
says: ``We will do what we want and you guys will be told how it 
goes''.
<P>
	What makes me really sick about all this is to have somebody 
from that side roll out the demographics, roll out the statistical 
data, to tell us it is a 6.3 per cent reduction crime and then a 4.9 per 
cent. One of the national parole people phoned me one day.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, the hon. member had five minutes. Surely I can 
get-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sure the hon. member 
realizes that the debate time is 10 minutes and questions and 
comments are 5 minutes. You have 30 seconds left.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Madam Speaker, I would ask 
the House, if this member gets five minutes-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> The hon. member for 
Durham had four minutes. You have been speaking for 30 seconds 
and you have 30 seconds left.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Thanks a lot. When I get calls 
from the parole board saying that we have an 87 per cent success 
rate, I say that is nice, it has a 13 per cent failure rate. They had 
better think about this over there. It is the 13 per cent who are 
coming through the doors. It is the 13 per cent plus their families 
who are worried-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Resuming debate, the hon. 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Russell MacLellan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for 
Brandon-Souris.
<P>
<B>(1540 )</B>
<P>
	The hon. member for Fraser Valley West has made some 
interesting allegations which I do not think are quite fair. The 
government has done a great deal in the areas the member 
mentioned with respect to victim impact statements. Recent 
amendments to the Young Offenders Act require victim impact 
statements. Under section 745, statements from victims are 
permitted and encouraged. The judges are to request statements 
from not only the victims or the families of the victims in this case 
but friends and neighbours of the victims.
<P>
	The parole board now has to seek out statements from victims. It 
must give victims an indication of when someone is to be released 
who may endanger that person. That was not the case before but it 
has recently been the case. To my knowledge it is being 
implemented by the parole board.
<P>
	There are improvements being made, in particular in the areas 
the member mentioned.
<P>
	The assertion that there has been no attention paid to the role of 
victims is not quite fair. I wonder whether this assertion is not 
based on confusion about the purposes and principles being applied 
in criminal justice interventions.
<P>
	Surprisingly, until recently no such statement existed in the 
Criminal Code. This situation was at odds with the degree of 
attention that we pay in Parliament to matters relating to tax, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16676"> 16676 </A></B>
<P>
international trade and unemployment  insurance. It is at the stage 
of sentencing that the criminal justice system most consciously and 
visibly expresses its denunciation of behaviour; its attempts to 
deter or incapacitate people from further wrongdoing or when it 
orders reparation or redress for harm done or sets in place measures 
to bring about the rehabilitation of offenders.
<P>
	Parliament's role to date in this process has been too often 
limited to setting maximum penalties for specific offences rather 
than dealing with the policy objectives of the sentencing process. It 
was clearly time Parliament put its collective mind to describing 
the kind of criminal justice system it wants to forge for Canadians.
<P>
	This occasion was given to us in the sentencing bill, Bill C-41, 
introduced by the Minister of Justice. Of all the representation we 
receive, the most heart rending, as all members would agree, is the 
representation from victims. Victims of crimes often feel their 
immediate emotional, financial and physical needs are not being 
addressed.
<P>
	The criminal justice system may appear at times to be overly 
concerned about the court process and the punishment of the 
offender and insufficiently concerned about victim needs.
<P>
	Parliament has had the opportunity in this session to debate an 
important bill touching several aspects of the way victims are 
treated within the criminal justice system. With the sentencing bill, 
Bill C-41, Parliament had for the first time an opportunity to 
address the purpose and principles of criminal sentencing. The bill 
brought together the purpose and principles of sentencing, 
procedure and evidence and the various sanctions the courts may 
impose in a form that represents the collective view of Parliament 
and which touches on many issues of vital importance to victims.
<P>
	Let me give some examples. Bill C-41, recently passed in the 
House, specifies that if an offence is motivated by bias, prejudice 
or hate it will be considered an aggravating factor in sentencing. 
The statement specifies that if an offence was motivated by bias, 
prejudice or hate based on race, national or ethnic origin, language, 
colour, religion, sex, age, mental or physical disability, sexual 
orientation or other similar factor, the court shall consider that the 
motivation be an aggravating factor.
<P>
<B>(1545 )</B>
<P>
	Numerous recommendations have been made respecting breach 
of trust for offences involving violence against women and other 
vulnerable persons, including children.
<P>
	A 1993 survey by Statistics Canada demonstrated that almost 
one-half of women reported experiencing violence during their 
lifetime by men known to them. In too many cases positions of 
trust were exploited, for example by parents against their children 
or by a physician against his or her patient.
<P>
	In 1984 the Badgley committee called for the protection of 
children from persons they already know and may trust. Bill C-41 
states that where there is evidence that the offender in committing 
an offence abused a position of trust or authority in relation to the 
victim, it shall also be considered an aggravating factor in 
sentencing.
<P>
	All these changes respond to concerns raised by community 
groups, victims, and others about hate motivated violence and the 
plight of victims.
<P>
	Bill C-41 took other important steps. The statement of purpose 
and principles specifically indicates that objectives for sentencing 
include the provision of reparations for harm done to victims or to 
the community and the promotion of a sense of responsibility in 
offenders in acknowledgement of the harm to victims and to the 
community. It goes further. Specific provision is made to ensure 
that any information provided by victims is considered during 
hearings held under section 745 of the Criminal Code.
<P>
	A new set of measures respecting restitution, developed 
co-operatively with the federal government and our provincial 
colleagues, is set out in the bill. A priority for restitution is set out 
in the bill. If a court finds it appropriate to award both a fine and 
restitution, the priority shall go to restitution.
<P>
	The House added a provision as well respecting restitution, 
stating that in the case of bodily harm or threat of bodily harm to an 
offender's spouse or child, the court may order restitution for 
expenses incurred by that person as a result of moving out of the 
offender's household, as well as for temporary housing, food, child 
care and transportation. Provision is made to ensure that restitution 
orders can be enforced by the civil courts.
<P>
	The Criminal Code will specifically state that any restitution 
ordered by a criminal court will not limit the victim's right to sue 
for damages in the civil court.
<P>
	The House of Commons participated in an important debate 
involving the status of victims in the criminal justice system. 
Significant changes were brought to our criminal law, aimed at 
improving the situations of victims in the system. The government 
and the House are concerned about victims and have demonstrated 
that concrete action at the legislative level is a priority of the 
government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
have difficulty trying to relate to the government that the 
legislation it plays with is not a full implementation of what is 
necessary.
<P>
	For example, when the Young Offenders Act was changed in the 
House we said all along that the government was not changing the 
law to suit the real world out there. We wanted to change a number 
of issues. That did not happen. Many of the victims rights groups 
out there said time and time again that the  government was too soft 
on its legislation. Yet government members stand in the House, as 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16677"> 16677 </A></B>
<P>
my colleague did just now, and say they are working on it and it is 
coming along.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	This has been a long time in happening. I want to give some idea 
of the frustration that abounds. For instance, when we debated Bill 
C-45 we asked for the some issues to be addressed. My colleague 
from Wild Rose and I stood and put a number of motions to the 
House that day. One of the motions would have provided for 
compensation to victims of crime and for medical treatment for 
victims of sexual assault to be paid by the perpetrator. That was 
voted against and defeated by the government. We also asked that 
there be no provision for statutory release for violent offenders, and 
that was defeated.
<P>
	The government might ask what violent offenders have to do 
with victims rights. This has a lot to do with victims rights. 
Dwayne Johnston is a good case in my town. In The Pas, Manitoba, 
he was convicted for stabbing a 17-year old lady 56 times. He was 
sentenced to life, with eligibility for parole in 10 years. It is six and 
a half years later, and guess whose community he is in. Mine.
<P>
	We are asking the government to carefully consider a lot of 
tough legislation that has to be put in place. It should not stand in 
the House of Commons and say that it is working on it or or that it 
has come 20 per cent of the way, that life is long and that it has a 
long time to do this. That is not what we are asking about. The 
government has to take the bull by the horns and deal with it.
<P>
	We asked to ensure that criminals serve their full sentence if 
conditional release is revoked or suspended. If they are doing time, 
get out on parole and commit another offence, it is revoked; they do 
their full time. That was turned down by the government.
<P>
	I do not happen to think those are unreasonable requests. Yet 
time and time again in the House we hear that there cannot be an 
agreement between Liberals and Reformers because we are on the 
tough side of it and the government is on the liberal side of it.
<P>
	The people who really count when we are asking for victims 
rights are the victims and the non-victims out in our Canadian 
society, the potential victims. Those are the people we must look 
after today.
<P>
	Finally, I have had several discussions with private companies 
that build and operate prisons, and it is no coincidence that they are 
moving into Canada. They are doing that successfully. The reason 
is the confidence has gone in the government.
<P>
	Why can the government not take another step forward, get 
tougher on these laws and not stop with this point of view in the 
legislation?
<P>
	<B>Mr. MacLellan:</B> Madam Speaker, the hon. member says he does 
not want to hear about things the government is working on.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> I did not say that.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> May I ask that responses 
be addressed through the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. MacLellan:</B> We have to be able to say what we are working 
on. It is important that as part of the answer it be perceived that the 
government is working toward further solutions. A lot of the areas 
relate to provincial jurisdiction such as maintenance orders and 
matters of family law.
<P>
	Also, we have done things with regard to the Young Offenders 
Act. We have said that with respect to young offenders we are 
making more information available. We have said there will be 
access to victims and they can present statements. We have said 
that we will allow people to use information from criminal cases in 
civil cases. We have done an awful lot, and the member should 
recognize that.
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Glen McKinnon (Brandon-Souris, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I have found the exchange very interesting this afternoon. 
Like other members, I have been working with young people all my 
working life. I sense that this is very pertinent in terms of where we 
are now, where we are going and where we have been.
<P>
	I had the privilege of attending the conference in Cairo in May of 
this year on the treatment of prisoners. This brought together 143 
countries from around the globe, representing all cultures and all 
components of society. The feeling I came away with, and which 
was articulated directly by some European countries, was that they 
expect to have no prisons in due course. They are working toward 
that objective in terms of treatment of offenders. They are putting 
in place other strategies. They sense and we agree that there will be 
resulting benefits. I am sure the articulation by the justice 
department and my colleague will also do that.
<P>
	We have some pilot projects taking place in the country right 
now. In Manitoba there is a victim services program, which 
commenced about five years ago. It offers assistance, 
psychological and in some cases financial. More important, it 
offers counselling services for people who have been victimized by 
various parties in society.
<P>
	I do not subscribe to the lock them up and throw away the key 
approach, as some members do, in pursuit of increasing public 
safety. This is more likely to increase public risk when prisoners 
finish their sentences and return to the community. Evidence from 
the United  States in those states that have instituted very simplistic 
and punitive based treatment such as California shows there was a 
rise in crime rate, not a decrease. I suggest to parties that subscribe 
to those views that maybe there should be a re-examination of the 
data as well.
<P>
	My colleague from Durham put forward statistics in terms of the 
drop in crime rate. I think the information he provided to the House 
is very accurate. I too have viewed those stats.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16678"> 16678 </A></B>
<P>
	The hon. member's concern for victims of crime is admirable, 
but I must say that I find the phrasing of the motion a bit unclear. 
He suggests that more needs to be done to protect the rights of the 
victim. He goes on to imply that one way to achieve this protection 
is to diminish the rights of the offender. There are several problems 
with this assertion.
<P>
	First, we should ask whether there is a necessary trade-off 
between competing rights. Is justice better served by somehow 
reducing the rights of an accused person? The motion does not 
specify where rights are objectionable. The emergence of the 
victims rights movement in Canada is one of the most important 
criminal justice trends we have seen in the last 20 years. Yet I doubt 
that any victims organizations in Canada would advocate 
eliminating the right of an accused to a fair trial, the right to due 
process, the protection of habeas corpus or the protection of an 
accused against self-incrimination. Do I need to remind the House 
that there are rights guaranteed to all Canadians under sections 7, 
10 and 11 of the charter of rights and freedoms?
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	I will not dwell on the matter of comparing the rights of the 
accused to the rights of the victim, but I do suggest that the motion 
misses the mark. I believe a more constructive approach, simply 
put, is to determine where and how the victim should be involved 
in the criminal justice process. The concept we should embrace is 
access to justice for the victim.
<P>
	At what point in the criminal justice process does the victim 
deserve to have input? Should the victim have input into the police 
investigation, to the trial of the accused, at the sentencing stage or 
later at the parole decision making stage and finally when the 
offender is released from custody?
<P>
	If we can provide the victim or the victim's family with the 
appropriate access to the criminal process in a timely fashion then 
maybe we can be a little less concerned about who has more rights.
<P>
	Let us examine the progress that was made over the last two 
decades both in terms of the general recognition of the needs of 
victims and specific measures.
<P>
	Much of the policy and the programs dealing with victims 
derived from a report by a federal task force on  justice for victims 
of crime in the early 1980s which offered 79 recommendations to 
both levels of government for improving social, criminal justice 
and health responses to victims of crime.
<P>
	In 1985 Canada co-sponsored the UN Declaration of Basic 
Principles of Justice for Victims of Crime. This document soon 
became the basis for a unique Canadian statement of principles. 
This statement was endorsed by the federal government and the 
provinces and territories in 1988. It has provided a reference point 
for provinces to develop their own policy and legislation on 
victim's rights and most jurisdictions now have victims oriented 
legislation. It is important to note the provincial perspective since 
the provinces' responsibility for the administration of justice 
means that all access to justice issues are under federal control.
<P>
	Progress continued during the 1980s and in 1988, Parliament 
passed Bill C-89 which amended the Criminal Code in several 
relevant areas. For example, the code now provides for protection 
of the identity of the victims and witnesses of sexual offences and 
extortion offences. The law also makes it easier for victims of 
property crimes to prove ownership and the value of stolen goods.
<P>
	Perhaps most important, the law now provides for victim impact 
statements. Section 735 permits provinces to determine the form 
for victim impact statements in their jurisdiction. In effect, this 
provision creates flexibility by allowing police based victim 
witness service programs to generate victim impact statements or 
alternatively crown or court based services as appropriate.
<P>
	In my view the victim impact statement is a crucial element in 
sentencing. It is appropriate that the Criminal Code not only 
provides for such formal statements but allows the court to 
consider any other evidence concerning any victim of the offence 
for the purpose of determining sentence.
<P>
	The motion argues that there has been little recent progress in 
advancing victims rights. I would conclude the opposite. Bill C-41 
passed recently by the House contains an amendment to the 
Criminal Code stating that the court shall consider the victim 
impact statement. This mandatory requirement consolidates the 
role of the victim impact statement in the sentencing process.
<P>
	While we are on the subject, please note that the victim in this 
context is broadly defined so that where the victim himself or 
herself is deceased, any relative of that person or anyone who in 
law or in fact is responsible for the custody of that person, or for his 
or her care or support of that person can present the victim impact 
statement and it will be considered. This is a significant 
improvement.
<P>
	There are other measures in Bill C-41 that will benefit victims 
and keep the focus and the impact of the crime on the victim. The 
new section 726.2 requires a court  when imposing a sentence to 
state the terms of the sentence and the reasons for it and to enter 
those terms and reasons in the sentence.
<P>
	I conclude at this time and welcome any questions.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16679"> 16679 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
does the hon. member receive any letters from victims across the 
country asking for improvements to the system? I would like to 
know how many he receives. We have about 500,000 now in 
storage ready to pass on to the Minister of Justice. They are all 
crying for changes to make things better.
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	Is the member aware of a 2.5 million signature petition calling 
for a pile of different changes? Is the member aware of the 
hundreds and hundreds of other petitions around calling for these 
changes?
<P>
	Last, but not least, is he aware that there are literally thousands 
of people who belong to victims' organizations? Do you know why 
they exist, Madam Speaker? Because this government is not doing 
anything. All those people would like to go home, go back to work, 
get back to a normal life, including the Carpenters of the Carpenter 
group, the Stu Garriochs of Calgary and the FACT group, the 
people from the CRY group in Vancouver, the CAVEAT people 
from all across the land. They are trying to lead normal lives and 
they cannot because they are victims. They are joining together 
trying to get some changes.
<P>
	They are trying to get changes to this warm, fuzzy little Criminal 
Code that was invented by the Liberals and they have not changed a 
thing.
<P>
	Is the hon. member aware of these things? If he is, for heaven's 
sake why do the Liberals not wake up and do something?
<P>
	<B>Mr. McKinnon:</B> Madam Speaker, I will respond in this fashion. 
The approach of the government has been to take under advisement 
the recommendations that are forthcoming from various groups.
<P>
	It is a very important process to get that information to the 
attention of the government. I would think, as my colleague 
mentioned in his speech, that it is the most heart rending 
experience as a member of the House to hear some of the concerns 
that have been raised by these groups.
<P>
	Let us not cherry pick and only look at the extreme 
circumstances. I am not alleging that the member is doing that but 
there are those who look only at the worst case scenario and use 
that as the reason for passing extreme kinds of legislation.
<P>
	We have to look at both sides of the issue and the government is 
doing that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, the 
member opposite in his presentation  referred to the idea of finding 
forms of punishment other than jail to act as a deterrent. He said he 
is not in favour of this throw away the key approach to the jail 
system. Reformers are not either.
<P>
	Reformers have presented ideas that would replace using 
imprisonment as a deterrent. We have presented many different 
concepts. Unfortunately I have not seen any of these ideas being 
picked up by the Liberal Party.
<P>
	Some of the ideas we have presented are boot camps, public 
service, which is being used, corporal punishment as a possibility, 
capital punishment which can act as a deterrent and certainly will 
prevent an individual from murdering again. These are just some of 
the things that we have proposed.
<P>
	We have proposed paying restitution to victims. We have 
proposed requiring the person who has committed the offence to 
pay restitution to the victim as a deterrent. None of these have been 
picked up by the government.
<P>
	I ask the member for one example of legislation presented by the 
government which has put in place a deterrent other than jail so that 
we do not have to have this throw away the key approach to dealing 
with prisoners.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sorry, but time has 
just about expired.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McKinnon:</B> I will be equally brief, Madam Speaker.
<P>
	It would be out of my league to give a long list of things. I will 
give one example. I am only going back to my high school 
principal days where we actually had to bring together the victim 
and the perpetrator, going eyeball to eyeball. It was necessary for 
that to take place in our community with youth victims.
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
wish to inform the Chair that I will be sharing my time with the 
member for Québec.
<P>
	The Reform Party's motion borders on the ridiculous. I am no 
longer surprised by their manipulation of public opinion. It is pure 
and simple demagoguery. We have reached a point where their 
endless interventions are beginning to get on our nerves.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Sit down.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Venne: </B>It is not clear exactly what they want. I am being 
asked to sit down, but I have no intention of doing so.
<P>
	Does the Reform Party want to change criminal law and the 
Criminal Code? Do they want to change the powers of the Minister 
of Justice, of judges or lawyers? Are they unhappy with judicial 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16680"> 16680 </A></B>
<P>
proceedings? Do they  want to do away with the presumption of 
innocence? What is their intent? I do not know.
<P>
	I would, however, like to draw attention to the Reformers' 
approach. While I do not disagree with parts of their motion, I am, 
however, flabbergasted at the back room scheming of the third 
party. The third party, I repeat. It is important to mention this, 
because the motion we were to debate is not the one before us 
today.
<P>
	The Reform Party, or should I say, the Opportunity Party, wanted 
to table a motion, not on victims' rights, but on their own status in 
the House. We are already well aware of the ambitions of the 
member for Calgary Southwest, who wants to become leader of the 
opposition even before the Leader of the Opposition has left.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Where is 
the relevance at this point? We are debating victims rights.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> That is a point of debate, 
sir.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Venne: </B>So, Madam Speaker, I continue by saying to you 
that we have reached the height of hypocrisy. At the last minute, 
and because of the fact that our leader has not resigned his position, 
the Reform Party stopped talking about political opportunism and 
started talking about victims of criminal acts. That takes some 
nerve. How can we trust a party that is concerned about victims 
only when its political manoeuvrings do not succeed?
<P>
	The Reformers often set themselves up as defenders of the weak 
and of the oppressed when it suits them to do so or, as in this case, 
when they have no choice. Their chivalry will always depend on 
how much air time they can get with it. Let us not forget the 
attitude of the Inquisition Party in the matter of gun control. When 
the time came to systematically obstruct proceedings both in the 
House and on the justice committee, the Lancelots of the west 
became the defenders of native rights.
<P>
	They contended that they could simply not support a bill that 
might trample native rights or contravene ancestral treaties. If they 
think we do not see through their little game, they better think 
again. We can see them coming a mile off. Today they are 
proposing a motion on victims' rights, when, not so long ago, they 
opposed a bill to protect victims.
<P>
	If they want to talk about victims, let them talk about those who 
succumb to wounds inflicted by firearms. How can they promote 
the rights of victims and ignore those who die from gun shot 
wounds? The statistics on deaths caused by firearms are staggering. 
In 1991, suicides made up 77 per cent of the 1,445 deaths 
attributable to firearms. Of the 732 homicides recorded in Canada 
in 1992, 246, or 34 per cent, were committed with a firearm.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	In the last ten years, the majority of homicides were committed 
with shotguns or rifles. Three times out of four, the woman 
murdered by her spouse was killed with a shotgun or a rifle.
<P>
	From 1990 to 1992, in Quebec, 1 293 deaths were attributed to 
gun shots, an average of 425 deaths annually. Still in Quebec, three 
deaths out a four that are caused by a firearm are suicides, for a 
total of about 300 suicides each year. These statistics cannot be 
ignored.
<P>
	If Reform members want to talk about victims, they should talk 
about the ones I just mentioned. If not, they should keep quiet 
instead of talking nonsense. These far right hypocrites are here 
only to make political gains. Every chance they get, they tear off 
their shirts in public in order to attract attention and stand in the 
limelight.
<P>
	They should try to emulate the Bloc Quebecois, this mosaic of 
ideas and talents that, for more than two years, has been fulfilling 
the double mandate that Quebec voters gave it, that is, to promote 
Quebec's sovereignty and to act as the official opposition of a 
government that never stops insulting the intelligence of Quebecers 
and their legitimate representatives.
<P>
	While Reform members are revelling in political fiction, we, the 
Bloc members, are getting ready to pursue the goals that we have 
set for ourselves five years ago, that is, to consolidate our political 
strength in Ottawa, around Quebec's interests alone, in order to 
dispel any ambiguity and to support Quebec's march towards 
sovereignty.
<P>
	The motion put forward by the Reform Party invites us to 
condemn the government for two reasons: first, because it 
supposedly failed to make progress in reforming the criminal 
justice system in general; and second, because its criminal 
legislation presumably favours the rights of the criminal over those 
of the victim.
<P>
	What I find shocking is that this motion is a perfect example of 
disinformation. This is a good way to exploit public resentment. 
The motion before us simply reflects the nightmares of an extreme 
right cut off from reality.
<P>
	This motion is a mishmash of reactionary preconceived notions. 
They might as well blame the government for winter arriving a 
little early this year.
<P>
	According to the third party, the whole criminal justice system 
should be reformed. Does the Reform Party at least know how? 
Does it have any alternatives to offer? We all have complaints 
about the justice system, of course. It is one thing to say that it is 
flawed; it is another to state that the whole system must be 
reformed without proposing any alternatives.
<P>
	As everyone knows, I have always fought for the rights and 
protection of victims. I have already suggested to the House that 
victims should be given a much greater role  in our judicial 
proceedings. I have already submitted that the victims should be 
represented by lawyers, produce their own witnesses, examine and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16681"> 16681 </A></B>
<P>
cross-examine crown and defence witnesses, plead on the 
evidence, suggest sentences or participate in negotiations; in short, 
they should take part in the whole judicial process and even be 
allowed to appeal any ruling.
<P>
	That is an alternative. Those are concrete solutions. We must 
start thinking about this and come up with serious proposals instead 
of a botched motion that amounts to a vague criticism of the whole 
justice system and the supporting legislation.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I thank my colleague from Saint-Hubert for her excellent 
remarks. I appreciate the support she shows for the government in 
this debate.
<P>
	I would like to ask her a question which pertains to her remarks 
about sovereignty, the role of the Bloc and the direction in which 
her party is going.
<P>
	In the context of sovereignty and in the context of the motion 
before the House, in her attitude toward sovereignty, would she 
recommend that individuals born in Quebec who commit major 
crimes be incarcerated only in Quebec or should they be put in jails 
across the country? Is it a federal thing or a separatist thing for her, 
the incarceration of prisoners who are born in Quebec?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Venne:</B> Madam Speaker, I wonder if the hon. member is 
serious in asking me that, but I will answer any way, because his 
concern seems genuine.
<P>
	There is no doubt that, upon achieving sovereignty, Quebec will 
look after its prison population, like any sovereign country. 
Quebec, as a sovereign country, is not different in that respect from 
any other sovereign country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I listened to the remarks made by the hon. 
member for Saint-Hubert. I shall set the sovereignty issue aside, 
since, as can be expected, we disagree on that point.
<P>
	I wonder if she would not agree with me that it is somewhat 
ironic that the Reform Party would come and talk to us about 
victims and what not on the very day when a gun control bill is 
being debated, and could even be passed in just a few hours in the 
other place, to use correct parliamentary terminology and be in 
order, that they would raise this issue today, knowing full well how 
many victims guns have made, not only in our country but also 
south of our border, where, admittedly, there is hardly any gun 
legislation.
<P>
	Is it not-how could I put this, again, in parliamentary 
terms?-less that honest on the part of the hon. members of the 
Reform Party to address this whole issue of victims of violence 
without mentioning that they are the ones who moved and continue 
to move heaven and earth to prevent the establishment of gun 
control across Canada until now and who lobbied certain 
Conservative members of the other place about this?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Venne:</B> Madam Speaker, of course I agree with what the 
hon. member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell is saying, because 
that was precisely my point.
<P>
	Of course, any discussion about victims must include gun 
victims. And of course, the Reform Party completely ignores them. 
I also agree that, soon, in less than an hour in fact, the other place 
will be voting on Bill C-68.
<P>
	I will go and see how the matter is settled in the other place and I 
hope that it will not have to be debated all over again in this House. 
As far as we are concerned, I think that it is clear that every 
conceivable concession and compromise has been made, ultimately 
leading to the passage of Bill C-68. I hope that the bill will come 
back unchanged and that there will be no need to consider it again.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, it was 
very interesting to listen to the comments of the hon. member for 
Saint-Hubert.
<P>
	She touched very briefly on the rights of native communities. I 
was wondering if she would reflect on the rights of the Inuit people 
who reside within the province of Quebec. Does she believe they 
have the right to self-determination? Does she similarly believe 
that they could also be a nation within the definition of that word? 
Do they have the right to secede?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I strongly question the 
relevancy of those questions to the motion we are debating.
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Venne:</B> You are quite right, Madam Speaker, this question 
has nothing to do with the matter in hand.
<P>
	I would like to point out to the hon. member that, when I 
mentioned aboriginal people earlier, it was in reference to the 
position the Reform Party had taken, again, during the gun control 
debate. I simply made a reference to them earlier.
<P>
	As for the question per se, I think it might be answered in a 
different setting.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
although I find the motion proposed today farfetched and not really 
in line with the Reform Party's position on firearms, it does at least 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16682"> 16682 </A></B>
<P>
afford us the  opportunity to address and reflect upon a significant 
social phenomenon: the victims.
<P>
	Where there is a victim there is usually crime, violence, or at the 
least a socially unacceptable act. People can also be victims of 
unfair policies, stifling economic situations, unattainable job 
markets.
<P>
	Societal values and our attitude towards the way people treat 
each other are changing. Today's definition of ``victim'' therefore 
differs considerably from what it was, say, fifty years ago.
<P>
	I shall speak particularly of women as victims, since women are 
my primary concern, given my portfolio as status of women critic.
<P>
	This morning I leafed through a most interesting book, the <I>Traité 
des problèmes sociaux</I>. This treatise, published under the direction 
of a number of eminent Quebec academics, covers a multitude of 
topics related to our society. Looking through the table of contents 
I was struck by the innumerable types of victims there can be 
within a society.
<P>
	Among the subjects covered were: occupational diseases, mental 
illness, alcoholism and other addictions, STDs and AIDS, crime, 
prostitution, pornography, poverty, unemployment, racism, 
homelessness-and these are but a few of the topics in the <I>Traité 
des problèmes sociaux.</I>
<P>
	You can see then, and this is what I wanted to talk about, the 
unbelievable number of social and personal situations that can 
``create'' victims, if we can use that verb here.
<P>
	Of course, women are not the only victims of poverty, 
unemployment, racism. They are, however, most often the victims 
of domestic violence, prostitution and pornography. The victims of 
certain problems are almost always women, because of their 
gender, along with children.
<P>
	Moreover, problems related to unemployment, illiteracy and 
poverty affect women differently, because of their family 
responsibilities and society's perception of their role within it.
<P>
	Even governments are not immune to prejudice. We need only 
think of this government trying to calculate benefits paid to women 
based on family income. This is the best example of the 
victimization of women because of their role within the family.
<P>
	As for the notion of victim, Denise Lemieux traces its evolution, 
in the context of spousal abuse. She writes, in the above-mentioned 
text: ``What stands out, if you look at this over several centuries, is 
the major attitudinal and legislative change regarding the wife 
beating. Tolerated in the seventeenth century, sometimes even 
glorified by the popular culture of the time as a manly thing, and by 
the law and the religion of the time as a paternalistic punishment 
for the wife, children and  servants, violent behaviour gradually 
became a reprehensible thing, as principles of democratic 
government began to spread''.
<P>
	Principles of democratic government. So, there seems to be a 
connection between the principles of government and the concept 
of victim. This is interesting. One such principle, affirmed by the 
Canadian and Quebec charters, provides that men and women have 
equal rights.
<P>
<B>(1630)</B>
<P>
	When equality is denied, whether because a man beats his wife, 
or because a government pays smaller benefits to a woman than to 
a man, that woman becomes a victim. When a government tolerates 
the fact that members of its army organize parties to celebrate the 
killing of 14 young women, all women become victims.
<P>
	So, the concept of victim is related to a certain vision of society. 
Everywhere, our governments have officially proclaimed a vision 
of society in which women have the same rights as men. We will 
have to recognize that women are victims whenever equality is not 
respected, whether in the family home, or in the policies and 
practices of the government.
<P>
	Those in power will also have to concentrate their energies on 
eliminating the inequalities between men and women. Our aim is to 
have fewer and fewer victims or none at all.
<P>
	Until then, our efforts must go to re-establishing a balance 
between victims and those responsible for situations creating 
victims, at whatever level.
<P>
	Let us go for openmindedness, and let us make sure, as leaders, 
that we provide our young people with positive role models. Let us 
work to provide women with equal opportunities in all settings. Let 
us eliminate social, economic and political inequality between men 
and women. Let us make men understand that discriminatory 
behaviour is completely unacceptable-at work, at home, in 
associations, in the courts of justice and in government offices.
<P>
	Let us put our fine words into practice. This is surely one way to 
ensure victims' fundamental and democratic right to equality and 
quality of life without violence.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
am pleased to have a chance to speak on this issue. I am certainly 
pleased that the warm and fuzzy questions asked by the Liberals to 
the warm and fuzzy Bloc members regarding law and order are 
over with. That was difficult to take.
<P>
	I would like to quote a few statistics I have picked up myself 
with regard to what the hon. member from the Liberal Party stated 
a while ago. I am going back to 1984. The rate of violent crime 
since 1984 has increased 49 per cent. The rate of sexual assault has 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16683"> 16683 </A></B>
<P>
increased 8 per cent  annually since 1984. Assaults accounted for 
six out of ten reported violent incidents in 1994.
<P>
	Consider that since 1984 when the Young Offenders Act was 
introduced, crime has gone up by 140 per cent. Members over there 
stand on their feet and tell us how much better it is getting because 
the crime rate went down 3.2 per cent or 5.9 per cent or whatever 
from one year to the next. It is not getting better. There are a 
number of incidents we could talk about which reflect this.
<P>
	When are we in the House going to realize there are victims? 
Guns do not make victims; killers make victims, in case members 
opposite have forgotten.
<P>
	The people who were victimized close to Montreal recently by 
young offenders with ball bats provide an example as do George 
and Tom Ambas from Scarborough, Ontario, who lost a brother in 
their store to young offenders with knives. We do not need to talk 
about what weapon is used. We need to talk about the fact that there 
are victims because of killers.
<P>
<B>(1635 )</B>
<P>
	In the Reform amendments to the legislation we attempted to 
incorporate those things that were suggested to us by victims 
through their petitions and letters. We listened to Canadians and we 
tried to put their wishes into the criminal agenda through our 
motions.
<P>
	For example, we tried to get Bill C-45 amended which would 
allow victims to be paid out of inmate funds. There would be 
mandatory restitution. All of the things we put in were geared 
toward improving things for the victim. Not one member in the 
House voted for those amendments, except for Reform Party 
members. All the Liberals said no and all the Bloc said no to things 
like mandatory restitution. We were trying to do something that 
would make it a little easier for the victims.
<P>
	A lady in my riding was raped. She happened to be a former 
student where I taught. The perpetrator was identified by her, 
picked up at breakfast and was out on bail by noon. Is living in fear 
following that rape fair to the victim, knowing that the perpetrator 
is still on the loose? If we arrest violent offenders, surely we can 
keep them in jail. Why would a victim stand up and cheer any 
system that would let the perpetrator out only a few hours after the 
crime? Somebody explain that to me.
<P>
	In the case of Ann Marie Bloskie, her killer made lots of 
advances toward her and she always refused. Her killer tried to 
force her into sex. When she fought back he crushed her skull with 
a rock and then he sexually assaulted her. He went home and slept. 
The next day he returned and further abused the body. Then he 
buried her.
<P>
	This killer loved violent, sexually explicit porno videos. He 
showed no remorse for the crime. He had deep seated 
psychological problems that would require life  long treatment, 
said the psychiatrist. This crime happened just a few weeks short of 
his 18th birthday, so the judge said it was in the best interests of the 
murderer to be tried under the Young Offenders Act. There was no 
mention of the victim, no mention of the family.
<P>
	Her killer is now nameless. He is now walking the streets 
because all he got for that crime was three years. After three years 
he is back on the streets but nobody knows for sure who he is. The 
parents of the victim were not notified that the killer was released.
<P>
	Fixing those problems is the kind of thing that makes plain, 
ordinary common sense. That is what is on the agenda of 
Canadians. It is on the Reform agenda because it is what Canadians 
want.
<P>
	Why is having a binding referendum for capital punishment on 
the Reform agenda? Because it is on the agenda of Canadians. That 
is why. In polls all across the land, 70 per cent of the people have 
indicated that is what they want. If it is on their agenda, it is on the 
Reform agenda. It is too bad the Liberals do not listen to the people 
in their ridings.
<P>
	Things get worse. We talk about victims. I really get worried and 
upset when I see some of the things that have been produced by the 
government. I know some Liberals were visited this very day by a 
group who are quite concerned that there is an organization putting 
pamphlets in the schools which promote anal sex as a method of 
reducing violence and pregnancy. I looked at the little booklets and 
guess who prints them and pays for them? The taxpayers of Canada 
pay for them, compliments of this government's health department.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	Members sit over there and laugh. I hope they laugh when their 
grandchildren come home with this kind of garbage. I hope they 
can laugh then. I cannot laugh when this happens and I will not 
laugh. I think it is ridiculous and it is a shame. They know it is 
happening. They see it happening. It is being printed by the 
Canadian health department. If members have any doubts, they can 
come on over and I will show them.
<P>
	Those are the kinds of things Canadians are telling their MPs. 
They do not want it because it is creating more victims and causing 
problems. I do not want it either but if we try to do something about 
it, those on the other side are overcome with warm, fuzzy feelings. 
It is always the criminal, the criminal, the criminal.
<P>
	I cannot believe that grown men and women would allow those 
kinds of things to happen. I cannot believe that a colleague of mine, 
who taught in a school just as I did, would find that an acceptable 
piece of junk to come into the building. I know he would not.
<P>
	The trouble is that the justice system is absolutely not addressing 
anything which is causing victims more grief. They could do it if 
they wanted to.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16684"> 16684 </A></B>
<P>
	Christine Silverberg, the Calgary chief of police, has written: 
``Dangerous violent criminals should never be released''. I agree. 
``There should be a victims bill of rights''. I agree. ``Victims are 
the most neglected group in the legal system from beginning to 
end''. I agree. ``Victims should be involved in every government 
decision dealing with their assailants''. I also agree with that.
<P>
	When is this government going to wake up and listen to the 
people of Canada, listen to what the petitioners are saying and 
listen to what their letters state which I know they all receive?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I would like to indicate to the hon. member that the 
constituents of Winnipeg North in addressing this issue have not 
only called to tell us about their concerns for safety in their homes 
and on the streets but they have also shared solutions.
<P>
	One of the important things my constituents have told me is that 
we should address the fundamental causes of crime. That is just 
like preventive medicine. Unless we address the root causes of 
crime we may not totally address the issue.
<P>
	I am proud to say that in my constituency of Winnipeg North the 
MLA for The Maples in my riding has now established the Maples 
Youth Justice Committee. The MLA for Inkster has established a 
similar organization, as has the MLA for Kildonan. I have met with 
all of them.
<P>
	What specific initiative has the member taken in his own riding 
to address the root causes of crime? Does the Reform Party 
acknowledge that prisoners week is an international religious event 
that includes victims, families and communities as it addresses the 
issues of the victims and the prisoners? Does the Reform Party not 
acknowledge that the victims of the misuse of firearms, for 
example the relatives of the victims of the massacre in Montreal, 
were correct in asking for gun control? If that is so, where does the 
member's party stand on this issue?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Madam Speaker, I object to any kind of a week 
that is named prisoners week. If this week was intended to honour 
victims then it certainly is not named right. The first thing I thought 
of when I heard we were having national prisoner's week is good 
old Clifford Olson, good old Karla Homolka and good old Paul 
Bernado. That is exactly what crossed the mind of most people in 
my riding when they phoned me and said: ``What in the devil is 
prisoner's week?'' I said: ``I do not have any idea at all. I just heard 
it was announced''. They do not have brains enough to at least 
name it right.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	Now they are going to defend it by saying that what they really 
meant was this and that and so on, but it sure did not come out that 
way. If you are to have something besides honouring those kinds of 
individuals then say so and name it properly.
<P>
	Let us go to the second question. You must have not been 
listening, sir, when I told you about these pamphlets that are getting 
into-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Address your questions 
through the Chair, please.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> I am sorry, Madam Speaker. The hon. member 
must not have been paying much attention. I have been asked by 
the people who have brought all these materials to me to question 
the government as to why the health department is funding those 
kinds of documents that lead to nothing but trouble, that lead to 
crime. A root cause. It is called morals, dealing with the morals.
<P>
	When you bring it to the government, it tries to defend it. If it 
can defend it, that would be one thing, but it cannot. It has had its 
opportunities to defend it and it cannot. Even backbenchers would 
not support some of the garbage that was going on. Of course they 
get punished for that. That is the rule over there: listen to the boys 
on the front line. They do not have enough guts to stand up on the 
back row and take their own stand.
<P>
	I do not want to get into this great gun debate once again. We 
have gone through that so much. Guns are no different from any 
other weapon. They cause problems. The victims are victims 
regardless of why or how. If any member could show me that the 
registration of a gun will save a life at the hands of a criminal, I 
might support it. I do not think anyone can show me.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
the debate today, for Canadians who are following it, is on an 
opposition day motion. This is a day when an opposition party has 
an opportunity to set the agenda for debate in the House. Reform 
has introduced for debate today a motion first of all to discuss the 
lack of progress being made in reforming the criminal justice 
system. Second, we refer in our motion to another opposition day 
motion we had about a year and a half ago on the same topic:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House condemn the government for its inaction with regard to the 
reform of the criminal justice system, in particular its allowance of the rights of 
criminals to supersede those of victims.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Here we are again a year and a half later with the same concerns. 
As we heard from my colleague who just spoke, these are very 
strong, serious concerns. These are not matters we take lightly. 
They are matters we keep hearing from our constituents and other 
members of the public that they want to see dealt with. They are 
saying the government is not dealing with them.
<P>
	A year and a half ago we urged the government in debate, which 
we were able to introduce, to do something. A year and a half later 
we are making the same request, the same appeal to government. 
You wonder why.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16685"> 16685 </A></B>
<P>
	In our motion we urged the government to do two things. One 
is to introduce measures right now to ensure the rights of the 
victim are protected and supersede the rights of the criminals. We 
are also asking the government to change the name of this week, 
November 19 to 26, from prisoners week to victims rights week.
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	Reform's position is very simple. We say the whole priority of 
the criminal justice system should be the protection of the lives and 
property of law-abiding citizens and that should come ahead of the 
protection of the rights of criminals.
<P>
	The state exists to protect the lives and property of citizens. That 
is the reason we organize. That is the reason we have institutions of 
society, so we can live in a civilized manner and can respect each 
other's rights, respect each other's safety and each other's lives.
<P>
	If we are to do that as a state, we have to make law breakers 
afraid of breaking the laws and afraid of what will happen if they 
violate the rights of other people. It would not be too strong to say 
that one of the main purposes of having an organized society and an 
organized government is to make law breakers afraid, to bring fear 
of law breaking into our society.
<P>
	We have to ask ourselves does our society make law breakers 
afraid? I do not think there are very many Canadians who would 
answer that question in the affirmative. We have had many 
examples brought up in the House over the last several months. 
Law breakers commit horrendous crimes and are right back out on 
the street living a normal life while the victims and their families 
have torment, grief, upset, pain and agony. Yet criminals and law 
breakers have every protection, every consideration, every possible 
assistance and comfort extended to them.
<P>
	Our whole society, our whole approach to the criminal justice 
system in this regard is totally on its head. That is why we have the 
strong concerns of Canadians continually being brought forward in 
this whole area.
<P>
	What does the government say? What is it doing about the 
situation? The justice minister is saying all the right things. He is 
saying yes, we are going to protect victims; yes, we are changing 
and toughening up the justice system; yes, we want the public's 
confidence in the justice system.
<P>
	These are all well and good, but here we have a minister who has 
had over two years now to do some concrete, strong, forceful, 
vigorous things to rectify this situation and instead is taking timid, 
weak, ineffectual baby steps in correcting a situation causing 
continual concern and grave frustration to our citizens.
<P>
	The second thing we have seen the government do is get really 
tough with law-abiding citizens. If they do not register their 
firearms, they will be in big trouble, they  will have a criminal 
record, but nothing is being done about these weapons which can 
be obtained illegally and quickly by any law breaker in the country.
<P>
	We have done so little to make them afraid to do that. We put the 
fear of God into the law-abiding citizens, who did not need it in the 
first place, and we have done nothing to ensure that law breakers 
cannot obtain an illegal weapon in the nearest bar in 30 minutes.
<P>
	How will this protect our society? The whole philosophy of our 
criminal justice system is on help, sympathy and support for 
prisoners and law breakers. It says a lot that this is prisoners week. 
We have prisoners week but no victims week at all.
<P>
	I was rather surprised when I read an article about women 
inmates decrying the lack of rehabilitation programs. A woman 
inmate was saying: ``In two years I got nothing. Nobody listens and 
nobody cares. I am broken hearted. Inmates are upset with the lack 
of programs''.
<P>
<B>(1655 )</B>
<P>
	There is as real desire to help everyone we can in society to be 
the best citizens they can. When we have people who have broken 
the law and violated the rights of others who are outraged and 
incensed that they are not getting help and support, when the 
victims of crime are coming in a poor second, surely the attitude 
we are fostering is wrong. There must be a change very quickly.
<P>
	I cite one other example that sums up what is wrong in our 
justice system. We have a convicted murderer who has sued 
corrections Canada and the Government of Canada for negligence 
in protecting him. This murderer was convicted for stabbing a 
15-year old boy while trying to sexually assault him.
<P>
	He sued because he was beaten up by other inmates in 1991. This 
year he was awarded an out of court settlement by the Government 
of Canada to compensate its lack of protection for him.
<P>
	I contrast that with the family of a young woman who was 
murdered by a convicted murderer who in honour of his birthday, a 
wonderful day, was given a nice pass to go shopping and to enjoy 
himself. He had been convicted of murdering someone, but of 
course we do not want to be too harsh on anyone in our society and 
we would certainly not keep a convicted murderer from having a 
shopping trip on his birthday.
<P>
	This convicted murderer went out on his birthday and gave 
himself an even better present than a shopping trip. He assaulted 
and killed a young woman. The system again failed to protect 
someone, this time an innocent young woman, not a convicted 
murderer.
<P>
	The family of the young woman naturally made an appeal for 
compensation to the Government of Canada. Where has that appeal 
gone? For six years there has been absolutely no offer of 
compensation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16686"> 16686 </A></B>
<P>
	It is incumbent on us to get serious about turning our justice 
system to the protection of the citizens and innocent people.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sue Barnes (London West, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, one of 
my favourite poets is Shakespeare. One of the soliloquies from 
``Macbeth'' talks about sound and fury signifying nothing. We have 
a lot to learn from Shakespeare because talk is cheap and action and 
hard work are the real tests.
<P>
	When we talk about being concerned about victims we have to 
listen to victims when they come before us. This is a day when in 
the other place we will have a vote on gun control.
<P>
	I remember as vice-chair of the justice committee the victims 
coming before us on gun control, the victims groups saying how 
badly they needed the legislation. I remember the suicide experts 
coming before us saying how badly this legislation was needed. I 
remember the women's groups coming before us saying how badly 
they needed this legislation. There is work to be done.
<P>
	We have done work in the government. We have talked about 
balancing rights. We do not put one right above another when 
public safety is the issue, and that is the issue. It is not whom we 
rank in order. There is a realistic need to address the problems in 
society.
<P>
	The party opposite thinks the way to address problems is to 
single out notorious, terrible events. These events are terrible and 
there are great losses. However, there is no ownership on caring for 
victims in society by any one of the parties in the House. We all 
care about victims in society.
<P>
	The difference is that when we care, we roll up our sleeves and 
do some real work. We look at real facts. We voted for the 
legislation that puts gun control in place because the victims asked 
for it. We voted for the legislation on sentencing because it gives an 
ability for the victims to go to the courts to get compensation. We 
go and we get victim impact statements at hearings.
<P>
<B>(1700)</B>
<P>
	The Reform Party can find some little place in these pieces of 
legislation where they do not care about those bills and they vote 
them down. The victims count. CAVEAT met this week in 
Hamilton, a national organization, and where did they rate the 
provinces that take the attitude that is closest to the third party? 
They rated them as a <I>d</I> in Alberta and a <I>d</I> in Ontario. Where did 
they rate our minister? They rated him up there because he has the 
fortitude to stand behind a bill that will do something for victims. 
They just do not care.
<P>
	What you need to figure out here is who is really working. Who 
is working when we have victims of misuse of firearms? Who is 
working when we have victims of family violence? I remember 
comments on December 6  last year from the other side. They have 
no understanding of family abuse.
<P>
	We have bills that bring sexual offenders now to the ends of their 
terms. We have improved the Young Offenders Act and we will do 
more. We take DNA evidence. They came alongside on that, and 
that is good. Maybe that is a real vision for the future, looking at a 
bill and making sure it works and helping us implement it.
<P>
	The Reform Party did support the drunkenness defence bill, but 
today they like to forget that we did that bill. That helps victims.
<P>
	I wish I had 20 minutes, because I have a lot more to say on this 
issue. Behind the scenes we will do the real work and not just push 
the trigger buttons.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I am absolutely delighted to hear the passion with which the 
member opposite commits to helping victims. I would like to give 
her and her government suggestions as to what we could do to 
increase the rights of victims.
<P>
	First, we could give them a right to restitution from the offender. 
Second, we could give them a right to prompt return of property. 
These are rights they do not now have. Third, we could give them 
the right to be informed of services to help them in the trauma they 
have experienced. Next, we could give them the right to 
information and notification in a whole range of areas, which I 
would be very happy to supply to the member. We can give them a 
right to be heard by the crown and a right to be heard throughout 
the judicial process.
<P>
	We could give them a right to privacy, a protection from 
unnecessary invasions of privacy; a right to refuse to be 
interviewed by defence counsel; a right to waiting areas in the court 
buildings that are separate from those used by the accused; a right 
to be free from intimidation; a right to have a prompt disposition of 
prosecutions; a right to be informed of victims' rights; a right to an 
explanation of their role and the scope and progress of the 
proceedings.
<P>
	There are a whole range of areas where we can help victims in 
very practical ways.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> The hon. member's time is 
over.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, this month marks the second 
anniversary of the period during which it has been my privilege to 
serve the Prime Minister and the government as Minister of 
Justice. I can say that during that time there have been no 
experiences that have left deeper impressions on me and there has 
been no work that has been more important to me than those 
occasions on which I have met with victims of crime, spoken to 
family members who survive others who have  died as a result of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16687"> 16687 </A></B>
<P>
crime and heard from them about their perception of justice and the 
justice system.
<P>
	I refer to meeting with Priscilla de Villiers, whose daughter Nina 
was murdered and meeting with Chuck Cadman in Vancouver, 
whose son Jesse was murdered. Priscilla de Villiers reacted by 
creating CAVEAT, which is now a strong national organization 
standing for the rights of victims and drawing the attention of 
Canadians, including governments of all levels, to the 
shortcomings in the justice system. Chuck Cadman created the 
organization called CRY, in which thousands of people participate 
actively for constructive change in the justice system.
<P>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
	I have met with Rita Jervis, a woman from the Maritimes, whose 
husband was shot and who herself was seriously injured. She 
survived that attack to devote her energies and her efforts to 
improving the justice system.
<P>
	I met with the parents of the young people murdered at the 
McDonald's restaurant in Cape Breton. I heard from them about the 
tragic and everlasting sadness and suffering that is the result of that 
dreadful crime.
<P>
	I met with Stu Garrioch and his wife in Calgary, whose son was 
killed in crime.
<P>
	I met with Margot B, the courageous woman from Quebec who 
campaigned across the country for changes in the system as a result 
of her victimization of sexual assault.
<P>
	I met with Jay Danelesko in Edmonton, whose wife Barb was 
murdered in the middle of the night in their home. She died in front 
of their children.
<P>
	I met with Monica Rainey, whose own son, a toddler, was the 
victim of sexual molestation. She turned her energies and her 
extraordinary talents into efforts to create ways to protect other 
children from that kind of victimization.
<P>
	I met with Steve Carpenter, who lost his daughter in a dreadful 
tragedy in British Columbia.
<P>
	I met with Morris Rose, whose son died a victim of violent 
crime.
<P>
	I met with Tom Ambus last week in Toronto, whose brother was 
brutally stabbed to death on the floor of Tom Ambus' store.
<P>
	It is said that victims are too often forgotten, that victims are the 
orphans of the criminal justice system. I stand in this place today to 
say that those persons and all the other victims with whom I have 
met have left too deep and indelible an impression on this Minister 
of Justice ever to be forgotten as I approach the issues in my 
portfolio, ever to be forgotten as I bring forward proposals for 
change, ever to be forgotten as I work to develop the policy of the 
government toward criminal justice.
<P>
	I shall never forget as I do my work the part they play and the 
part they have played, not only through the suffering they have 
endured through the awful loss of loved ones, but also through the 
way in which they have helped the police in the investigation of the 
crimes, how they have had the courage to testify in the prosecution 
of those responsible, how they have devoted their energies 
afterward, notwithstanding their personal pain, in efforts to 
improve the justice system, working constructively for change.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Since I took up my duties as Minister of Justice, we have tabled 
several bills aimed at improving the criminal justice system for the 
benefit of Canadian society as a whole and more specifically for 
the benefit victims of crime.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I believe the changes we have made have improved significantly 
the circumstances for victims in the Canadian system of justice. I 
point to Bill C-41, which for the first time sets out in the criminal 
law of this country in statute the principles and the purposes of 
sentencing, including the obligation of the criminal justice system 
to provide reparation to victims of crime.
<P>
	Bill C-41 specifically provides that the court will consider as an 
aggravating circumstance that someone was victimized by reason 
of a breach of trust, by reason of violence by a man against a 
woman in a domestic context, or by reason of hatred based on the 
personal characteristics of the victim. They are all on the bad list.
<P>
	Bill C-41 also contains changes in section 745 of the Criminal 
Code to ensure that the surviving family members of someone who 
is murdered must be heard from by the court when an application is 
made for permission to seek early parole under section 745.
<P>
<B>(1710 )</B>
<P>
	Perhaps most importantly for present purposes, Bill C-41 also 
provided for much strengthened provisions for restitution. I 
listened to the hon. member opposite describe the urgent need for 
avenues of restitution for the victims of crime. Bill C-41 brought 
together significant improvements, which were combined in that 
bill to provide that from and after the date of its proclamation the 
courts will be empowered to order, even without the victim asking 
for it, appropriate restitution. The victim may take that order, 
register it in the courts in the same manner as a civil judgment, and 
it can be enforced in the same manner as a civil judgment, taking 
the responsibility for enforcement off the shoulders of the victim 
and putting it where it belongs.
<P>
	In Bill C-42 the government proposed changes that are now in 
effect in the Criminal Code of Canada to provide that peace bonds, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16688"> 16688 </A></B>
<P>
restraining orders made by the courts to keep threatening persons 
away from their potential  victims, can be made on application by 
police officers instead of by the potential victim himself or herself, 
to relieve them of that obligation, to make it that much easier for 
them to have that court protection.
<P>
	Bill C-42 provided dozens of ways to streamline the criminal 
justice system for the benefit of victims, including, for example-I 
offer this only as an example-that those who have lost property in 
crime may establish ownership of the property for the purposes of 
the prosecution simply by swearing and filing an affidavit rather 
than having to take the time and trouble to appear in court 
personally to establish that technical proof.
<P>
	In Bill C-72 we expressly provided words in the Criminal Code 
that will bring home the personal responsibility of those who 
intoxicate themselves voluntarily and then commit a crime of 
violence involving the general intent of harming others. The 
preamble of Bill C-72 is express testimony of this government's 
concern about and commitment to victims of crime. Bill C-72 
stands as a profound and important statement from this Parliament 
on behalf of victims that those who intoxicate themselves 
voluntarily and then harm others in those circumstances will be 
held accountable and cannot rely upon their own self-induced 
drunkenness or intoxication from drugs as an excuse. That is action 
on behalf of victims.
<P>
	In Bill C-37 the changes to the Young Offenders Act expressly 
provided for the first time for victim impact statements in court 
proceedings involving young offenders. In the second phase of that 
work involving the young offenders, which was commenced by the 
justice committee of the House this week, I expressly asked the 
committee to look at different approaches toward juvenile justice 
with specific reference to the role of the victim. I asked how we can 
have that act improved so as to more directly involve the victim 
through reparation, through confronting the offender, through 
restitution, through community work, so that people who are the 
victims of crime can have some sense of justice out of the process. 
I expressly asked the committee to work with me in designing 
changes to achieve those objectives. I share those objectives with 
the members opposite. We have the same goals in mind. I have 
invited them this week as members of the committee to work 
constructively with me toward the attainment of these goals.
<P>
	In Bill C-104, which received the agreement of all parties in the 
House, we introduced for the first time an express provision in the 
Criminal Code empowering police officers to go to the courts for a 
warrant to obtain bodily substances for testing for DNA, important 
forensic evidence either to establish guilt or prove innocence. That 
is a step forward for victims. When combined with the further 
legislation the Solicitor General of Canada is preparing to establish 
a data bank for DNA samples of  those convicted of crime, we will 
have available to the authorities in this country an invaluable
<P>
resource to detect and ultimately pre-empt and prevent crimes of 
violence against victims.
<P>
	I have three more general points before concluding. First, when 
we speak of victims of crime, indeed, when we speak of violent 
crimes generally, it is very important to remember that 70 per cent 
of the victims of crime are acquainted with their assailants. The 
general impression that some might have that violent crime is 
confined to the streets where strangers lurk dangerously to assault 
us, is not right. The vast majority of victims know the person who 
attacks them. That leads to a related point.
<P>
<B>(1715)</B>
<P>
	An appalling percentage of crime goes on in the home and 
involves violence by men against women. It is to that cause, against 
that kind of crime, that we must also unite in our efforts and in our 
opposition. Violence by men against women tragically forms too 
large a part of the crime problem in the country. We must work 
through the wide variety of strategies available to combat, to 
reduce and ultimately to end it.
<P>
	Second, I draw the attention of hon. members to the importance, 
not just of legislative initiatives but to crime prevention. Because 
law alone, no matter how much improved by the suggestions made 
by hon. members, will never, ever be enough to address the 
problem of crime and community safety.
<P>
	It cannot work in isolation because it deals with symptoms and 
not with causes. It becomes engaged when it is too late. The crime 
has been committed, someone has been harmed and the charge has 
been laid. Crime prevention is a strategy by which we can take 
community resources and energy and through linking police 
enforcement with the justice system, with social agencies, with 
families, we can do something about crime before it happens.
<P>
	All across the country as I go from the west to central Canada to 
the maritimes, I see the energy and the commitment of 
communities. Instead of just wringing their hands about 
community safety, they are rolling up their sleeves and doing 
something constructive about it.
<P>
	The National Crime Prevention Council created by the 
government in the summer of 1994 provides the national 
instrument by which that energy and that commitment can be 
brought together and focused on that important national objective.
<P>
	Let it not be thought that we will make ourselves safe simply by 
ratcheting up the penalties and making the laws more harsh. That is 
only part of the approach. We must also look at the underlying 
causes of crime. We must recognize that preventing crime has as 
much to do with the strength of families as it does with the length 
of sentences. It has as much to do with literacy as it does  with law. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16689"> 16689 </A></B>
<P>
It has as much to do with community co-operation as it does with 
mandatory supervision.
<P>
	No one here should think that we are serving victims if we offer 
them only vengeance. Victims want more than to see the offender 
punished. That is where hon. members of the third party, in my 
respectful view, fall short in their approach to this problem. More is 
required than simply vengeance.
<P>
	If ever there was eloquent evidence of that principle, it was 
offered by the family of one of the victims in the Bernardo tragedy. 
I believe it was the Mahaffey family. When asked about capital 
punishment, the Mahaffey family said: ``That is not our objective. 
That is not what we are after. What we are after is to make sure that 
something positive comes of this awful tragedy. What we are after 
is to make sure that person is put away for life in prison. What we 
are after is to ensure that it never happens again''. That is what 
victims want and it is toward that constructive objective that we 
must work together.
<P>
	A few weeks ago I spoke outside on this magnificent Hill to a 
rally organized by a group of victims seeking changes in the 
criminal justice system. I undertook on that occasion to work with 
them in the name of justice for changes to our laws to achieve the 
objectives of which I have spoken today. I intend to keep that 
commitment, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I said earlier that I welcomed this opportunity to respond to the 
motion before the House today. The government is proud of its 
achievements because it has a made a concerted effort to approach 
the problem of crime from various angles.
<P>
<B>(1720)</B>
<P>
	I am not suggesting that all has been said and done. But I do 
know that creating new crimes with increasingly stiffer sentences 
will not solve the problem. Finding the causes of crime is no easy 
matter. It involves a cause and effect analysis as wideranging and 
complex as human nature itself. However, to claim that we can 
solve the problem by getting rid of criminals as long as possible is 
simply to evade the issue.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Let me close by emphasizing that the motion before the House 
today is somewhat of a surprise since it emanates from members of 
the third party. Sometimes the way they express themselves on 
such subjects, one would think that the members of the third party 
have a monopoly on righteousness when it comes to the position of 
victims.
<P>
	Their position, I am afraid, is hardly that strong. I suggest that 
their presentation today of this resolution offers somewhat of an 
embarrassing contrast for the third party. Today, through their 
resolution and their  arguments, they would have us believe that 
their priority is the rights of victims and the perspective of victims.
<P>
	Just two days ago, on Monday of this week, a group of victims 
met here on the Hill. They made a very powerful, a very emotional 
and a very moving presentation in favour of Bill C-68, urging the 
Senate to adopt the government's proposals on gun control.
<P>
	Those victims also have a point of view. The men and women 
who stood on the Hill on Monday in favour of Bill C-68 are victims 
too. They want Bill C-68 put in place because they know it is in the 
best interests of victims and the criminal justice system in this 
country.
<P>
	It is the members of the third party who have fought so much 
against Bill C-68 in the past and continue to do so. Perhaps that is 
the best evidence of the flawed approach of the members of the 
third party toward the proposition in which today they pretend so 
strongly to believe.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I enjoyed 
listening to the speech of the justice minister.
<P>
	A year ago Reformers brought up the same issue, asking the 
government to be a little more active in trying to protect victims 
and their rights. For years, the criminal justice system-as a 
lawyer, he would know this-has been geared toward the rights of 
the criminal. From the moment the offender is arrested to the 
moment of the expiration of the sentence, our system is built 
around the criminal. The victim has been generally ignored.
<P>
	We brought this to the attention of the House. There has been 
some movement and very little improvement. We want to make 
more improvement.
<P>
	If Parliament is intent on protecting society, it should and will 
have to recognize and codify victims' rights. As a party we have 
pushed four issues: official standing in court cases and parole 
hearings, which the minister has not invoked; mandatory victim 
impact statements and victim compensation, where there is an 
opportunity to draw from the criminal himself or herself some 
compensation, and to recognize that the rights of the victim 
outweigh the rights of the criminal.
<P>
	Our charter of rights and freedoms in some ways give criminals 
privileges that are unheard of. We talked a year ago about the 
46-year old woman, mother of three children, who was raped by a 
convict on day parole. The victim tried to get a Quebec court to 
compel her attacker to take a blood test for HIV but the court ruled 
against her, saying that the blood test would compromise the rights 
of the accused rapist.
<P>
	Protecting the rights of the accused at the expense of the victim 
of a crime is a crime in itself. Today, we have the Bernardo and the 
Homolka situation. We have two prisons that are connected by a 
tunnel-
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="16690"> 16690 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Will somebody tell the minister it is 
normally expected that the minister would wait and reply to 
questions and comments. I thank the minister for coming back.
<P>
<B>(1725 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, I posed the question. He is a busy man. 
Maybe he is going out to fix up our victims rights. Maybe he is 
going to do something about the bill.
<P>
	Getting back to the point I was making about the two prisons 
where Bernardo and Homolka are held, a tunnel connects the two. 
According to the charter of rights and freedoms, he is going to be 
able to have conjugal visits with members on the female prison 
side. This is not punishment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hoeppner:</B> It's ludicrous.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> It is ludicrous, I agree with the member from 
Manitoba.
<P>
	I guess I need another preamble for my question. I believe that 
we should make violent criminals-that was my comment and now 
to the question for the-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> We are laughing and joking, but it is not really funny.
<P>
	This man has been the justice minister for two years. All he 
wants to do is register firearms at a cost of $400 million and impose 
a bunch of ludicrous infringements on private property and 
carrying on like that, rather than doing what really is important 
which is toughening up the criminal justice system, making our 
streets safer and actually punishing people who commit crimes.
<P>
	It is wonderful to talk about the causes of it. It is wonderful to 
look at how we can help these people to not commit these crimes. 
Those are solutions that are of a much longer term. In the short 
term the punishment should fit the crime and parole should not be 
given to violent offenders.
<P>
	Why not make violent criminals serve their full sentence without 
possibility of parole? Why not get tougher with the criminals, show 
that the justice system is tough, then look at the rights of the 
victims and give them the satisfaction that at least the government 
of this land is looking after their rights and not just the criminals 
rights.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rock:</B> Mr. Speaker, may I first of all make it clear that I 
intended no disrespect to the hon. member when I left the Chamber 
for a few moments. I am sure he knows that and I trust that the 
Speaker knows it as well.
<P>
	In response to the point raised by the hon. member, I take it that 
what he is advocating is a balance in the approach. We must take 
steps to strengthen the criminal justice system. We must also be 
sensitive to the rights and the interests of the victim. I believe that 
is what we have reflected in the steps we have taken as a 
government.
<P>
	We have introduced, for example, in Bill C-68 mandatory 
minimum penitentiary terms-the longest in the Criminal 
Code-for those who use guns in crime. That is a very significant 
punitive element in the criminal law. I know that it has the support 
of the members of the third party.
<P>
	At the same time in Bill C-41, for example, we have recognized 
the role and the rights of the victim in the strengthened restitution 
provisions. We have changed the section 745 procedure so that they 
are guaranteed a role in such applications. In Bill C-42 we have 
made it unnecessary for them to go to court, for example, when-

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="PARLIAMENTOFCANADAACT">PARLIAMENT OF CANADA ACT</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden, NDP)</B> moved that Bill 
C-314, an act to amend the Parliament of Canada Act (other 
pension income), be read the second time and referred to a 
committee.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I am pleased today to say a few words at 
second reading of my private member's bill, Bill C-314. I made a 
few comments when I introduced it but for members in the House 
today I want to remind them that this bill is an act to amend the 
Parliament of Canada Act (other pension income). The bill requires 
all pension or retiring allowance payments received by a member 
of Parliament which are paid from public funds to be deducted 
from the member of Parliament's sessional allowance payments.
<P>
	The following occupations fall under the definition of a public or 
retiring allowance paid from the public purse: a member of the 
legislative assembly of a province or a provincial parliament; a 
member of the public service of Canada or a province; a judge of 
any court in Canada; a member of the Canadian forces; a peace 
officer; an employee or officer of a crown corporation of the crown 
in right of Canada or of a province; an employee or officer of a 
board, bureau, commission, council, institute or agency of the 
crown in right of Canada, the crown in right of a province or a 
municipality; an employee or officer of a publicly funded school, 
school board, college, university or hospital; an employee or 
officer of an organization that the board by law orders to be an 
equivalent organization, crown corporation, agency of the crown, 
or college, university or hospital.
<P>
	The bill is a reverse double dipping bill. There are two 
definitions of double dipping. The first is members of Parliament 
with 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16691"> 16691 </A></B>
<P>
pensions taking government jobs while  still drawing their 
parliamentary pension. This definition has been primarily dealt 
with in Bill C-85. The President of the Treasury Board introduced 
the bill and it was passed. It was part of the pension adjustment bill.
<P>
	The second definition of double dipping, which this bill 
addresses, is MPs elected while collecting a public pension. They 
are receiving in essence a pension from a position which I made 
reference to plus receiving their member of Parliament allowance.
<P>
	For example, there is a former MLA in this assembly who 
receives a pension of approximately $61,000 annually. He was 
elected to the House and receives a full salary as a member of 
Parliament as well. Therefore he is earning something in the order 
of $165,000 for serving the public. This bill would take the $61,000 
pension and subtract it from the $64,400 which is due to a member 
of Parliament, thereby only paying this person to continue to serve 
the public at the federal level his $61,000 pension and $3,400.
<P>
	I will take the House through a bit of the history of double 
dipping in Canada. Prior to 1976 pensions of the Royal Canadian 
Mounted Police, members of Parliament, the military and public 
servants were regulated by Parliament and the regulations were 
quite uneven. A former member of the military could not keep their 
pension if elected to Parliament, yet a civil servant could. It was 
also not possible for a former member of Parliament to join the 
public service and collect their pension. The rules did not allow for 
a level playing field. Certain occupations were eligible to collect 
pensions while working in another occupation, while others were 
not.
<P>
	This was updated in 1976 but instead of preventing all public 
pensioners from drawing a salary and a public pension, the process 
was opened up to allow them to collect both. In hindsight this was a 
costly, unfair and unacceptable practice, as it is now, in light of our 
fiscal situation and in light of a significant increase in 
unemployment, in particular with young Canadians.
<P>
	The purpose of a pension is to provide income to an individual in 
recognition of years of service. In essence it is a deferred income or 
a deferred benefit earned while working to be paid when one 
retires. It is meant to sustain retirees in a satisfactory manner 
during retirement. A public pension is provided by the taxpayers so 
that the retiree has a source of income.
<P>
	The proposal I am putting forward through Bill C-314 is seen in 
other jurisdictions. For example, it is a policy with many school 
boards to deduct salaried earnings from retirees who go back to the 
classroom to teach so they are not double dipping, receiving a 
pension from the school board as well as receiving a full time 
salary-doing two things; double dipping in terms of getting 
double revenue for doing one job and also taking the job away from 
somebody who needs it much more than the person who is 
receiving a substantial pension.
<P>
	This policy was established because school boards could not 
justify to the taxpayer that a teacher should be able to earn a salary 
from teaching when they claim to be retired from the very 
profession in which they are working.
<P>
<B>(1735 )</B>
<P>
	The bill would save the House of Commons literally millions of 
dollars annually because the payroll would be reduced. As well, 
there are currently at least 60 members of Parliament who could be 
affected by the bill. The numbers are approximate, we do not know 
for sure. A number of Liberals, Bloc members and Reform 
members are currently receiving pensions from previous public 
service and collecting a full salary as members of Parliament. They 
fall into the categories of MLAs, MPPs, municipal politicians, 
teachers, military officers, peace officers and various and sundry 
civil servants.
<P>
	Some are receiving generous pensions and others will be eligible 
soon for benefits while still serving as a member of Parliament. 
The bill reflects the fact that these individuals are continuing in 
their role of serving the public and should not be paid twice. They 
should not be considered retired from public life and then pursue a 
career as a member of Parliament and be paid twice to serve that 
very same public.
<P>
	Many members of Parliament in most veins agree that serving 
Canada is an honour and a privilege. We should not abuse that 
privilege. All we do by receiving a public pension while being a 
member of Parliament receiving a full salary is add to the cynicism 
of the public by abusing the goodwill of the Canadian taxpayer.
<P>
	Bill C-314 recognizes that despite the level of government there 
is only one taxpayer paying the salaries of MPs, retired municipal 
politicians and retired civil servants. If a retired person becomes a 
member of Parliament, that person should no longer be considered 
retired.
<P>
	The government does not allow persons who are collecting 
unemployment insurance benefits to collect welfare benefits at the 
same time. We have this in other jurisdictions such as school 
boards and unemployment insurance. UI does not allow persons to 
collect unemployment insurance while holding a job either. If a 
person does this they are considered to be cheating the system. 
Why are members of Parliament exempt from this form of double 
dipping? In essence those of us who are receiving pensions could 
be considered cheaters on the taxpayers.
<P>
	We cannot expect Canadians to tighten their belts with massive 
cutbacks to government programs while we receive a public 
pension and a public salary at the same time. Contributions 
members of Parliament would make in terms of savings could go 
toward a special fund.
<P>
	For example, consider a member who makes $61,000 in pension 
income. That $61,000 could go to this fund  which could be used on 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16692"> 16692 </A></B>
<P>
an annual basis to be paid directly on the deficit. This could provide 
very significant leadership to Canadians in the sense that the 
members who receive these pensions with this deduction from their 
MPs salary could use this fund annually toward reducing the deficit 
while telling Canadians we are making some very difficult choices 
and that we also believe as members of Parliament we are to make 
some difficult choices ourselves which will address the deficit 
issue.
<P>
	We also see an opportunity to save money for taxpayers. 
However, we have seen governments in the past, and particularly 
this Liberal government, make some significant cuts to transfer 
payments in the health, education and social service areas. It is not 
really saving money. It says it is saving money by cutting back $7 
billion this year with respect to health, education and social 
services costs but all it is really doing is transferring this to other 
levels of government, the provincial governments and the 
municipalities across the country. The taxpayer has to make up the 
difference of the $7 billion.
<P>
	We are also seeing a government making cutbacks to 
unemployment insurance. In Saskatchewan's circumstance we 
have seen the unemployment insurance program cutback so 
dramatically in the last two years that over 15,000 people have 
been taken off UI as a result of the new cutbacks by the Liberal 
government. They are now being put on the Saskatchewan 
assistance plan case load, which costs an extra $63 million a year.
<P>
	In addition to the unemployment insurance reductions, the 
Liberal government has transferred responsibility for providing 
assistance to off reserve status Indians, adding another 10,000 
people to the welfare case load of Saskatchewan alone at an 
estimated cost of $37 million. We have seen $63 million, $37 
million, $100 million on those two initiatives under the 
unemployment insurance benefit scheme alone.
<P>
<B>(1740)</B>
<P>
	The Liberal government was elected on the platform of 
providing jobs and of course it has thrown more people out of work 
and on to welfare rolls in Saskatchewan than ever before, adding to 
the burden of the Saskatchewan taxpayer.
<P>
	Bill C-314, which I am proposing, would assist in a very minor 
way but illustrates the Liberals have no new ways of trying to save 
money. All they want to do is pass off the expense of running our 
country to another level of government.
<P>
	I will say a few words now about double dipping in the Reform 
Party. If the Reform Party is concerned about double dipping, it 
would support the bill. The bill creates a level playing field. 
Members of Parliament would see retirement income deducted 
from their paycheque during their tenures as members of 
Parliament.
<P>
	Members of the Reform Party have stated they would not accept 
the parliamentary pension before age 60. Yet there are Reform MPs 
who gladly accept publicly paid pension benefits from the 
provincial governments they have served in other public sector 
jobs, be it teaching, municipal governments or other provincial 
government sectors.
<P>
	This in my view is hypocrisy on the part of the Reform Party. 
The Reform Party is insulting the intelligence of Canadian 
taxpayers. If it is wrong for a former member of Parliament to 
accept his pension and take a public sector job, then why can a 
former MLA now in the Reform Party receiving a $61,000 a year 
pension not do the same thing when he becomes a member of 
Parliament?
<P>
	Reform Party members must lead by example and voluntarily 
deduct their pension incomes from their salaries and give the 
difference back to the House of Commons or to the deficit.
<P>
	I have some very profound arguments and a great deal of support 
for the bill. Barbara Yaffe of British Columbia wrote in the Ottawa 
<I>Citizen</I> on April 20:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Now that the diabolical double dip has been addressed, the Chrétien 
government might want to take action on the reverse dip.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Double dipping is to be forbidden under the reforms to the MPs' pension plan 
announced in February by Treasury Board President Art Eggleton. But the 
reverse dip was not mentioned in those reforms.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The column was quite laudatory for me and with respect to this 
bill. She does quote a number of members of Parliament who are 
serving in the Reform and Liberal parties: the member for 
Bonavista-Trinity Conception, a retired naval rear admiral; the 
member for Lethbridge; the member for Nanaimo-Cowichan; the 
member for Saanich-Gulf Islands, a former armed forces officer, 
and it goes on and on. I would like to read the whole article but I do 
not think it would be appropriate at this time. However, the bottom 
line is there is a great deal of support for the bill.
<P>
	I am not doing this out of mischievousness. I am doing this 
because it is a serious issue for Canadians and for Parliament. I am 
doing it with sincerity. As a former member of the Saskatchewan 
legislature, I have gone on record before and after the election that 
if I was serving my country in the House of Commons I would 
never take a pension for my former service as a member of the 
Saskatchewan Legislative Assembly. I will stick by that regardless 
of whether the bill is passed.
<P>
	I reaffirm my position that as a former member I will not take a 
public pension, my legislative pension or my pension as a 
corporate planner with Saskatchewan Telecommunications because 
I believe it is a privilege to serve my constituents, my province and 
my country. Regardless of what position I am in, I will take only 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16693"> 16693 </A></B>
<P>
the  salary due to me and disregard and postpone taking any 
pensions I am entitled to.
<P>
	In this regard I am putting the bill forward in a serious manner. I 
hope that members of the Reform Party and the Liberal Party will 
join with me in supporting the bill.
<P>
<B>(1745)</B>
<P>
	There are a few more things I would like to add with respect to 
some of the impacts on the bill but I note that the Liberal member 
opposite is anxious to say a few words on it.
<P>
	I will end by saying there have been some comments in the 
House today concerning the MPs pension plan. There are members 
of Parliament who will argue that members should not receive any 
pension whatsoever. For those who argue for no pensions, one has 
to question their motives. Is it because they already have a pension, 
or is it because they are representing interests which will pay them 
handsomely for doing other things? Or is it simply an attempt to 
falsely bribe the electorate into believing that if the MPs are not 
worthy of pensions or MPs should not take pensions they might be 
more worthy of support by the electorate?
<P>
	I think those arguments are false. People will support honest, 
hardworking politicians who are fair, who work to build our 
country and who raise taxpayers' money fairly and spend it even 
more fairly and wisely in a very accountable fashion. People will 
agree that if we are not doing a good job or if we are corrupt or 
dishonest, we deserve nothing. In fact, nothing is still too much for 
some in people's minds because of the lack of work they have done 
or the corruption they have been involved with.
<P>
	No one disagrees with that but it does not mean because there are 
some bad apples in a profession that all are bad, or in the case of 
members of Parliament that none deserve or are entitled to 
pensions. I do not subscribe to that.
<P>
	I believe if taxpayers treat their members of Parliament 
satisfactorily in terms of pay and benefits, be they current or 
deferred or both, that the members of Parliament will be 
responsible and accountable to those who pay their salaries and 
benefits. If members of Parliament or any other elected official are 
not paid satisfactorily, they will receive income from other sources. 
Perhaps they will be accountable to those other sources more so 
than those people they are representing in this wonderful institution 
called the House of Commons.
<P>
	I do not take for one second the argument that members of 
Parliament should not take a pension if they deserve it, if they have 
earned it and if they have served their country well. There is some 
room to manoeuvre in terms of the possibility of not having served 
the country in an honourable or honest fashion. Then perhaps some 
penalties might arise. However, I certainly believe  Canadians 
would agree that if a member has worked and earned his or her 
pension then the member is entitled to it.
<P>
	There will always be a debate on how much the pension should 
be, but the point is that the concept of a pension is realistic. If a 
member of Parliament receives a pension, the member will work 
hard in this House of Commons to ensure that all Canadians receive 
a fair pension.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with interest to the remarks of the hon. member for 
Regina-Lumsden as he introduced this private member's bill. 
While he may have had some very virtuous points, I think his bill is 
misguided.
<P>
	It is unfortunate that this bill cannot come to a vote because then 
we could make a decision on it. However, it is not a votable item so 
we will have to make do and it will be dropped from the Order 
Paper after the debate. That is not going to stop me from expressing 
my views about the hon. member's bill, of which I am sure the hon. 
member for Mackenzie was a reluctant seconder.
<P>
	Having said that, it is important to look at what the hon. member 
has proposed in reality. While it may have a superficial appeal in 
terms of actual fairness, I suggest it is not exactly what Canadians 
would want.
<P>
	Canadians earn pensions in the course of their employment as 
part of the remuneration for the employment they are engaged in. 
In other words, if I take a job and am paid a specific salary, 
attached to the job will be the possibility of a pension.
<P>
<B>(1750 )</B>
<P>
	Let us assume that the job is one that has a pension attached. My 
salary will be lower than it might otherwise be in order for the 
employer and I to contribute to a pension plan. We will contribute 
at varying rates according to the terms of the contract but 
nevertheless, contributions will be made to a pension plan.
<P>
	It will be understood that that is deferred compensation. It is 
money that I am not being paid in the course of my employment to 
ensure that I receive additional moneys later. I make that 
agreement when I make a deal with an employer. The hon. member 
knows that all kinds of persons engaged in employment contracts 
make those kinds of deals.
<P>
	He is now saying that where a person is subsequently elected to 
the House of Commons, at the time that he is entitled to draw a 
pension from another source, that pension should not be paid to 
him or her. Or, if it is paid, his or her salary as a member of 
Parliament is reduced by the dollar amount of the pension.
<P>
	Let us imagine for a moment that in my previous employment I 
had been engaged in a place where I earned a pension. I was not, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16694"> 16694 </A></B>
<P>
but suppose I was. Suppose  that on my election to the House 
because I had left my previous employment I was eligible to a 
pension of $30,000 a year. That would mean my sessional 
indemnity as a member of Parliament would be reduced from the 
standard $64,000 to $34,000 because I was receiving this 
additional pension from my previous employment. They were 
funds that I had earned in the course of that employment and which 
were payable to me as a result of that work.
<P>
	Let us assume that the hon. member for Regina-Lumsden had 
no pensionable earnings from previous employment. He came to 
the House and earned his $64,000. What inducement would there 
be for me to work on a full time basis as a member of Parliament 
when my salary was less than his? I would be paid $30,000 less by 
Parliament for doing exactly the same job presumably he was 
elected to do. Why should I do that? Why should I be paid on a 
different basis?
<P>
	We are all paid the same amount as members of Parliament. 
Some of us work harder than others. We accept that fact, but the 
House does not make any differentiation between that. We are all 
paid the same and it is assumed we all do the same work. We all 
certainly have the same responsibility.
<P>
	Some of us get a little extra money because we are parliamentary 
secretaries or cabinet ministers. However as members of 
Parliament, we all receive the same basic pay. It is not adjusted 
downward because one of us receives a pension. Yet, the hon. 
member not only would draw that distinction between MPs, he 
would then draw it only in respect of those who received pensions 
from a public sector pension fund.
<P>
	If mine happened to be from a private employer, I could keep my 
money and take no reduction. If it came from a public sector 
employer, I would take a cut in my pay as a member of Parliament. 
I do not think it is fair and the hon. member on serious reflection 
would realize it is unfair.
<P>
	Tempting as it is to go after his friends in the Reform Party, that 
is not the way to do it. Pensions represent deferred earnings. The 
sessional indemnity that members of Parliament earn is paid for us 
to do our job here. After all, we are paid to do the job we were 
elected to do at the specified rate I have indicated. That rate surely 
is one that is not overly generous. To suggest that it ought to be 
reduced because someone gets a pension modest or otherwise from 
another source is unfair.
<P>
	Who will be prejudiced by the hon. member's bill? Let us look at 
who is likely to end up suffering. It will be those who are over an 
age where they could draw a pension. Younger members of 
Parliament will not qualify for a pension in any event. It will 
almost exclusively be more senior members who will be affected 
by this. Senior members are here to work as are the younger 
members. Why should they be paid less as members of this 
Parliament because they are older and entitled to another  pension? 
I ask the hon. member to reflect on that. I do not think he has in 
drafting the bill.
<P>
	There is no reason for the hon. member to assume that all public 
pensions are heavily subsidized the way the MPs pension has been 
until the recent changes the government brought in and which I 
assume is the evil he is driving at. He is suggesting that because 
public pensions are somehow subsidized by the taxpayer they are a 
polity different from those that are paid by private employers and 
therefore a public sector pension should result in the lowering of 
the MPs salary.
<P>
	I do not agree because many public sector pensions are not 
subsidized heavily by the taxpayer. They are paid on the basis of 
matching contributions by employer and employee, as are private 
sector pensions. I suggest there is nothing unfair about that.
<P>
<B>(1755)</B>
<P>
	The ability to draw a pension from one employer, private or 
public, when working with another stems from the fact that the 
individual completed a career and has moved on to another. In 
private work if I have qualified for a pension in my first job and 
move to a second job and draw the pension, that factor is not taken 
into account by my second employer in determining salary. That 
matter will be negotiated between me and the second employer. If I 
happen to be in an organization where the rate of pay is fixed by 
some kind of collective agreement, I will be paid at a standard rate 
with no possible reduction because I happen to be receiving a 
pension from another source.
<P>
	Given that, why would the hon. member seek to interfere in that 
employer-employee relationship particularly those under a 
collective agreement which he says he and his party support so 
staunchly?
<P>
	We all know what happened in Ontario with the recent New 
Democratic Party government. The New Democrats claimed to be 
the great friends of labour but by the time they left office after the 
last provincial election everyone acknowledged they were not the 
friends of labour. In fact they were probably the greatest enemies 
the Ontario labour movement had for some time, until the Mike 
Harris government came in, but that is another matter. We all 
remember with great fondness the Rae days the former premier 
imposed in the province of Ontario. The hon. member for 
Lisgar-Marquette may not be fully conversant with the disaster 
we suffered in Ontario for the five years ending earlier this year. It 
seems we have moved from one disaster to another in our province.
<P>
	I see the chief government whip is advising me that the gun 
control bill has cleared the Senate, 64 votes to 28. Mr. Speaker, I 
thought you would want to know. presume that is without any 
amendments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> That is right.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> That is very good news.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="16695"> 16695 </A></B>
<P>
	The other problem with the hon. member's suggestion, as I have 
indicated, is we would end up with great inequality in the House 
where two members of Parliament sitting side by side in the House 
might find themselves earning different amounts because one 
happened to draw a private pension and one happened to draw a 
public pension.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solomon:</B> That happens now.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Yes, it happens now because members come here 
with varying amounts of money. Some are well to do. Some may 
have a very substantial investment income. They still get paid a 
salary of $64,000 and change for doing their job as a member of 
Parliament. Every single member of Parliament gets that.
<P>
	The ones who are getting paid extra, and I point this out to the 
hon. member, are the ones who are doing work which is additional 
to their work as members of Parliament. He may not think that the 
additional work is significant but the fact is all the ones who are 
getting paid extra are being paid extra because they do additional 
work. All the ones who are not doing additional work in this House 
are receiving the same amount of money.
<P>
	I want to quote the hon. member for Calgary Centre who 
justified one of his own members receiving a pension from a 
provincial legislature by saying: ``The member the Liberal MP 
asked me about is not guilty of double dipping. It is not double 
dipping. This individual served in the provincial legislature. This 
individual resigned from the provincial legislature. This individual 
offered his services to the Canadian public on a federal basis''.
<P>
	The hon. member for Lisgar-Marquette loves it when I quote 
one of his colleagues.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I compliment the hon. member for Kingston and the 
Islands. I finally heard the fact that I can agree with him, that what 
the member for Lethbridge is doing is not double dipping. We have 
heard the Liberals so often saying: ``The double dipper is sitting 
right there''. Finally they have seen the light. Thank you for that, 
Mr. Speaker. We are making progress in the House. That is what I 
like to see.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this bill. I 
listened to the very eloquent remarks of the hon. member for 
Kingston and the Islands.
<P>
	I am sorry I was not here for previous remarks but I was in the 
other place watching the other place do the right thing. NDP 
members would have acknowledged it at one point, but more 
recently they do not acknowledge quite as much that gun control is 
a good thing.
<P>
<B>(1800)</B>
<P>
	In any case, the other place passed gun control, as the member 
for Kingston and the Islands indicated, 64 to 28.  That is excellent 
news. All Canadians, except for a handful of New Democrats and a 
larger handful of Reformers, would agree. That is a very good 
thing.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speller:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I heard the 
hon. member talking about something going on in the other place. 
What did he say the Conservatives did over there? I was not quite 
clear as to what he said.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I appreciate that the hon. member is being 
light hearted, I believe, but we do have rules of relevance in the 
House. As you know, the Chair often sits here and squirms and 
wonders why we do not observe those rules. Normally the Chair 
waits for a member to get up and say that somebody is speaking 
totally off the subject. I am sure the hon. chief whip to the 
government party will make his remarks relevant to the subject 
very soon.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak to the bill, but 
at the same time I am also pleased to inform the House that some 
Conservative members in the other place voted for the bill, some 
voted against the bill, some abstained and so on. In other words it is 
the same thing as usual: several different messages coming from 
the Tories.
<P>
	We are back to Bill C-314. I am pleased to be speaking about 
that. The hon. member from the New Democratic Party is 
proposing this bill to us today. As my colleague for Kingston and 
the Islands has indicated, this is not a bill that some of us are 
willing to support.
<P>
	The bill would create a number of inconsistencies. Apparently 
one of the issues is the concern for public funds. It is interesting 
that some public pensions would be applicable in terms of the 
reduction from salaries and others would not. For instance, if an 
MP happened to be older than 65 years of age, the CPP or QPP 
provisions would not be reduced, even though that is a public 
pension as well, but other pensions would. OAS would not be 
covered, veterans pensions and so on, but military pensions would. 
You can see that there are a number of inconsistencies created in 
what the hon. member is trying to address.
<P>
	The government has gone a very long way toward improving the 
pension plan for members of Parliament. I believe the government 
has done the right thing. I was pleased to support the government's 
initiative. I was pleased to defend it. I did not happen to think there 
was much wrong with the system as it existed even prior to that 
change, but some people feel, and those in the Reform Party are in 
that category, that MPs should have less pension and virtually 
double the salary. This is what the member for Calgary Centre has 
suggested.
<P>
	When I was asked by the media what the chances are of doubling 
MPs' salaries, I said it is about the same as the chances of Brian 
Mulroney being re-elected. In other words, it is not a very likely 
proposition, to put it mildly. Most Canadians would not look too 
favourably on either  one of those two situations. Of course that did 
not happen.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="16696"> 16696 </A></B>
<P>
	It is wrong as well to somehow portray, either through the bill or 
others, that MPs are somewhat overpaid. I do not share that view. I 
am not suffering. I believe I am making a decent salary. In 
comparison with other people in society, I do not believe that we 
are overpaid. In my province of Ontario, a high school 
vice-principal-there must be two dozen of them in my 
constituency-is paid a salary which is larger than mine. A high 
school principal makes even more. Then there are the school 
superintendents, the directors of education and so on. I am only 
addressing people in the public sector involved in education.
<P>
<B>(1805)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hoeppner:</B> Do they get a living allowance?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> The hon. member opposite asks about a living 
allowance. I do not get one. I do not qualify for such an allowance. 
Perhaps he does not know that. I do not qualify because I do not 
operate two homes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hoeppner:</B> What about mileage?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> People who travel for a living are reimbursed for 
their mileage expenditures. That is fairly standard. The hon. 
member opposite knows that.
<P>
	People in the educational sector, those who travel from school to 
school, get a travel allowance. The hon. member knows the 
answers to all these questions. He is just trying to be funny. Heaven 
forbid that he would not know better than what he is pretending 
today. If he does not, maybe it is a lost cause.
<P>
	Those are the comments I want to make with respect to the bill 
which is presently before the House.
<P>
	At some point in the future, perhaps not in this Parliament, 
because I do not see how it could be done, I would like to see the 
whole issue of compensation for MPs revisited. There have been 
two reports in this Parliament which both recommended an overall 
increase in benefits. Of course that will not happen.
<P>
	We even had a party which pretended that MPs should receive 15 
per cent less. Some of them adhered to that principle, others 
pretended to do it and others did not. We never knew which was 
which. The scheme was abandoned because it was not appropriate. 
The public was being fooled.
<P>
	Some of them said that they were not using their tax free 
allowance and were giving it back. However, once the MPs' 
pension was reduced they said that they would keep it to create 
their own pension scheme.
<P>
	The Reform Party's preachings in this area are a little less than 
totally sincere.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It has been a pleasure to speak to this bill which would require all 
pension or retiring allowance payments paid from public funds to 
be deducted from the member's sessional allowance.
<P>
	However, there are certain aspects that are not given sufficient 
clarification in the hon. member's proposal. First, some public 
pension plans are not paid from public funds. That is number one.
<P>
	There are entities in this country that are neither public nor 
private, in other words, they are sort of in-between. And finally, of 
course, even if a pension is public, that does not necessarily mean it 
is subsidized by the government or by the public jurisdiction
