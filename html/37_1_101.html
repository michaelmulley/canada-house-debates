	Mr. Speaker, in my riding of Brome—Missisquoi, an event
					 is held that is dear to the hearts of all lovers of fine food. It is called “Le
					 canard du lac Brome en fête”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a country celebration of the gastronomic and
					 scenic wonders of the Eastern Townships. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than 40 restaurants, hotels and inns in the region
					 take part in the celebration of Brome Lake duck, which has become a real
					 institution in our region, as well as gaining international renown. Hon.
					 members will recall the place of honour our Brome Lake duck held at a reception
					 given by our Prime Minister during the last summit of the Americas.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My congratulations to Claude Trottier of la Ferme des
					 canards du lac Brome, founded in 1912, the oldest duck farm in Canada, as well
					 as one of the region's biggest employers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can be proud of the dynamism of our people and their
					 invaluable contribution to the development of our rural regions. </p>

					 Canadian Alliance): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, terrorism and organized crime are
					 interlinked. Terrorism is visible, violent and emotional so it is scary.
					 Organized crime is latent, hidden and invisible so it is given less attention.
					 However its effect is long term. It undermines the economy and is a root cause
					 of many social evils at high cost to taxpayers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terrorists thrive on organized crime. Drugs, fraud,
					 human and firearms smuggling, extortion and money laundering are common
					 symptoms. Due to recent heightened security potential terrorists may shift to
					 organized crime to raise funds, strengthen themselves and wait to strike at the
					 appropriate time.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The success or failure of our war on terror hinges on
					 the ability and willingness of Liberals to fight terror and organized crime
					 simultaneously. The government should create a synergy by integration and
					 co-ordination of its resources, policy and legislation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a town hall meeting Surrey Central constituents told
					 me they were afraid and that they believe the government is not doing enough to
					 protect them. They expect no less.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, today is United Nations Day.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October 24, 1945, the United Nations Organization
					 was founded, a significant date in world history. The Organization was quick to
					 take its place on the international scene and now plays an irreplaceable
					 role.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada's John Humphrey drafted the first version of the
					 Declaration of Human Rights, which was to be adopted by the UN in 1948. Lester
					 B. Pearson was the one who came up with the idea of the first peacekeeping
					 operation, in 1956.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada has contributed greatly to the UN and has served
					 six terms as a member of the Security Council. Many Canadians continue to be
					 involved.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take advantage of this day to focus on our
					 commitment to the United Nations.</p>

					 (Barrie—Simcoe—Bradford, Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, it is an honour for me to remind
					 parliamentarians that, today, Canadians are joining with the other members of
					 the United Nations family, to celebrate United Nations Day, which marks the
					 date the UN charter came into effect in 1945.</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The credibility and effectiveness of the United Nations
					 have been enhanced by the outstanding leadership of Secretary General Kofi
					 Annan. His vision for a revitalized organization received a vote of confidence
					 of the highest order when the Nobel committee decided to award the Nobel Peace
					 Prize to him and to the United Nations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear that the terrorist threat can best be met
					 through a co-ordinated multilateral response. However while the United Nations
					 faces unprecedented challenges it is reassuring that the purposes and
					 principles entrenched in its charter continue to provide inspiration for our
					 multilateral efforts to meet these threats.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the many
					 Canadians who serve throughout the United Nations system.</p>

					 legend of the RCMP. Hundreds of family members, friends, acquaintances and
					 business contacts gathered to pay tribute to the assistant commissioner. The
					 true measure of this man's accomplishments was expressed through the
					 relationships he had developed with others over his years as a
					 lawman.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too often men strive just to gain the praise of others.
					 Not so for Assistant Commissioner McDermid. He was praised by many though he
					 did not seek it. His dedication, loyalty and integrity brought true success and
					 his leadership inspired confidence in the community he served.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assistant Commissioner McDermid's daughter graciously
					 spoke the words that said it all: “You can't get any more Canadian than to be
					 part of a family whose father is a Mountie”. We are all part of that Canadian
					 family.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank Don McDermid and his wife Pat for their years
					 of service and love of Canada.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us remember the facts: the program called <i>Le
					 Canada du millénaire</i> and the heritage minutes for which former journalist
					 Robert Guy Scully was either co-producer or co-creative director served as
					 vehicles of federal propaganda.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Mr. Scully's production house, BCE Média, as
					 well as the CRB Foundation served as fronts for the federal government to
					 secretly channel funds from the Canada Information Office and Canadian Heritage
					 to pay for these pseudo information programs.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The response from the CBC's ombudsman partially
					 vindicates the complaint lodged by the Communications Union of Radio-Canada, by
					 recommending that in the future, there be a requirement for all of the funding
					 for information programs to be made public.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is only a small victory in the battle against
					 federal propaganda, since the Canada Information Office will have an annual
					 budget of between $30 million and $60 million dollars over the next three

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the aftermath of September 11, that trade is now in

					 Canadian exports that head south to the United States, the government acts like
					 nothing at all has changed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the government prepared to protect Canadian

	<b>Mr. Guy
					 St-Julien</b>:<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to the gold market and the Bank of
					 Canada's activities in this area: (<i>a</i>) what is the average daily volume
					 of transactions on the international gold markets; (<i>b</i>) since 1980, what
					 have been the key elements of the Bank of Canada's policy on the sale of gold
					 with respect to its international reserves; (<i>c</i>) since 1980, has the
					 government's gold sales program proved advantageous for the government; and
					 (<i>d</i>) if so, why?</p>


	<b>Mr. John McCallum (Parliamentary
					 Secretary to the Minister of Finance, Lib.)</b>: <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, with respect to (a), the daily turnover in
					 the international gold market is approximately six to seven million ounces per
					 day.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to (b), Canada has had a clear and
					 transparent policy since 1980 to sell gold at a gradual and controlled pace to
					 reduce the proportion of gold held in our official international reserves in
					 order to benefit Canadian taxpayers. Because gold is less liquid than many
					 other assets and earns a low rate of return, this policy has increased the
					 return on Canada’s reserve assets and increased their liquidity. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to (c), yes, the gold sales program has
					 been very profitable for the Government of Canada. Estimates show that, since
					 the beginning of the gold sales program, the income on reserve assets has been
					 more than U.S.$13 billion higher than if the gold stocks had been maintained.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to (d), proceeds from Canada’s gold sales
					 are used to purchase other foreign currency assets that yield higher returns.
					 These higher returns benefit Canadian taxpayers.</p>

	moved that Bill S-23,
					 an act to amend the Customs Act and to make related amendments to other
					 acts, be read the third time and passed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said: Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to take part in
					 this debate on Bill S-23. This bill is most important for the implementation of
					 our customs action plan.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The changes made in Bill S-23 are necessary to enable
					 us to put in place some of the key programs contained in this action plan.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last month's events make the passing of this bill even
					 more critical. As we know, the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency is ready to
					 implement quickly many of the initiatives contained in our action plan, but we
					 need this legislation.</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the terrorist attacks on the U.S., we have been
					 applying extreme vigilance at the border. This means increased examination of
					 goods, intensified questioning of travellers and reallocating our resources to
					 higher risk areas. We remain committed to continuing this extreme vigilance as
					 long as it is needed. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, even during this difficult time, we must
					 always be mindful of our dual mandate: to protect Canadians and to keep the
					 flow of travel and trade moving. Of course this mandate has posed many
					 challenges over the past month. Let me reassure the House that we are doing
					 everything we can to address them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also equally committed to long term solutions to
					 keeping Canada safe while ensuring that goods and people keep flowing across
					 the border.</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our action plan is indicative of this commitment and
					 desire to maintain the necessary equilibrium. Programs such as customs
					 self-assessment and the expedited passenger processing system cannot proceed
					 without this legislation, nor can other changes such as the customs control
					 zones.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Bill S-23 we will be able to make our borders more
					 efficient. It is the outcome of lengthy consultations. We have consulted the
					 stakeholders, our clients and our partners in the security and trade sectors.
					 Both sectors have supported our customs action plan and the amendments proposed
					 in Bill S-23.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now more than ever it is crucial to put Bill S-23 into
					 place so that the agency can continue to provide Canadians with the protection
					 they expect.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now more than ever it is indeed crucial to put Bill
					 S-23 into place, so that the agency can facilitate the continuation of trade
					 exchanges in order to ensure the Canadian economy of the activity it
					 needs.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as trade is concerned, we have consulted with
					 businesses and have understood that simplified trade administration policies
					 are needed. As for the travelling public, we were made aware of the importance
					 of uninterrupted travel without delays at customs.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The customs action plan is a critical investment in the
					 future and will allow us to remain one of the most modern border agencies in
					 the world. By providing innovative solutions to the problems we face today, the
					 plan ensures that our customs processes will not be an impediment to Canadian
					 prosperity.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As my hon. colleagues already know, the approach
					 outlined in the action plan, and which the provisions of Bill S-23 would put
					 into place, features a comprehensive risk management system incorporating
					 principles of self-assessment, advance information and pre-approval, all
					 supported by state of the art technology. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our risk management approach will be supported by an
					 effective and fair sanctions regime that imposes penalties according to the
					 type and severity of the infraction.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ultimately, businesses or individuals with good track
					 records should benefit from their history of compliance. The bill would give
					 them options that will make crossing the border easier, more convenient and
					 more productive.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of the action plan, we are introducing the
					 customs self-assessment program. The CSA program is one of the innovative ways
					 in which we are changing how we do business at the border. It is the direct
					 result of consultations with the trade community and was highlighted as its
					 number one priority.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The customs self-assessment program is based on the
					 principles of risk management and partnerships, partnerships with those clients
					 who have proven track records. The CSA program also streamlines the customs
					 clearance process bringing greater speed and certainty to the importation of
					 low risk goods.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be implemented in phases and will expand over
					 the years to include an ever increasing proportion of low risk import trade as
					 customs works in partnership with the import trade and other government
					 departments and agencies. Traders will welcome the provisions for advance
					 information and pre-approval programs contained in Bill S-23. I believe my hon.
					 colleagues will agree that this is a major step forward in border
					 management.</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The administrative monetary penalties system, AMPS,
					 described in the act is designed to ensure uniform and fair rules for all
					 Canadian businesses. This complete system will encourage compliance with the
					 legislation, thanks to a series of penalties that are proportional to the type
					 and severity of the offence.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to guarantee uniform application across
					 Canada, the penalties will be based on detailed policies and guidelines. This
					 graduated approach is more transparent and more equitable than the one in place
					 at the present time, and provides importers with the opportunity to solve
					 compliance problems long before the maximum penalty is applicable. In a desire
					 for fairness, the program will be subject to an independent recourse mechanism.
					 This program is intended merely to encourage compliance, nothing
					 more.</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compliance is the key to success in this endeavour and
					 Bill S-23 is designed to improve levels of compliance. Higher compliance levels
					 ultimately benefit our clients because they lead to fewer examinations and
					 audits.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that the improved service and streamlined
					 processing that we will be able to offer will provide incentives for voluntary
					 compliance. However, ever mindful of our twin mandate, the protection of
					 Canadian society, the agency reserves the right to do periodic spot checks and
					 audits to verify compliance with Canada's customs laws and
					 regulations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The passing of Bill S-23 would also bring exciting
					 options for travellers. Many of the hon. members will have heard of the Canpass
					 highway program which was pilot tested in a number of locations in recent
					 years. Under this permit based program, pre-approved, low risk travellers are
					 permitted to use designated lanes to bypass regular customs
					 processing.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The testing of this and other members of the Canpass
					 family of programs has demonstrated their viability and effectiveness. The
					 Customs Act amendments proposed in Bill S-23 would allow for the introduction
					 of these programs on a continuing basis across Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another good example is the expedited passenger
					 processing system for travellers. Under this new and innovative program, EPPS
					 participants will be able to use an automated kiosk that will confirm their
					 identity and membership in the program when entering Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These innovative pilot programs are working. We want
					 all Canadians and those who travel and trade here to be able to profit from our
					 progress.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another exciting initiative is the harmonized highway
					 pilot, also known as Nexus, at the Blue Water bridge in Sarnia, Ontario and
					 Port Huron, Michigan.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nexus' goal is to provide a seamless service to
					 pre-approved travellers entering Canada and the U.S. at these border points
					 using technology and of course a common card.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New programs, such as EPPS, will not only make clearing
					 customs a faster process but a more secure one. With new technologies, such as
					 iris scanners, only those who have been pre-approved by a thorough screening
					 process will benefit.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to clarify for my hon. colleagues that
					 pre-approval does not mean exempt. All participants in these programs are still
					 subject to random identification checks and examinations. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With technology such as x-rays and iris scanners along
					 with increased co-operation with our federal partners, we will be able to
					 ensure Canadians a secure yet effective customs screening process.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that a customs action plan will serve
					 Canadians well by improving the flow of people and goods across the border and
					 by strengthening our ability to protect Canadians. More people, with more of
					 the right tools and technology will strengthen our security, while maintaining
					 the flow of goods and people so vital to our economy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The agency is in the business of administering and
					 enforcing laws governing the movement of goods and people in and out of Canada.
					 It is also in the business of providing client service excellence and serving
					 the interests of Canadians overall. Using our new approach to customs
					 clearance, we will get as much information as possible before goods or people
					 arrive at the border, enabling the agency to focus on high risk areas.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, amendments to the Customs Act proposed in
					 Bill S-23 would allow for the introduction of advanced passenger information
					 and passenger notification record. With those programs, customs officers will
					 receive certain prescribed information from commercial transportation companies
					 on drivers, crew members and passengers in advance of their arrival in
					 Canada.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By receiving this information in advance customs
					 officers will be able to make enlightened decisions prior to the arrival of
					 goods and people. It will make it easier to facilitate the movement of
					 legitimate travellers and goods while allowing the agency to exercise its
					 protection mandate. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we modernize our border we will consider the
					 technological infrastructure a vital element of our customs action plan. The
					 agency will continue to conduct random customs examinations. The instincts of
					 trained, experienced customs officers will continue to be our guiding
					 force.</p>

	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The agency must be able to meet the growing needs of
					 travellers and of Canadian airports.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new design of certain airports offers the
					 possibility of mixing international and national travellers. This helps reduce
					 delays, which in turn helps increase airport profitability. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though this is an interesting option for both
					 travellers and airports, it increases the risk of goods being smuggled into
					 Canada. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed amendments contained in the bill would
					 enable the agency to meet the commercial needs of the Canadian aviation
					 industry as they evolve and to manage all the inherent risks.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed amendments would allow the agency to
					 create controlled areas inside airports and to authorize customs officers to
					 interview people and to search their personal effects when they leave those
					 controlled areas.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another provision of Bill S-23 will be used to ensure
					 that personal information is better protected. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill will be very explicit as to: when customs
					 officers can gather information; the exact type of information that can be
					 gathered; the use that can be made of this information; the circumstances and
					 the conditions under which this information can be disclosed; and the reasons
					 for disclosure. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to emphasize that the sole purpose of this
					 proposal is to codify something that already exists through the ministerial
					 authorization process and that is to make disclosure more open and more
					 transparent. </p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As my hon. colleagues know, an amendment is proposed in
					 Bill S-23 which would provide the CCRA with the authority to examine export
					 mail. This proposed amendment is necessary to ensure that the postal stream
					 does not become a legal means of bypassing Canada's export controls. I assure
					 hon. members that it is consistent with existing authorities and practices
					 relating to the charter and the import of mail. Customs officers will continue
					 to exercise their authority in a professional and proper manner within the
					 legislative framework. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government's agenda to promote trade and investment
					 in Canada will only achieve true success if it is supported by the customs
					 action plan and the amendments contained in Bill S-23. Bill S-23 provides a
					 bold and innovative framework to modernize Canada's border and border
					 processing procedures. </p>

				  </b>

	Madam Speaker, the reform of Canada customs has been
					 the subject of a huge and extensive period of consultation. We started some
					 years ago by consulting stakeholders, the department and customs officers.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said on numerous occasions, we can use technology
					 and programs like Canpass and the Canada customs self-assessment, but at the
					 end of the day customs officers are the key component of our customs system.
					 These are the people we rely on. We need their experience and expertise. We are
					 using technology to make sure that we will proceed with a much better risk
					 assessment and risk management system. We will make sure that our human
					 resources focus on where the risk is higher or unknown.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I met with the head of the union some weeks ago and I
					 told him that we must maintain an ongoing relationship in the sense that our
					 customs officials are working in the field and their advice is very important.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know that pre-clearance is part of our customs
					 action plan. It is one program that needs to be more efficient and effective.
					 We have looked at that question at airports. Pre-clearance could also be
					 established in other places as well. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as I said many times when referring to the
					 management of customs and the land border, it should include a high tech smart
					 border as well as co-operation with the United States.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is familiar with PALS, which is used on the front
					 lines at our border crossings. I have compared the system with that used south
					 of the border. The U.S. system ties indirectly and immediately with every
					 organization. PALS does not. It is way behind in that respect. It does not tie
					 in to CPIC, RCMP databases and a number of things that it should tie into,
					 particularly at this time. </p>

	Madam Speaker, that is an interesting question and I

					 customs officers would join the team shortly and be assigned to airports and
					 seaports. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also announced additional technology such as x-ray
					 machines, ion scanners and passport readers that are very effective. There is a
					 new generation of passport reader that we will be obtaining shortly.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The databanks that we have at Canada customs are a key
					 component of airport security, if that is what the member is talking about. The
					 announcement that I made will improve the databanks we have at airports. Our
					 customs officers at land borders access different databanks. There is a primary
					 inspection line and then a secondary inspection line is referred to that has a
					 variety of databanks.</p>

	Madam Speaker, it gives me pleasure to speak to Bill
					 S-23. I thank the minister for staying around to answer a few questions. In his
					 speech he referred to Canada customs as one of the most modern agencies in the
					 world. That is just not the case. That is reflected in his answer to my
					 question regarding PALS. He stated that there is an effort being made to
					 upgrade a number of systems, including PALS, that are used on the front
					 lines.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to refer to a number of things that I have
					 received in the past couple of months since becoming the critic for customs.
					 They deal with border crossings, seaports and airports. I will refer to some
					 documents but they are actually letters written to the minister. I know he has
					 received these letters because I gave him some on behalf of frontline officers,
					 the first line of defence, who are very unhappy for a number of reasons.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason I will refer to them is that I am a believer
					 that if someone wants to learn how things should be done, a good place to start
					 would be right on the front line with the people who deliver the service and
					 face the problems.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a problem in Canada with the government.
					 Everywhere I have been the border customs officers are doing a fantastic job
					 given what they have to work with. It is an utter shame that when we visit
					 these places we are denied the opportunity to talk with the frontline people
					 because of directives from the minister, other departmental heads and
					 commissioners. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I received letters that were written by an assistant
					 deputy minister and an acting assistant deputy minister. I have others from a
					 southern Ontario regional commissioner, an assistant commissioner and a
					 regional director. All these individuals are with customs. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of these letters states very strongly that
					 employees should refrain from making any direct, or through a third party,
					 public pronouncements critical of federal policies, programs and officers or on
					 matters of current political controversy. It states that employees are not
					 allowed to talk when others who are not of the government come to visit. The
					 final sentence in each of these documents states that if they choose to do so
					 they will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including
					 termination.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, customs officers, prison guards,
					 corrections officers, or those holding whatever job in a government department,
					 have strict orders not to speak their mind when people ask questions. When we
					 go to visit these people they are not allowed to answer questions. I get a pile
					 of letters from different individuals doing these jobs with the trust that I
					 will not use their names lest they face the consequences of having provided
					 information to me.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot believe that in a supposedly democratic
					 country when we are looking to the people at the front lines of defence at the
					 borders, in our prisons, or wherever they may be, for suggestions on what we
					 can do to make it easier for them to accomplish their mission, which is to
					 protect and provide security for Canadian soil, its people and its property,
					 they cannot openly discuss their views so that we can take them back, research
					 them and possibly come up with better legislation. They have received orders
					 from the government not to speak out in that nature to anyone.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During my last visit I was denied the opportunity to
					 visit with the front line people. We know what the supervisors will say. They
					 follow the rules very well. That is why they are supervisors. The higher up the
					 ladder they go the better they follow them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I walked through these areas it was a shame to see
					 the people on the front lines handing me notes urgently requesting that I call
					 them because they are desperate to speak with me. They really want to speak
					 with us yet are not allowed to. These people from all areas of the system wish
					 to voice some serious concerns.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The response I have heard from the government these
					 last few days during our two supply motions regarding the terrorist legislation
					 and aspects of Bill S-23 was that anything we suggest is simplistic. The
					 government's answer to everything is that it is too simplistic. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most simplistic thing I have ever seen in my life
					 is a government that was elected by the people to run the show yet in the House
					 of Commons openly admits that it does not, as the solicitor general did during
					 question period when he said he does not run his department. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is right. The government does not run the show but
					 the bureaucrats sure as dickens do. They hold an iron fist. There are a whole
					 pile of instructions from the bureaucrats to the frontline people ordering them
					 not to speak out or they may lose their jobs. Welcome to the democratic society
					 of Canada. It is disgraceful. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will point out how difficult it is to get our hands
					 on the information we desperately need to help make the situation at the border
					 safer and more secure, especially since September 11. This is the kind of
					 support the frontline people are crying out for. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada customs has been all about collection for years
					 and years. One customs officer said he was getting awfully tired of being
					 referred to as a grocery cop or a tax collector when one of his main functions
					 at the border has always been to provide safety and protection. However customs
					 officers work for a revenue agency which is good for collecting money. It is
					 the type of agency that will provide them with bulletproof vests and then give
					 them calculators. It does not make much sense.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is time to move out of collection and into
					 protection. Protection is what it is all about. That is the priority we see
					 across the country as a result of the events that took place on September
					 11.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where are we falling short? I pointed out to the
					 minister during our short question period that this piece of equipment, PALS,
					 is out of date. A few hundred yards down the road at the U.S. border the system
					 in place there is instantaneously tied into every agency that is essential for
					 a customs official to do his or her job. It immediately identifies the felons,
					 the murderers, the smugglers and those who are being sought for
					 kidnapping.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ours does not. That sends up a red flag. There is a
					 problem when we must detain and question a person for a few minutes while we go
					 into the main office and try to hook up to all the things we can to gather
					 information about what it is we are looking for. It is time to start bringing
					 things up to date.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have stood in the booth at the border and have been
					 shown how it works and what its shortfalls are. I know the equipment. We could
					 sit here and start talking again, as I know the member over there who is
					 shaking his head would like me to do, about what it is and what it is not.
					 Unfortunately I do not think most members over there spend their time in a
					 booth at the border to see what is really going on.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am tempted to paint Liberal all over my car some day,
					 although I would regret it dreadfully, and drive to the border so that I would
					 be welcomed with open arms and able to speak freely with all the people who
					 work there. If one is not a Liberal one cannot do that. They will not allow it.
					 The customs officers are gagged. The documents right here tell them loud and
					 clear that if they talk freely they will jeopardize their jobs.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was the principal of a school for many years. If I
					 wanted to know what we could do or change to make things work better in Grade
					 1, I did not go to the Grade 12 teachers. I went to those who were offering the
					 service. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the university training and all the elections one
					 could have would not change my view that if I wanted to know how to do things
					 right I should talk to the people who spend years providing the service and
					 putting their experience to work. These people look for the best solutions,
					 something the government refuses to do because its bureaucrats have all the
					 simplistic solutions. They are simplistic because they do not believe in
					 consulting with their frontline people.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long before September 11 the auditor general recognized
					 that with more than 100 million travellers a year entering the country at 147
					 border points and 13 international airports, the risks to Canada's safety and
					 security were extreme. He recognized it in his reports long before September
					 11. Last April the auditor general wrote that the main role of customs officers
					 was to protect Canadians against illegal activities such as smuggling of
					 contraband or the unlawful entry of inadmissible people. The audit raised
					 concerns about how well the risks were being managed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thought that comes to some people's minds,
					 including my own, is that if smuggling of contraband and dealing with criminals
					 and inadmissible people is the main thrust and primary function, should it be
					 done by a revenue collection agency like Revenue Canada? </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Customs officers are being asked to enforce the
					 criminal code. They are being asked to arrest drunk drivers. They are being
					 asked to arrest smugglers. They are being issued minimal equipment to do their
					 jobs. The government has upgraded that a little. It now gives them bulletproof
					 vests, most of which are used ones donated by the United States because we do
					 not have new ones.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The auditor general points out that if they are to
					 function in this capacity and enforce the criminal code it will not be easily
					 accomplished through an agency designed to collect taxes and revenues. He does
					 not suggest this point blank but he alludes to it. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do we not move it to an organization that has the
					 knowledge and ability to work with these people so they can do an effective job
					 of enforcing the law? That is what the majority of their work
					 entails.</p>


	<A NAME="T1550"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1550"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1555"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1545"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1550)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That would require upgrading of equipment. It would
					 require upgrading a number of things such as the number of people and hours of
					 training. Frontline officers south of the border in the United States have 16
					 weeks of training. That is more than a lot of basic training camps in the
					 military. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not so on this side of the border, certainly not
					 when it comes to hiring students to fill in for the people we have. These
					 students receive only two weeks of training yet their duties are the same. They
					 must enforce legislation brought forward by the government in Bill C-18, which
					 empowers them to arrest drunks and do everything they can to enforce the
					 criminal code.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will reiterate once again what happens. We have a
					 number of border crossings where there are only one or two people on duty. They
					 need to close these crossings at certain hours because they cannot keep them
					 open that long. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand the government will try to keep all border
					 crossings open 24 hours a day. It will need more people to do that. When
					 crossings are closed they put out little orange cones to block traffic. Would
					 that really stop someone from coming into the country who should not be here?
					 People are under the illusion that criminals, smugglers and people trying to
					 find their way into the country illegally do not know about that. They think
					 they will stick to our main points of entry. That is not the case.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When will we recognize that if we are to properly equip
					 and train our people to enforce the criminal code it could be better
					 accomplished under a different agency than a tax collection agency called
					 Revenue Canada? However the government has said that solution is simplistic.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been alluded to by a great number people,
					 including the auditor general, that there are serious concerns. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at the customs office in Victoria. That is
					 the famous port where Ahmed Ressam was arrested and finally caught on the U.S.
					 side after many years of operating out of Canada. At the Victoria port's main
					 terminal they do not have a single computer. They operate out of a 35 year old
					 trailer. They consult 30 year old lists on a clipboard about how to operate,
					 who to look for and what to do. There is no computer. With more than a million
					 people passing through the port a year, how can a clipboard do the job
					 properly?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will refer to some comments, not just one comment
					 from one person but some pretty general comments. First, people on the front
					 lines have talked about technology. Technology is extremely important and it
					 needs upgrading severely. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, we need more people at our borders. When we
					 consider the number of individuals we will need at Pearson and other
					 international airports, when we look at the 147 border crossings across the
					 country and all our major airports and seaports, 130 people is a drop in the
					 bucket. They need a lot more. They are understaffed by 10% to 50% in most
					 places across the land.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to look at eliminating the student program.
					 Members should not get me wrong. I believe in hiring students. It is important
					 that we keep students working and provide them an opportunity for work. However
					 when it comes to the security of the nation and all the training customs
					 officers require to do their job properly, many believe that students are not
					 the ones who can best fulfil the job. It needs to be done by trained
					 professionals, as it is today. We could eliminate the danger by eliminating
					 these kinds of programs.</p>


	<A NAME="T1555"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1555"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1600"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1550"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1555)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me read one quote to the House: “I would like to
					 talk about another aspect of my job, which is danger. Every day I go to work
					 could be the last day of my life. The customs and immigration part of my job
					 sees me interdicting persons smuggling high value drugs, firearms and weapons,
					 as well as inadmissibles, some of them criminals and terrorists from other
					 countries. Now I have the authority of a police officer and I am responsible
					 for arresting drivers who are drunk or high on drugs, persons abducting
					 children or persons with warrants for their arrest for a wide range of offences
					 right up to murder”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is quite astounding what is required of this
					 individual. He also said: “I basically deal with the same persons, goods and
					 situations that my armed colleagues on the other side of the border deal with.
					 As a result it would be prudent to assume that customs officers in Canada would
					 be subject to the same dangers faced by the law enforcement officers in the
					 United States”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I went to Fort Erie I noted the equipment issued
					 to the customs officers, like bulletproof vests, batons and pepper spray. They
					 had no sidearms. I went to the other side of the border where they were all
					 wearing sidearms and were equipped with whatever was necessary because they
					 have to deal with the criminal element. On the United States side of the
					 border, frontline individuals can speak with anyone at random. There are no
					 restrictions. They can speak with the press or anyone. They have the freedom to
					 do that, which we do not have on this side of the border thanks to the
					 government, which will not allow it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The officers in the United States first of all
					 commended the officers in Canada for doing a great job and for doing the best
					 they could with the equipment they have, but they fear daily for each and every
					 one of them and feel they are not in a position to look after themselves
					 properly.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our government in its wisdom must have recognized that,
					 because it put out regulations. Regulation 16, I believe, in the manual states
					 that in the event someone is coming into Canada and is showing signs of being a
					 real and sincere threat to our nation and its people or to the guards
					 themselves, they are to simply wish that person well and admit him or her into
					 the country then report it to the police. I do not know at how many ports of
					 entry where it might be at least half an hour or up to maybe two, three and
					 four hours before the police can even respond to the situation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know if members have seen this out west, but
					 in Ontario it is the same. People can come across these borders in these areas
					 and if they want to get lost for a while, boy, it is easy to do. They will not
					 be found. If they are, it will be well after the fact simply because the
					 customs officers do not have the backup or the proper equipment to make an
					 arrest when they should be able to. If there is a threat they have to let these
					 people go.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people working on the front lines do not like doing
					 that, because they recognize the fact that those people can run free and loose
					 forever. It is really hard for them to accept the fact that they have to let
					 people go who they know will cause real serious problems somewhere down the
					 line for some other people.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have talked to a number of individuals in regard to
					 some of our suggestions. My colleague from Edmonton, who is the chief critic
					 for customs and revenue, and I visited with a number of people from the union
					 representing the individuals we have talked about. We have talked to the police
					 association and their people. It is always strange: When people get together
					 who always seem to agree with the suggestions that we put forward in terms of
					 what is needed to enhance the bill or what is needed to make the anti-terrorism
					 bill better, they do not look upon the suggestions as being at all simplistic.
					 In fact they agree with them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They agree that customs and revenue should not be the
					 agency that is working with, controlling or managing the frontline officers or
					 customs officers at the borders. These jobs should not be under that portfolio.
					 They should be under a portfolio that deals with law enforcement. They are just
					 not allowed to arrest or detain people and they cannot use force against
					 them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not understand why the government has such a hard
					 time accepting the suggestions that come through the mail from these people who
					 are not allowed to voice their opinions when they would like to. They have to
					 white out their names and ask that their names not be used for fear of losing
					 their jobs.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of my colleagues have seen the same problem in
					 the coast guard and waterways are another area that needs to be addressed. When
					 we go to a waterway border crossing and look to the south, we see the American
					 coast guard going full scale in regard to protection. If we look to the north,
					 nothing is happening.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I once asked a supervisor how he knew what the boats
					 coming north were bringing in and what was happening. They do not know. Once
					 again, they can only report to the police and the police usually do not have
					 time to investigate because they are tied up with so many things. It is a
					 pretty sad situation when a customs official has to say that a boat docked at
					 one angle is probably carrying cigarettes, at another angle it is probably
					 carrying whisky, at another probably guns and at another probably people. That
					 is the best they can come up with. They simply do not have the forces to look
					 after the continual flow of boats coming in freely at different crossing
					 points, because we do not have officers patrolling those lines.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are continually looking for legislation to address
					 the needs. One of the needs of course is that we have to keep traffic flowing.
					 We do not want the economy to collapse because of not being able to move freely
					 across the borders. That is why we supported Bill S-23. It worked toward that
					 end. If we do not get our heads out of the sand, start looking across country,
					 recognize what the problems are and be willing to deal with them, we are headed
					 for some serious problems.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the government should make one thing happen. It
					 should be willing to allow the voices of the people trying to provide the
					 service to be heard. I will emphasize that more and more. If their voices could
					 only be heard to the fullest extent then we could come up with some very good
					 suggestions and solutions for the problems we face each and every
					 day.</p>


	<A NAME="T1605"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1605"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1610"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1600"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1605)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The morale of such individuals is terribly low and I
					 can understand why. They request something and it is not allowed. They write a
					 letter and they get a warning that they will lose their jobs if they do not
					 keep their mouths shut. Welcome to Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know the Liberals have a real hard time listening to
					 the truth. The truth is an aggravating thing, especially when a party is
					 operating a government that does not allow democracy to work. It is an absolute
					 shame. I just cannot express enough about what it is like to work for a
					 government agency where people's hands literally are handcuffed and their
					 mouths taped lest they lose their jobs. We should think about that for a
					 minute.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They do not have to worry about it on the other side of
					 the House. Maybe they will lose their jobs in an election but they can say
					 anything they like.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guards at the border crossings have asked me to
					 make certain that their voice is heard in all these respects. They do not enjoy
					 the idea of going to work improperly equipped. They do not feel safe in their
					 work. There are a number of issues that could be so much better if the
					 government would only listen.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also want to speak on behalf of the remote ports.
					 They are really crying out for help, with one person at one station all by
					 himself. We do not have anything there to address that person. There are many
					 of those crossings, all across the line.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to talk about the students once again. They are
					 trained for only two weeks, on average, yet they make up over half of the
					 customs workforce during the two busiest months of the year, July and August.
					 Half the workforce is students. There have been reports of shifts at Pearson
					 airport manned entirely by students. To my way of thinking and to a lot of
					 people's thinking, to have students as the first line of defence is a bit
					 terrifying. I just recently heard about a female student who intercepted an
					 individual crossing the border who had a gun. In the process of the student
					 checking the chamber of the gun, it discharged and the bullet lodged in the
					 building across the street. The students are not trained well enough in the
					 inspection of a gun. It went off, but that was a student. She is not to blame.
					 Sure, there should not have been a bullet in the chamber, but anybody who knows
					 anything about guns knows that is the first thing a person wants to know when
					 picking one up.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The auditor general's report referred to that. It also
					 said that at many ports relations are totally strained among customs,
					 immigration and other agencies and departments. When we add them together,
					 customs, immigration and other agencies and other departments, at these ports,
					 when they are strained to the degree that they are why are we not doing
					 something about it? We are putting on 130 people. That is hardly a drop.
					 </p>


	<A NAME="T1610"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1610"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1615"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1605"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1610)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A quality referrals report was recently produced by
					 immigration officers who were frustrated with the poor quality of referrals
					 from the primary inspection line that is staffed by students. They were having
					 a real problem because the expertise was not there to do the job
					 properly.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October 12, 17 of 29, or 60% of the officers on
					 duty, were students with two weeks of training. This is a common occurrence.
					 Week in and week out more than half the officers at Pearson are students. Our
					 immigration officers are pretty sick and tired of the poor quality of referrals
					 being sent to them. They are bogged down so badly that it is eating at their
					 time. They feel they are not able to properly handle their work.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1991 we learned that the immigration department
					 hired a contractor because the quality of referrals from the primary inspection
					 line were so poor. The Ekos report found that in August, a peak travel period
					 when a massive number of students is employed, more than 50,000 immigration
					 referrals to secondary inspections were missed. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not understand why the minister will not remove
					 students as a first line of defence or at least make provisions for them to be
					 properly trained. It should be more than two weeks of training.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to remind the House that in the past week the
					 American government has tripled its border workforce. The Americans increased
					 their officers by 5,400 people and their border patrol officers to 900 persons
					 along the Canada-U.S. border. Our minister announced last week the addition of
					 139 employees.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I look at this I can understand the disappointment
					 from the people on our side as to why this is not much of a priority. If the
					 Americans have information that indicates they need 5,400 people on the border,
					 what information do they have that we do not? Do the American officials
					 understand that our immigration policy is so weak that they must defend against
					 those travelling through Canada with the United States as their final
					 destination and getting prepared for that? They have a lot of reasons to think
					 that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to express one more time that terrorism is an
					 extremely serious situation. We have provided answers through consultation with
					 those on the front lines, as much as we could, and with the police associations
					 at every opportunity and they are on side with our suggestions. We have
					 consulted with other agencies that like what we have to say with regard to what
					 we should be doing. However, there are some people across the way who will not
					 listen. They do not listen. They like their simplistic solution of letting the
					 bureaucrats deal with it. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What else is new? I think that has been going on for 30
					 or 40 years. Once this government decides we ought to have a few reforms within
					 our own country that respect democracy to a better degree, we might see the
					 changes that are essential.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I look at what is happening today, it is tiring to
					 see day in and day out that respect for democracy by members across the way is
					 diminishing and that there is little or no concern for protecting our people
					 who are providing the service.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that some day the members on that side will wake
					 up and recognize that our first priority, particularly at this time, should be
					 protecting our country and providing security. I hope that one day they will
					 start acting on this.</p>

					 (Rivière-des-Mille-Îles, BQ): </b>

	Madam Speaker, I am pleased to speak to this important
					 bill, Bill S-23. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, I must say that I will not be using the
					 40 minutes allotted me, nor will I be inviting the member for Wild Rose to
					 share my time.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I was saying, Bill S-23 is an important bill. It is
					 vitally important but, unfortunately, it does not seem to interest my
					 colleagues in the House.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What needs to be understood is that we must at all
					 costs improve the flow of goods and people, as well as the movement of
					 travellers through customs at the Canadian and U.S. borders, but still maintain
					 complete security.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must also be recalled that, since 1991, the number
					 of vehicles crossing the border has increased by 11% a year because of free
					 trade and various other factors.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to illustrate just how much transportation has
					 changed in recent years, I will give a few statistics for the year ending
					 August 2001. They are quite recent.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of vehicles crossing border points using
					 bridges or tunnels between Canada and the United States between August 2000 and
					 August 2001 was 45,587,344 automobiles, 8,306,261 trucks and 348,639 buses, for
					 a total of 52,242,244 vehicles in all.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ambassador Bridge between Detroit and Windsor was
					 crossed by 8,592,000 vehicles, 3,332,960 of them trucks. I could go
					 on.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did not do the math, because I did not have a
					 calculator. With the volume of trucks and cars regularly crossing the border,
					 —I would estimate that this comes to over 50,000 cars a day using the tunnels
					 or bridges between Canada and the United States alone. I did not check the
					 other border points.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence the importance of rapid and effective movement
					 and good service at border points, so as not to hold up truckers and motorists
					 for hours on end. Hence the importance of seeing the real danger that exists in
					 transporting people: There must be security for people and for goods. Just
					 about anything can be taken past these border points. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite a few reservations, the Bloc Quebecois will be
					 supporting Bill S-23.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill S-23 is more than just sheets of paper, more than
					 words or a wish list. It is a bill. What is important? To be able to implement
					 the provisions of this bill. A piece of legislation with no one to enforce it
					 is worthless. We need bodies. Canada needs more customs officers. The number of
					 customs officers must absolutely be raised because of the heavy car and truck
					 traffic going through customs.</p>


	<A NAME="T1620"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1620"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1625"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1615"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1620)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As well, customs officers must be better trained in
					 order to enhance their skills and enable them to do their job better. They must
					 be provided with modern techniques. The Minister of Revenue referred to iris
					 readers to identify people. Is this wishful thinking or reality?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why we presented an amendment at the report
					 stage asking the minister to come before the Standing Committee on Finance a
					 year after the bill is enacted to tell us “This or that thing is not going at
					 all well, can it be changed?” Thought must be given to the conditions in which
					 we have been living since September 11. If things were normal, perhaps nothing
					 would have to be changed, but the conditions are far more serious.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other question I have is this: how are our
					 neighbours to the south, our American neighbours, going to see Bill S-23? Only
					 this past weekend, hon. members will recall, New York state Senator Clinton was
					 at Champlain, which is very close to Montreal. She spoke of a total perimeter
					 for all of the Americas, with customs control and points of entry and exit at
					 customs. That is not the position of the government across the way.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is time to start thinking of a common ground. All we
					 need is modern and efficient equipment, adequate numbers of staff and staff
					 that is efficient and well trained, as well as a rapid information exchange
					 system among all departments, in order to determine precisely which individuals
					 are considered a low, medium or high risk. Customs officers must have the tools
					 and information right at hand in order to function effectively. Otherwise, the
					 paper on which Bill S-23 is written will merit nothing more than a fast trip to
					 the round file, file 13.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope with all my heart that Bill S-23 will
					 successfully improve border crossings and border security. The Bloc Quebecois

					 (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern Shore, NDP):
				  </b>

	Madam Speaker, I rise with great pleasure to discuss
					 Bill S-23.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I represent the Halifax airport and one of the concerns
					 I have is that many times the Halifax airport authority has asked the transport
					 minister and the revenue minister about getting pre-clearance at the airport.
					 This is something that the Ottawa airport, the Vancouver airport and other
					 airports have. It is vital to the movement of U.S.A. passengers for them to
					 have the convenience of being pre-cleared through the Halifax airport very
					 quickly and expeditiously to the United States. All the authority is asking for
					 is fairness, something that other airports in Canada have. In fact other
					 airports that do not have it will probably be seeking this as well. We hope the
					 minister, or at least his department, will take that under advisement to see
					 how we can very quickly move that issue forward.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, when any bill of this nature comes forward it
					 does absolutely no good unless it has full consultation with and support of the
					 men and women at customs, the frontline workers, more or less the unionized
					 workers. Again we encourage the government to ensure that the union is in
					 lockstep with this measure, to ensure that union voices are heard, to ensure
					 that their concerns have been brought forward as well.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister mentioned that there are about 130
					 additional employees being hired. In reality, within two years probably 300 to
					 400 employees will be lost through retirement. Therefore those losses will not
					 have been offset at all. It would be prudent of the minister to go on a serious
					 recruiting drive to encourage young people to get into the customs field and to
					 become highly trained. The numbers should be in the 1,200 to 1,500 range, which
					 is what is required to meet the new security measures post-September
					 11.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter what program we put in place we have to make
					 sure that the movement of perishable goods, especially just in time goods, is
					 not hindered by the actions on September 11. It is imperative as the two
					 economies become more closely linked that the movement of goods and services is
					 done correctly, quickly and efficiently and that both sides of the border are
					 respected by both governments.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My former colleague, Mr. Peter Mancini from Cape
					 Breton, raised in the House many times the divestiture of ports police in
					 Canada to the normal city police, as was done in Vancouver, British Columbia
					 and in my hometown of Halifax.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We argued at the time that it was wrong to do that. We
					 felt that the ports police had to be specialized, a separate unit on its own,
					 in tandem with government. The last time I heard any statistics on it, customs
					 or the police check about 2 out of every 100 containers that come into the
					 Halifax port. That is simply not good enough and is insufficient to say the
					 least. We encourage the government to rethink that policy of the divestiture of
					 ports police. It should reinstate the ports police, give them the training,
					 adequate resources and personnel that is required so we can ensure that the
					 goods and services that enter into our ports are properly checked and
					 screened.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am appalled that not so much the minister but his
					 department would put a gag order on senior officials of the customs and excise
					 union. It is simply unacceptable in this day and age of co-operation, open
					 dialogue and transparency. “I want to be clear on what I would like to do” is
					 what we always hear from the government front bench. At the same time that the
					 ministers talk about openness and transparency, they tell their officials to
					 put gag orders on the senior officials of the union.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a letter from Serge Charette, the national
					 president of CEUDA, to the revenue minister, dated October 5. It clearly states
					 that the union would like the gag order removed from its employees and
					 rescinded. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I seek unanimous consent from all
					 parties of the House of Commons to table the letter from the union to the
					 minister so that it can be on the public record.</p>

					 PC/DR): </b>

	Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak to Bill
					 S-23.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say to the member who spoke previously that we
					 certainly would have supported the tabling of that document. We think that
					 access to information is an important aspect of parliament.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bill is an act to amend the Customs Act and to
					 make related amendments to other acts. We actually supported the bill
					 throughout and thought that it had a lot of good practical ideas, until
					 September 11, which made the whole thing obsolete in our opinion. It did
					 propose a lot of good changes and enhancements to the systems that would
					 expedite the process at border crossings and so on and so forth.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The events of September 11 in our opinion make Bill
					 S-23 obsolete. The total focus is on our borders now. There is a great debate
					 about whether we will have perimeter security, which I think we will have
					 eventually. There is a great debate about increasing staff at border crossings,
					 enhancing the procedures of control and assessment, increasing the focus on
					 examining goods, services and people and identification at borders. It makes
					 all of these things that were created to fast track and expedite border
					 crossing obsolete until we finish the great debate on the philosophy of how we
					 will treat our borders as a whole. Right now there is a proposal to increase
					 funding by a lot for our borders.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand a second omnibus bill is being drafted to
					 deal with terrorism. That one will focus on transportation issues and border
					 issues. Bill S-23 will be superseded by that omnibus bill in many ways. We
					 should shelve Bill S-23 for the time being until we see what the government
					 puts on the table in the proposed omnibus bill. We have not seen it yet. We
					 have just heard talk and conjecture about it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government is debating whether or not to consider a
					 perimeter security system. The Americans will surely have a perimeter security
					 system and we will be either inside or outside the system. Whatever decision is
					 made will have a big impact on how we deal with our borders. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many politicians in the U.S., such as the president,
					 the vice-president, many senators and governors of states, have indicated that
					 they want changes to the border crossing system. They have suggested that
					 Canada is a safe haven for terrorists. We do not agree. However, they have
					 certainly indicated that they have concerns about our border crossing systems.
					 They will demand that we make changes, not the changes that are in Bill S-23
					 but other changes. If the bill goes through, we will go through a major series
					 of changes to our border crossings and then we will have to do it all over
					 again.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The U.S. has already tripled its staff at border
					 control points which is an indication of the changes that are about to take
					 place. Now Mexico is into the discussion about the perimeter security system.
					 If the United States and Mexico are to have a perimeter security system, then
					 Canada must be a part of that. I believe we eventually will be a part of it,
					 which again will make many aspects of Bill S-23 obsolete.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last few days the official opposition has
					 proposed motions that change job descriptions and functions at the border
					 crossings. The official opposition has proposed that we change all the things
					 in Bill S-23, completely reverse many positions, turn customs officers into law
					 enforcement officers, remove the tax collection function from customs officers
					 and give it to a whole new enforcement agency and so on and so forth. That is
					 an indication of the changes we are facing.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Business groups, chambers of commerce, boards of trade
					 and provincial premiers are also calling for changes at the borders which do
					 not necessarily coincide with Bill S-23. We should put the whole bill on hold
					 until we assess what we will do as a country and how we will treat the overall
					 security system, the overall border system and our relationship with the United
					 States.</p>


	<A NAME="T1630"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1630"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1635"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1625"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1630)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essentially there will be a revolution on how we deal
					 with border crossing issues and because of September 11, everything will be
					 different. Everything is different now. Much of our trade is halted at the
					 border because of delays caused by examinations. I do not expect the United
					 States government to agree that the aspects of Bill S-23 will expedite the
					 smooth crossing of traffic and trade at the border and allow things to go back
					 and forth freely. That is not going to happen. Bill S-23 in that way is a
					 little obsolete.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perimeter security is inevitable and Canada has to be
					 part of it. Eighty-five percent of our business travels back and forth between
					 the United States and Canada. The amount was as high as $250 billion in 1999.
					 The bill was drafted prior to September 11, in a whole different world and
					 under a whole different set of circumstances. In many ways we think it would be
					 a waste of time to proceed with all of these changes, some of which were really
					 good prior to September 11 and some of which may still be good. However, if the
					 U.S. does not agree with them and they are not part of its overall vision it is
					 going to be very difficult to proceed with them and we will have to bring in
					 another bill to reverse or change them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill should be shelved until these matters are
					 dealt with and an agreement is made, even a fundamental decision as to whether
					 or not we are going to be part of a perimeter security system and whether or
					 not Mexico is going to be part of that system. There is no point in going ahead
					 with these major changes if we are going to be faced with another series of
					 changes, which we will be for sure. This is not a matter of if we are going to
					 change our systems and procedures at the border crossings, it is a matter of
					 when and how. We are going to change them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill S-23 should be held off until we know exactly what
					 the government's philosophy and position is. Until that happens, we would like
					 to see the bill shelved.</p>

	Madam Speaker, I appreciated the hon. member's speech.
					 I share his concern about the security aspect of the bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously much of the consultation that was done on the
					 bill prior to September 11 focused specifically on trade and did not focus on
					 the issue of security as adamantly as we would like to see, especially after
					 the events of September 11. To my understanding, the minister in his
					 consultations did not meet with any security groups other than the customs
					 union. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The U.S. recently has been talking very seriously about
					 invoking section 110, which in fact could completely stop trade going south of
					 the border from Canada because of exit controls and a number of other things
					 that the U.S. may implement. There is talk of this being implemented over the
					 next couple of years. What is the hon. member's impression of the impact that
					 could have in the end on our trade going south of the border?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he knows, 84% of our exports go down to the United
					 States. I think our concern, and I am sure it is the hon. member's concern as
					 well, is that if section 110 is invoked because we have not addressed the
					 security issues as seriously as we should have in this bill, our industry will
					 still suffer the consequences of a lack of security at the border. </p>

				  </b>

	Madam Speaker, that is an excellent
					 question.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot separate trade from security in our
					 relationship with the United States. Eighty-four per cent of our trade is with
					 the United States. Every truck, every shipment, everything that goes across the
					 border involves security. Many aspects of Bill S-23 deal with allowing trucks
					 to flow freely back and forth without inspection at the border by arranging for
					 prior inspections. This is absolutely contrary to the atmosphere now in the
					 United States and in Canada. We are not talking about expediting transportation
					 now. We are talking about increased security. That is just the
					 opposite.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many aspects of Bill S-23 were to allow for
					 electronically transmitted information and pre-clearance based on profiling and
					 audits on previous business and things like that. We have to come to an
					 understanding with the United States on whether or not it is going to accept
					 that philosophy prior to passing any bill, either Bill S-23 or the proposed
					 omnibus bill that we hear hints of from the government, which will deal with
					 transportation issues. It is supposed to be the second bill after the terrorism
					 bill, Bill C-36. We understand it is coming, that it is being drafted now. We
					 have not seen it yet, but many aspects of it will impact on Bill
					 S-23.</p>

					 Canadian Alliance): </b>

	Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak in qualified
					 support for Bill S-23. I would like to make it abundantly clear from the outset
					 that the Canadian Alliance strongly believes in free trade and that is why we
					 support the trade liberalization initiatives included in Bill S-23. We do not
					 share the revenue minister's opinion, however, of this new vision of Canada
					 Customs. We believe it is a myopic vision dangerously lacking in the tools,
					 resources and legislation to provide adequate national security. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The official opposition is supporting the legislation
					 in an effort to support the revenue minister during this time of crisis. He has
					 assured Canadians that heightened security initiatives are forthcoming. We take
					 him at his word and will be most vigilant in holding him to it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue of border security is of utmost importance to
					 Canadians, especially those whose livelihoods are contingent upon trade with
					 the United States. Any slowdown at the border jeopardizes Canadian jobs and
					 subsequently the mortgages, college funds, retirement savings and purchasing
					 power needed to keep our economy strong and prosperous. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I stood in this place during the emergency debate on
					 September 17 and spoke of the need to address our border security, not only to
					 strengthen our borders but also to appear to be strengthening our borders. The
					 reason for this was to head off any accusations by the United States that
					 Canada was complicit in the events of September 11.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several members of the U.S. congress and senate have
					 targeted the Canadian border as a sieve for terrorists and a threat to the U.S.
					 national security. These members were quite influential in passing section 110
					 of the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of 1996.
					 This part of the omnibus bill aims to strengthen U.S. border security and
					 reform the process of refugee and asylum determination by implementing a system
					 of entrance and exit controls for all aliens travelling to the United States,
					 including Canadian nationals.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill was passed in 1998 but implementation of
					 section 110 has yet to occur. However, in the aftermath of September 11
					 discussions are beginning to take place regarding the initiatives included in
					 section 110.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the <i>National Post</i>, James Ziglar,
					 the commissioner of the U.S. immigration and naturalization service, told the
					 U.S. senate this week that he planned to put the entry-exit system in place at
					 airports and seaports by 2003 and at the 50 largest land entry points by
					 2004.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said that the collecting the data and using it
					 electronically was important for U.S. security as part of anti-terrorist
					 legislation, called the U.S.A. act, which was approved by the U.S. senate and
					 house of representatives. The bill would also triple the number of border
					 patrol agents to 900 along the 6,440 kilometre Canada-U.S. border and boost the
					 number of INS inspectors to 5,319 from 1,723.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An increase in processing time at the border will have
					 a disastrous effect on the Canadian economy. I do not need to remind this
					 government that 87% of Canadian exports go to the U.S. while only 25% of
					 American trade is with Canada. Presently Canada is the U.S.'s largest trading
					 partner, but President Bush has made no secret of his desire to help develop
					 and expand the Mexican economy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mexico has the potential to surpass Canada as a market
					 for American goods. In other words, the U.S. can afford to slow down the stream
					 of trade crossing the Canada-U.S. border in the interests of national
					 security.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a time of war, when emotions and patriotism abound,
					 the rhetoric of the U.S. politicians toward Canada is being met with a
					 groundswell of public support.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada and the U.S. are democratic countries. We share
					 a common border. Our professional sports teams play in the same leagues. Our
					 economies are integrated. However Canadians are asking why our border policies
					 are so different. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canada-U.S. border is a clash of fundamental
					 philosophies. In the U.S., the customs service believes its primary mandate is
					 enforcement whereas the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency believes its primary
					 mandate is to liberalize trade restrictions and collect revenues. The U.S.
					 customs service considers itself the nation's primary border security agency.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One official stated “When we short changed customs we
					 short changed America's security”. Where is that sentiment here in Canada? I do
					 not believe that Canadian values are any less worthy of protection. I believe
					 that our citizens are just as worthy to feel safe and secure in their own homes
					 as Americans. Why is the government so opposed to national security
					 initiatives?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that part of the problem stems from Canadian
					 complacency. We live next to the world's largest military power and have taken
					 for granted that it will always protect us. Prior to September 11, the Liberal
					 government lived in a state of denial regarding terrorism in Canada. Our
					 American neighbours have been much more vigilant, which is reflected in the
					 mandate of its customs officers. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other part of the problem is that we have a Prime
					 Minister so concerned with his legacy that he has been more interested in
					 securing his re-elections than securing our borders. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We hear a lot about Canada's porous borders. I know I
					 have used that phrase myself. This phrase is by no means a reflection of our
					 customs officers, rather of the role the government has decided for
					 them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to take this opportunity to thank our
					 customs officers who, in the aftermath of the September 11 terrorist attacks,
					 have been under incredible pressure, working extra long hours to thoroughly
					 interrogate thousands of travellers seeking entrance into Canada. They are
					 doing a tremendous and extremely valuable job with limited human, technological
					 and financial resources.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has to make up its mind as to what role
					 customs officers should serve. If it is in fact the first line of defence, then
					 the government should provide sidearms. If it is tax collection, then it should
					 provide a calculator.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many border crossings are staffed with only one
					 officer. These crossings are often not hooked up to computer networks and in
					 some cases are dozens of miles away from the nearest police
					 detachment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in the Alliance believe there should be an immediate
					 network hookup of computers and of all customs software at all ports of entry
					 into Canada. It is unacceptable for some customs officers in ports across
					 Canada to have limited access or no access to electronic customs systems which
					 provide intelligence and support to customs officers who must undertake
					 interdiction and detention decisions and actions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Customs officers at points of entry have been given
					 peace officer status to detain drunk drivers and enforce other criminal code
					 violations. All customs officers should have the power to detain individuals
					 who are violent or suspicious. It is customs policy to allow all individuals to
					 enter our country even if they are violent or suspicious, then contact the
					 local RCMP detachment. Our remote customs crossings are not secure when the
					 local RCMP detachment is hours away.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our customs officers are proud to be on the front
					 lines. In many cases morale is quite low as a result of the day to day
					 operations at our borders. Our officers do everything they can to protect our
					 borders. Many take specialized training to apprehend contraband, save abducted
					 children and make other vital interventions. These same specialists are then
					 joined on the border by summer students who have gone through an abbreviated
					 two week training period before being put out on the front lines to screen
					 people seeking entry to Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am fully in favour of student job initiatives.
					 However I would not be in favour of student summer police officers. Why?
					 Because they are not adequately trained to protect the public or themselves.
					 The same is true for our border guards.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the customs union president appeared before the
					 committee, he spoke of an incident where a student had intercepted a handgun
					 from a traveller but was unable to unload the weapon. Unfortunately, the weapon
					 went off as the student was handing it back to the person who had brought the
					 weapon across the border. A shot was fired and the bullet hit a building.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The union has complained to CCRA officials repeatedly
					 over the student program. Recently one of the union vice-presidents was
					 preparing to meet with U.S. customs officials to discuss border problems. CCRA
					 managers threatened to fire this VP if he even met with U.S. officials. What
					 does the CCRA have to hide that it would threaten to terminate this union rep's
					 job?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the CCRA is trying to hide the fact that it
					 has no expertise or interest in security issues. The U.S. customs agency
					 believes that its primary function is law enforcement, whereas Canada customs
					 claims to have a dual mandate of processing revenues and border security. The
					 Canadian Alliance believes that a greater focus on security is required in
					 order to harmonize custom standards with the United States which cannot be
					 achieved within the CCRA. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill S-23, which is lauded as the new vision for Canada
					 customs, is the product of months of consultations. With the exception of the
					 Union of Customs Employees, all the consultations took place with trade and
					 tourism representatives. As no security or protection experts were consulted,
					 it can be concluded that the CCRA is not concerned with border security and
					 therefore Canada customs must be moved out of the tax collection agency and
					 under the purview of the law enforcement department of the solicitor
					 general.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I spoke at length on this issue during our supply day
					 motion yesterday so I will direct my comments to the initiatives included in
					 Bill S-23.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said at the beginning of my speech, we support
					 many of the trade liberalization initiatives within Bill S-23, in particular
					 the advance passenger information system that allows carrier manifests to be
					 thoroughly scrutinized prior to arrival.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Alliance has called for similar
					 initiatives in the past, including overseas interdiction programs and the use
					 of digital photography and scanning of traveller documentation to ease in
					 determining the identity of spontaneous refugee claimants who arrive in Canada
					 without documentation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other initiatives we support are the customs controlled
					 areas where arriving passengers are segregated from airport personnel and the
					 travelling public prior to interrogation. We believe this will help stop the
					 transfer of documents and packages that have circumvented customs inspection in
					 the past.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canpass and Nexus programs will hopefully alleviate
					 some traffic congestion once Canada invests in infrastructure improvements at
					 our ports of entry and throughout our trade corridors. We are disappointed,
					 however, with the lack of reciprocal programs in the United States. It seems we
					 are doing everything to help exporters gain access to Canadian markets but
					 little to help Canadians access American markets. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is where Bill S-23 truly fails. The omission of
					 comprehensive security measures and the omission of measures to harmonize
					 customs regulations with the United States is a missed opportunity to secure
					 our U.S. trade links and stabilize our economy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other areas of concern in the bill include the
					 administrative monetary penalty system, or AMPS, in conjunction with the driver
					 registration program which do not take into account the vast turnover in
					 drivers experienced by the trucking industry. The inclusion of a mandatory
					 review procedure would have ensured that the penalty regime was not injurious
					 to the realities of the industry. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in the opposition allowed the legislation to be fast
					 tracked in order to provide the minister with the resources needed to respond
					 to September 11. As a result, we have abdicated our responsibility to
					 thoroughly scrutinize the legislation. </p>


	<A NAME="T1655"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1655"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1700"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1650"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1655)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am calling on the government to co-operate with the
					 stakeholders who may be adversely affected as a result of the legislation, to
					 commit to an independent review in the near future to study the legislation's
					 impact in expediting trade and to gauge the re-allocation of departmental
					 resources from low risk to high risk assessment. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In times of crisis we must never neglect our
					 responsibility to those who have entrusted us with the task of creating just
					 and sound laws. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will take this opportunity to plead my case once
					 again in favour of a continental security perimeter. The free trade agreement
					 and NAFTA involved harmonizing Canada's tariff and duty regulations with its
					 North American neighbours. Our nation has prospered as a result of our
					 proximity to and trade with the United States. Eighty-seven per cent of our
					 trade crosses into the U.S. and untold jobs and livelihoods are contingent upon
					 strong, uninhibited trade with the U.S. and Mexico.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next logical phase in NAFTA is to protect the
					 trading relationship by harmonizing our security regimes. A continental
					 security perimeter is a fancy name for knowing who is in our country. In order
					 to keep the flow of goods, people and capital across our internal borders, we
					 must more vigilant at screening and tracking those entering North America. A
					 perimeter does not surrender any of Canada's independence to the United States
					 nor does it remove our decision making ability here at home.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can have a made in Canada solution to the
					 continental security perimeter. Last week B.C. premier Gordon Campbell came to
					 Ottawa on behalf of eight provincial premiers and two territorial leaders to
					 urge the Prime Minister to pursue a perimeter initiative with the United
					 States. The Canadian business community, including the CNR, has been calling
					 for the same thing.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So too has the Coalition for a Secure and Trade
					 Efficient Border. However it is trying not to use the term North American
					 security perimeter because of the negative reaction the phrase has drawn from
					 the Liberal government. It does support the idea of trying to secure North
					 America by checking goods and people at entry points to the continent rather
					 than when they cross the Canada-U.S. border.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge the members opposite to take seriously the
					 recent developments in Washington, D.C. Exit and entrance controls at the U.S.
					 border will have ripple effects across every community in Canada. If these new
					 U.S. border policies are a veiled threat, I suggest we heed it, for there is
					 nothing to be lost by being part of a North American security perimeter but
					 there is everything to be lost from being outside an American security
					 perimeter.</p>

					 to the Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
				  </b>

	Madam Speaker, I did not intend to rise because I
					 support the bill, as I know the member does although he qualified his support,
					 but he commented on a couple of items on which I really need
					 clarification.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the points he made was that there should be
					 better co-ordination between Canada and the U.S. in terms of our border
					 efforts. If his concern, his objective, is that we have better controls with
					 regard to people coming into Canada, then what he is basically saying is that
					 we should co-ordinate our efforts with the Americans who let people into their
					 country under their standards. He wants us to apply the same standards but he
					 is trying to fix a problem where we are letting people into Canada whom he
					 feels are undesirable but who have met the U.S. standards.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is actually a contradiction to say that if we
					 co-ordinate with the U.S., which is to go to their standards, that somehow we
					 will fix the problem. The problem is that the people who come into Canada from
					 the U.S. got through its system just by the fact that they were residents and
					 legally in the United States.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member threw out the comment about undocumented
					 refugees. I do not want to get into all that but the member knows that 50% of
					 the applicants for refugee status present themselves at the Canada-U.S. border.
					 In other words, those people have entered the United States, have been accepted
					 as legitimate applicants and have been released on their own recognizance. They
					 are not in detention.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we co-ordinate our efforts does he not believe there
					 is a contradiction simply from the standpoint that the U.S. does not provide
					 housing, social assistance, legal assistance or anything Canada that provides?
					 Naturally a significant portion of those who claim refugee status in the United
					 States will present themselves at the Canada-U.S. border for refugee status
					 here simply because we do provide support to those who we believe are
					 legitimate refugees and we do give them an opportunity to establish
					 that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point I am trying to make is that it appears there
					 is a contradiction. If the problems are being imported from the United States
					 why would we want to change our standards to those of the United
					 States?</p>

				  </b>

	Madam Speaker, it is obvious that when government
					 members are listening to speeches, especially constructive speeches from this
					 side of the House, they like to make topsy-turvy interpretations of things that
					 do not even exist in speeches that are given.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would love the opportunity to clarify, especially on
					 the question that was asked. Throughout my speech I spoke about the importance
					 of moving forward, especially since the September 11 disaster that we all
					 witnessed. I also spoke about the importance of harmonizing systems so that we
					 have more effective security measures at the border. Whether it is on the U.S.
					 side or on the Canadian side, it is still in our best interest to work with the
					 U.S.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That does not mean we have to adopt the systems that
					 are in place in the U.S. and no one has even suggested that. I think that is
					 where the government has completely failed. We need to look at our problems
					 here at home and seriously find ways to improve certain situations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one is disputing the fact that our humanistic
					 refugee settlement program is one of the most wonderful programs in the world
					 but it should be tightened up so that it serves incoming refugees and existing
					 refugees in country more effectively. I do not think we would find any
					 opposition to that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My family came here as refugees. Our community in
					 Canada looked into ways to improve the system for potential refugees so that
					 legitimate refugees were let in under the settlement program but potential
					 refugees who would abuse the system were shut out. That is where the problem
					 lies.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is obvious that this particular member has not taken
					 the time to see what is happening at Canada's borders. I recently visited one
					 of the border crossings in southern Alberta which already had a plan in place
					 to build a new facility that will house both U.S. customs and Canada Customs
					 and Immigration on separate floors in the same building. There will be an
					 increased effort to work together at that particular port and others.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does it not make sense that we in the House should be
					 leading the way for the facilitation of systems and information that could work
					 for both sides of the border and improve our border security? We have to
					 remember that the reason for border security is not only to protect Canadians
					 but to allow trade to continuously flow, especially since it is in the best
					 interest of this country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I encourage the member to make a shift in his thinking
					 and allow a review of the system so we can see where improvements need to be
					 made and where we can work more positively and constructively with the United
					 States to harmonize systems that can work in the interests of all citizens
					 whether they live in Canada or in the U.S. Obviously if we want to protect our
					 trade and we should be doing that. We should not be playing games when we are
					 trying to protect Canadian lives and Canadian trade.</p>

	Madam Speaker, before I ask the question, I am sure the
					 member would support my call on the House to give personal congratulations to
					 the Minister of Veterans Affairs for finally resolving the issue of the
					 Buchenwald veterans.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know that the Minister of Veterans Affairs is
					 going through his personal concerns but for him to lead the way in getting this
					 issue dealt with I believe deserves a round of applause from all of us in the
					 House of Commons for his great efforts to resolve that issue for those heroes
					 of Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have two quick questions for the member for
					 Edmonton--Strathcona. Would he not believe that pre-clearance at airports,
					 which most airports are calling for, is a very important thing in Canadian
					 airports to facilitate and expedite the transfer of American passengers or
					 American bound passengers to the United States? Would he and his party not
					 believe in the New Democratic position that the ports police in Canada should
					 be brought back as a separate unit working in conjunction with other forces
					 within the country?</p>

				  </b>

	Madam Speaker, those are both relevant questions and I
					 would say that the Alliance would concur with both of those positions of the
					 NDP.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pre-clearance is obviously a solution that would help
					 deal with the flow of traffic at the airports. If proper security checks were
					 put in place, the identities of passengers bound anywhere, especially if they
					 were travelling through Canada, could be checked to make sure they were the
					 same people with the same information they had when they got on the plane at
					 the point of origin. Our party would obviously that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea of ports police has been raised by a number of
					 our colleagues who have ridings, as does my hon. colleague, in places where
					 there are large bodies of water. With the loss of the ports police, some of
					 those ports have not been patrolled as effectively as they should, which has
					 been of great concern to a number of our colleagues. We would like to see some
					 direction maybe even pointed to that. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. member raised perfect questions that basically
					 addressed the fact that we in this place have to make some serious decisions
					 over the course of the next months and should be continuously making these
					 decisions on how to prioritize our spending most effectively, especially in
					 times of crisis, but also on how to provide adequate security for all
					 Canadians. If that means putting in measures like pre-clearance and ports
					 police, then let us really look at ways to do that within our budgets and
					 within our means and allocate those resources effectively. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the factors to be considered. On July 20,
					 1998, Superior Propane announced that it was about to formalize an agreement
					 with ICG from Petro-Canada. Some three weeks later the competition commissioner
					 commenced the inquiry into the transaction as is required under law for all
					 merger reviews. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December 1, 1998, the commissioner applied to the
					 Competition Tribunal for an interim order to prevent the completion of the
					 transaction. The tribunal rejected the application and the parties completed
					 the transaction.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The commissioner filed to obtain a divestiture order
					 from the tribunal under section 92 of the Competition Act that would have
					 Superior divest itself of ICG. On December 11 the tribunal issued a hold
					 separate order pending its decision. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the period of time from December 11, 1998 to August
					 30, 2000 the tribunal announced in a rather interesting landmark precedent
					 setting decision based on section 96 that it was dismissing the application
					 brought forward by the competition commissioner under section 92. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It found that the merger was likely to prevent
					 competition in Atlantic Canada and lessen competition substantially in many
					 local markets and for national account customers. The majority of the tribunal
					 dismissed the application brought by the competition commissioner pursuant to
					 section 92 on the grounds that the respondents had been successful in
					 demonstrating their efficiency defence in accordance with section
					 96.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The commissioner appealed that finding. I introduced
					 the first bill on October 17. On April 4, 2001, on the request of the
					 competition commissioner the Federal Court of Appeal allowed an
					 appeal.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the decision on that date the court ruled that the
					 tribunal incorrectly applied the efficiency defence in section 96 of the
					 Competition Act. It found that according to the tribunal the fact that the
					 merged entity of Superior and ICG would eliminate all consumer choice and
					 remove all competition in the propane supply market, as it is likely to do in
					 Atlantic Canada, is not an effect that legally can be weighed under section 96
					 against the inefficiency gains in the merger. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Justice Evans looked at the decision and stated that
					 such a conclusion seemed so at odds with the stated purpose of the act, namely
					 to maintain and encourage competition and the statutory objectives to be
					 achieved thereby, as to cast serious doubt on the correctness of the tribunal's
					 interpretation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The federal court effectively ordered that the matter
					 be remitted to the tribunal for determination and in effect to rehear the
					 case.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his case the competition commissioner stated that
					 the court agreed the efficiency defence was not intended to sanction mergers
					 that result in a monopoly or a near monopoly without taking the impact on
					 consumers into consideration. The issue was then appealed by Superior to the
					 Supreme Court of Canada which literally refused to hear Superior's
					 appeal.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have an example of where private members' business
					 and initiatives by the House have anticipated a concern in many respects. If we
					 think for a moment about the potential impact this had on the farming community
					 in western Canada, suppliers, producers and consumers in Atlantic Canada, and
					 ultimately its devastating impact on the competitive process, the decision by
					 members of parliament to correctly put this issue before the House of Commons
					 and deem it votable was the correct one.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year I was responsible for assisting a number of
					 Canadians through a very difficult winter when energy prices were soaring, much
					 as a result of arbitraging the market.</p>


	<A NAME="T1715"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1715"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1720"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1710"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1715)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We saw natural gas prices, home heating fuel, propane
					 and the like all rising rather dramatically and suddenly, causing the
					 government to try to take correct appropriate action to help stave off what
					 would have otherwise been a perilous situation for many Canadians. I compliment
					 the government for having taken that position. I believe it was the correct one
					 at the time.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also believe the House has a responsibility to ensure
					 that our Competition Act is interpreted in such a way that the precedent set by
					 the Competition Tribunal is clearly set aside by the House of
					 Commons.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There may be members of parliament who would dare to
					 suggest that this is rule made law and that somehow the supreme court or the
					 federal court has made decisions. I assure the House that they have not come to
					 any decision. We must ensure with respect to Bill C-248, if we are to qualify
					 the efficiencies defence in the Competition Act, that those efficiencies and
					 gains which occur when two entities merge together to create a substantial and
					 possibly dangerous monopoly are found to be transferred either to customers or
					 to consumers, not simply to individuals who happen to see a good deal, take
					 over their competitor, shut their operations down and consolidate their
					 monopoly.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the shortcoming of the way in which the act is
					 written. The act also suggests incorrectly that it is possible to use a
					 hypothetical economic efficiencies defence argument. Again there is no
					 clarification. Parliament is being called upon to ensure that the clarification
					 coming from those who understand the Competition Act as I do, because I have
					 interpreted and worked in many facets of that act, also gives them an
					 opportunity to have a say in terms of how the deliberation occurs.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I well understand there will be those who will make the
					 argument that it is before the courts. I can assure my hon. colleagues it is
					 not sub judice. It is not a criminal matter. This is before the Competition
					 Tribunal, a quasi-judicial body which will have to hear it again. I suspect the
					 decision may very well come ultimately some time in the month of January.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That does not preclude parliament because it ultimately
					 wrote the Competition Act with the help of certain very powerful individuals in
					 1996. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am interested in this issue because I also find that
					 even our friends at the OECD make it very clear to many of us who have looked
					 at the issue time and time again that using gains in efficiency is simply not
					 acceptable. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I try to find the appropriate document, it is very
					 clear to me that other international bodies have already spoken very eloquently
					 to the need to ensure that a merger request which results in and is designed to
					 create an efficiency situation for a particular entity is not used in a way
					 that does not see the value being returned to customers or consumers or, more
					 important, to offend the competitive process.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OECD roundtable No. 4 competition policy on efficiency
					 claims and mergers and other horizontal agreements states very clearly:
					 </p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right">
</td>
<td><small>--there is a clear limit for the efficiency defence: the

						  agreement would bring about high efficiency gains, these efficiencies are not
						  able to justify an elimination of competition.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It says, in terms of the European act:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right">
</td>

						  --85(3) provides for a kind of “sliding scale”: the more competition is

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the OECD's position, given what we experienced
					 last winter in a very cold winter for many, and given what the House has seen
					 with respect to the right decision that was taken by a competition
					 commissioner, I do not think we have much time for silly arguments that it
					 should not be considered because we want to wait for the tribunal to ultimately
					 make a decision.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not that we in the House want to rush judicial or
					 quasi-judicial interpretations. The interpretation of the federal court not to
					 hear this and the decision taken by the commission bears out the validity. This
					 is a clear sign that members of the House should take inventory of what is
					 currently before us and be able to point the Competition Act in a direction to
					 ensure that above all it meets the goals and expectations of the Competition
					 Act.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to point out to members of parliament that the
					 federal court did point out the purpose and interpretation. Article 1.1 of the
					 Competition Act states: </p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>The purpose of this Act is to
						  maintain and encourage competition in Canada in order to promote the efficiency
						  and adaptability of the Canadian economy, in order to expand opportunities for
						  Canadian participation in world markets while at the same time recognizing the
						  role of foreign competition in Canada, in order to ensure that small and
						  medium-sized enterprises have an equitable opportunity to participate in the
						  Canadian economy and in order to provide consumers with competitive prices and
						  product choices.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of us in the House have this great fear that if a
					 large corporation says it must be bad, and it has a few jobs in the riding, we
					 should ultimately ignore the plight of many of our small and medium sized
					 enterprises and, more important, the very people who elect us, the consumers of
					 this country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have every bit of evidence to demonstrate that there
					 are shortcomings in the Competition Act. I will not get into the details as to
					 who wrote the act. No doubt a select group of individuals may have had
					 something to do with it. However I assure members that when it comes to the
					 interpretation of this important regulatory body, which is there to protect a
					 market oriented process, it is the plaything of a select group of individuals
					 who, in their infinite wisdom and reason, may have another interest, and that
					 is of course of their clients. In the House of Commons, we have a greater
					 obligation to the broad public interests in this country.</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why I say that the provisions in the bill make
					 good sense. I urge other members to support them, not just to improve
					 competition but also to assure our constituents that this parliament is alive,
					 is capable of being effective and can easily react to problems peculiar to the
					 times we live in.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why I am here, not just to debate the issue of
					 competition. Obviously there are other members sitting on various committees.
					 Generally speaking they recognize the need to supply our country and to anchor
					 this bill in reality.</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to infuse a reality check in what we
					 are doing here. I commend members of parliament who have worked with me on
					 previous endeavours and initiatives such as Bill C-235 in the last
					 parliament.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, you were part of the Liberal committee on
					 gasoline pricing many years ago. On a very cold day in January you invited us
					 to talk about the plight of individuals who could not get supplies or consumers
					 who were having difficulties. I recall that it was in Timmins where people were
					 forced to pay 10 cents or 15 cents more than people were in southern Ontario.
					 Everybody knew that driving a truckful of gasoline from the Toronto refineries
					 all the way up to Timmins could cost no more than a cent or two a litre more.
					 Yet we were seeing various discrepancies of 10 cents to 15 cents and even more
					 in remote areas.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is only one segment. The media will also look at
					 gasoline. I find it funny when my little four year old son, Bradley, calls me
					 the gas man. I am not sure what he means by that. However, I assure hon.
					 members that the concerns this side of the House has raised, and I see that
					 members on the other side of the House are starting to raise similar concerns
					 with respect to the Competition Act and gasoline, apply to a general pattern of
					 concentration in Canada which is in need of review. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that concentration may be, of necessity, an
					 inevitability of globalization. We have the authority and the ability to ensure
					 that at the end of the process its effects can be minimized if consumer choice
					 is removed or, worse, if consumers are forced to pay more for a product which
					 in many respects is one that comes from under the ground or is harnessed by
					 other means.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A nation that is abundant in so many resources finds
					 itself in a bit of a contradiction where it may pay more for its products or
					 have less choice than our competitors south of the border.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not want to go on at great length about that. The
					 reason that parliament should now address the efficiency defence is important
					 because a dangerous precedent has been set. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tribunal said that it was okay to have a harmful,
					 anti-competitive merger as long as one could prove that one could have some
					 kind of efficiency gain. It did not say to whom that efficiency gain had to go,
					 but presumably corporations are not stupid. They will put it in their own
					 pocket. That will benefit those who are interested from a shareholder's
					 perspective. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However that flies in the face of the intention of
					 parliament in 1986. The parliament of today must ensure the enhancement of the
					 competitive process whereby consumers and business can enjoy the fruits and
					 labour of a competitive process. It is for these reasons that parliament has an
					 obligation to ensure that it provides timely and effective responses to
					 individuals who may from time to time find themselves without a
					 voice.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find it interesting and passing strange that in terms
					 of this bill and other bills that come before the House on the issue of
					 competition, and we see this in committees, the only individuals who tend to
					 speak out against these things are people who are there on behalf of very large
					 entities. The irony is that at many of the meetings I attend off Hill and on
					 Hill as a guest speaker, an intervener or facilitator, I always see the same
					 people. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the most important pieces of legislation
					 including amendments and considerations tends to be decided by a handful of
					 individuals. The same individuals probably have a lot to do with being able to
					 attend various international competition conferences around the world. It is
					 interesting because they tend to knock the lack of timing, effectiveness and
					 efficiency of our competition bureau. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would probably have some cause with that except I see
					 it from their perspective. They are not getting their mergers quickly enough.
					 They think that the process of enforcement in the writing of the guidelines
					 should be toward their own ends. </p>


	<A NAME="T1725"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1725"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1730"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1720"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1725)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that is a very dangerous thing for us to
					 observe. In papers like the <i>National Post</i> and the <i>Financial Post</i>
					 we always see articles written about how international bodies, which tend to be
					 our own competition lawyers who work for some of the largest corporations in
					 this country, are out slagging the bureau. They cannot do it locally, they have
					 to do it internationally and hide behind that sort of shield.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us expose this for what it is. Let us begin to take
					 back a piece of legislation that is important to all of us. It is a piece of
					 legislation that is critical to the good functioning of our economy. We need to
					 stand and become relevant as members of parliament to ensure that a handful of
					 individuals is not going to be the gatekeeper of what is in that act. If they
					 can get away with it in the Competition Act, I am sure there are possibilities
					 for them to do it elsewhere in other pieces of legislation. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just to qualify, that is not to suggest there is not an
					 important reflection and review of the Competition Act. Again, it is very
					 strange that I always see the same individuals coming forward. Members of
					 parliament more often than not receive criticism from small business or
					 consumers who are left with no choice and wonder why there is no effective
					 enforcement of our act, real or perceived. We as members of parliament are
					 their best shot. It is for that reason members of parliament have to take the
					 time to write legislation that makes sense, that is reviewed within the context
					 of the decisions that are made, but also responds effectively to the needs of
					 Canadians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bill is the third such bill that has been made
					 votable on the Competition Act which I have been able to bring forward. With
					 the private right of access I am proposing with respect to Bill C-23, I believe
					 we are now making headway. It is important to recognize that I applaud the
					 government for allowing members to do this, but let this not stop in the House.
					 Let us ensure that the Senate also understands its validity and impact on
					 Canadians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe we will have gone a long way not only to
					 address the shortcomings that are clear and abundantly obvious to anyone,
					 including our government and opposition, with respect to the Competition Act,
					 but we will have done something to improve legislation generally in Canada and
					 earn our own pay.</p>

					 Canadian Alliance): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak to Bill C-248, an
					 act to amend the Competition Act with respect to the efficiency defence for
					 merger proposals.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The official opposition's chief critic for industry,
					 the hon. member for Peace River, unfortunately cannot speak to this bill due to
					 some urgency, but he has done quite a bit of work on this issue and is very
					 interested in it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bill was introduced in the last session of
					 parliament but as the member said, it died on the order paper. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-248 is a deceptively short bill with only one
					 clause and two subclauses. However there is more to the bill than meets the
					 eye.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the private member's bill seems to be
					 that the enactment amends the Competition Act to clarify the competition
					 tribunal's power to make or not make an order in the case of a merger when
					 gains in efficiency are expected or when the merger would create or strengthen
					 a dominant market position.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 96 of the Competition Act specifies that a
					 merger may be approved by the competition tribunal even if it substantially
					 lessens or is likely to prevent competition within a specific market, trade or
					 industry as long as those advocating the merger can prove that such a move
					 would bring about or would likely bring about gains in efficiency that would be
					 greater than and would offset the effects of any prevention or lessening of
					 competition. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appreciate the intent of the hon. member in bringing
					 forward this bill but when we look at the details, we find that this is mere
					 tinkering.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 96 further instructs the tribunal to consider
					 whether such gains in efficiency will result in a significant increase in the
					 real value of exports or a significant substitution of domestic products for
					 imported products. The Competition Act is clear that a redistribution of income
					 between two or more persons or groups cannot be considered an efficiency. In
					 other words, if a proposed merger will benefit one person or group to the equal
					 detriment of others, that cannot be considered an efficiency.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-248 would create two new subsections for section
					 96, subsections (4) and (5), to further instruct the tribunal on the
					 consideration of efficiencies in a merger case. I would argue that these
					 instructions would muddy the waters and quite possibly stand merger review on
					 its head.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motivation behind Bill C-248 was the competition
					 tribunal's decision to allow the merger of Superior Propane and ICG Propane
					 against the wishes of the competition commissioner. I agree with the
					 commissioner that the merger probably should not have gone ahead. I was pleased
					 to hear that the competition bureau won its appeal at the federal court and
					 that this case will be heard again by the tribunal. I would like to see the
					 process run its course.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. member from Pickering has crafted a private
					 member's bill that he thinks will fix the problem. I commend his initiative and
					 efforts. However, I have trouble with reactionary law or amendments tinkering
					 with existing laws that are designed to resolve a specific situation. This is
					 not the way to make coherent legislation that will stand the test of time.
					 </p>


	<A NAME="T1735"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1735"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1740"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1730"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1735)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently when considering gains in efficiency, the
					 tribunal does not discriminate between groups as long as one group does not
					 benefit at the expense of another group, which is considered merely a
					 redistribution of income.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall efficiency gains are the main issue. The
					 distribution is not important. However proposed subsection (4) would require
					 that the majority of benefits derived from gains in efficiency will be passed
					 on to customers and consumers. The amendment proposed by the member from
					 Pickering would require the tribunal to favour consumer interests over producer
					 interests. This is a serious change in tone and direction. I am not convinced
					 it would benefit the economy as a whole.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsection (5) would disallow the efficiency defence
					 entirely should the merger result in the creation or even the strengthening of
					 a dominant market position. This amendment would require the tribunal to
					 discriminate against dominant players. In a country with a domestic market as
					 small as Canada's, it may not make economic sense in a number of
					 sectors.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike the member from Pickering, I do not believe that
					 dominant players in the market automatically are abusing their dominant market
					 positions. This is presuming guilt before innocence. I also do not see much
					 merit in enshrining outright discrimination against dominant players in the
					 Competition Act. It is not fair. There is nothing inherently wrong with a
					 dominant player in a market but subsection (5) could have the effect of
					 preventing dominant players from emerging even if that is the best thing for
					 the market.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would argue that this might not be a good strategy in
					 a global economy. We should not allow the tribunal's hands to be tied by
					 proposed subsection (5). That is what it will do. It will tie its hands. The
					 tribunal must be able to make decisions on a case by case basis.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill talks about a specific scenario but it has a
					 broad spectrum of implications. It implies that the bill does not want real
					 competition but a regulated competition. That is the difference. We want real
					 competition in the market, not a regulated competition of a few industries
					 under strict conditions. It should be the market forces that dictate free and
					 fair competition in the market, not artificially unfair conditions. It is only
					 tinkering.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To further make my point, I will quote a recent article
					 in the <i>Globe and Mail</i> which discusses a draft report by the Organisation
					 for Economic Co-operation and Development: </p>


	<p>

</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The competition bureau should be

</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The report also states that laws that require Canadian
					 ownership and control in several sectors, especially airlines, banks and
					 bookstores, have prevented competition policy from dealing adequately with
					 issues such as market power and monopoly.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course there are other issues such as enforcement
					 and other things but I will not go there. In a nutshell, important decisions
					 should not be subjected to political pressures to protect national competition
					 interests.</p>

					 BQ): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to speak to Bill C-248,
					 introduced by the member for Pickering--Ajax--Uxbridge.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to state at the outset that I am very
					 pleased to support this bill, as I believe the Competition Act needs to be
					 strengthened.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is sad to note that the act currently has no power
					 to fight collusion. In our world where the role of the economy and markets
					 becomes increasingly important, we need to ensure better protection for
					 citizens of this country. Personally, I believe that Bill C-248 is a step in
					 the right direction.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This private member's bill proposes a review of the
					 application of sections 92 and 96 of the Competition Act. This would have the
					 effect of prohibiting any one company from having a dominant market position
					 following a merger.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the deficiencies of the current Competition Act,
					 I sincerely believe that we must do everything within our power to restrict any
					 possibility of dominant positioning and collusion at the outset, because once
					 it has occurred, it is difficult to come back and ensure that the public is
					 well protected and served by fair and healthy competition.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at an example. In my region of Saguenay, we
					 have been in a very difficult situation in the past few months. The price of
					 gasoline was so incredibly high at one point that we thought the price at the
					 pump would go beyond a dollar a litre.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would remind the House that, in January 2001, Irvin
					 of Calgary published a study, which concluded that the retailers in the region
					 of Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean had the highest profit margin in the country. While
					 the national average was about five cents a litre, in the Saguenay, retailers
					 were getting as much as 12 cents a litre. It is not surprising to discover the
					 range of prices at the pump. How do we explain it? It seems to me that healthy
					 competition should produce similar prices across the country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, strange as it may seem, on the same
					 street, at the same point in time, retailers in my region were raising their
					 prices. I can understand this happening when prices are being lowered, since no
					 retailer wants to be outdone and uncompetitive. However, what is the
					 explanation for the simultaneous price hike?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people in the competition bureau call this
					 phenomenon “conscious parallelism”. This means that a retailer will follow all
					 price changes, be they upwards or downwards. Would it not, however, be logical
					 for a retailer to keep his prices lower than the competition in order to
					 increase his business?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to say I do not accept this theory of conscious
					 parallelism for a moment. It is, instead, collusion among retailers who benefit
					 from people's dependency on their cars.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I lodged two complaints with the competition bureau to
					 get them to investigate. Nevertheless, although this price shift is disgusting
					 to ordinary consumers, the competition bureau cannot investigate a mere
					 observation. It must have written or oral proof to even initiate an
					 investigation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us get serious. With all the new technology we
					 have, like cell phones and e-mail, it has become very easy to avoid being
					 caught for fraud.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The review of section 45 of the Competition Act must be
					 closely followed in the case of collusion in the oil industry. Indeed, the term
					 “unduly” in this section forces the competition bureau to have written or oral
					 evidence of collusion which, as I just explained, is almost impossible to get.
					 We must adapt this section to the modern realities of the 21st
					 century.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not the only one to promote this idea. When he
					 appeared before the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology,
					 Professor Thomas Ross, with other witnesses, said:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>It is important to remove the term
						  “unduly” to facilitate price fixing investigations, which are currently too
						  difficult to conduct.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further on in his remarks, Mr. Ross said “It is high
					 time to reform section 45 and I do hope that the industry committee will look
					 at this issue very soon”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe it is high time we as parliamentarians review
					 our acts so as to give priority to the interests of individuals, on the
					 competition issue as well as all other issues. As I said in my presentation,
					 major companies, such as oil companies, have it too easy and can do whatever
					 they want in their sector. They take advantage of the weakness of the
					 Competition Act to gouge prices in an unreasonable fashion.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. member who presented this bill has a great
					 deal of expertise in the area of competition. He also presented Bill C-472 on
					 private applications and I congratulate him on that. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must say that I am more and more in favour of this
					 idea. I believe that individuals themselves should have the right to bring
					 before the courts a company that is guilty of fraud or price fixing. We must
					 not forget as well that the chronic underfunding of the competition bureau
					 greatly limits the number of cases heard by the tribunal. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Short of providing the adequate financial means for the
					 competition bureau to do its job, allowing citizens themselves to institute an
					 action is a very good idea. We must examine it carefully and move
					 forward.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The competition sector is extremely large. Bill C-248
					 introduced by the hon. member for Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge would restrict the
					 influence of big companies. Finally, the competition bureau would have a say in
					 mergers leading to an excessive market control.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I strongly urge members to ask themselves some
					 questions about the implementation of section 45 of the Competition Act.
					 Private access is also a solution that may be emphasized. The government must
					 be open minded and finally be on the consumers' side. Perhaps these people do
					 not put as much money into campaign funds as Petro-Canada or Shell do, but it
					 is still taxpayers who are funding our salaries with their taxes. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is time to give priority to the real citizens of
					 this country. This is what I am doing and I am proud to speak on behalf of my
					 constituents of Jonquière and to represent their interests.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask all members of the House to tighten up the
					 Competition Act and to support Bill C-248, which was introduced by our
					 colleague.</p>


	<A NAME="Int-60072"></A><a HREF="#Int-60074"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-60069"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Claude Drouin (Parliamentary
					 Secretary to the Minister of Industry, Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have this opportunity to
					 address Bill C-248, an act to amend the Competition Act. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague, the member for 
					 Pickering--Ajax--Uxbridge, has a long standing
					 interest in competition law and he should be commended for raising its profile
					 in this place. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Competition is important, not as an end in itself, but
					 rather as a means to an end. Competition encourages firms to lower costs,
					 reduce prices, improve services and develop new products. As consumers, this
					 makes us all better off.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Competition Act applies to virtually every industry
					 and business in Canada. It seeks to maintain and enhance competitive market
					 forces. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-248 would amend the act to limit the application
					 of the so-called “efficiency defence”. Simply put, the efficiency defence
					 allows for the consideration of gains in efficiency when examining the
					 anti-competitive effects of a merger. Bill C-248 would limit this defence by
					 addressing two specific circumstances under which it could not be used.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, it would require that the gains in efficiency
					 exceed the anti-competitive effects and lead to lower prices. This proposed
					 price test is widely viewed as one of the simplest and most direct means of
					 verifying that efficiency gains resulting from a merger will ultimately benefit
					 consumers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second feature of the bill is that the efficiency
					 defence would not apply if the merger would result in the creation or the
					 strengthening of a dominant market position. The obvious extreme example would
					 be a merger to monopoly. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the inspiration for this bill was a decision by
					 the federal competition tribunal in a merger between ICG Propane and Superior
					 Propane.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This 1998 merger brought together the two largest
					 propane suppliers in Canada and it was the first merger case where the
					 efficiency defence was used to counter the anti-competitive impact of a
					 merger.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The commissioner of competition challenged the merger
					 on the grounds that it would clearly lead to both a substantial lessening and
					 prevention of competition in the market for propane. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Superior Propane argued that the efficiency gains
					 resulting from the merger would offset those anti-competitive impacts, so the
					 merger should be allowed to stand.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In August 2000, the competition tribunal decided that
					 the merger was likely to prevent competition in Atlantic Canada and lessen
					 competition substantially in many local markets across Canada and for national
					 account consumers. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It also concluded that the appropriate remedy for this
					 anti-competitive result of the merger would be an order compelling the
					 divestiture of ICG. However, the tribunal did not issue such an
					 order.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tribunal agreed with Superior that no order could
					 be issued because the efficiencies resulting from the merger would be greater
					 than and would offset the effects of any prevention or lessening of
					 competition.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The commissioner appealed the decision to the Federal
					 Court of Appeal. The federal court overturned the tribunal's ruling and sent
					 the matter back to the tribunal for a re-determination hearing. Most recently,
					 Superior Propane was denied leave to appeal the matter to the Supreme Court of
					 Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The matter of Superior Propane's acquisition of ICG
					 Propane is important both for Canadians who use propane fuel and for Canadian
					 competition law.</p>


	<A NAME="T1750"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1750"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1755"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1745"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1750)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of how to treat various elements of
					 efficiencies and how to balance them against the anti-competitive effects of a
					 merger is one which became topical when Superior Propane proposed to acquire
					 ICG Propane in 1998.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hearings before the tribunal involved a large
					 number of witnesses, including many economic experts. The tribunal heard a wide
					 range of views on how efficiencies should be measured and how they should be
					 balanced against anti-competitive impacts. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The federal court, in its reasons for judgment,
					 disagreed with the standard of review used by the tribunal, but added that it
					 would not itself tackle the question of what is the correct method for
					 determining the anti-competitive effects, which reflects on the complexity of
					 this area of competition law. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill before us received first reading on February
					 7, 2001, prior to the Federal Court of Appeal's ruling on the commissioner's
					 appeal of the tribunal ruling. This was a period of uncertainty in Canadian
					 competition law because it was unclear whether the federal court would uphold
					 the tribunal's ruling, reverse it, or cast the efficiency defence in an
					 entirely new light. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-248 appears to have anticipated a federal court
					 ruling supporting the tribunal's decision, and therefore sought to clarify the
					 issue by limiting the application of the efficiency rule.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is difficult to propose rewriting a law while it is
					 before the courts, but we must understand that there was considerable concern
					 that if the tribunal ruling stood, there could be a wave of mergers to monopoly
					 which would be unstoppable because of efficiency claims. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have indicated, the question of how efficiency
					 claims should be treated in merger analysis is very complex. The Federal Court
					 of Appeal has pointed this out in its ruling. While I understand the underlying
					 motivation for this bill, I think the Federal Court of Appeal and the Supreme
					 Court of Canada have spoken unambiguously on this subject. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it would be unfair to suggest already that the
					 tribunal needs further guidance than that provided by the superior courts on
					 the issue. It would not be helpful to change section 96 of the act while the
					 tribunal is adjudicating a matter on that very section.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not presently have reason to believe that the act
					 needs clarification through amendment in respect of the efficiency defence.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us be reasonable and let the competition tribunal
					 do its job and revisit the propane merger now with the benefit of the wisdom of
					 our superior courts. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again, I would like to thank the member for
					 Pickering--Ajax--Uxbridge for bringing this important issue to the attention of
					 the House. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The matter which gave rise to this bill is again before
					 the Competition Tribunal and may yet again be brought before the Federal Court
					 of Appeal and possibly the Supreme Court of Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given that this matter is currently before the courts,
					 it would not be prudent of members in this place to presume the outcome. I
					 trust members of the House will use their good sense to ensure that we make the
					 right decisions. </p>

					 PC/DR): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, thank you for the opportunity to speak to
					 Bill C-248, an act to amend the Competition Act. It is a timely piece of
					 legislation given the current situation in our country as far as our concern
					 goes for our economy generally. However, it is also timely because we are
					 reviewing parts of the Competition Act in committee right now.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to commend the hon. member for
					 Pickering--Ajax--Uxbridge for bringing this legislation forward. He is becoming
					 quite well known for his critique of the Competition Act and the tribunals and
					 so on. It is a well earned reputation. He is someone who, both in committee and
					 in the House, is building a reputation for the strength of his private members'
					 bills and his committee work. It is a tribute to him as an individual MP who
					 sometimes kicks over the traces a little bit, which is always to be admired in
					 this place. More important, he does it on a matter that he has focused in on
					 and I think he has done a good job of highlighting a concern he has about the
					 Competition Act.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do want to know how he always gets his bills drawn
					 from the private members' bin. That in itself deserves a competition
					 investigation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the time given to me I want to talk briefly about
					 the specific circumstances that led to the need for the bill, and I think we
					 have heard a good part of that, about the other changes possibly required in
					 the Competition Act and then finally about the kind of overlying principles
					 that I think are at stake when we talk about changing the Competition
					 Act.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-248 would amend section 96 of the Competition
					 Act by stating the following: </p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>For the purpose of subsection (1),
						  gains in efficiency cannot offset the effects of a lessening or prevention of
						  competition unless the majority of the benefits derived or to be derived from
						  such gains in efficiency are being or are likely to be passed on to customers
						  within a reasonable time in the form of lower prices.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In layman's terms, if there are big savings to be made
					 in a merger that results in a essential monopoly, then the majority of those
					 savings has to be passed on. In other words, it is a quid pro quo. If there is
					 a monopoly, under the amendment the customer then gets a benefit. They cannot
					 have their cake and eat it too. If there is a monopoly there has to be
					 something in it for consumers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proposed subsection 96(5) states:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>This section does not apply where,
						  after the transaction has been completed, the merger or proposed merger, will
						  result or is likely to result in the creation or strengthening of a dominant
						  market position.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My understanding is that this was brought about because
					 in July 1998 Superior Propane put forward a proposal to purchase ICG Propane
					 from Petro-Canada. This gave Superior control of nearly 70% of the Canadian
					 propane industry and the competition commissioner commenced his inquiry into
					 the transaction in August of that same year. In December the commissioner
					 applied to the tribunal for an interim order preventing completion of the
					 transaction. He was concerned because he felt that the deal would hurt farmers,
					 small businesses and ordinary consumers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tribunal rejected his application and the parties
					 completed the transaction in December 1998. After the tribunal's ruling, the
					 competition commissioner appealed the decision to the federal court. The court
					 ruled that the competition tribunal “had incorrectly applied the efficiency
					 defence”, stating that the decision was in contradiction of the stated purpose
					 of the act, that is, “to maintain and encourage competition”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The case is now back before the competition tribunal
					 which will make a new decision next year. Meanwhile Superior has merged its
					 operations with ICG. To sum it all up in a nutshell, one company bought another
					 company, giving it a virtual monopoly in the Canadian propane industry. The
					 argument is how far we will let that go before a monopoly threatens prices or
					 undermines fair competition and, in many cases, undermines the livelihood of
					 Canadians who are dependent on the propane industry.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Competition Tribunal of Canada allowed this act to
					 take place and supported it. The argument it used is that the merger would save
					 Superior $29 million over 10 years. In other words, the tribunal said yes, it
					 was concerned about the monopoly but the savings were so significant that it
					 was worth putting up with the monopoly.</p>


	<A NAME="T1800"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1800"><!-- Hour: 6--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1805"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1755"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1800)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem with the original ruling is that it was
					 very precedent setting. It allowed or would have allowed a monopoly or virtual
					 monopoly in the marketplace, so we were just supposed to hope against hope, I
					 guess, that consumers would not pay a price for it down the road.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost every time we see a monopoly or virtual monopoly
					 in the marketplace, if not immediately but certainly down the road, the
					 consumer pays. Monopolies are not good for the marketplace, they are not good
					 for consumers and often they are not even good for business.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I only have to point out the example of Air Canada. I
					 do not know if Air Canada got what it wanted, but when it got a virtual
					 monopoly in the air travel industry that did not actually help it. It certainly
					 did not help consumers, nor did it serve the marketplace well. In the long run
					 not only did we pay a lot for our tickets and see a reduction in service, but
					 now we see that the company itself is going through tough times. A monopoly is
					 no guarantee of efficiency. A bad business deal or a bad situation, especially
					 when dealing in international markets, means businesses go under rather than
					 become competitive.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will summarize by saying that according to the
					 tribunal, efficiency is not in and of itself enough of a reason to acknowledge
					 or recognize a monopoly. After the ruling of the court, this is back again for
					 a further ruling. We will see how this legislation goes, but I think we will
					 end up having to wait for that further ruling before we see the legislation
					 before us today go the extra mile and actually become law.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we are talking about competition, it is
					 interesting to me to see that the recent report by the OECD points out that we
					 do have problems in Canada with the Competition Bureau and tribunals in regard
					 to how this is handled. It is often a political football. It is often used by
					 government to either shirk its responsibilities or fob them off on someone
					 else. It was pointed out by the OECD that occasionally the government turns a
					 blind eye to monopolies, hoping that they are in the national interest.
					 However, they are seldom in the national interest and seldom, if ever, in the
					 consumer's interest, and I would argue it is not in the interest of the
					 marketplace generally. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The marketplace is not well served by monopolies. No
					 matter how much money monopolies think they are saving in the initial pass, in
					 the long run the consumer will pay and our national competitiveness takes a
					 blow.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, because we are now dealing in an international
					 marketplace, it is pretty hard for us to go to another country when we have our
					 own nice little Canadian monopolies and tell that other country that its
					 monopolies are bad. Increasingly we will see the Competition Act and other
					 bilateral agreements forcing Canada to be as concerned about our monopolies as
					 we are about those of other countries.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, it is like a free trade agreement. We
					 will not be able to say that one monopoly is good for our one little part of
					 the rock but another monopoly across the border is a bad one. We will have to
					 say that when the marketplace is competitive it is competitive for all of us,
					 not just when we think it is a good thing for our little industry or our part
					 of the rock.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion I will summarize by saying that there are
					 conflicting principles at stake. One is the free enterprise principle, that is,
					 we should encourage free enterprise. That is a sound principle and I hope all
					 of us in the House understand the need for it. Second, however, there is a role
					 for the government to ensure that monopolies do not take place and that unfair
					 practices are not foisted on consumers. When that happens, the government has a
					 role to play to ensure that competition exists and that true free enterprise
					 can take place.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last thing, and the one concern I have with the
					 bill, is that when we encourage companies to be as efficient as possible they
					 do not realize any savings from being efficient. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, we have to trade off the idea of
					 “monopolies are bad”. On the other hand, when we create efficiencies, it is
					 because companies are trying to save money. We have to allow them to save money
					 and to be efficient, but we have to do it in an atmosphere that does not allow
					 monopolies.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why the bill should go to committee for further
					 study. The principles are sound. I hope that we can support it, at least at
					 second reading, to see if we can integrate it into the Competition
					 Act.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I have thrown my speech away. I want to
					 support the member. Bill C-248 is a necessary bill and the member's speech laid
					 out the detail.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We just heard about the Superior Propone case in
					 layman's terms, as well as the technical language. It is absolutely astounding
					 that in that case, the tribunal said that although it found the merger was
					 likely to prevent competition in Atlantic Canada and lessen competition
					 substantially in many local markets and for national accounts customers, the
					 respondents successfully demonstrated their efficiency defence.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is precisely why the bill is here. That decision
					 is being appealed because it was a bad decision and there was not the
					 clarification within the Competition Act. That is exactly what Bill C-248 would
					 do. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill would bring clarification to the act so that
					 we do not get decisions which contradict the stated purpose of the Competition
					 Act itself, which starts on page 1. I do not have to read it. I think we
					 understand.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last few seconds, let me simply compliment the
					 member for 
					 Pickering--Ajax--Uxbridge for taking a lead role. I
					 do not think there is any member in this place who has been so comprehensively
					 active in Competition Act issues and has led the House, whether it be gasoline
					 prices, taxation, et cetera. We owe the member our thanks and gratitude for
					 this, for taking it on as one area of many and leading us to a very important
					 bill, Bill C-248, to provide clarification. My congratulations to the
					 member.</p>

					 NDP): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak tonight to deal with
					 a question I asked the transport minister on September 27, 2001.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was talking about airport safety and all that is
					 being done in airports by the government and security firms.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The disappointing thing is that the official languages
					 commissioner, in her report, has said that, three years from now, airports that
					 have been privatized will no longer come under the Official Languages
					 Act.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The French speaking minority communities in Canada will
					 certainly be affected by this.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was also disappointed to learn what my predecessor,
					 Doug Young, did when he was transport minister, in 1993. I have not always been
					 surprised by his actions, but after so many years, I look back and I say that
					 his privatization of airports made it possible for the government to get out of
					 its obligation to ensure that services are provided in both official languages.
					 It is a disgrace.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a disgrace that in 2001, we still need to talk
					 about this in Canada. It is a disgrace that we have to fight, in the Standing
					 Joint Committee on Official Languages, to get Air Canada, which is subject to
					 the Official Languages Act, to respect both official languages in our country
					 on airplanes. Now, we are being told that airports will no longer be subject to
					 the Official Languages Act, which is a slap in the face.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Liberal Speech from the Throne, last year, the
					 government said that it would take the issue of official languages very
					 seriously, and that it would undertake the required efforts to ensure that they
					 are respected in Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These same Liberals sold off our airports to the
					 private sector and included a clause in the contract whereby the airports would
					 no longer be subject to the act in ten years' time. This took place in 1993.
					 That means that in 2003, they can say, “it is not our problem”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I asked the question to the transport minister, and I
					 was pleased with his response. However, tonight I would like to hear the follow
					 up to his answer, when he said:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>I accept the advice of the hon.
						  member and I am prepared to discuss this issue with my officials.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He even said that he was ready to introduce a
					 bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am anxious to hear from the parliamentary secretary,
					 to know if he can clarify at all what the transport minister said, because it
					 is very important that there be no difference in the use of the two official
					 languages. Both languages must be respected in our country.</p>


	<A NAME="Int-60083"></A><a HREF="#Int-60085"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-60081"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. André Harvey (Parliamentary
					 Secretary to the Minister of Transport, Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I will begin by thanking my colleague from
					 
					 Acadie--Bathurst, who
					 always defends with such passion the interests of fellow citizens in his entire
					 region. Sometimes the causes he defends are even national in stature. I
					 congratulate him for all the interest he has shown in important
					 issues.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the application of the Official Languages Act
					 is concerned, I believe the hon. member is clearly differentiating this. It is
					 obvious that full application of the Official Languages Act applies to the
					 national airport system. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Application of the Official Languages Act therefore
					 covers 95% or 96% of all Canadian air traffic. This does not necessarily solve
					 the problem of the portion of the issue the hon. member has focused on:
					 defending the value of respecting official languages. Even if we do not have
					 complete jurisdiction over privately managed airports, I still want to point
					 out to the hon. member that a review of the Canada Airports Act is under way.
					 It will maintain application of the Official Languages Act in all of the
					 national airport system. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to airports that are not covered by the
					 national airport system concept, it is important to point out that they are
					 governed by the market. I fully realize that this is not enough. Measures are
					 required, not necessarily coercive measures, but significant
					 incentives.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While this may cover 1.5% or 2% of the overall traffic,
					 I do not know if there is a particular problem at the Bathurst airport as I do
					 not have a detailed knowledge of all regional airports, or even national
					 airports, but all the measures taken and the report of the Commissioner of
					 Official Languages also bear fruit. Through the measures that were put in
					 place, managers developed an awareness of and a respect for official languages.
					 Even if the Official Languages Act cannot be fully implemented in these
					 sectors, the measures include an increased awareness by airport operators of
					 the requirements in that regard. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Improving the government's monitoring efforts is also
					 important.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me also say that the appointment of the Minister of
					 Intergovernmental Affairs to deal with the issue of official languages will be
					 a major asset in achieving the anticipated success in the future. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that the introduction of a protocol to codify
					 the process for handling official languages complaints is an interesting
					 guarantee, not necessarily a guarantee of perfection but an interesting
					 guarantee for the attainment of an objective that is very important not just to
					 the member for 
					 Acadie--Bathurst but for
					 all members of the House, particularly the French-Canadian members who have an
					 interest in seeing their language fully respected in all Canadian
					 airports.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I repeat that there is full respect in national
					 airports throughout the national system. Additional measures to ensure respect
					 for both official languages throughout the system are, I believe, beginning to
					 bear fruit and are in fact bearing fruit.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transport Canada is working with the Minister of
					 Transport and all stakeholders. I think we can be optimistic that the results
					 will be interesting, but we are not there yet.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to thank the member for his diligence on this
					 issue. I think it is my role, as parliamentary secretary, but also as a
					 French-Canadian, to defend interests having to do with the respect of the
					 official languages, even in those sectors where full respect is not
					 automatic.</p>

				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague the parliamentary
					 secretary for his kind remarks on the matters of concern to me.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, I must say that I do not agree with his
					 remarks and I will tell him why. The government has a number of
					 responsibilities including passing legislation. These airports used to belong
					 to the federal government. The government changed its mind and decided to
					 privatize them. Now it is pulling a fast one on us. How? By failing to comply
					 with the Official Languages Act.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the government opened the door to the
					 privatization of Air Canada, it included a clause to the effect that Air Canada
					 would be subject to the Official Languages Act. This was needed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contract signed with the private sector provides
					 that this company must comply with the Official Languages Act for ten years.
					 Why not make it forever? This is what we need in Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would point out that it applies not just to
					 francophones but to anglophones who visit the Gaspé or Kapuskasing or Hearst.
					 It exists to ensure respect for both official languages,English and French, in
					 Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want the minister to work to change the law and
					 guarantee that the Official Languages Act will be accepted and applied
					 throughout Canada.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will do this in co-operation with the federal
					 Minister of Transport as well as with the Minister of Intergovernmental

					 official languages. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am certain that we will see progress in respect of
