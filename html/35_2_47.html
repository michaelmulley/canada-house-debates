650 million tonnes of waste per year. We have approximately 6,000 
abandoned tailing sites and over 10,000 abandoned mines resulting 
in clean-up costs conservatively estimated at $6 billion, costs 
which will likely be borne by taxpayers.
<P>
	A sustainable mining industry would ensure that the price paid

minerals and metals through the removal of tax barriers favouring 
the use of virgin material over recycled material.

to draw attention to their contribution to the economies of Quebec

<P>
	The men and women of the mining sector toil long and hard, 
often putting their lives and their health at risk.  They deserve our

our quality of life and our collective wealth.
<P>
	The mining industry provides us with the raw materials that are 
transformed into high technology products we find in many items 
used in our daily lives.
<P>
	The federal government has promised to hand full responsibility 
for mines back to the provinces. It will then be the Government of 
Quebec's responsibility to help the mining industry to develop, and 
we are confident that Quebec will be equal to that task.

to its promises, for once.

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on October 24 in Verdun, the Prime Minister intimated to 
Quebecers that a yes vote in the referendum was irreversible. 
Finally, yesterday, the Prime Minister said that the federal 
government would certainly not permit Quebec to declare 
sovereignty unilaterally, thereby denying Quebecers' right to 
decide their future. Today, the Prime Minister has to qualify his 
position, because the path he chose was a dead end.
<P>
	Would the Prime Minister acknowledge that, by taking a legal 
route to resolve the constitutional issue, which pleases the other 
Canadians temporarily, he is heading down a cul de sac, which he 
will have to get out of sooner or later, having once again falsely 
lulled the rest of Canada?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we have gone to court for a very simple reason: the 
Quebec government lawyers, in the presentation they made before 
going to court, alleged in their documents that the Canadian 
Constitution would no longer apply to one of the provinces of 
Canada at a given point in time, thus forcing the attorney general 
for Canada to defend the Constitution.

<P>
	I was very happy this morning to see in the newspapers that

that a referendum was nothing more than a popular vote and posed 
no risk of taking away anyone's rights.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr.

he made this morning on ``Good Morning America'' to his 
statement of yesterday that there was no question of permitting 
Quebec to unilaterally choose sovereignty following a referendum?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I spoke with the program before I came to the House. 
There is no contradiction. Everything has to be done according to 
the international and national systems of law. I said that in Canada 
nobody wants to use violence to keep people in Canada.
<P>
	I repeat what I said before. Everything has to be done according 
to the Canadian Constitution and international law. I hope the Bloc 
Quebecois is not advocating that it does not want to respect the law 
of the land.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister said this morning on ``Good Morning 
America'' that Quebec's right to decide its future was not enshrined 
in the Constitution, but that Canada was a democratic country and 
if the people of Quebec expressed their wishes clearly they would 
be respected.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister acknowledge that, in the light of these 
remarks this morning, he went much too far yesterday in the House 
when he said that Quebec could not unilaterally declare its 
independence following a democratic referendum?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have spent weeks saying in this House that 50 per cent of 
the votes plus one was not enough. I think this is perfectly 
reasonable. The desire must be clear and the question clear, and the 
question must take the needs of the other partner into consideration 
as well. It is totally logical. That is what I said yesterday on the 
program.
<P>
	However, when people try to come up with ways to say things 
that are not clear and say they are going to separate but remain 
Canadian, and keep Canadian passports and currency and maintain 
economic and political partnership with Canada and remain 
Canadian citizens for ever more-listen, you have to be clear.
<P>
	These will be matters for negotiations, if there is ever another 
referendum, so we make sure everyone is very clear on the issue, 
the result and the consequences.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, once again the Prime Minister has cast  doubt-and once 
again we in this House have heard him do so-on one of the 
fundamental rules of democracy, one that is universally 
recognized. According to him, the rule of the absolute majority, 50 
per cent plus 1, is not sufficient for the verdict of the people of 
Quebec to be accepted.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	My question is a very simple one. Since the Prime Minister-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> Mr. Speaker, I understand that the 
government does not want to hear our questions, but hon. members 
could perhaps listen.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Your question please, dear colleague.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur: </B>Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	Since the Prime Minister is dismissing out of hand the 50 plus 1 
rule, what percentage does he have in mind?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to see it clearly established that the rule of 
democracy must be respected. Two referendums were held in 
Quebec, and both were won by those who wish to remain within 
Canada.
<P>
	Yesterday, in the National Assembly, Bloc Quebecois Central 
refused to vote in favour of an opposition resolution calling for 
recognition of the outcome of the last referendum. So who is it that 
is refusing to recognize democracy?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, are we to understand from the words of the Prime Minister 
that, in June, he intends to discuss with his provincial counterparts 
the percentage which the rest of Canada would deem acceptable to 
impose on Quebec for the next referendum?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> No, Mr. 
Speaker, because in my opinion today's debate arises out of the fact 
that the Government of Quebec has tabled a motion stating that, 
under certain circumstances, the Constitution of Canada would not 
apply. In this connection, the Minister of Justice was absolutely 
right. Not only was he right, but his mandate obliged him to come 
to the defence of the Constitution of Canada. We are not the ones 
who triggered the debate, the Government of Quebec did.
<P>
	As for me, I have no intention of continuing it. My hope is to 
have a federal-provincial conference where we will be able to make 
a great deal of progress toward improved federalism. I hope to be 
able to meet with Mr. Bouchard as soon as possible, in order to 
discuss job creation and real problems, the real problems that exist 
in Montreal at this time. I was prepared to do so at his convenience, 
and still am, because the economic future of Quebecers is the issue 
closest to the heart of this government.

<P>
	If the Prime Minister had made that position crystal clear before 
the last referendum we probably would not be discussing it today. It 
is imperative that Quebecers and all Canadians know the ground 
rules and the stakes before another secession attempt.
<P>

yesterday with a motion in the House specifying the government's 
position on a unilateral declaration of independence and on the 
rules governing any future secession attempt?
<P>

was enough to split Canada. I heard him many times. I want to say

will be respected as well.
<P>

House how many votes are enough?
<P>

him to go back home.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the trouble with the Prime Minister is he is not clear and 
precise on an issue desperately requiring clarity and precision.
<P>
	If the Prime Minister says he is to rely on the rule of law in an 
unprecedented situation, he should translate his position into 
legislative acts and motions before the House.
<P>
	Again, will he introduce a motion into the House, a solemn 
declaration affirming the people of Canada are free to determine 
their political destiny and that Parliament will not recognize a 
unilateral declaration of independence by any province?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the if the hon. member introduced a motion that a 50 per 
cent plus 1 vote would be enough to split Canada, I would vote 
against it. That is what he was arguing before.
<P>
	My view is that at the moment there is no referendum. At the 
moment we are working to make sure there will be progress in the 
federation and that there will be no need for a referendum. This is 
exactly what I am trying to do and what I have been working on. I 
made it clear there will be a meeting in June to improve the

	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in 1991, Quebec acted in good faith and complied with the 
federal government's request to harmonize its sales tax with the 
GST. It did so without any compensation. By comparison, three 
maritime provinces will get a gift of $1 billion from the federal 
government, including $250 million paid by Quebec taxpayers.
<P>
	How can the Minister of Finance explain that Quebec, which set 
an example of economic efficiency for the rest of Canada by 
harmonizing its sales tax with the GST, and which contributed to 
the smooth running of the Canadian economic and trade union, is 
being penalized, while provinces that had so far refused to 
harmonize their taxes are being rewarded?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
there is a formula to compensate provinces that will lose more than 
5 per cent of their sales tax revenues. This is not the case for 
Ontario, British Columbia, or Alberta. It is not currently the case 
for Quebec either, and it was not in 1990 when it signed the 
harmonization agreement.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Quebec harmonized its tax with the GST in 1991. Five 
years later, it is easy to say that it does not meet the requirements 
for compensation. It is easy to say so after the fact. But let us not 
forget that it was at the federal government's request that Quebec 
harmonized its tax. This is like inviting someone to dinner and 
making him pay, not only his own meal, but also that of the next 
table, since Quebec's contribution will amount to $250 million.

to pay to the Government of Quebec, as he is being asked by the 
province's deputy premier and minister of state for economy and 
finance, a fair compensation for having done its job before 
everyone else?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
we offered a compensation to all the provinces which, based on the 
formula, will lose money.
<P>

<P>
	Quebec did not lose money this year and did not lose any the 
year it signed the agreement. It is exactly in the same position as 
Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia. We will compensate the 
provinces that lost money.

	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is 
for the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.
<P>
	For several months now, the minister has been referring to the 
results of an impact study to justify his position on applying user 
fees to the coast guard. In a letter dated April 23 of this year, 
Christopher Wright, the author of the study, flatly contradicts the 
minister's assertions and says that it cannot be concluded from his 
study that the marine industry will be able to absorb the planned fee 
structure.
<P>
	Both of them cannot be right. Either the minister has 
misinterpreted the study in question, or he has misrepresented the 
results. In either case, can he inform this House on what he is now 
basing himself in sticking to his decision?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Fred Mifflin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, neither is true. The hon. member has to check his 
assumptions. I am not sure whether he is referring to the letter or 
the study, because some of the assumptions are different.
<P>
	In the impact study the assumptions were the following. Based 
on 309 million tonnes, which is transshipped in Canada, there 
would be a fee of $60 million, with the inclusion of ice breaking 
services, and there would be absolutely no cap on the amount of 
cargo that would be charged.
<P>
	The actual fee structure does not include ice breaking. It is put 
together at $20 million. There is a limitation on transshipment. For 
bulk cargoes we have a limitation of 50,000 tonnes. That is entirely 
different from the reference made by the author of the article who 
was, I believe, one of the consultants.
<P>
	The assumptions are different and therefore the conclusions 
must be different.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the minister 
could also take the time himself to reread the author's letter, which 
has been published, because, whatever the case may be, according 
to the actual study on the 20 million, the author also indicates that 
he is concerned about traffic being diverted from Canadian to 
American ports.
<P>
	Now that it is clearly established that the minister cannot rely on 
any study, what is he waiting for to scrap his user fees, until some 
serious and credible impact studies are done?

<P>
	<B>Hon. Fred Mifflin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, perhaps to further instruct the hon. member on the 
detail of these disagreements, the total volume of cargo the impact 
study stated as being sensitive to the fees at the $60 million level 
was that fees at $60 million represented 7 million tonnes, which is 
2 per cent of the 309 million tonnes in Canadian water borne 
commerce. Even if the assumption is $60 million we are still 
dealing with less than 2 per cent of the total volume.

	The Prime Minister is so reluctant to let his plans be known on 
national unity. We are facing a crisis here and he must speak up on 
this. He promised quite clearly, as he just referred to, in the 
government's throne speech that Canadians, no matter where they 
live, will have their say in the future of their country.
<P>
	When will the Prime Minister let Canadians have their say? Will 
he let them see this national unity plan? If so, will it be before or

have already discussed that with the provincial governments, and

offering no concrete measures. After the unemployed, it is now the 
turn of the handicapped to feel the wrath of the minister.
<P>
	Can the minister confirm that, besides paying them lip service in 
his report, the only concrete answer he has for advocacy groups for 
the handicapped is to cut their funding without warning and in an 
under-handed way, putting them in jeopardy?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, we often have the opportunity 
in this House to talk about jurisdiction, duplication, overlapping, 
responsibilities, and various levels of government with regard to 
individuals or activities.
<P>
	In the throne speech, we clearly indicated, as a government, that 
in all areas of shared jurisdiction, we were going to take every 
possible step to ensure a sound and hopefully fruitful dialogue.
<P>
	In this particular area, of course, the concerns of people affected 
by changes, due to either the federal or the provincial governments, 
are important. We are committed to keeping on talking with the 
provinces to make sure that people with special needs due to a 
handicap are well taken care of by the government responsible for 
their well being.

<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> It is the same thing.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead):</B> It is the

them that they are going to be scrapped. This is what the minister 
has decided.
<P>
	Is the minister telling us that the federal government will no 
longer meet its responsibilities with regard to the handicapped in 
areas under its jurisdiction, offloading them onto the provinces 
without any compensation?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am always intrigued when 
members of the official opposition speak about jurisdiction. I often 
wonder whether their motivation is based on concerns for the 
people who are affected and who have legitimate anxieties about 
changes in the way government delivers service or are they just 
interested in compensation.
<P>
	I was trying to indicate to the hon. member that if he is interested 
in taking care of associations and organizations, it is our objective 
to try to take care of the people who are affected by problems over 
which they have little or no control.
<P>
	I believe that handicapped Canadians in every part of the 
country, regardless of the nature of the handicap, are concerned 
about how governments will come to their assistance, not 
necessarily the organizations that purport to represent them. Some 
of these organizations do very good work. Other organizations are, 
to say the very least, in a situation where I think we have to look 
closely at the level of funding we provide for them.
<P>
	Our commitment is to take care of the people who need help. We 
will continue to discuss with those organizations that want to assist 
us in doing that their future and how they will be funded.

must recognize that it will be unable to achieve this goal.

	Many of the commitments in the red book on environment and 
sustainable development have been realized. We are also cognizant 
of the international commitment that was made at Rio and at Berlin 
on behalf of Canada and the international community. Climate 
change is something that we take seriously.

doing on those commitments.

important for not only Canada but for all countries to be transparent

unacceptable but he does not know what is acceptable; distinct 
society is okay, even though it was defeated in the Charlottetown

is its own creature, to try to play down its own responsibility in the 
historical fiasco with Montreal airports?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Bloc Quebecois is always pressuring me in this House 
to interfere either in the affairs of Quebec or those of some regional 
organization or another. We, in the federal government, do not want 
to get involved when it is not our responsibility to step in.
<P>
	The hon. member should be reminded that my mandate consists 
in ensuring that issues concerning aircraft and air carrier safety are 
considered.

	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the future 
of our great country is threatened because the government does not 
have the will or the imagination to come up with a national unity 
plan to answer the demand for change that I am hearing all over 
Ontario.
<P>
	The Prime Minister says that something big will happen at the 
first ministers' meeting. Ontario and the provinces need to know 
now whether he will stop delaying and announce whatever that 
something big is today?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, is there any rule against repetition in the House of 
Commons?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, talking 
about a lack of response or repetition, their answers would qualify.
<P>
	History will show that while Canada was being torn apart, the 
best this Liberal government could do was send in a lawyer to help 
with a court challenge. This is nothing short of a disgrace.
<P>
	The Reform Party had a plan. We made it public months ago. 
Reformers have shown leadership. Where is this government on 
leadership? My question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	The first minister's conference is only a few weeks away. Why is 
he stalling, why is he frustrating federalists across the country and 
why will he not announce his plan today?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, check <I>Hansard</I>: two, three or four will apply.
<P>
	I replied to this question many times. Members of the third party 
are preoccupied with unity now when they were all hiding outside 
Quebec last fall.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="GASPRICES">GAS PRICES</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Vic Althouse (Mackenzie, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	Using their power to boycott certain service stations, consumers 
have forced government into action on gas pricing. The public 
wants more than just a report under the Competition Act which 
says that prices have gone up. They know that already.
<P>
	Since it is already clear that the industry is not doing the 
responsible job of self-regulation that the Minister of Industry 
promised during consultations on amendments to the Competition 
Act, will the government create an  energy pricing commission 
with power to regulate and roll back unjustified price increases?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Minister for the 
Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, Minister of Western 
Economic Diversification and Minister responsible for the 
Federal Office of Regional Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we have a very decentralized federation as members 
opposite well know.
<P>
	When it comes to dealing with regulation of retail prices, I am 
sure the hon. member knows that would fall within the jurisdiction 
of a federal government if one were to choose to intervene in the 
market in that way.
<P>
	The member should also know that regulation of prices creates a 
certain amount of rigidity and from experience prices tend to be 
somewhat higher in markets where they have been regulated than 
in markets where competition is vibrant and vital.
<P>
	Our objective in this whole gas pricing affair is to ensure that we 
have a very open marketplace where competition is real. We will 
do our utmost to enforce the laws, ensuring that there will be real 
competition. That together with consumers who are diligent will be 
our best guarantee that prices will come down.

	<B>Mrs. Carolyn Parrish (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Minister of International Co-operation.
<P>
	While no Canadians can tolerate the acts of terrorism committed 
by Hamas in Israel, we currently have a human rights concern there 
with hundreds of thousands of women and children being deprived 
of medical supplies and food. Is there anything Canada can do to 
help in this situation?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, at the last pledging conference, Canada offered to 
contribute $5.5 million to help with the health, education and water 
supplies in the West Bank and Palestine. That brings the total 
contributions to about $70 million since 1993.
<P>
	Last night in Montreal I attended a meeting of the Canadian, 
Jewish and Arab communities, where they got together to talk for 
the first time about what Canada had contributed. What is really 
important is that the private sector should come together, 
improving investment, commerce, trade and development. That is 
the most important way we can give hope to the Palestinian people.

	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to present a petition from the citizens of Brandon, 
Manitoba.
<P>
	The petitioners would like to to bring to the attention of the 
House that the consumption of alcoholic beverages may cause 
health problems or impair one's ability and specifically that fetal 
alcohol syndrome and other alcohol related birth defects are 100 
per cent preventable by avoiding alcohol consumption during 
pregnancy.
<P>
<B>(1505 )</B>
<P>
	The petitioners therefore pray and call upon Parliament to enact

containers of all alcoholic beverages to caution expectant mothers 
and others of the risks associated with alcohol consumption.

	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
pursuant to Standing Order 36 I am pleased to table a petition today 
signed by several members of the Beaver River constituency from 
Thorhild and Radway, as well as several individuals from 
Edmonton.
<P>
	The petitioners state that the majority of Canadians believe that 
the privileges which society accords to heterosexual couples should 
not be extended to same sex relationships, and that societal 
approval, including the extension of societal privileges, would be 
given to same sex relationships if any amendment to the Canadian 
Human Rights Act were to include the undefined phrase of sexual 
orientation as a ground of discrimination. They therefore pray and 
request that Parliament not amend the Canadian Human Rights Act 
or the charter of rights and freedoms in any way which would tend 
to indicate societal approval of same sex relationships or of 
homosexuality, including amending the Canadian Human Rights 
Act to include in the prohibited grounds of discrimination the 
undefined phrase of sexual orientation.

Two of the petitions are from the constituency of Port 
Moody-Coquitlam and two are from Ontario.
<P>
	All of the petitioners pray and request that Parliament not amend 
the Canadian Human Rights Act or the charter of rights and 
freedoms in any way that would tend to indicate societal approval 
of same sex relationships or of homosexuality, including amending 
the Canadian Human Rights Act to include in the prohibited

two, that the boundaries of Canada, its provinces, territories and 
territorial waters may be modified only by (a) a free vote of all

<P>
	The petitioners draw the attention of the House to the fact that

	The petitioners pray and request that Parliament proceed 
immediately with amendments to the Criminal Code which will

impaired or causing injury or death while impaired reflects the 
severity of the crime and reflects a zero tolerance toward this crime 
by our government.

	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have a large number of petitions which I have put into 
two groups.
<P>
	I am pleased to present seven petitions today on the subject of 
gasoline taxes. The petitioners come from many areas of my riding.
<P>
	Because the cost of a litre of gasoline is about 52 per cent 
government taxes and because excise taxes on gasoline have risen 
by 566 per cent in the past 10 years,  the petitioners ask Parliament 
to not increase taxes on gasoline. They feel that we need to use the 
natural advantage of a low cost energy source to offset the high cost 
of transporting our goods over great distances to reach their 
markets.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="HUMANRIGHTS">HUMAN RIGHTS</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the second group contains 59 petitions signed by 
concerned citizens from all across Canada.
<P>
	They oppose the inclusion of the phrase sexual orientation in the 
Canadian Human Rights Act. The signatures number 1,471 in total 
and the petitions are still pouring into my office. These Canadians 
believe freedom from discrimination is already protected in the 
human rights act without this amendment. A brief summary of this 
petition indicates that they feel the inclusion of this category will 
infringe on the rights and freedoms of Canadians in the areas of 
religion, conscience, belief, expression and association.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have two 
petitions to present today on behalf of the constituents of Simcoe 
Centre.
<P>
	The first group of petitioners request that the Government of 
Canada not amend federal legislation to include the phrase sexual 
orientation. The petitioners fear that such an inclusion could lead to 
homosexuals receiving the same benefits and societal privileges as 
married people.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="AGEOFCONSENT">AGE OF CONSENT</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the second

years to protect children from sexual exploitation and abuse.

	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have the privilege of presenting three petitions this 
afternoon, all of which deal with Bill C-33.

	The petitioners pray that the Parliament of Canada not pass any

include the phrase sexual orientation. The petitions are from Cilia 
Bergsma, the Victory Christian Center and Beulah Alliance 
Church.

	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on March 6, 1996, I put a question to the government 
regarding the existence within the Privy Council, or in the federal 
government, of an special emergency measures co-ordinating unit. 
Although more than 45 days have passed, I have still not received a 
reply. I wonder when the government will be good enough to give 
an answer to a lowly MP. The question was Q-19.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Zed:</B> Mr. Speaker, I can respond to the hon. member that the 
information I have is that the answer is still being prepared.

to ask the government House leader when I can expect to receive 
answers to my three questions on the Order Paper, Nos. 2, 3 and 4. 
These questions first appeared on the Order Paper in the second 
session of the 35th Parliament on February 27, 1996. I requested an 
answer from the government within 45 days. As of today, 79 days 
have passed.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My dear colleague, subject to being corrected I 
believe that these answers were tabled today. Is that correct?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Zed:</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish my colleague would take yes for 
an answer. The member will find that we tabled Question No. 3 
today which I believe was the bulk of the member's concern. With

<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to participate in 
the debate, which is at the report stage but which is also at the 
second reading stage as the bill had been referred directly to 
committee. This bill is about the commercialization of civil air 
navigation services. Behind this bill is a commendable goal: trying 
to make air navigation services more efficient, more profitable, by 
reducing operating costs.
<P>
	If the bill referred to this goal while recognizing that safety is 
paramount, the Bloc Quebecois, the official opposition, could 
support it. We are proposing a number  of amendments, and some 
of the most important ones are in the first group.
<P>
	What we really want is a preamble to the bill, which would be 
used as an interpretive clause for the whole bill and would ensure 
that safety is always paramount. Privatization or the establishment 
of a non-profit organization in charge of managing air navigation 
services, strikes a balance in a way.
<P>
	We have gone from living in an era when everything was 
managed by the public sector to creating a non-profit organization 
that must become viable. Along the way, however, we forgot to set 
aviation safety criteria based on operational requirements in this 
area, in which errors can have disastrous consequences.
<P>
	Yes, we must bring excessive costs under control, but without 
throwing the baby out with the bath water. We want to make sure 
that safety has priority over all other considerations and that is the 
purpose of our preamble. We hope the government will pay 
attention to our arguments.
<P>
	There is another aspect we regard as important, as essential even, 
an aspect which, in our opinion, must be approved as an 
amendment if the bill is to be acceptable to Quebecers, to 
Canadians, to users and to those who operate the system: small 
carriers must be given an active role to play.
<P>
	During consideration of the bill in committee, we realized that 
the board of directors of Nav Canada, on which will sit 
representatives of all air navigation stakeholders, did not include 
enough small carriers. So how will we decide in the future what to 
charge carriers for air navigation services? There are people who 
do not have enough of a say.
<P>
	Among these is the Association québécoise des transporteurs 
aériens, which was unable to get a guaranteed seat on Nav Canada's 
board of directors. We all know the importance of this industry as 
far as the use of the French language in the future is concerned. 
This is an industry where there have been problems for several 
years. Today still, it is a daily battle for those working in this 
industry to ensure French is recognized.
<P>
	The bill states that the Official Languages Act will apply to Nav 
Canada. Fine, but we feel that many other aspects of everyday use 
of French in air travel are insufficiently protected. The use of 
French is one thing, but there are also many economic 
considerations.
<P>
	For example, there is a risk with a fee structure based only on 
criteria favouring large carriers, should it established. When the 
time will come for the board to decide on a pricing system, since 
the people sitting on the board are there to look after their own 
interests, naturally they will make sure that the fee structure 
selected is the one that penalizes them the least.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2820"> 2820 </A></B>
<P>
	A decision that impacts only minimally on very large carriers 
may destroy small carriers.
<P>
<B>(1540)</B>
<P>
	Very small air navigation companies do not have very high profit 
margins. The fee structure could make the difference between a 
given operation being profitable or becoming unprofitable, spelling 
the death of small carriers in the medium term. This point was 
made to us in committee by many witnesses, especially those in the 
tourist transportation industry, such as outfitters and other small 
carriers operating on lines which are not major commercial lines. 
These lines are a source of income for them and constitute, among 
other things, an interesting business activity for remote 
communities.
<P>
	The second thing we felt important to include in our preamble is 
the fact that there should be a balance between small and large 
carriers in Nav Canada's operations, thus eliminating the need to 
hold a debate to specifically guarantee a small carrier a seat on Nav 
Canada's board of directors. Our intention is that the preamble will 
create a moral obligation, a need for statutory interpretation 
whereby small carrier representatives will be able to take their 
cases to the board of directors and have their say.
<P>
	The third subject covered in the proposed preamble, which we 
hope to see the government add to its bill, is northern and remote 
communities. It must be realized that, while the bill changes the air 
traffic control system and allows a non profit corporation to take 
over this system, it does not oblige the corporation to take the 
economic impact of its decisions on the regions into account.
<P>
	For example, in the case of the airport in Mont-Joli, or any other 
regional airport with air navigation equipment, Nav Canada will 
have to decide, when trying to determine future equipment needs, 
whether to buy new equipment, and what to install for safety 
purposes at the airport.
<P>
	Senior public servants told the committee that, under the bill, the 
corporation is under no obligation to take the economic impact of a 
regional airport into account. If equipment required to meet safety 
requirements represent a major investment in terms of the volume 
of traffic at the airport, the equipment might not be bought, thus 
reducing the impact of the airport and resulting, in the long term, in 
its closure.
<P>
	Nothing is provided in this bill to allow those concerned by the 
region's economic development to express their views. Several 
other amendments will therefore be moved so that, when changes 
are anticipated, the regional community will have to be informed 
through the media and all other suitable means to ensure that 
decisions are not made without consideration of their impact on the 
region. Decisions must not be made without the knowledge of 
interested  local parties, to ensure they do not lead to a crisis. This 
is the third element of our proposed preamble to the bill.
<P>
	We could consider the bill to be acceptable if the government 
included these three points in a preamble, namely to consider 
safety as a paramount concern, to provide an adequate role for 
small carriers, to protect airports in northern and remote regions, 
and to guarantee that interested parties have a say when Nav 
Canada makes decisions regarding equipment in regional airports.
<P>
	The system could probably be changed effectively if such 
elements were included to ensure an adequate balance regarding 
the issues of safety, regions and small carriers.
<P>
	Under the current system, costs were somewhat out of control 
and the expected level of satisfaction was not necessarily met. 
There would now be a return to private activity.
<P>
	The government must analyse the situation, find a balance and 
come up with a solution ensuring the paramountcy of safety. After 
all, safety is the primary responsibility of Nav Canada.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, it is a privilege to respond to 
the amendments the hon. member put to the House. A great deal of 
work has been done by the Standing Committee on Transport, 
which I had the privilege to chair in my previous incarnation.
<P>
	In this situation we have witnessed an agreement that transfers 
Canada's air navigation system to the private sector. This is by no 
means an easy task with all the nuances and all the negotiations that 
must take place between the two sides for a move from essentially 
a crown corporation, a government entity, to a not for profit 
corporation. Imagine all the legalities involved in such an 
undertaking.
<P>
	This change was made with a minimal number of bumps in the 
road. There was agreement on almost all the nuances that took 
place between both the federal government and the not for profit 
corporation, Nav Canada.
<P>
	Nav Canada came to the federal government with this proposal. 
It was not that the federal government went out looking, but the 
proposal was made and it was a solid proposal. As I have just 
heard, the proposal was endorsed by the member opposite from the 
Bloc. We on this side of the House agreed with the hon. member 
when he said Bill C-20 is good legislation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2821"> 2821 </A></B>
<P>
	As with any legislation there is some discussion on the ability to 
see clearly each clause in a piece of legislation to ensure that each 
one of these clauses is accurate and  does what is in the best 
interests of the travelling public and Canadians at large.
<P>
	Priority number one for Transport Canada and for Nav Canada 
has been safety. The hon. member opposite raised three issues in 
the first group of amendments which I will speak to. The insertion 
in the preamble is in our opinion unnecessary. The legal effect of a 
preamble is to assist in the interpretation of other sections of 
legislation. The three issues dealt with in this motion by the hon. 
member, as well as Motions Nos. 2 and 3 which I will address 
separately, are specifically addressed within the legislation already. 
The value of the preamble is doubtful at best.
<P>
	A preamble on safety is definitely unnecessary. For example, 
clause 5 clearly establishes the supremacy of the Aeronautics Act, 
the legislation that governs safety. We all know safety is the most 
important aspect of any mode of transportation, in particular this 
mode of transportation.
<P>
	Members opposite have alleged the bill does not adequately 
address safety. Bill C-20 is intended to deal only with the transfer 
of Transport Canada's air navigation services to a single not for 
profit company and with the commercial and economic regulatory 
arrangements for the continued operation of those services.
<P>
	Clearly Bill C-20 establishes the supremacy of the Aeronautics 
Act. Section 5 states that nothing in this act affects the application 
of the Aeronautics Act. Section 14 states that changes in services 
and facilities must be subject to the Aeronautics Act, including any 
regulations made under the act that relate to aviation safety or the 
safety of the public.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	The preamble proposed by the hon. member opposite is bound to 
overlook some important matter that otherwise would be dealt with 
in the legislation. In the preamble proposed in Motion No. 1 there 
is no mention of the safety of private and recreational aviation. We 
do not want to put forward a preamble that might be void of critical 
and important aspects that would affect the rest of the bill. We feel 
that is covered in clause 5, which states the supremacy of the 
Aeronautics Act.
<P>
	The Bloc member who proposed the second motion is a new 
member on the Standing Committee on Transport. He is well 
versed on the matters of transportation and has been a hard working 
member of the committee. We can tell the differences between 
members who bother to care about anything in committee work. 
This hon. member surely does.
<P>
	On this motion, an insertion in the preamble, given the three 
issues dealt with in the motion as well as Motions Nos. 2 and 3 are 
addressed in the legislation, again we are not convinced of the 
usefulness or value of this motion.
<P>
	It is about charging and it is completely unnecessary. The 
charging principles contained in clause 35 and the associated 
opportunity to appeal charges to the National Transportation 
Agency as well as the diversity of interests represented on the Nav 
Canada board remove the need for a preamble dealing with equality 
of opportunity and charging for large and small carriers.
<P>
	Rather than clarify the charging principles, the proposed 
language in the preamble may well confuse matters. In this case it 
is the expression ``equality of opportunity''. I am not sure what that 
means. It is ambiguous. It is certainly less clear than the charging 
principles outlined in clause 35 of this legislation.
<P>
	The final representation by the member, Motion No. 3, requests 
that Nav Canada recognize Canada is a country in which air 
services to the north and remote regions are necessary. Clauses 18 
to 22 and the charging principles contained in clause 35(1)(g) take 
care of the concerns of the hon. member about services to remote 
regions of the country.
<P>
	Clauses 18 to 22 establish a special process for designated 
current air navigation services in northern and remote parts of the 
country. This designation means that if Nav Canada, the new 
private not for profit company, wishes to terminate or reduce any of 
these services in a way likely to affect a significant group of users 
or residents in any material way, it first must give public notice and 
then must have the concurrence of all the affected provincial or 
territorial governments and a quorum of users or the approval of 
the Minister of Transport. Clauses 18 through 22 certainly make 
the addition of a preamble in this area unnecessary as well.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Mercier:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not fully understand. It is 
obvious that we will shortly be voting on the motions group by 
group. For the moment, we are looking at Motions Nos. 1, 2 and 3. 
Of course, we are going to read them and comment on them, group 
by group, and, if I have understood correctly, go on to the vote. I 
presume that it is not a question of forgoing a vote by accepting in 
advance to the motions as presented.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The member is quite right. The Chair is in 
agreement with what the member has said. All the groups of 
motions will be debated, but the deputy government whip has 
merely asked that the Chair dispense with reading all the motions. 
That is all. 
<P>
	Is there consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am very pleased the parliamentary secretary spoke 
before I did. It was my understanding that it was to be Bloc, Liberal 
and Reform. At least that is the normal rotation. That is why I 
assumed that was what we were doing.
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary in essence said many of the things I 
would have said. I thank him for saving me from digging through 
all of that.
<P>
	The consideration for Nav Canada is to run a business guided by 
economic and financial considerations, with safety of paramount 
importance, regulated by the government.
<P>
	However, one thing the parliamentary secretary said which I find 
exceedingly interesting was that he thought it inappropriate to list 
certain types of operators, small and large, and not address other 
groups such as private and recreational users, leaving them off the 
list. I find it interesting that the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Transport feels it is bad to create lists if some people 
are to be left off.
<P>
	I suggest he review the blues on what he said and then read Bill 
C-33, which the government has just passed and which I believe he 
voted in favour of. That was the principal argument of the Reform 
Party.
<P>
	Likewise, I suggest the Prime Minister of Canada read that list 
because now with this action dealing with the referendum question 
in Quebec he is stating how important it is to uphold the rule of law, 
as is the Minister of Justice. I would ask them why they did not  
think the same way when they brought in the bill on Pearson airport 
where the rule of law was clearly subverted.
<P>
	We will not be supporting the Bloc motions on this for reasons 
that have been adequately stated by the hon. parliamentary 
secretary.
<P>
	In essence, we feel these would politicize the mandate of Nav 
Canada, and that is clearly not the intent of the bill.
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Mercier (Blainville-Deux-Montagnes, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as my colleague for Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup has 
said, we agree with privatization in principle, but we have 
considerable reservations about its key mechanisms, so much so 
that, should the amendments we will be presenting not be accepted, 
we will find ourselves forced to vote against this bill.
<P>
	For the moment, we are talking about the motions in Group No. 
1, which address the preamble we wish to see at the beginning of 
the bill, and which we see as important in expressing the ultimate 
purpose of the bill.
<P>
	Nav Canada is a private body, but one that provides a public 
service. Because of that private status, perhaps the public will not 
have the guarantees and services it would otherwise, if the body 
had not been privatized.
<P>
	The essence of our opposition to certain aspects of the bill 
therefore lies with that point, that a private body providing a public 
service must deliver the same quality and quantity of services as 
would be provided without privatization.
<P>
	For an overview of our position, I shall digress a little to list the 
points covered in the motions of Group No. 1.
<P>
	There are six applications to the principle I have just set out. The 
first addresses safety. Public safety may be reduced by 
privatization. I think that this is a perfectly obvious principle, and 
one that must be set out explicitly in the preamble.
<P>
	The second point is that Nav Canada's concern for profits must 
not, either now or later, lead to the reduction of services to northern 
and isolated regions. In terms of its viability, service in these 
regions might be considered less profitable, but we feel that this 
ought not to be a reason for Nav Canada's cutting back on services. 
We therefore insist that the preamble explicitly include the 
principle of maintaining services to northern and isolated regions.
<P>
	This is also the case for the necessity of protecting the interests 
of the small shippers, whose profit margin is very slim and who 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2823"> 2823 </A></B>
<P>
could run into rate problems if their interests were neglected in 
favour of the large companies  which, we feel, were the source of 
most of the influence on the government around this proposed bill.
<P>
	These three points I have listed are the ones covered in the 
motions of Group No. 1. We will have an opportunity very soon-I 
am stating them here to establish our overall position-in Group 
No. 2, to talk about the need for sufficient local dissemination of 
the changes Nav Canada would propose to charges or to the quality 
or quantity of services.
<P>
	We will also have to intervene to prevent private clients from 
having to pay indirectly for services provided to public clients such 
as organizations designated by National Defence; then, and this is 
extremely important, we will have-and this concludes the 
overview of our objections to the bill-to protect the personal 
information on clients and personnel held by Nav Canada.
<P>
	Generally speaking, this leads me to say that, when the federal 
government delegates its power to an organization it has created, 
services to the public must not be cut.
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	This sort of delegation must not-and this applies to ADM as 
well-result in the organization created serving as a screen 
between the public and the government so that, as the Minister of 
Transport has just said, the government cannot say: ``It is ADM; or, 
it is Nav Canada. We are innocent of the blood of this just person'', 
in the words of Pontius Pilate.
<P>
	There is no way we will accept this surreptitious dropping of a 
hot potato, under the guise of decentralization, with the blame 
being directed elsewhere: ``It is not me, it is Nav Canada; or, it is 
not me, it is ADM''. We totally object to this handy way to fob off 
responsibilities.
<P>
	This summarizes my position on these three aspects of block 1. I 
will no doubt have occasion to rise again on the other aspects I have 
spoken to briefly.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
not on the transport committee, but I was in the aviation field for a 
number of years, and when I caught wind of this issue, I saw there 
were some things not right about the bill.
<P>
	As my colleagues have said, we are not against the bill, but there 
are certain things that are slipping past the public, and in some 
respects the issue is such a complex one that people are not 
reacting.
<P>
	We are in agreement with the privatization of air navigation 
services. It is a good idea. We have reached the point where we 
must pay. The problem is the manner in which the government is 
going about it. They have created an agency called Nav Canada to 
examine ways of privatizing air navigation services.
<P>
	The first problem is that in the group of 15 people making up the 
board there are very few, if any, representatives of small carriers. It 
is for this reason that I wished to speak on Motion No. 2. When Nav 
Canada has to decide on fees for users and carriers, will it take 
small carriers into consideration?
<P>
	I come from a remote area, Lac-Saint-Jean, where the air link 
between Montreal and Alma is very important, and small carriers 
like Air Alma are essential. A study has been done showing that if 
the price of an airline ticket goes up by one dollar, there are losses 
of one dollar on this same ticket as a result of this bill. Each time 
airfares go up, there are some very negative repercussions for 
airline companies.
<P>
	What I find fascinating is that the only reactions come from 
Quebec. There is very little reaction from other air carriers. We 
were told that Nav Canada's board includes representatives of 
small carriers such as Air B.C. Air B.C. has BA-146s, which can 
carry 146 passengers; this, in my book, does not make it a small 
carrier.
<P>
	What is interesting and important is that, first of all, this board 
should include Quebec members so that French language air 
navigation services are always well represented. We are also 
proposing that AQTA, the Association québécoise des 
transporteurs aériens, be represented.
<P>
	At a recent committee meeting, we were told that the president 
of AQTA had refused. I have here a letter from ATAC, the Air 
Transportation Association of Canada, which refers to the 
invitation to the president of AQTA to sit on the Nav Canada board. 
I have a second letter in which the president agrees to sit on the 
board. I have a third letter saying that, unfortunately, the president 
of AQTA will not be able to sit on the board. This is a major 
disappointment because AQTA represents both Quebec and small 
carriers.
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	Within Nav Canada small carriers are represented by the 
president of ATAC, Mr. Crichton, who also represents ATAC. The 
problem is that some 70 per cent of ATAC's funding comes from 
large carriers. One therefore has good reason to fear that the way 
air services are taxed may hurt small carriers.
<P>
	You may argue that small carriers are not happy because the 
price of their tickets will go up a little. This could have a very 
negative impact, even on chambers of commerce. I think it was the 
Matane chamber of commerce that sent the Prime Minister a letter 
saying: ``It is about time to lower the price of tickets''. This goes to 
show how important this is, because the prices have to be 
reasonable for the representatives of chambers of commerce 
routinely doing business with Montreal to be able to get to 
Montreal regularly.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2824"> 2824 </A></B>
<P>
	Not only are air carriers adversely affected, but employment in 
regional airlines, chambers of commerce and any company doing 
business with Montreal and across Canada are also adversely 
affected.
<P>
	This may look like nothing, but I think it could have serious 
consequences not only in Quebec but also across Canada. Some 
will say: ``Why is Quebec the only province griping about this?'' 
That is because, in Quebec, we have a permanent organization 
known as the Association québécoise des transporteurs aériens. I 
say ``we'' because I worked in that field for three years. Our 
purpose in having a permanent organization is to ensure that all 
small carriers are represented by an association capable of 
analysing the issues concerning them.
<P>
	Another problem I can see with the Nav Canada committee is the 
fact that Nav Canada is not accountable to the people. After the 
committee has been established, it is very important to undeerstand 
that small carriers must have a say. If they disagree with 
something- because of the lack of representation I mentioned 
earlier-will they be heard, even if they take to the streets? There is 
cause to be very sceptical.
<P>
	As my hon. colleague indicated, the same kinds of problems 
were encountered with ADM. Nav Canada then acts as a shield 
behind which the government can hide by saying: ``This is no 
longer our responsibility. Blame Nav Canada''. Except that Nav 
Canada was created by the government. Again, we realize that the 
system is flawed in that regard. We have every reason to examine a 
consideration that could have very serious consequences.
<P>
	It is also important, in considering this bill, to take a look at the 
various forms of taxation. At present, three separate methods of 
taxation could be contemplated. There is, however, reason to 
believe that only one of them would work to the benefit of small 
carriers, but that Nav Canada is not considering that particular one.
<P>
	I will sum up by saying that I really hope that the government 
will be able to revise its bill at least to include small carriers and an 
AQTA representative, so that small carriers can have a say about 
the method of taxation. It would be much too complicated to get 
into the various methods, although I touched on the subject, but all 
I really want is for the minister to allow an AQTA representative to 
sit on his committee. I am not asking for anything complicated. In 
fact, it is quite simple, yet it would be very important.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Guimond:</B> Mr. Speaker, is this still debate, or are we now at 
questions and comments?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> This is the period for ten-minute 
speeches, without questions or comments.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I  am pleased to take part in the debate on Bill 
C-20 which, among others, establishes a corporation called Nav 
Canada.
<P>
	I want to stress the importance of the Bloc Quebecois' first 
motion. The motion proposes that the preamble of the bill includes 
a mention that the safety of passengers, personnel, air carriers and 
the public has priority over all other considerations in the decisions 
taken by Nav Canada. This motion seeks to have the government 
and Nav Canada recognize that public safety and interest take 
precedence over money considerations.
<P>
	I have been the Bloc Quebecois critic on this issue since the last 
election, two and a half years ago. Our party did not oppose the 
privatization or, rather, the commercialization of civil air 
navigation services. We did, however, have some reservations and 
we still do.
<P>
	For example, we know that, given modern technology and 
satellites, air traffic control services for all of Canada could be 
provided from a single location, for example a mall in Mississauga 
or North Vancouver. One of the Bloc Quebecois' concerns was the 
preservation of French in this area.
<P>
	As members of the official opposition, we have a duty to be 
vigilant. In the years 1975-76, a battle took place in Quebec 
regarding the use of French by air traffic controllers. This episode 
turned out to be a determining factor in the Parti Quebecois' 
victory on November 15, 1976. Thanks to these efforts, a French 
speaking pilot and a French speaking air traffic controller could 
now communicate in French. This was not the case before. Until 
then, two francophones were forced to speak English to each other, 
seemingly for safety reasons.
<P>
	We do not want such gains, including those of the Association 
des gens de l'air du Québec, to have been made in vain and to 
simply be forgotten. This is why I just mentioned that modern 
technology makes it possible to set up, in a Mississauga mall, a 
national air traffic control centre that would include Quebec's 
airspace. This is particularly true now that a corporation primarily 
interested in making profits will have responsibility over this 
sector. We are not talking about a charity or a non profit 
corporation. Consequently, profits might take precedence over the 
requirement to provide services in French in Quebec's airspace.
<P>
	Despite the victory won by the Association des gens de l'air in 
1976, still today, on the Lower North Shore, still today, in the 
Magdalen Islands-and we in the Bloc Quebecois have regularly 
asked questions about this-pilots tell us that they have trouble 
being served in French in some sectors, including the one covered 
by the Moncton area control centre, which is apparently supposed 
to be bilingual.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2825"> 2825 </A></B>
<P>
	I also wanted to speak to Motion No. 2, because we realize that 
there is a certain common denominator in the composition of Nav 
Canada's board of directors, and  that the large airline companies 
are very well represented.
<P>
	Our new colleague from Lac-Saint-Jean has, I believe, his pilot's 
licence and therefore knows whereof he speaks, and did so most 
eloquently a moment ago, in my opinion. Where I find fault, as 
does my colleague, is with the composition of Nav Canada's board 
of directors. It is unfortunate that this government did not respect 
the wish of small carriers to be represented, to be listened to.
<P>
	So this will be just large carriers, and regional carriers will not 
be heard from. Is it acceptable, for example, that the Association 
québécoise des transporteurs aériens cannot sit on Nav Canada's 
board of directors? Is that realistic?
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	What were we told in the Standing Committee on Transport? 
That the association was a member of the Canadian council, and 
will therefore be indirectly represented. I am sorry, but this does 
not really meet the expectations of the aviation sector, in any event, 
not those of Quebec carriers.
<P>
	The bottom line is that if all the seats are held by representatives 
of large carriers, the priorities set regarding cost per passenger 
could also give them an advantage over small carriers. Because we 
know that what matters is who gets in there first. If someone in the 
family makes a big chocolate cake and the first person to come 
along helps himself to a great big piece, the others will have 
nothing but the crumbs that are left to divide up among them.
<P>
	Human nature being what it is, the big companies will not want 
to assume the lion's share of the bill, so they will arrange to pay 
just a bit of it and to pass the rest on to the small regional carriers, 
who will not be able to afford it. And who will the small carriers 
pass the buck to, since their profit margins are so slim? To the 
passengers.
<P>
	When I was in the Saguenay, I recall being told that flying from 
Bagotville to Montreal costs more than from Montreal to Miami 
and, in certain seasons, more than a round trip ticket 
Montreal-Paris. They used Bagotville-Montreal as an example, 
but it could as easily have been Val-d'Or-Montreal, 
Sept-Îles-Montreal, or Gaspé-Montreal. This is aberrant. Once 
again, the people in the regions are the ones to be penalized by such 
a decision.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois is concerned about the potential impact of 
Bill C-120 in this area. We are proposing, and this is the purpose of 
our motions, that an addition be made to the preamble stipulating 
that Nav Canada must commit to maintaining equality of 
opportunity between small and large carriers when imposing all the 
charges.
<P>
	I will conclude on this point, because time is running out. The 
third and final motion I wish to comment on  attempts to include in 
the preamble the fact Nav Canada must recognize that Canada is a 
country where air service to northern and remote regions is 
essential. A tour of Dorval airport reveals that it is not only the 
people of Dorval who fly out of it. People in transit at Dorval come 
from the regions and are on their way to another destination, such 
as the south, Europe or other provinces in Canada. They are people 
from the regions, and we must take this into consideration with 
respect to air services.
<P>
	The aim with this provision is to establish a parameter for 
interpretation purposes, drawing attention to the fact that one of 
Nav Canada's prime objectives is to serve the regions.
<P>
	In conclusion, we must remember that it is true Quebec has 
Montreal and Canada has Toronto, Vancouver and Calgary, but we 
must not forget that Quebec and Canada are made up of regions as 
well. Sometimes decisions made centrally here in Ottawa by 
bureaucrats do not take the regions into account.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ): </B>Mr. Speaker, like my 
colleagues, I too am happy to speak to Bill C-20 on the 
commercialization of civil air navigation services. In the final 
analysis, what we are discussing today is the establishment of a 
private air navigation corporation.
<P>
	I think that the Bloc Quebecois has a duty to review the bill 
before us very carefully. After looking at the motions to be debated, 
I asked to speak. Although I was not on the committee, I asked to 
speak because I was a long time member of SOPRAM, the 
organization promoting the Montreal airports, which revolves 
around ADM and the Montreal airports. I asked to speak because I 
thought we had done a good job, especially on the motions before 
us today in Group No. 1, including the motions saying that safety 
must take precedence over commercial considerations.
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
	Of course, the private corporation being formed will try to make 
a profit. I remember that, for ADM, this was often an area of 
concern. We often looked at safety versus deregulation, versus 
privatization, as there is a tendency to confuse deregulation with 
privatization.
<P>
	We also realize that setting up a commercial, for-profit 
corporation is often done at the expense of safety. Even our 
American friends are asking questions about this whole issue, as 
we saw with the crash of a ValuJet DC-9. Investigators in the U.S. 
are asking if Americans are safe when these companies may be 
cutting corners on safety to make a little more profit.
<P>
	We may wonder if, in Nav Canada's decisions, people's safety 
will take precedence over making a little more profit. As far as the 
safety of passengers, personnel and the public is concerned, it 
seems quite logical and right that the preamble to the bill should 
provide that safety take precedence over Nav Canada's profits.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2826"> 2826 </A></B>
<P>
	I often like to give examples from my riding. In Saint-Jean, we 
have an airport with a control tower paid for by Transport Canada. 
What will happen the day after Nav Canada takes over? I made 
some enquiries today. Naturally, officials at Transport Canada are 
telling me: ``Do not worry, Mr. Bachand. In any case, Nav Canada 
will take perhaps a year or more to consider what it should divest 
itself of, what it should keep and what to do with what it keeps''.
<P>
	There are about 50,000 aircraft movements per year at the 
Saint-Jean airport. Dynamair, a flying school, is responsible for the 
majority of these movements. Of course, teaching students to fly a 
plane means many takeoffs and landings. The same is true of the 
gliding school where air cadets attend glider training every 
summer. You will understand that the bill before us has an impact 
on my riding as a region.
<P>
	I must admit that we are somewhat concerned about what would 
happen if, a year from now, Nav Canada said: ``We have decided to 
make changes at the control tower in Saint-Jean. Air traffic will no 
longer be controlled by air controllers, but by people like those of 
the UNICOM project, for example''. A single individual mans the 
tower and directs traffic. That is a bit on the lean side. These are not 
professionals like air controllers. They will have to call upon the 
services of the airport in Saint-Hubert.
<P>
	This raises serious questions in my mind and in the minds of my 
constituents about the impact this bill here today will have.
<P>
	What will happen to the flying school for instance if we no 
longer have air controllers at our airport? This is rather serious, 
considering that there are often three, four or five aircraft taking off 
and landing, not to mention the possibility of a plane from another 
airport entering the school's airspace.
<P>
	We are right to warn the government. We agree on the issue of 
profits for Nav Canada, but these profits should not jeopardize 
safety. We also wonder about the other side of the issue, the 
introduction of user fees. Some of my colleagues just gave the 
example of large carriers versus small ones. This is the object of 
Motion No. 2. Industry officials in Quebec told me that the 
Association québécoise des transporteurs aériens would have liked 
to be represented on Nav Canada's board.
<P>
	The minister at the time, who is now the Minister of Human 
Resources Development, said: ``You are only a regional 
association''. I happen to think that Quebec is larger than a region.
<P>
<B>(1630)</B>
<P>
	This was not good enough for the minister. He added: ``See if 
you can form a group''. A council of air carrier associations was set 
up. It included the Quebec association and several other 
associations in Canada. Some 800 companies were represented by 
the council.
<P>
	After forming the council, these people asked again for a seat on 
Nav Canada's board, but the minister told them they could not be 
represented, because the work was already too advanced. People 
were upset that they had taken the time to form a council, only to be 
told by the minister that, as small carriers, they would be excluded 
from Nav Canada, that only Air Canada, Canadian and all the large 
carriers would be represented. The danger exists that Air Canada 
and Canadian will say that they want preferential rates, and that if 
Nav Canada wants more money it has only to turn to the small 
carriers.
<P>
	This has an effect both on privatization and on control towers. 
There are also repercussions for users, such as the pilots' school I 
mentioned earlier, and the air cadets, who might be slapped with 
user fees. Right now, there are no user fees at Saint-Jean. Airplanes 
landing and taking off from Saint-Jean pay no fees.
<P>
	This could have major consequences for an industry such as 
Dynamair, which could find itself paying fees for each landing and 
take off. These are the negative consequences. This is why the 
motion before us today says that safety must take precedence over 
business considerations.
<P>
	In conclusion, I would be remiss if I neglected to mention 
remote areas. You know that, as Indian affairs critic, I am often 
required to travel to remote areas. These people are worried also, 
because air services are absolutely essential to them. I think that 
the bill before us does is neither satisfactory nor sufficiently 
reassuring for these areas.
<P>
	The motions moved by my colleagues in the Bloc Quebecois add 
the necessary amendments and safety for remote areas. I thought 
this needed to be said. I invite the government to join us and agree 
to these motions, which will increase safety and take account of 
remote areas in Quebec and in Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philippe Paré (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to take my turn in speaking to Bill C-20. First of all, I 
would like to remind you that, in July 1994, when the former 
Minister of Transport, now Minister of Human Resources 
Development, released the policy for commercializing airports and 
air navigation, the Bloc Quebecois came out in favour of the 
principle.
<P>
	At that time, however, we did not know how this new policy 
would take shape, and so we voiced some reservations on its 
application.
<P>
	Today we are starting to have a somewhat clearer idea of how the 
government plans to put into practice the principle made known in 
July 1994. Why did we agree with the principle at that time? It 
struck us as reasonable, and more efficient, to make local 
administrators who are familiar with their region, its resources, its 
strengths and its weaknesses, responsible for the way their local 
airport developed.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2827"> 2827 </A></B>
<P>
	Nevertheless, even then, we had some concerns about what 
would become of the regions. My colleague has just spoken of 
this. There are 26 major airports in Canada, and there is very little 
doubt in our minds that management of those major airports by 
the private sector is more dynamic than management by public 
servants in Ottawa.
<P>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
	However, we must also remember that there are over 500 or 600 
airports in Canada. This raises the question of what fate is in store 
for the small local and regional airports. Things are not moving 
along very quickly, because, at the moment, some 20 local and 
regional airports have been transferred to municipalities.
<P>
	My remarks apply primarily to three elements of the first block 
of motions. The first concerns safety. In recent years, I have been 
involved in the issue of safety because there is an airport in my 
riding, Jean Lesage international airport, and we have watched how 
the government-Transport Canada-has dealt with this issue over 
the past few years. While we supported the principle of 
commercialization of airports and air navigation services, it is still 
possible now for us to have serious reservations. Increasingly, the 
government's motives are becoming clear, transparent.
<P>
	It is not out of generosity. It is not because the government 
places greater faith in local managers that it is withdrawing. No, it 
is doing so strictly in order to pull out and to save money. Therefore 
this bill must be considered in the light of this.
<P>
	May I remind the House of some cases that show how relevant 
my comments are. A little over a year ago, almost two years ago in 
fact, Transport Canada decided to close a number of terminal 
control units at five or six airports, the last one being the one at 
Jean-Lesage airport.
<P>
	We then waged a major fight to try to convince and show 
Transport Canada that there was still a ray of hope. The system that 
had been put in place to monitor all of Quebec did not always work 
properly. I remember in particular that, on April 9, 1995, a Quebec 
City terminal control unit that was following a plane suddenly 
realized that the plane had done a 180-degree turn. What was going 
on? Very simply, the radar allowing controllers to monitor the 
plane suddenly focused on a flight of Canada geese going in the 
opposite direction.
<P>
	Every time we asked the Minister of Transport a question, he 
told us: ``The most important thing is the safety of passengers''. 
Allow me to question how safe they are.
<P>
	We were also told, to justify closing the terminal control unit in 
Quebec City, that the emergency control unit at Dorval airport was 
fully operational, which was not true. When we went to the airport, 
we saw that the equipment that was supposed to be there did not 
exist  and, what is more, that it took exactly 20 minutes to move 
crews to the regional control centre.
<P>
	That is the first point. So, when government members come and 
tell us: ``Our primary concern is safety'', we do not believe them.
<P>
	Let give you another example, still in connection with safety. In 
the interest of economy, always, Transport Canada discontinued 
the security services normally provided by the Royal Canadian 
Mounted Police at a number of Canadian airports. Again, 
Jean-Lesage airport was one of those affected. RCMP officers were 
replaced with veterans, I think. Granted, they can perform some 
functions, but I does not seem to me that they can do the same job 
as the RCMP officers.
<P>
	Further evidence of the fact that the government, through 
Transport Canada, does not care about safety can be found in the 
length of aircraft allowed to land in Canadian airports. Of course, it 
is regulated.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	The applicable regulations take into account, among other 
things, runway length of course, but also firefighting services 
available at the airport.
<P>
	Given the number of firefighters on duty at the airport in Quebec 
City, the number of fire trucks available and the type of trucks 
used, it was clear that Transport Canada was not abiding by its own 
regulations. What did the government and Transport Canada do? 
They took one more truck away and reduced the number of 
firefighters, departing even further from their own regulations.
<P>
	This government has decided to decentralize to the regions only 
to save some money. We have seen what it has done with Canadian 
National Railways. You might say I am getting sidetracked, but I 
am not. I am still discussing the same theme. The government is 
withdrawing from this area, not out of generosity towards the 
provinces, but to avoid fulfilling its financial obligations. 
Transport Canada neglected the Quebec City bridge for 15 years. 
And no sooner was CN privatized last year, what did the federal 
government do? It started saying: ``Yes, the Quebec City bridge is 
in bad shape, but like Pontius Pilate, we are washing our hands of 
the whole thing. CN is now a private corporation. Consequently, we 
have nothing to do with the maintenance of the bridge''. Yet, it is 
because of CN's negligence, and Transport Canada's negligence, 
that the bridge is in its current state of disrepair.
<P>
	The issue of navigational aids in the St. Lawrence River, which 
we raised on numerous occasions in recent weeks, is another 
example of government withdrawal. The reason is always the 
same: to save money. Safety is hardly a consideration. Without first 
conducting a real economic impact study, Canada was divided in 
three zones and the government is telling users of the St. Lawrence 
Seaway, to the Great Lakes, that they will now  have to pay for 
services provided to them. The decision was made without even 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2828"> 2828 </A></B>
<P>
bothering to see if it will impact on the volume of traffic and if it 
will result in ships using American ports instead.
<P>
	ADM is another example of the government's quickness to say it 
is no longer its responsibility, when it withdraws from an area. 
ADM was established and we agree with the underlying principle. 
Now there is a problem, and the government, instead of requiring a 
public examination of the effects of transferring flights from 
Mirabel to Dorval, said, instead: ``No, no, this is no longer our 
concern. We are no longer involved and have passed the 
responsibility for the Montreal airports on to a private firm''.
<P>
	I would also like to talk a bit in this context about Nav Canada's 
representativeness. Colleagues have already spoken on this. Nav 
Canada's board of directors does not represent the Canadian reality. 
Only the Transportation Association of Canada has been authorized 
to appoint representatives to the board. And where do these 
representatives come from? Two are from British Columbia and 
two are from the Ottawa region. This composition of the board they 
claim represents Canada. There is no one from Quebec.
<P>
	Two groups in particular have been very involved in navigation 
in Quebec over the past 20 or 30 years: the Association québécoise 
des transporteurs aériens and the Association des gens de l'air. 
They had a special place in air transportation and were dismissed 
with a wave of the hand, simply because, as they were told: ``You 
do not represent a national association. You are regional''. So there 
is no one from Quebec.
<P>
	When the criticism is made to the Minister of Transport that 
there is no one from Quebec, his response is very smooth.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	He says: ``Well, we appointed someone from Quebec to 
represent you: Michel Vennat, the president of the Council for 
Canadian Unity''. He is representing the interests of Quebec 
aviation with Nav Canada. What does Mr. Vennat know about air 
transportation? Probably nothing. I am not criticizing him. I am 
criticizing the government for appointing him.
<P>
	It refuses to appoint people from the industry and appoints a 
political person, someone who plays a very dubious role in 
constitutional discussions, to the board of Nav Canada to represent 
Quebec's interests.
<P>
	We should be having serious doubts about this bill. Agreeing 
with the principle is one thing, but accepting the bill as written is 
another.
<P>
	In another vein, I would like to return to the matter of French. I 
do not consider the guarantees at all satisfactory. The minister says: 
``We will ensure that the Official Languages Act applies'', but 
while Transport  Canada was managing air control, it took no steps 
to ensure that the Official Languages Act was being complied with. 
Why should we trust a private company to do so? I will come back 
to this a little later.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernard Deshaies (Abitibi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise immediately after my colleague from the riding of 
Louis-Hébert, in Quebec, to speak to Bill C-20, which the Bloc 
Quebecois has introduced motions to amend. This bill is of 
particular concern to my riding, the riding of Abitibi, which is 
definitely a remote area relying heavily on air services. I think that 
these motions should be given serious consideration.
<P>
	One of the motions is to add to the preamble that Nav Canada 
recognizes that Canada is a country where air service to northern 
and remote regions is essential. We are seeking, in this way, to lay 
down a parameter that would help prevent areas such as ours from 
being frequently left out of the equation.
<P>
	In my area, Val-d'Or, an airport is affected by this bill. Right 
now, the city, or the chamber of commerce, whichever is working 
on the question, is required to know whether Val-d'Or will keep its 
airport when the Department of Transport cuts off its dwindling 
grants. Will the city of Val-d'Or have the money to run this airport?
<P>
	For five years now, the policy of the Department of Transport 
has been to reduce the size of airports. It is obvious that, in the past, 
airports had practically the same services. The regions did not 
always ask to have all the fancy services available at Dorval, 
Toronto, or even Vancouver. It is not necessary to have moving 
walkways, the sophisticated checking systems of major airports, 
but areas such as ours must receive essential and equitable service.
<P>
	Why do people in regions like ours, as my colleague has said in 
the speech prior to the last one, pay two or three times more per 
kilometre to fly than people who go from Montreal to Toronto, for 
example, which is almost the same distance? Why can they get seat 
sales at $149, while we have to pay $550 for a regular fare between 
Val-d'Or and Montreal?
<P>
	What about the air fare between Val-d'Or and Quebec City? It is 
$650, which makes it expensive for people from Abitibi to get to 
Montreal or Quebec City-usually not for pleasure, but for 
business. Pleasure trips are also possible, as they are for people 
who fly from Montreal to Miami, but people with average incomes 
find it almost impossible to fly from Val-d'Or to Montreal or 
Quebec City.
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	This has, I feel, become impossibly expensive. Some months 
ago, when I spoke on decentralization and deregulation of 
transportation services, I called for recognition of equal rights for 
the people in the regions, whether my region or some other region 
in Canada, to receive quality service. Not necessarily the plush 
service there might be in Toronto or Montreal, but service which 
would allow people to get quickly from place to place as needed. 
Often trips of more than 700 kilometres are required, to get to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2829"> 2829 </A></B>
<P>
Toronto, Montreal, Quebec City or beyond. These services are 
necessary, I believe, for sometimes trips have to be made on an 
emergency basis because of illness or death or the like, and 
sometimes there is no choice between driving and flying.
<P>
	But now Val-d'Or is faced with a choice: Will we continue to 
maintain our airport? Will we have the $500,000 or $600,000 
needed to put into it yearly? Will the taxpayers have to foot the 
bill? I do not feel it should be necessary to ask such questions.
<P>
	People in regions like Val-d'Or ought to have access to an real 
operating airport, so that, for instance, if there is a health 
emergency, a government plane can land quickly and rush the 
patient to hospital in Montreal or Quebec City.
<P>
	The Val-d'Or region also serves a vast area of nearly 1,500 
kilometres north of Val-d'Or: the Inuit and Cree territories of the 
Far North. It is from Val-d'Or that the goods intended for these 
people are shipped.
<P>
	All the goods sent to the Inuit and the Cree go through Val-d'Or. 
Shipping may cost less than a third of what it would if the goods 
were sent from Montreal. It is easy to understand, as an air mile 
costs much more than a road mile. But, if the Val-d'Or airport 
closes, shipping costs for the Inuit and the Cree may increase even 
further, while the people of Val-d'Or would come out even.
<P>
	I used Val-d'Or as an example, but I am sure there are other 
airports in the northern regions of Saskatchewan and Manitoba that 
serve Native communities living further north who also need 
services at fair and realistic prices.
<P>
	A few years ago, during the air service decentralization process, 
the air traffic controllers in Val-d'Or lost their jobs. They had 
uncovered documents proving that keeping them in Val-d'Or did 
not cost more than sending them to Toronto or Montreal, where air 
traffic is monitored. They could also control air traffic over a rather 
large territory, and there was less of a safety risk.
<P>
	One of the things the Bloc Quebecois wants to find out about 
Nav Canada is if the safety level of the people in those areas is not 
as high as that of the people in Montreal or Toronto. Why are they 
seen as being candidates for reduced service? Because they live in 
outlying areas? I think that most of the people in the 
Abitibi-Témiscamingue region work in the natural resources 
sector, that is to say, in the forestry and mining industries. These 
people generate a lot of money for those who live further south.
<P>
	As my colleague was saying, when I hop on a plane in Val-d'Or 
or Rouyn-Noranda to fly to Montreal, Quebec City or Toronto, I 
pay money to those national airports.  If we could get only half the 
taxes collected on the cost of plane tickets, we could finance our 
own airports and control our own destiny.
<P>
	We also wanted Bill C-20 to say that Nav Canada should let 
small carriers have a say, as they would like to. That is the wish 
representatives of the Association québécoise des transporteurs 
aériens, or AQTA, have expressed to the Air Transport Association 
of Canada, and people listened to what they had to say. With the 
support of the Canadian council of air carrier associations, the 
Association québécoise des transporteurs aériens made 
representations to be fully represented on the board.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	How can your interests be defended when you are not even 
represented on the board? If Quebec's small carriers serving our 
regions have no control or say, how will we go about ensuring any 
degree of protection? Quebec users have received only a negative 
answer.
<P>
	When the airport decentralization and air transport system 
devolution policy was introduced in the latter part of 1993 and 
early 1994, we were promised that the system would be more 
cost-effective and deliver the same level of service at a lower cost.
<P>
	The letter from the Association des transporteurs aériens du 
Québec makes us wonder what services are to be expected. What 
can we do, if we are not even given the right to know what goes on 
at the board?
<P>
	I take a strong interest in this matter, because in deciding the 
future of their airport, as I indicated earlier, the people of Val-d'Or 
cannot help but wonder also about future changes Nav Canada 
could impose on a local civilian authority like the City of Val-d'Or, 
when people will not have any control over future changes.
<P>
	At the airport in Val-d'Or, for example, there is an aircraft 
approach system. This system will be under the control of Nav 
Canada. What would prevent Nav Canada from sending the City of 
Val-d'Or a bill for the maintenance of the system three, four or five 
years from now? This is one of many possibilities that have been 
raised. Last week, I attended a meeting of the chamber of 
commerce on the Val-d'Or airport acquisition project. People were 
wondering how they could be sure that costs would remain 
constant, if there is no control over any of these elements.
<P>
	Again, if we include in the bill a motion to ensure the safety of 
air services in northern regions, it will always be possible to tell the 
government in the future: ``Listen, the municipality cannot absorb 
the annual costs of $200,000 or $100,000. It should be up to Nav 
Canada to ensure our safety. Aircraft cannot land without an 
approach system''. Then, we, who live in regions, will be 
protected.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2830"> 2830 </A></B>
<P>
	In conclusion, I am asking the government to be receptive to 
the needs of regions. For too many years now, the government has 
been making decisions under cover of cuts required by its debt. 
Regions can absorb part of the deficit. However, the government 
must realize that if it does not stop depriving us of essential 
services, people will get discouraged. Sometimes, we cannot help 
but wonder if the government is trying to shut down regions.
<P>
	In my estimation, this would be a serious mistake, given what 
northern regions such as ours provide to other regions, given our 
great natural resources, which are not even developed here, but 
taken to southern destinations to increase their worth. Indeed, it 
would be a serious mistake to conclude, here in Canada, that 
northern regions generate costs and not profits.
<P>
	The government should support this motion, so that all regions 
will feel, even though they do not get additional funding, even 
though they have to learn to live within their means, that they have 
some security, that they are respected, and that no forgotten bills 
will show up in the future.

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Mercier (Blainville-Deux-Montagnes, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the motions in Group No. 2 deal with clauses 15, 18, 21, 
36, 37 and 40. We put forward 18 motions on these six clauses, 
which goes to show how important this group of motions are.
<P>
	The main objective of these motions-which is also why they 
were grouped together-is to ensure broader distribution of the 
notices Nav Canada has to give in some instances stipulated in the 
act. The main instances where Nav Canada has to give such notices 
to the regions and the organizations concerned are the following. It 
has to do with the notices Nav Canada has to give when it wants to 
increase or reduce the services it provides.
<P>
	Another specific clause deals with the instances where Nav 
Canada wants to increase, reduce or modify designated northern or 
remote services.
<P>
	Lastly, Nav Canada must give notices when it wants to establish 
a new charge or revise an existing charge or review the 
organizations that have to pay those charges.
<P>
	Those are the three instances where Nav Canada must give 
notices. In these three cases, the current legislation provides for 
notices to be given to the organizations concerned. However, the 
problem we have with this, and which deserves our attention, is 
that the list of organizations that may be concerned is too vague, as 
are the means to be used to reach these organizations.
<P>
	All our motions propose, in the three cases I just 
mentioned-changes in services, changes in northern or remote 
services, changes in user charges-that advance notice be served 
first to all local daily newspapers. Obviously people must be 
advised of such important changes as those to the services provided 
by Nav Canada.
<P>
	We also think that, if need be, the band council or councils 
concerned should be informed. Generally, theses notices should be 
sent as much as possible not only by mail but also by E-mail.
<P>
	We also want the large and small organizations representing the 
users to be advised of changes to the user charges and services. 
Finally, since individuals should not be forgotten, anyone who has 
expressed an interest in the previous ten days should be informed. 
This, then, covers the cases in which we want notices to be sent and 
the type of notices to be sent.
<P>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
	We do not think these provisions are useless. We just want to 
specify the means that must be used. Let us not forget that, since 
Nav Canada necessarily has a commercial purpose, we, as 
legislators, must protect ourselves and protect users against the 
tendency Nav Canada could have, for financial reasons, not to 
announce widely the measures it intends to take, or to save money 
in the way it makes these announcements.
<P>
	We want to avoid anything arbitrary in the way Nav Canada 
provides information concerning the measures it intends to take. 
Again, these amendments are based on the general principle that 
even though Ottawa delegates some of its powers to a private 
organization that has to provide a public service, it does not mean 
that this service must be reduced in terms of quality and quantity. 
In this second group of motions, this service is the provision of 
information.
<P>
	Since we are talking about information, I will take this 
opportunity to draw a parallel between this and another creation of 
the federal government, namely Aéroports de Montréal. ADM is 
another example of the government's unfortunate tendency to 
delegate responsibilities to an organization in a way that allows it 
to use this organization to avoid providing services that it had an 
obligation to provide before this delegation of responsibilities took 
place.
<P>
	The parallel being drawn here, with respect to information, is 
justified by the fact that ADM has just taken a decision that is 
extremely important for the region and even, I would say, for 
Quebec and for Canada, because it involves international airports. 
With respect to the measure taken by ADM, my office asked for 
copies of the studies on which ADM is basing its decision. If you 
can believe it, we were told that ADM is subject to the 
requirements of the Access to Information Act and that therefore 
they do 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2833"> 2833 </A></B>
<P>
not have to provide us with the studies on which they are basing 
their decision. We therefore  have here another federal creature, 
which, thanks to the delegation of authority, may decline to justify 
in a manner satisfactory to the public the decisions it wants to take.
<P>
	We therefore see that there is a risk that the federal government 
will create agencies in order not to have to provide the public with 
the information it has a responsibility to provide and which it must 
provide when there is no delegation of authority to an intermediate 
agency, which, under the label of private service, may decline to 
give out information that, in this case, one is entitled to expect from 
an agency providing a service to the public.
<P>
	The point is that the ADM precedent is an indication that we 
should be very wary that Nav Canada does not become a 
convenient screen that the government can use to shirk certain of 
its obligations. In this case, the obligations that we want to be sure 
Nav Canada assumes concern the distribution of notices in the 
cases provided for in the bill in the manner and according to the 
terms regarding the media that we have mentioned.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to 
respond to the motions being put forward by members of the Bloc. 
Talk about latitude. I do not know how we got on to the issue of the 
ADM, or Aéroports de Montreal.
<P>
	I want to remind members of this place and the hon. member 
opposite that ADM, or Aéroports de Montreal, is the body which 
looks after the operations of Mirabel and Dorval airports.
<P>
<B>(1710 )</B>
<P>
	It has been charged with responsibilities that are no longer under 
federal jurisdiction. It is the working group that will manage the 
two airports in that area. The government's intent is to split off the 
business of running business away from the federal government 
and let the communities take control of their destinies. It is the 
communities, on many levels, municipal, provincial, et cetera, that 
are represented on this local airport authority called ADM and are 
charged with these responsibilities.
<P>
	It is a measure that has been put forward by the government 
which has been overwhelmingly endorsed by Canadians from coast 
to coast to coast. It is producing very dramatic, very appreciable 
and well supported, far reaching opportunities for all the airports, 
including my airport in Hamilton, Ontario.
<P>
	I must respond to and strongly disagree with the concerns 
outlined by the hon. member for 
Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans and others in the Bloc who 
allege that the regions are not fully represented on the Nav Canada 
board.
<P>
	On the subject of the request by Bloc members in their motions 
for representation for large and small carriers on the board of 
directors of Nav Canada, this request is entirely unnecessary. This 
request was debated in committee. I am not sure how a lot of these 
motions got put in at report stage. Exactly the same motions were 
dealt with in committee, but that is a matter for another day.
<P>
	Why is it completely unnecessary? This matter is already taken 
care of by the bylaws of the corporation. Four directors are 
appointed by ATAC, which is the Air Transport Association of 
Canada. It is the largest trade association, representing carriers of 
all sizes and from all regions of the country.
<P>
	ATAC membership includes major national and international 
carriers, regional air carriers, and I stress the word regional, local 
service carriers and even flying clubs.
<P>
	On the specific issue of regional representation, Nav Canada's 
bylaws require the corporation to consult with bona fide regional 
trade associations in the appointment of its directors. It is worth 
noting that one of the four directors appointed by ATAC is the 
former president and chief executive officer of a regional air 
carrier.
<P>
	Organizations representing smaller air carriers also have an 
opportunity to influence Nav Canada's decision making process 
through an advisory committee provided for in the Nav Canada 
bylaws.
<P>
	At Nav Canada's first annual general meeting held last April 10, 
15 individuals were elected to the advisory committee. Among 
these individuals were representatives of several regional 
associations, typically consisting of smaller commercial operators 
such as the British Columbia Aviation Council and Mr. Jenner at 
the Association québécoise des transporteurs aériens. Therefore, 
the representation is there and the Bloc's concerns that the regions 
are not represented are entirely unfounded.
<P>
	Moving to the next group and in response to the hon. member's 
motions, particularly Motion No. 4, can anyone imagine the 
impracticality of giving notice in every newspaper serving the 
regions to be affected by a proposal, whether in respect of changes 
in services or changes in charges?
<P>
	If one carries that logic to the logical extension, in the case of an 
en route charge where one is taking it right across the country, that 
would impose a requirement on the new not for profit corporation 
called Nav Canada to publish in every newspaper across the entire 
country. Can you just imagine the fees and charges that would 
entail in making notice on a change in charges, for example?
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2834"> 2834 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1715 )</B>
<P>
	Incidentally, the motion also contains an error. Clause 15 deals 
with changes in services and facilities, not charges. The 
notification requirement established in clause 15(3) already 
ensures that all interested persons will know about a Nav Canada 
proposal. It is there.
<P>
	In addition, the Nav Canada bylaws require that notice be given 
in the two largest national circulation newspapers in each of the 
official languages of our country.
<P>
	In Motion No. 5 presented by the Bloc members, the 
requirement to send by mail and electronic means would clearly 
represent an unproductive duplication of effort. The Bloc motion 
refers to mail and electronic means.
<P>
	What if an individual, organization or group was not equipped to 
receive a notice by electronic means? There must be a few of them 
in Canada. Nav Canada could be in breach of its obligation to 
provide notice if it did not send a notice electronically to such a 
person or a group because, and I remind the hon. member opposite, 
the motion refers to mail and electronic means. Nav Canada should 
be allowed to use either mail or electronic means, which makes the 
most sense in terms of the specific interested individual.
<P>
	On Motion No. 6, Bill C-20 identifies only one group of persons 
specifically, that is, the users. This does not mean that only users 
have a role. Everyone else is covered by the expression ``other 
person''. The reference to ``other person'' is in Bill C-20. To single 
out, as the Bloc requests to do in this motion, band councils from 
all other interested persons seems rather inappropriate.
<P>
	The association of commercial pilots which appeared before the 
Standing Committee on Transport would be one group that might 
expect explicit recognition. Airport operators would be another 
group that might feel this way.
<P>
	The expression ``representative organization of users'' seems 
pretty clear. It is clear enough that a change to ``organizations 
representing users'' is entirely unnecessary.
<P>
	On Motion No. 7, the reference is incorrect. It should be clause 
18, not clause 15. It would be impractical to give notice in every 
newspaper primarily serving the regions to be affected by a 
proposal, whether we are talking about changes in northern or 
remote services or changes in charges. In the case of an en route 
service where one is taking it right across the country, this proposal 
could impose a requirement on Nav Canada to publish in every 
newspaper in outlying regions of the entire country. This is not very 
practical.
<P>
	Motion No. 8 contains a reference which appears to be incorrect. 
It should be clause 18 and not clause 15. The requirement to send 
by mail and electronic means would  represent that unproductive 
duplication of effort we spoke about earlier.
<P>
	Motion No. 9 contains an incorrect reference. It should be clause 
18, not clause 15. I repeat that Bill C-20 identifies only one group 
of persons specifically, that is, the users. That does not mean that 
only users have a role. Of course everyone else is covered by the 
expression ``other persons''.
<P>
	The remaining Motions Nos. 10 to 12 and Motions Nos. 16 to 24 
are amendments which repeat all the impracticalities put forward 
by the Bloc. They are impractical and unproductive amendments 
which I addressed in the first nine motions of this group.
<P>
	In the closing remarks of the last group the Bloc raised its 
concerns about safety. I cannot stress enough to hon. members 
opposite that Transport Canada prides itself, whether it is the 
Minister of Transport, members on this side of the House or all the 
men and women who work for Transport Canada, on the safety 
record in transportation in this country. Transportation safety is 
always priority one in that department.
<P>
<B>(1720)</B>
<P>
	When the hon. members speak I dare say politically on the issue 
of safety and their concerns, I recognize they have concerns. 
However I want to remind them and I must remind them that where 
safety is concerned, the supremacy of safety in Bill C-20 is clearly 
established through references to the Aeronautics Act within the 
body of Bill C-20 and regulations made pursuant to the act.
<P>
	We cannot do a better job putting those requirements or 
preambles to motions within the body of Bill C-20. We cannot do a 
better job than referring to the Aeronautics Act. It is the best 
instrument to address safety, better than anything the Bloc might 
want to move motions on.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to deal with a couple of little housekeeping 
items first. Both the Bloc member and the parliamentary secretary 
mentioned a couple of areas.
<P>
	Bloc members were concerned that the Quebec transport 
association was not getting a proper voice. For the record, Mr. 
Jenner of that organization was offered a seat on the board of 
directors and turned it down. He acknowledged this right in 
committee. I am not quite sure where the Bloc is coming from on 
that. He was offered exactly what they say he should have got and 
he turned it down.
<P>
	Also Bloc members talked about ADM. As the parliamentary 
secretary said, I do not know how that found its way into this 
discussion. I have one point for clarification. What they are asking 
for is the Montreal authority be ruled by the federal government.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2835"> 2835 </A></B>
<P>
	If Bloc members are saying that rather than having local 
authorities in Quebec rule on things, they want the  federal 
government to rule on it instead, they had better re-evaluate their 
entire mandate as separatists. What they want is to come away 
from the federal government and take control but when they have 
it, they are saying they want the federal government to take it back. 
They should clarify why they are really here in the first place.
<P>
	With regard to the variety of motions in Group No. 2 dealing 
with information and the process of advertising that information, I 
talked with the Bloc members on this in committee where it had 
been brought up by them. I did not support them at the committee 
level because while they had a good concept, it went too far. It was 
far too onerous.
<P>
	I said that they should come down with something simple. They 
were telling me they wanted better notification for changes in 
services or deletion of services particularly in northern areas where 
there may not be good information dissemination. I said I could 
support that if they could word it in such a way that they did not get 
into all those other areas. That is still a great concept, to have a 
better type of advertisement in some of the more remote and hard 
to reach areas. However instead of simplifying their motion, if 
anything, they have made it more complex.
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary correctly pointed out that if a 
general change were made in the fee structure, which obviously 
will happen from time to time-God knows I would love it if I 
were still paying the same for food, a haircut or gasoline that I paid 
in 1970 but that is not the case. And it is not going to happen with 
Nav Canada neither. From time to time its fees are going to change. 
The way it reads for most of the motions is that every time Nav 
Canada changes its fee structure, as it will do, it must advertise in 
every newspaper in this country. That is so onerous and makes it 
absolutely impossible.
<P>
	It seems ironic that the government, correctly though it may 
have been, speaking against better dissemination of information 
mainly because it was too onerous should turn around in another 
area and try to promote the dissemination of information that 
probably should not be going out.
<P>
	At committee we dealt with a motion by Reform which actually 
added to the bill a requirement that Nav Canada meet the same 
parameters of the Privacy Act as was done when it was a 
government organization. It follows exactly the same format the 
government used for the official languages bill. In fact, it was a 
subclause to that same section of the bill. This is not something 
which the privacy commissioner, who has the responsibility for 
this, spoke against. In fact, he came to committee to see if we 
would please put it in. Nav Canada did not have any objection and 
was basically going to do this anyway.
<P>
<B>(1725)</B>
<P>
	It put in an assurance to the users that it was going to be taken 
care of and it passed. Reform, who put it in, voted for it. The Bloc, 
who had a similar amendment, voted for it as did some Liberals.
<P>
	As the parliamentary secretary is fond of saying, a committee is 
master of its own destiny. If we ignore what the committee does 
and overrule it by Liberals only, then why bother even having the 
committee? If the Liberals are going to pass only the things they 
like and overrule things that get passed in spite of them, then why 
do we bother having these committees in the first place? The 
government might as well write out its four year agenda, pass it and 
that is the end of it.
<P>
	I am very shocked and disappointed to see the Liberals trying to 
take out a clause that their own Liberal dominated committee 
passed. It is astounding.
<P>
	Reform will not be supporting the motions brought forward by 
the Bloc in Group No. 2. The only area we support are some 
technical motions that are going to be discussed later in Group No. 
3 brought forward by the Liberal Party. We do not have a problem 
with that. Because of what I would have to say is a rather deceitful 
motion by the government, we will probably also support the Bloc 
motion to try to put it back in, even though it is by a somewhat 
convoluted method.
<P>
	It is a good bill. It is unfortunate that we get into these debates on 
various types of changes, some of which are political. The bill has 
been drawn up out of eight possibilities that were looked at early on 
which were quickly narrowed down to two and soon focused in on 
one. The users, the employees, the service providers are all 
working together to provide a not for profit organization so that 
somebody is not going to try to get rich from this.
<P>
	Could the bill have been better? I doubt there is a bill that is ever 
passed that could not perhaps be slightly better. Maybe we will find 
some improvements to make on it as we watch it unfold. We may 
find there are some corrections we could make.
<P>
	On the whole it has the support of the industry, albeit some 
people are a little nervous because it is new and change is always a 
little scary for a lot of people. It has the support of the users. It has 
the support of the people who work in the industry. It will have the 
support of the Reform Party as well.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keyes:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. To assist the 
chair, if we have completed debate on this group, maybe we could 
call for the question and move on to the next group.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I am sure the hon. 
parliamentary secretary is being very co-operative but unless I am 
<P>

<B><A NAME="2836"> 2836 </A></B>
<P>
mistaken I think there are members from  other parties who still 
want to speak to these motions in Group No. 2.
<P>
	My hesitation was more on the basis of the clock. I do not know 
of too many members who would seek the floor to speak for 30 
seconds or one minute. However, that is not a subject of concern to 
any of us any more.
<P>
	It being 5.30 p.m., the House will now proceed to the 
consideration of Private Members' Business as listed on today's 
Order Paper.

	The House proceeded to the consideration of Bill C-243, an act 
to amend the Canada Elections Act (reimbursement of election 
expenses), as reported (with amendments) from the committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.)</B> moved that 
Bill C-243, an act to amend the Canada Elections Act 
(reimbursement of election expenses), as amended, be concurred 
in.
<P>
	(Motion agreed to.)
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> When shall the bill be read 
the third time? By leave, now?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> moved that the bill be read the third time and 
passed.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I thank members in the House and in 
particular in the committee that dealt with the bill for their 
assistance. I also thank the Chief Electoral Officer of Canada and 
Elections Canada for their assistance in putting the bill together.
<P>
	The idea behind the bill was that election expenses, money paid 
by the government, by the taxpayers of Canada, to registered 
political parties is done so for good reason. There are some who say 
there should be none paid and there are others who say it should be 
paid differently. Today the country reimburses political parties and 
candidates a certain amount of the expenses they incur in their 
political activities.
<P>
	In the case of individuals running for political office federally 
there must be a hurdle to be met. That hurdle is that in addition to 
whatever else one does one must get 15 per cent of the total votes 
cast in one's constituency in order to qualify for reimbursement of 
election expenses, which amounts to 22.5 per cent of whatever 
qualifies.
<P>
	The case with registered political parties federally was that all 
that was required was that a minimum threshold be met in 
spending. It seemed reasonable that if members had to receive a 
minimum amount of popular support in  their constituencies, 
registered political parties should also receive some popular 
support.
<P>
	When the bill was examined in committee the question was 
raised of what the threshold should be. There were those among us 
who said the threshold should be fairly high and there were those 
who said it should be fairly low.
<P>
	The compromise of a 5 per cent threshold of a political party's 
having to garner either 2 per cent of the votes nationally or 5 per 
cent of the votes in the constituencies in which a political party 
fielded candidates was a compromise between those who wanted a 
lower number, say 2 per cent, and those who wanted a higher 
number, say 8 per cent or 9 per cent.
<P>
	In committee we determined that 5 per cent was a compromise 
and that is how we arrived at 2 per cent of the total votes cast 
nationally or 5 per cent of the votes in the constituencies in which a 
political party ran candidates.
<P>
	I want very much to thank all of the members who participated in 
committee who helped give consideration to the bill. It does not 
have a particularly large effect in the scheme of things on the 
pocket book of the nation, although it is over $1 million we are 
talking about, and that is not small change in anybody's lexicon.
<P>
<B>(1735 )</B>
<P>
	Most important, it brings into the body politic the necessity to be 
accountable for what we do as citizens and how we spend the 
nation's treasury.
<P>
	I welcome the debate that will follow and I thank everyone for 
their participation and consideration of the bill. I thank Elections 
Canada and affirm to everyone in the Chamber today this measure 
fits exactly with the report of the Chief Electoral Officer submitted 
to Parliament in February.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Zed (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to have this opportunity to speak to Bill C-243, sponsored 
by the member for Edmonton Southwest.
<P>
	Bill C-243 is a short bill which proposes amendments to only 
one subsection of the Canada Elections Act. However, it touches on 
the important issue of financial controls for the electoral process. I 
believe this is fundamental to representative democracy.
<P>
	We on this side of the House support Bill C-243. We do so for 
three main reasons. Bill C-243 would promote both fiscal restraint 
and fairness in the electoral system. With respect to fiscal restraint 
there is a need to ensure that the scarce tax dollars are not directed 
to electoral activities that receive marginal or trivial voter support. 
With respect to fairness, there is a need to ensure the system for 
financing electoral campaigns does not unduly restrict the electoral 
choices of Canadians.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2837"> 2837 </A></B>
<P>
	The bill, we believe, represents a good balance between these 
often conflicting goals. Let me explain this balance in greater 
detail.
<P>
	A registered political party is required to field candidates in at 
least 50 electoral districts in order to obtain and maintain its 
registration. Section 322(1) of the Canada Elections Act sets out 
the conditions that allow registered political parties to receive 22.5 
per cent reimbursement of eligible electoral expenses. In order to 
claim reimbursement a registered political party must spend more 
than 10 per cent of its election expenses limit as determined under 
section 39(1) of the act.
<P>
	Registered political parties become entitled to the 
reimbursement no matter how few or how many votes they receive. 
This reimbursement is tied in part to the political party's ability to 
spend.
<P>
	There has been criticism of this reimbursement regime. It 
follows no logical except perhaps to reward the ability to spend, 
which no electoral system should encourage.
<P>
	We are familiar with the abuses of the last general election. We 
noted in the House in May last year the platform of certain political 
parties whose ideas did not seem to follow the national debate; the 
Rhinoceros Party and the Yogic Flyers are two that come to mind. 
Many Canadians perceived their campaigns perhaps as a humorous 
interlude in the midst of a very serious electoral event. Others we 
not amused.
<P>
	We also noted at that time that although most of these registered 
organizations received marginal public support, less than 1 per cent 
of the total votes cast, Canadian taxpayers, as my hon. colleague 
has already pointed out, were required to spend in excess of $1 
million in eligible reimbursements. That did not sit well with many 
Canadians. Questions were asked and Canadians wanted to know 
why their government handed over such sums to subsidize 
organizations whose objective did not appear to be one of a 
political party.
<P>
	I am not saying these organizations should not exist or that they 
should not have the right to speak out or to field candidates in any 
electoral event. That is their right. That is any Canadian's right.
<P>
<B>(1740)</B>
<P>
	Rather, this debate focuses on the need to apply some fiscal 
restraint. Moreover, this restraint should be applied in a logical and 
fair manner.
<P>
	We believe and agree with our hon. colleague that Bill C-243 
would drop the current requirement that a political party spend at 
least 10 per cent of its allowable election expenses to be eligible for 
reimbursement. That makes sense.
<P>
	The basis for reimbursement should not be a political party's 
ability to spend. Instead, eligibility for reimbursement would be 
limited to registered political  parties which receive either 2 per 
cent or more of the number of valid votes cast at the election or 5 
per cent of the number of valid votes cast in the electoral districts 
in which the registered party endorsed a candidate. In other words, 
reimbursement would be voter based. Political parties would be 
rewarded for their efforts in convincing the electorate of the 
validity of their principles and their overall platform. That makes 
sense. The bill also ensures the deck is not stacked against the 
establishment of new national or regionally based parties.
<P>
	The royal commission on electoral reform and party financing 
noted Canadians wanted a broader choice in the selection of their 
electoral representatives. The bill is in keeping with that viewpoint. 
In doing so it also supports the fundamental charter right of 
freedom of expression.
<P>
	The bill in our opinion is also in keeping with the red book 
commitments of electoral financing. That is the second reason we 
as Liberals rise in support of the bill. The red book noted the need 
to limit the role of special interest groups in campaigns, the need to 
impose tougher spending limits and the need to close certain 
loopholes in election spending. Bill C-243 makes an important 
contribution toward these objectives.
<P>
	The third and final reason for our support concerns the 
comprehensive manner in which the bill was developed. The 
Canada Elections Act is a complex piece of legislation. In general 
its provisions must not be considered independently from one 
another. Piecemeal amendments to the act are usually discouraged. 
However, in this case we can all point to the in depth review 
conducted by the Standing Committee on Procedure and House 
Affairs last fall.
<P>
	The original proposal of the hon. member for Edmonton 
Southwest was amended, with his concurrence and support, to take 
into account the concerns of all committee members. There was a 
consensus that the bill, as amended, was worthwhile and would not 
impact inadvertently on the other provisions of the act. It shows 
what can be accomplished when members work together.
<P>
	The government's support of the bill today is tangible proof of 
its belief in the importance and the relevance of private members' 
bills.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am a 
bit out of breath, having rushed here from a meeting of the national 
security committee, where we would have greatly appreciated the 
presence of the hon. member for Scarborough West. Oh well, 
maybe next time.
<P>
	I took part in the examination of the bill known during the first 
session of this Parliament as C-319, and now with reprinting and 
Motion No. 1 it has become Bill C-243. As the hon. member for 
Fundy-Royal has said, this is a compromise, reached after many 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2838"> 2838 </A></B>
<P>
efforts on all  sides by all of the parties represented on the Standing 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs.
<P>
	I would like to commend the hon. member for Edmonton 
Southwest, if I may, for all the energy he has devoted to this entire 
process, first of all, in having managed to get his bill into the 
works, then in having defended it before the Sub-committee on 
Private Members' Business, and then in having defended it 
brilliantly before the procedure and House affairs committee.
<P>
	My congratulations, not just to the hon. member for Edmonton 
Southwest, but also to the colleagues who contributed to this 
compromise: the hon. member for Kingston and the Islands, of 
course, who chaired the committee, the hon. member for 
Laurier-Sainte-Marie, who shared his experience with us, and the 
hon. member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, who, as usual, 
helped us draw up a better bill.
<P>
<B>(1745)</B>
<P>
	As has been mentioned, but I will take the liberty of repeating it, 
we focused on one thing: avoiding having public funds, the public 
purse, used to support marginal groups, which, through sometimes 
contorted interpretations of the law, manage to register as political 
parties and, by spending an amount of money, manage to recover 
certain amounts.
<P>
	The aim was simply to eliminate the flakey. In no way did we 
question the political programs or options of any party. That was 
far from our intention. We set minimum criteria that enable parties 
with some popular support to develop in a democracy. It was 
certainly not our idea to limit access to Parliament, in practical 
terms, to existing parties or to parties that had existed in the past.
<P>
	The criterion we chose was that a party, to obtain reimbursement 
from the public purse, had to have 2 per cent of national votes or 5 
per cent of votes in ridings where they ran a candidate. With the 
elections act requiring a party to have at least 50 candidates in 
order to register, we felt this standard was high enough to eliminate 
the completely flakey organizations while allowing the 
development of political parties that failed to gather 30 or 35 per 
cent of votes in an initial election.
<P>
	It is a tricky balance to strike, but it was feasible with everyone's 
patience and co-operation. Credit here must be given to the 
member for Edmonton Southwest for endlessly contributing, with 
constructive suggestions, to the improvement of the bill and 
successfully creating a consensus on the Standing Committee on 
Procedure and House Affairs.
<P>
	Of course we have to come back to the funding of political 
parties by looking at other aspects of the question. This does not 
end the debate. An important point has been reached, however, and 
unanimously I assume. But, we must not stop here. One day we 
have to deal with the funding of political parties. In this case, we  
are only dealing with reimbursement. But how are parties funded?
<P>
	We had proposed in a motion which was voted down by this 
House by only a few votes-members of both opposition parties 
had overwhelmingly voted in favour of it-that contributions to 
political party election funds at the federal level be subject to the 
same rules as in Quebec. Contributions to political parties 
registered in Quebec can only be made by individual voters and 
cannot exceed $3,000 per party, a reasonable limit in a free and 
democratic country.
<P>
	This House came very close to passing such a measure and 
having a bill to this effect. If I remember right, motion M-150 
moved by the member for Richelieu dealt with this issue. We will 
have to resurrect it some day because Canadians have the right to 
know who is funding political parties in this country.
<P>
	The rule is simple: ``Tell me who is funding you and I will tell 
you whom you are serving''. The Bloc Quebecois has nothing to 
hide, we are entirely funded by our own members. We went way 
beyond the Canada Elections Act by choosing to accept 
contributions only from our members who could vote and by 
limiting contributions to $5,000. I must say that this maximum is 
rarely reached, contributions are often more modest.
<P>
	As most Canadians know, in Quebec, we raise money for our 
party through all kinds of events, giving us the opportunity to have 
a good time while holding more in-depth political debates, and 
ensuring grassroot funding. By using this form of funding, the Bloc 
Quebecois makes sure it is its own creature.
<P>
<B>(1750)</B>
<P>
	We are only accountable to those who elected us. If a contributor 
were to insist too much, it would be easy to say: ``Listen, I will 
write you a cheque-in this case it would be an Air Canada 
passenger coupon more than a cheque-I will write you a cheque, 
here is your refund''. But there are no such situations.
<P>
	If I had received $50,000 or $60,000 from the Royal Bank, I 
could perhaps write the first cheque, but as things stand, I am not 
sure my bank or caisse populaire would honour it. I would have a 
hard time paying it back.
<P>
	That is the problem they have on the other side. I hope the 
problem has not yet reached the Reform Party, because they seem 
unable to define their position on this.
<P>
	Our friends on the other side have a problem: they get their funds 
from large corporations, big business, and they are first and 
foremost accountable to those who provide those funds. Tell me 
who pays your way, I will tell you who you serve.
<P>
	Of course, the president of a large corporation who contributed 
to an election fund to the tune of a five or six-figure amount will 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2839"> 2839 </A></B>
<P>
probably get some private  telephone numbers or cellular phone 
numbers that will give him access to influential people.
<P>
	In our party, it is very easy, our numbers are in the phone book. 
All voters are welcome, whatever their political colours, blue, red, 
multicolored or any other colour you want. Reformers are a bit on 
the green side, I would say, but they are welcome too. When we are 
elected, we are, as yourselves, here to represent everyone. We are 
here to serve not only Bloc party members, but also Liberals, 
former Conservatives and NDP members who need our support.
<P>
	In conclusion, it is with this in mind that I send this message, so 
we can debate the financing of political parties in the near future. 
This would be a major reform, one of the great reforms of Canadian 
parliamentary process, as it was in Quebec.
<P>
	If we had to choose the most important piece of legislation in 
Quebec in the past 50 years, the first prize would go to the political 
party financing legislation, which only allows persons qualified to 
vote, ordinary citizens, to finance political parties, not unions, 
corporations or body corporates. This measure has revolutionized 
parliamentary customs.
<P>
	And if we were to adopt it here, of course, it is more difficult to 
build up campaign funds with $20, $50 or $100 here and there, 
although tax provisions allow for a generous refund of up to 75 per 
cent on the first hundred dollars, which may help sometimes.
<P>
	So, it is not so difficult, but we have to take the trouble to do it. 
Of course, it is always easier to make a phone call and receive a big 
cheque, but we stay in touch with the grassroots when we go from 
town to town in our ridings, to see our constituents and ask them 
for a contribution to a fund raising campaign. They are able to give 
us the message, to tell us what they want us to do in the House of 
Commons and which issues they want us to deal with first. This is a 
wonderful way for us to keep in mind we are accountable first and 
foremost to those who have given us, for a limited time, the seats 
we are sitting in so that we can rise from time to time and make 
some interventions such as this one, which is coming to an end.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
in reference to the comments of the member for Bellechasse, in my 
case and I hope in the case of every other member of this House, we 
are here to serve our constituents no matter what their political 
stripes may be. Whether they are NDP, Bloc, Liberal, Conservative 
or Reform, I feel it is my obligation to serve my constituents to the 
best of my ability. I am sure other members of the House feel 
likewise.
<P>
	I want to be on record as saying that given my druthers I would 
advocate doing away with all taxpayer financial support to political 
election campaigns. I would put the onus on political parties or 
individual politicians to convince their constituents that their 
political viewpoints or the capability of a specific candidate are 
such that citizens would be willing to provide financial backing to 
put forward those views or to support that candidate.
<P>
	Because this view does not now seem to be accepted by the 
current Canadian political establishment and because it is a step in 
the right direction, I am pleased to address at third reading Bill 
C-243 which will amend the Canada Elections Act and clamp down 
on federal election refunds to fringe parties.
<P>
<B>(1755 )</B>
<P>
	In 1974, section 322 of the Canada Elections Act was adopted, 
establishing an expense related system that allowed any registered 
party to receive a 22.5 per cent refund if it spent at least 10 per cent 
of its eligible expenses on its election campaign. At the same time, 
the new law imposed election campaign spending limits on parties 
and qualified candidates who received at least 15 per cent of the 
votes in their electoral district to receive a 50 per cent rebate on 
their actual campaign expenses.
<P>
	These reforms were important because they enabled greater 
public scrutiny and assisted in restoring public confidence in the 
political and electoral system.
<P>
	At that time, the face of the Canadian multi-party system was 
quite different than it is today. Those legislators did not foresee the 
emergence of multiple fringe parties that have very limited public 
support, but because of the money they spend during their 
campaign have under current regulations become eligible for a 
taxpayer subsidy.
<P>
	Last fall, as a new member of the Standing Committee on 
Procedure and House Affairs, I took part in the study of Bill C-319 
which has been reintroduced in the new session of Parliament as 
Bill C-243. During that study, modifications were adopted to 
ensure that this amendment to the Canada Elections Act will not 
impede the democratic process nor the ability of concerned citizens 
to organize and put forward candidates to run on any set platform.
<P>
	The goal of the amendment is to eliminate federal subsidies to 
fringe groups that have little or no significant degree of public 
support. Not only a matter of principle, it is in the interest of 
effecting greater fiscal responsibility for the taxpayer.
<P>
	I wish to reaffirm that Reform remains committed to the 
elimination of all political subsidies. Our party, on forming a 
government, will eliminate those political subsidies in keeping 
with our commitment to party policies and principles born through 
consultation with Canadians.
<P>
	For more than 20 years now, Canadian taxpayers have paid large 
election expense reimbursements and tax credits, thus directly 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2840"> 2840 </A></B>
<P>
supporting election campaigns and  indirectly topping up political 
war chests between election periods.
<P>
	Canadian taxpayers object to being forced to finance and thus 
support political parties they do not wish to support. This is 
particularly true at a time when it is increasingly obvious that 
political parties are able to raise the money required to run 
campaigns.
<P>
	Would they still be able to raise these funds, particularly the 
fringe parties, if there were no political contribution income tax 
deduction available? After the 1993 election, candidates eligible 
for the Elections Canada reimbursement held an average surplus of 
$1,518 in their accounts, without the federal subsidy.
<P>
	Again, in 1993 the top five political parties reported a total 
income of $63 million in campaign contributions but only actually 
spent $31 million on the campaign. From these figures, it is evident 
that the taxpayer could easily have been spared more than $7 
million in reimbursements to the top five parties.
<P>
	Further, knowing a 22.5 per cent reward will be paid based solely 
on their election expenses, there is little incentive for registered 
parties to be fiscally responsible in their campaign spending.
<P>
	Initially, the purpose of the national campaign refund was to 
ensure national or regional parties were kept alive and well 
between elections. With new fund raising techniques, these seed 
funds are no longer necessary. Current statistics indicate all parties 
could well function without them. The grants are simply not 
required to obtain voter support.
<P>
	While it is undoubtedly difficult for political parties to give up 
what has become a crutch, if the voter support is there the money 
will follow. Campaigns can be run with less glitz and still be 
effective.
<P>
	Clearly, the total elimination of election reimbursements would 
prove to be the most effective means to level the election playing 
field. Moving back to the issue at hand, the official registration of 
an organized political party gives it the right to issue tax receipts 
for donations and affords that privilege at rates well in excess of 
those granted to charitable organizations. I think it is 
unconscionable that contributions to a political party should exceed 
those given to an organization that is in direct support of people 
who need that help.
<P>
	The participation of fringe parties during the last two federal 
elections has prompted a growing public concern that some groups 
have used election campaigns as springboards for causes or issues 
that are largely dismissed by the general population as irrelevant to 
the political debate.
<P>
<B>(1800)</B>
<P>
	In proposing the bill, the member for Edmonton Southwest is 
attempting to gain the consensus of the House in agreeing to take 
one small step toward an  important electoral reform, a reform 
which will not deny the ability of individuals to form new parties 
and run candidates in even a relatively small number of ridings but 
will put an end to one of the identified flagrant abuses of the public 
purse.
<P>
	The bill will amend section 322 of the Canada Elections Act by 
imposing a minimum level of voter support as a condition to 
receive a refund for election expenses. This will be achieved by 
eliminating election refunds for registered regional parties which 
fail to receive at least 5 per cent of the valid votes in the electoral 
districts in which they run candidates, or authorizing refunds only 
for registered national parties which receive a minimum of 2 per 
cent of the total number of valid votes cast in that election. All 
reimbursement requirements will remain the same.
<P>
	The bill is of importance to all Canadians and of interest to 
parties of all political stripes. It will save taxpayers an unnecessary 
expense. Had it been law in the last general election, about $1 
million in election refunds would have been saved. It will not 
adversely effect regional parties geared to expressing the concerns 
and representing the interests of that region. It will allow a smaller 
faction to form a party, field candidates and promote a platform 
specific to that constituency.
<P>
	Politicians of all stripes must have the courage to lead by 
example. This bill represents only a small step in the right 
direction, but it is an important step because it is clear there is 
substantial support for the concept of eliminating election 
subsidies to political fringe groups.
<P>
	It is my hope, and I have been given reassurance, that the House 
will today give unanimous support to this important private 
member's initiative. I am pleased to congratulate hon. members on 
their sensible reaction to it.
<P>

	<B>Mr. Tom Wappel (Scarborough West, Lib.)</B> moved that Bill 
C-205, an act to amend the Criminal Code and the Copyright Act 
(profit from authorship respecting a crime), be read the second 
time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I ask you and all listening to imagine a 
country in which serial killers, child rapists, murderers and violent 
criminals can, from their jail cells, write stories of their crimes, sell 
the books to the citizens of the country within which they wreaked 
such havoc and bank the money anywhere in the world.
<P>
	Imagine a country in which these same heinous criminals can 
collaborate with movie producers, sell the stories of their crimes, 
be technical advisors to the creation of movies of their infamous 
activities and bank their ill gotten profits anywhere in the world.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2841"> 2841 </A></B>
<P>
	Many Canadians would be shocked to know that country is 
Canada. This is despite the fact that the common law of the 
country has held for centuries that a criminal may not profit from 
his or her crime. That is why a person who murders their spouse 
cannot collect the victim's life insurance even as the named 
beneficiary.
<P>
<B>(1805)</B>
<P>
	Should the murderer write a book about their crime, about how 
they plotted to kill their spouse in order to get the insurance 
proceeds, and thereby make a profit from the sale of that book, 
surely that is as much profiting from the crime as collecting the 
insurance. Yet there is no prohibition of this in Canadian law.
<P>
	A few might argue these miscreants have a right under our 
charter to sell their stories in whatever form and pocket the profits. 
The vast majority of Canadians, I included, do not share this view.
<P>
	How can we prevent such a perversion of the most fundamental 
principles of crime and punishment, indeed of justice? My private 
member's Bill C-205 is an attempt to insure that no criminal may 
profit from writing about or selling the story of their sordid 
activities.
<P>
	The idea for the bill was born in the summer of 1993 when I read 
a news report that Karla Homolka was reported to be considering 
selling her story for a profit. There may be some who do not 
remember the name Karla Homolka. Let it simply be said she 
pleaded guilty to manslaughter in the murder of two young girls in 
southern Ontario, together with her spouse who was charged with 
first degree murder, Paul Bernardo, who was subsequently 
convicted.
<P>
	In July 1993 I read a newspaper article. I quote two paragraphs 
from it. I am sure most Canadians would not believe what they 
were reading. The title of the article is ``Teale Free to Profit on 
Story''. The House may remember that Bernardo and his wife 
changed their name to Teale at one point: ``Karla Teale is free to get 
rich by selling the story of her guilt in the sex slayings of two 
teenaged girls, federal legal experts say. Officials in both the 
justice ministry and corrections Canada said yesterday there is no 
law barring Teale from selling her tale to the U.S. media networks 
or to book publishers''. That is a shock to most Canadians.
<P>
	At the time there was a publication ban on the case because 
Bernardo had not yet been brought to trial. That publication ban is 
now over. We know all the sordid details of the case. Yet she is by 
the admission of the justice department and by the admission of 
corrections Canada free to pander her story to whomever will buy 
it, to take that money, put it in the bank and use it for her own 
purposes, whatever they may be. There has to be something wrong 
with a country and with a system of justice that would allow that. 
That simply does not make sense.
<P>
	How do we do something about it? Let us ask a rhetorical 
question. If Karla Homolka is free to write a book or to sell her 
story and collaborate on a screenplay, free to open up a Swiss bank 
account, free to make whatever deals she wishes to make with 
whatever producer is wanting to make some money from her story, 
then why not Paul Bernardo? Why not Clifford Olson or Denis 
Lortie or any of the other heinous criminals we can think of, 
including the torturer murderers of Toronto shoe shine boy 
Emmanuel Jacques, which shocked my community a few years 
back?
<P>
	In the summer of 1993 when I read this article I could not believe 
it. Being a lawyer, the first thing I did was realize I must never 
believe what is in the media without checking it. I looked in the 
Criminal Code. Sure enough, there is no prohibition in the Criminal 
Code. There is no prohibition anywhere for criminals selling their 
stories. That was then.
<P>
<B>(1810 )</B>
<P>
	Since then Ontario has passed a bill to prevent this kind of thing. 
However, this is an extremely piecemeal approach, which I will 
talk about later, because what we are basically saying is that if a 
criminal happens to be housed for a period of time in Ontario they 
cannot do something, but the minute they are housed in another 
institution in another province they can do it.
<P>
	The Criminal Code applies all across Canada. We are not the 
United States with 50 separate Criminal Codes. Canada has only 
one Criminal Code. Surely we should be able to tell criminals they 
must not profit from telling the story of what they did. If they want 
to clear their conscience by writing about it, fine. This bill does not 
prevent anybody from telling their story or writing a book about 
their story, but it does try to prevent them from selling their story 
and making money on it.
<P>
	I then consulted with colleagues of mine in the legal community 
in Ottawa, in particular general lawyers. I thank in particularMr. Frank Brown. I also consulted copyright lawyers. I thank Mr. 
John Macera from the Copyright Bar of Ontario for helping me and 
working with me in formulating this bill.
<P>
	I reiterate very clearly what this bill is and what it is not and on 
what principles it is based. It is based really on two principles. 
First, no criminal should ever profit from telling the story of their 
crimes. Second, criminals need not be prevented from telling their 
stories provided they do not profit from the telling.
<P>
	This bill is a nutshell bill as it has only three sections. It is very 
simple. It includes in the Criminal Code definition of proceeds of 
crime any profit or benefit gained by a person or his family from 
the creation of a work based on the indictable offence for which the 
person was convicted.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2842"> 2842 </A></B>
<P>
	Thus we would be able to seize such profits under the current 
Criminal Code provisions dealing with proceeds of crime. This 
is clearly criminal law jurisdiction under our Constitution.
<P>
	I underscore there is no difference in my view, as I said earlier, 
with a criminal killing their spouse and then trying to collect the 
proceeds of the insurance. The insurance has nothing to do with the 
crime. The insurance is a private contract made under provincial 
laws between the insured and the insurance company. It has 
nothing whatsoever to do with the actual crime. The insurance 
policy may have been taken out 10 or 15 years earlier when the 
couple were on their honeymoon perhaps. Therefore there is no 
direct relationship between the insurance policy and the proceeds 
of the insurance policy and the crime.
<P>
	However, it is obvious no civilized society can convict someone 
for the murder of their spouse, put them in jail and then force an 
insurance company to pay a million dollar policy to the person who 
killed his spouse. Even though the insurance policy is not directly 
related to the actual murder, common law has always stated one 
cannot profit from one's crime.
<P>
	The same analysis can be made to either writing a book or selling 
one's story. Obviously it is not directly related to the crime because 
it clearly must occur after the crime. The crime has to be 
committed first, otherwise there is nothing to write a book about or 
sell the story. However, it is just as related in terms of the principle 
of profiting from one's crime as an insurance policy is.
<P>
	It does not make any sense to permit Paul Bernardo to sell a 
screenplay of what he did to some American producer and then 
have that money banked in Switzerland and used for whatever 
purposes he wants. There has to be a way of dealing with this. For 
reasons I will expand on in a moment, this bill will enable us to 
deal with virtually the entire civilized world and not just Canada.
<P>
<B>(1815)</B>
<P>
	The Criminal Code provision would be changed to include in the 
definition of proceeds of crime a work created by someone who has 
committed a crime. This alone would not help us if the story or 
book were sold outside Canada. It would only help us inside 
Canada. I will take members through the sentencing procedures in 
a moment.
<P>
	We still want to be able to go extraterritorially to prevent a 
Bernardo or Olson from making a deal outside Canada and banking 
the money outside Canada. How can that be achieved? We could 
look to the Copyright Act, which again is federal jurisdiction. 
There can be no question or debate about that.
<P>
	The bill amends the Copyright Act to provide, first, that the 
sentence for an indictable offence is deemed to include an order 
that any work based on the offence is  subject to a new section in 
the Copyright Act, which is in Bill C-205 and, second, to provide in 
the new section that in such a work the copyright that would 
otherwise belong to the convicted person becomes and remains the 
property of the crown forever.
<P>
	This would permit Canada to bring legal action in any country 
that is a signatory to the Berne convention on copyright to enforce 
its rights of copyright, including seizure of funds paid to the 
criminal or injunctions to halt the sale of books, movies, videos, et 
cetera.
<P>
	In three little sections of a bill criminals would be prevented 
from profiting from their crimes and would vest the copyright of 
any such story in the Government of Canada which could then 
enforce its rights to prevent the sale in any country to which the 
Berne convention applies, which is approximately 180 countries.
<P>
	Let me use someone like Paul Bernardo as an example. What 
would happen if this bill was in place? In addition to being 
sentenced to life in prison, on conviction there would be a new 
section in the Criminal Code which would automatically deem as 
part of his sentence ``an order that the convicted person and any 
work related to the offence be subject to section 12.1 of the 
Copyright Act''.
<P>
	Section 12.1 of the Copyright Act, which is also part of this bill, 
provides that any work which is principally based on an offence or 
the circumstances of its commission-the copyright of that work 
which would otherwise belong to the offender-would belong to 
Canada and would never revert to the offender. The work is a very 
technical legal question defined in the Copyright Act.
<P>
	If Mr. Bernardo wrote a book or screen play or collaborated on a 
book or a screen play and was paid for so doing, he would be 
unable to earn any money. He would have no copyright to sell 
because the only copyright available is in the Government of 
Canada which, of course, would seize the funds. That is how the 
bill would work.
<P>
	I want to stress how important it is that this be done on a national 
level. It is ludicrous to suggest that this be done on a patchwork or 
provincial basis. Ten different laws would be required. Even if 
there were 12 different laws, one for each province and a law for 
each of the territories, that were all identical and covered the 
prisoner in Canada, it would not stop the prisoner from selling the 
story anywhere else in the world, including the United States, and 
putting the money in a Swiss bank account to use for any purpose.
<P>
<B>(1820 )</B>
<P>
	It is not an answer, with great respect, to say it should be done by 
the provinces. That is patchwork at best. If nothing else, it 
guarantees that the story would be sold in the United States, West 
Germany, Great Britain or wherever there is someone who is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2843"> 2843 </A></B>
<P>
prepared to pay for the  story in order to make money from it. We 
all know that there have been some pretty gruesome movies made.
<P>
	The bill would not stop criminals from writing a story and asking 
that the crown send the profits to the victims. It would not stop 
criminals from writing a story simply to purge their conscience. 
The bill asks only one thing and that is to ensure criminals do not 
receive money for telling their story.
<P>
	I would like to advise the House that the bill has the endorsement 
of the following organizations: the Canadian Police Association, 
the Canadian Resource Centre for Victims of Crime, Families 
Against Crime Today Society, End Violence Against Children, 
Citizens United for Safety and Justice, Victims for Justice, 
Emotional Support for Victims of Violence and their Family, 
Canadians Against Violence Everywhere Advocating its 
Termination, known as CAVEAT, Victims for Justice, and 
Canadians Taking Action Against Violence.
<P>
	I would like to read a few quotations from some of the 
organizations that support the bill. I will begin with the Canadian 
Police Association, which stated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Canadian Police Association is pleased to announce its support forMr. Tom Wappel in his efforts to prevent criminals from profiting from their 
crimes. Mr. Wappel's Private Member's Bill will ensure that convicted criminals 
will not be permitted to profit financially through writing a book or selling their 
story. This bill will provide much needed protection for victims of crime, and 
ensure that their pain and suffering is not exploited.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The Canadian Resource Centre for Victims of Crime stated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Canadian Resource Centre for Victims of Crime is pleased to announce 
our support for Mr. Tom Wappel's Private Member's Bill concerning the 
proceeds of crime. If successful, this Bill would prevent criminals from 
profiting from their crimes if, for example, they write a book detailing their 
criminal activities.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This kind of legislation has been a long time coming, and will go a long way 
in ensuring that crime does not pay. That principle is a longstanding value 
entrenched in the Canadian justice system and Canadian society.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The letter from CAVEAT reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We would like to thank you for this Private Member's Bill which addresses 
the spectre of convicted offenders who stand to profit by exploiting their 
crimes-</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Public confidence in a just and safe society depends on societal values being 
reflected by the Justice System. Canadian society views violent offences, in 
particular, with revulsion and distaste. Criminals and their families should 
never be allowed to accrue rich rewards for their offences anywhere, anytime, 
any place.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	To that I say amen.
<P>
	In closing, I want to, in advance, thank any and all members and 
parties that choose to support this bill. I know there have been 
discussions, but I do not wish to presume anything. I want to 
remind members that we are at second reading. When this bill is 
voted on we will be  asked to approve the principle behind the bill. 
It can then to go the justice and legal affairs committee. The 
experts can look at it, fix whatever needs fixing and strengthen it by 
perhaps putting in a section directing that the money must go to the 
victims, for example. I am open to any reasonable proposal which 
would strengthen the bill and which would meet its fundamental 
principle, which is that no criminal should make a dime for 
committing a crime.
<P>
<B>(1825)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to participate in the debate on Bill C-205. The purpose of 
this bill, which was introduced by the hon. member for 
Scarborough West, is to prevent a convicted offender from 
benefiting from his crime by creating a work, a book or a video for 
example, describing part or all of the crime. This bill amends both 
the Criminal Code and the Copyright Act.
<P>
	According to the popular saying, crime does not pay. Yet, an 
individual convicted of an offence could now benefit from his 
crime. I agree, for several reasons, with the hon. member for 
Scarborough West that it is unacceptable and immoral for anyone 
to profit from his or her crime.
<P>
	First of all, profiting from one's crime in this case is no more 
acceptable than letting a thief keep the money it has stolen or a 
drug dealer keep the proceeds of his trafficking. Under this new 
measure, conviction for an indictable offence, that is to say a major 
crime, will automatically entail the forfeiture of the intellectual 
proceeds of crime, namely royalties on the story.
<P>
	Forfeiture of the proceeds of crime is ordered by the courts as a 
matter of normal practice. This bill merely extends the power to 
seize in order to prevent a person who has committed a crime to get 
rich as a result. Not only would the offender be deprived of any 
profit gained from the creation of a work based on the offence, but 
so would a member of his family or a person dependent on him. 
Otherwise, the offender might be tempted to create a work that 
would benefit the members of his family.
<P>
	The term ``family'' should be defined so as to include the father, 
the mother, the children, the brothers and sisters, the current 
spouse, and the spouse at the time the offence was committed, even 
in case of a divorce. However, the term ``family'' should exclude 
the victim of the criminal act, even if that person is a member of the 
family of the offender.
<P>
	Why should the victim, even if a member of the family, not be 
allowed to tell what he or she went through and gain from it? 
Publishing a book can be a legitimate means of expressing oneself 
and sharing one's experience with the public.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2844"> 2844 </A></B>
<P>
	It would be too bad to punish victims, when we are taking all 
sorts of steps to encourage them to speak out against crime and 
to testify in the courts. It could be of benefit to everyone to hear 
what they have been through.
<P>
	Everyone remembers the Lortie affair, the corporal in the 
Canadian army who fired a gun within the Quebec National 
Assembly. His ex-wife has just put out a book about the events 
surrounding the slaughter committed by her then husband.
<P>
	The bill before us does not apply to this situation, becauseMrs. Lortie is publishing her book without the participation of her 
ex-husband. The French text of the bill, for once, is an 
improvement on the English and reveals clearly the intentions of 
the member for Scarborough West.
<P>
	The English text would gain in clarity if the words ``from him'' 
were added after ``collaboration or cooperation'', in order to 
clearly indicate that the copyright would be confiscated only if the 
author of the crime either wrote or contributed to the work.
<P>
	Therefore, family members would be to benefit from the work 
based on the offence if the author of the crime is not involved in the 
creation of the work. I therefore support this bill, first of all to 
prevent the author of a crime or the members of his family from 
gaining any advantage from it, but also because the proposed 
measure constitutes a measure of additional protection for the 
victims. This is an excellent measure for ensuring that victims or 
witnesses may testify against the author of a crime without losing 
anonymity.
<P>
	Why do so many people not speak out? Very often, they fear 
publicity, fear having their names and what they experienced made 
public. Without the amendment proposed today, all other sections 
of the Criminal Code aimed at facilitating the laying of charges and 
testimony by victims and witnesses during a criminal trial are 
pointless. If the author of the crime can reveal victims' and 
witnesses' names, relate in detail what he did to them and how they 
reacted, do the victims and witnesses have any protection? They 
have been tricked.
<P>
<B>(1830)</B>
<P>
	They co-operated with the police, they testified in court. They 
were led to believe their anonymity was protected by hearings in 
camera or by a ban on publication. Then, once a conviction has 
been obtained, the author of the crime writes a book and reveals all. 
This is how they become victims a second time. We can assume the 
private life of victims is totally unprotected without this measure.
<P>
	This bill is in keeping with provisions already made and with 
others under consideration, all with the aim of encouraging victims 
of criminal acts to identify their aggressors and helping them 
testify in court.
<P>
	The Reform Party introduced a motion in this House on April 29 
to have a Canadian declaration of victims' rights proclaimed. We 
held that it was a provincial matter, but that the federal government 
could, secondarily, legislate victims' rights under the Criminal 
Code. The measure proposed today is such an example. We hope it 
will receive the support of the House.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to have an opportunity to speak on Bill C-205. I commend 
the member from Scarborough for an excellent presentation of his 
bill.
<P>
	As legislators there are often times when we find there are 
loopholes or something missing in our judicial system. 
Unfortunately it is brought to our attention by the criminal 
elements in our society. In the past couple of years there have been 
two such cases which come to mind.
<P>
	Back in March of this year we were informed that in an 
agreement with a former warden Clifford Olson had produced a 
dozen videotapes in prison modestly titled ``Motivational Sexual 
Homicide Patterns of Serial Killer Clifford Robert Olson'', 
recorded by a willing prison staff person. The purpose of the videos 
was apparently to provide insight into Olson's motives for 
committing 11 sex murders of children in B.C. before his arrest in 
1981. He also agreed to provide new information about unsolved 
murders.
<P>
	Then Mr. Olson registered for a copyright on the series of 
videotapes. This I might add is usually done for material with 
commercial potential. The fact that Olson would receive copyright 
protection of these videos was appalling at the time of discovery 
and it remains so today.
<P>
	Before the videotapes were exposed however, last fall my hon. 
colleague from Surrey-White Rock-South Langley received a 
letter from Olson who claimed to be writing a book for an 
American publisher. He wanted a picture of her and permission to 
use documents prepared by her office in his book.
<P>
	In addition to the tapes and this letter, Mr. Olson registered a 
copyright in 1989 on a book entitled <I>Profile of a Serial Killer: The 
Clifford Olson Case</I>. He registered a second copyright in 1992 on a 
volume entitled <I>Inside the Mind of a Serial Killer: A Profile</I>. Later 
in August 1993 it was revealed in <I>Saturday Night</I> magazine that 
Mr. Olson had access to a reporter for 18 months of regular 
meetings, hundreds of hours of telephone conversations and active 
correspondence with him. He revealed that he had already made 35 
cassette tapes of his autobiography.
<P>
	As the House can see, Mr. Olson has produced a number of 
pieces of work with the potential for him to profit from them. In the 
case of the videotapes, they are the property of Correctional 
Services Canada and not Olson. He will therefore not profit, not 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2845"> 2845 </A></B>
<P>
this time. However we have to prepare for the next time. The  threat 
of him being able to profit from any such material always exists.
<P>
	Olson has already manipulated the system for personal profit on 
one occasion. This was back in 1981 when the RCMP made a 
contract with him which allowed him to benefit financially from 
the deaths of the children he murdered. In 1982 the parents of 
Olson's victims sued Olson in civil court to have the money taken 
away from Olson and his family. The case was taken to the supreme 
court but unlike the American system, there were no laws in 
Canada to prevent him from profiting from these crimes. Beyond 
these frustrations is the fact that it has forced the families of 
Olson's victims to relive their tragedies again. These families 
feared all along that Olson would profit from the deaths of their 
children.
<P>
<B>(1835)</B>
<P>
	On March 17, 1996 I received a letter from Gary Rosenfeldt, one 
of the founders of Victims of Violence. He expressed fear that 
Olson or his lawyer might try to sell the videotapes to an American 
tabloid television program. It is clear that in the past couple of 
years he has produced enough work that has the potential to gain 
profit. This is why it is so important for Bill C-205 to be passed 
immediately into law.
<P>
	This issue was once again revived in the wake of the 
manslaughter conviction of Karla Homolka who was sentenced to 
12 years in prison for her part in the killings of teenagers Kristen 
French and Leslie Mahaffy. There was speculation that Homolka 
could be offered a television or book deal. Once again we are faced 
with the situation where there is no law barring Homolka from 
selling her story to the U.S. media networks or book publishers.
<P>
	According to the mother of Leslie Mahaffy, the sensationalism 
began with a book called <I>Lethal Marriage</I>. Since that time there 
have been many articles published and the knowledge that at least 
three more books, a movie contract, magazine specials, TV 
specials and talk show offers have given Mrs. Mahaffy no comfort, 
only apprehension as to whether Homolka or Bernardo will 
collaborate in any of these productions.
<P>
	Beyond these two cases we have had two others where the people 
have profited from their crimes. Roger Caron, a former bank 
robber, would not have been able to collect royalties on his 
Governor General's award winning book <I>Go-boy</I> which he wrote 
while still in prison. In the case of Lawrencia Bembenek, she would 
have had to forgo payment for her book <I>Woman on Trial</I> published 
in 1993. In this case she used the proceeds to help pay Canadian 
lawyers for the work they did on her case. She probably would not 
have written the story otherwise.
<P>
	In all of these cases, Bill C-205 would deny these individuals the 
opportunity to profit from their crimes. This is a much needed step 
in the right direction. In  today's society there is a tendency to make 
criminals celebrities with no regard to the moral questions 
involved. Today we have criminals collaborating on movie deals, 
becoming technical advisers in the creation of their movies and 
simply banking the profits.
<P>
	Sensationalism is at the forefront of most major news stories. 
The more sensational the story, the more profit there is to be made. 
It is bad enough when people want to profit from someone else's 
tragedy but the fact that the criminals themselves can profit from 
the crimes is outrageous. It is simply hard to believe that Canada 
would allow serial killers, child rapists, murderers and violent 
criminals to write their stories of crime and be able to bank the 
money anywhere in the world.
<P>
	Criminal acts are now held in such heroic stature that the 
escalation of these horrible crimes may never be deterred. Now is 
the time for action and this piece of legislation is the kind of law we 
need. We have to send a message that crime does not pay.
<P>
	My hon. colleague for Scarborough West has sought to rectify 
these situations in his Private Member's Bill C-205. He has 
attempted to ensure that no criminals will profit from writing about 
or selling the story of their criminal activities.
<P>
	Many of the victims of crime have been pushing for this 
legislation for a long time. The suffering these families endure on a 
good day is overwhelming, but as Leslie Mahaffy's mother states: 
``We cannot afford not to stop the sale of violence, profit from 
crime, especially murder which is obscene. Murder, violence, 
degradation, dehumanization, pornography are currently being 
marketed in novels, electronic games, slasher movies, videos and 
this must be stopped''.
<P>
	All in all, this legislation will ensure that victims and their 
families are not further victimized by criminals. We must do more 
for victims of crime and ensure that their rights and freedoms are 
respected as well. It is only right that the proceeds from such 
crimes should revert to the crown in order to reimburse society for 
some of the costs for ensuring safety in our society. Once and for 
all, the victims of crime must be considered before the criminals 
themselves.
<P>
<B>(1840)</B>
<P>
	With these thoughts in mind, I intend to move an amendment in 
the future which will allow the victims of crime to benefit directly. 
This is based on a model developed in the province of Ontario. In 
1994 legislation was adopted that empowered the Attorney General 
of Ontario to seize all proceeds earned by criminals selling their 
stories. Under Bill 85, all money made by criminals would be sent 
to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board which would directly 
help the families of the victims of crime. If this is possible 
provincially, there is no reason it could not work federally. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2846"> 2846 </A></B>
<P>
Therefore, I will be  working toward this amendment which will be 
presented to the justice committee in the weeks to come.
<P>
	Once again, my congratulations to the member for Scarborough 
West. May this bill become law.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am very delighted to participate in the debate on Bill C-205 which 
was introduced by the hon. member for Scarborough West. I 
commend the hon. member for all the hard work and detailed 
research he has done with respect to this bill, as he has done in 
other cases.
<P>
	The bill proposes amendments to the Criminal Code and to the 
Copyright Act. I will take a few minutes to review and comment on 
the proposed amendments to the Criminal Code.
<P>
	The bill amends part XII.2 of the Criminal Code so as to include 
in the definition of proceeds of crime, any profit, benefit or 
advantage gained by a person convicted of an indictable offence or 
by any member of his or her family from the creation of a work 
based on the offence. This amendment would extend to such 
profits, benefits and advantages the existing provisions of the 
Criminal Code respecting the search, seizure and restraint of 
proceeds of crime, as well as the provisions concerning 
confiscation.
<P>
	The bill also provides that a sentence for an indictable offence is 
deemed to include an order that any work based on an offence is 
subject to a new section which this bill proposes to the Copyright 
Act. The amendment to the Copyright Act would have the effect of 
vesting in Her Majesty any copyright in a work that would 
otherwise belong to the convicted person which is based on the 
offence for which he or she was convicted.
<P>
	I would like to state at the outset that I am extremely 
sympathetic to the motives which lie behind my distinguished 
colleague's efforts to amend the law in this area and to those who 
have spoken in favour of this change. The phenomenon of 
criminals writing or threatening to write accounts of their crimes in 
exchange for money or for other benefits is a relatively new thing 
in Canada.
<P>
	The very idea that a criminal who has committed a violent act or 
a series of violent acts, such as in the Bernardo case, could actually 
benefit financially from the recounting of his or her criminal acts is 
extremely offensive to many. If the victims of those crimes are 
made to be subject to those accounts, are they not being victimized 
again?
<P>
	It is therefore something which I believe should be addressed 
and I commend my colleague for attempting to do so through this 
bill. The real question that remains is how to achieve that goal 
without unduly limiting the expression of ideas in a free and 
democratic society.
<P>
	The bill we have before us, and more particularly the 
amendments which my distinguished colleague proposes to the 
Criminal Code, contain certain fundamental difficulties. As I 
mentioned earlier, this bill would amend part XII.2 of the Criminal 
Code of Canada which deals with the proceeds of crime. It should 
be noted that part XII.2 of the Criminal Code contains a 
comprehensive and complex legal regime designed to seize, 
restrain and ultimately confiscate proceeds from the commission of 
enterprised crime offences or designated drug offences.
<P>
<B>(1845 )</B>
<P>
	However, the moneys sought to be regulated by my colleague's 
bill are not derived directly or indirectly from the commission of a 
crime. On the contrary, they would be derived from a totally 
legitimate activity, writing a book or some other similarly 
legitimate activity. The simple act of writing a book is not in and of 
itself a criminal offence even if that book is a recounting of 
criminal activities for which the author has been convicted.
<P>
	On the other hand, part XII.2 is meant to be engaged only when 
the proceeds are derived from the commission of a crime, which is 
simply not the case with the writing and publication of a book or 
selling the rights for a movie.
<P>
	The proposed amendments to part XII.2 of the Criminal Code 
would subvert the purpose of this part of the code by enabling the 
use of the provisions of this part of the code to confiscate moneys 
earned from a non-criminal act. Even if one were to attempt to 
characterize moneys derived from the publication of a book written 
by a convicted person as the proceeds of crime, it would be almost 
impossible to justify trying to deprive moneys earned by a member 
of the convicted person's family who has not been convicted of 
anything and who has written a book about the convicted person's 
criminal activities.
<P>
	Any regulation imposed on income earned by an individual from 
materials such as books, videos, movies or other activities relating 
to his or her criminal activities raises constitutional concerns, most 
notably concerns relating to the charter. Section 2(b) of the charter 
guarantees to all Canadians the freedom of thought, belief, opinion 
and expression, including freedom of the press and other media 
communication.
<P>
	It has been suggested this bill's amendment to the Criminal Code 
does not infringe or restrict freedom of expression. It is argued that 
the regulation of moneys earned from materials relating to an 
individual's criminal activity does not impair freedom of 
expression in any way. The person is always at liberty to publish 
accounts of his or her crimes, but any money earned from the 
publication would go to the government.
<P>
	If this line of argument were followed, regulation of the financial 
exploitation of criminality would not offend  section 2(b) of the 
charter. However, there is another approach which results in a 
different conclusion. This approach to the characterization of this 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2847"> 2847 </A></B>
<P>
legislative initiative would result in the finding of a prima facie 
breach of section 2(b) of the charter.
<P>
	The approach holds that any attempt to regulate the moneys paid 
to a convicted person for publishing an account of his or her crimes 
amounts to a content based restriction on freedom of expression. 
The logic behind this approach rests on the fact that the only basis 
for depriving an author of any financial benefit from such an 
account of his or her crime is the content of the publication or 
expression itself. Typically the courts have found that content 
based limitations violate section 2(b) of the charter.
<P>
	This initiative may also raise constitutional division of powers 
concerns. I mention this because the division of legislative powers 
established by sections 91 and 92 of the Constitution Act, 1867 
assigns responsibility over certain activities to the federal 
government and other activities to provincial jurisdictions. Section 
91(27) gives federal Parliament the exclusive power to enact 
criminal laws and laws relating to criminal procedure. Sections 
92(13) and 92(16) permit provincial legislatures to enact laws 
affecting civil rights in matters of a private nature.
<P>
<B>(1850)</B>
<P>
	In the Queen v. Zelinski a bare majority of the supreme court 
held that an accused person could be ordered to compensate 
victims of crime provided that such an order was an element of the 
sentencing process in criminal proceedings. This case dates back to 
1978. Subsequent jurisprudence suggests the creation of a civil 
right of action for breach of the criminal law is very likely ultra 
vires of Parliament. That is, outside the jurisdiction of Parliament.
<P>
	It has been suggested the laws seeking to attach money earned 
from publishing accounts of criminal activity do not fit 
comfortably within section 91(27) of the Constitution Act of 1867, 
within the federal powers.
<P>
	Part XXI.2 of the Criminal Code already contains a legal regime 
designed to assist in confiscating proceeds obtained as a 
consequence of the commission of certain designated crimes. 
However, the moneys sought to be regulated here have only the 
most tenuous relationship to the crimes of which the individual has 
been convicted.
<P>
	Numerous publications have made significant literary, historical, 
criminological, sociological and psychological contributions to 
society. One such book, <I>Go Boy</I> by Roger Caron, which depicts a 
number of bank robberies the author committed, resulted in the 
author's receiving the governor general's award for literacy.
<P>
	The act of writing a book, producing a movie, even when based 
on a crime, is not criminal. The moneys earned directly from those 
acts are sought to be taken away from the author. Simply put, it is 
difficult to  characterize these as fruits or proceeds of crime. 
Rather, the financial exploitation of crime is more accurately 
characterized as the regulation of contractual rights, that is, within 
the legislative power of the province. This has been enacted in one 
province and certainly options are open for other provinces to to 
follow the lead of Ontario.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if I 
understand the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice 
correctly, he is saying that if the federal government were to 
proceed with this bill, some aspects of it would be contrary to the 
charter.
<P>
	Yet he is making the recommendation that the provinces have the 
authority to do this and that they would not be enacting a piece of 
legislation contrary to the charter of rights and freedoms. I see an 
inconsistency in this that is a justification for the government not to 
support the bill.
<P>
	In other words, if Ontario's Bill 84 is constitutionally sound, I 
am sure a similar bill passed by the government at the federal level 
would be constitutionally sound as well. Therefore I do not 
understand the argument of my colleague across the way.
<P>
	I rise in support of this bill. It would prohibit a criminal from 
profiting by selling, authorizing or offering the story of their 
crimes. I commend the member for Scarborough West for putting 
forward this bill.
<P>
	It is unfortunate but not surprising the government he represents 
does not see fit to initiate a bill of this nature, one which reaffirms 
the rights of victims, the right not to be revictimized.
<P>
	We need this bill because no criminal should ever profit from the 
exploitation of their crime.
<P>
<B>(1855)</B>
<P>
	During the heart wrenching testimony of the grandmother of 
murder victim Sylvain Leduc in front of the justice standing 
committee, we heard the horrible graphic details about that heinous 
crime.
<P>
	We heard about Sylvain. We heard how he was taken from his 
home in the middle of the night, how he was tortured and beaten 
until he died. We learned about the sadistic mutilation of the two 
young women who were also held hostage during this night of 
terror.
<P>
	We watched as the tears rolled down the cheeks of Sylvain's 
mother and welled up in the eyes of those in attendance as this 
horror story was related.
<P>
	We watched the sadness and the rage surface within Sylvain's 
grandmother as she relived the nightmare of her grandson's brutal 
murder. We can only imagine the pain and suffering Sylvain's 
family has endured and continues to endure.
<P>
	Hopefully we will never know this kind of anguish. To allow that 
anguish to keep festering, to allow the wound to be opened and 
reopened is wrong. If this bill does not  pass, if we do not stop 
thieves, sexual offenders and murderers like those who took the life 
of Sylvain Leduc from receiving money for telling their story in 
<P>

<B><A NAME="2848"> 2848 </A></B>
<P>
any form we will simply be adding to those horrendous crimes and 
to the suffering of those who have been victimized.
<P>
	In the absence of this bill not only would victims and victims' 
families have to endure reading or watching the horrific events they 
lived, they would be watching knowing their sexual attacker or 
their son or daughter's killer was profiting financially. Criminals 
and their families should never be allowed to accrue rewards for 
their criminal offences anywhere, any time or any place.
<P>
	How a civilized country like ours could and would allow 
criminals like Paul Bernardo, Karla Homolka or Clifford Olson to 
reap any kind of reward for their sordid activities is 
incomprehensible.
<P>
	The bill from the member for Scarborough West will not prevent 
a criminal from creating a work or collaborating on a work based 
on their offence, which many argue is within their charter rights. 
However, it will prevent those convicted of an indictable offence 
from profiting from their offence. I am sure it will eliminate the 
monetary motive for proceeding in the first place.
<P>
	I support CAVEAT's proposal with regard to this bill that any 
proceeds from the exploitation of crimes should revert to the crown 
for restitution to the victims of crime and to recompense society for 
the enormous financial costs of enforcing the law.
<P>
	The media reported very accurately and graphically the murder 
of Sylvain Leduc and the gang torturing of his female cousins. The 
press also adequately portrayed the shock, rage and sadness of the 
family, friends and the community. However, what it failed to 
reveal was the less sensational part of this horror story, the part of 
the story regarding money. We do not hear much about the 
financial cost of crimes.
<P>
	Unbeknownst to the Canadian public which read daily about this 
crime, Sylvain's single mother on welfare did not have enough 
money to bury her son. Although Sylvain's mother Carol applied to 
victims of compensation and qualified for emergency help, she was 
told it would be years before she receives any money.
<P>
	Fortunately for her enough money was collected from families 
and friends to assist her. If this was not bad enough, I would like to 
mention the wonderful treatment Carol received from our 
bureaucrats.
<P>
	Sylvain was killed on October 25. Three days later, October 28, 
Carol was called by the welfare office to tell her that since her son 
had died her cheque for the month of November would be reduced.
<P>
	Bill C-205 is about victims. It is about the rights of victims, 
rights that are being denied in this country in favour of criminal 
rights. I have to stop here for a moment and touch on those 
individuals who may oppose  the bill on the basis that this kind of 
activity would somehow have a rehabilitative effect on the 
offenders, that somehow the writing of these stories, the 
participation in videos or movies is somehow a rehabilitative 
procedure. I am sure we will hear that if this bill goes before the 
Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs. I cannot help but 
recall those witnesses that have appeared before the standing 
committee on a number of bills who have cried out for greater 
rights for those who have been convicted and are serving time in 
institutions.
<P>
<B>(1900)</B>
<P>
	I remember reading the report of Madam Louise Arbour on the 
riot in the Kingston prison for women. She made an enormous 
effort to support the rights of the inmates who had rioted, had 
assaulted and had completely disregarded the rights of the guards 
whom they attacked and the responsibility of the authorities to 
maintain security and order.
<P>
	The author of that report even criticized the correctional facility 
for not ensuring that the six inmates, after they had continued to 
riot for three or four days before being placed into segregation, had 
one hour of recreational activity during the period of rioting. It was 
a shock to me to read that report. It should be mandatory reading 
for every member of the House.
<P>
	I would like to read from a letter which Sylvain's grandmother 
wrote to the Minister of Justice and which she read to the justice 
committee. If this testimony does not move all members of the 
House to support Bill C-205 I do not know what will. The letter 
reads:
<P>

	Once again I commend the hon. member for Scarborough West 
for helping to put a stop to the pain and suffering of Sylvain's

all the families of victims of violent crimes. I support this private 
member's bill, as I believe the vast majority of Canadians do.
