would like to draw the attention of the House today to the 
Winnipeg Boys and Girls Club and its Floodbusters program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After the flood that Winnipeg suffered this summer, the 
department of human resources and the Winnipeg Boys and Girls 
Club got together and organized a program that hired 193 
students.  They worked all summer long cleaning up properties and 
helping homeowners repair their homes.  They removed some 400,000 
sandbags.  They ran a summer camp for kids displaced by the flood 
so their parents could work on their properties.  When the Red 
Cross was having trouble getting relief out, 12 members of the 
Floodbusters team worked with the Red Cross to ensure people got 
the compensation they needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The program was run by Mike Owens, executive director of the 
Winnipeg Boys and Girls Club, and Heather Popoff who actually 
directed the program.  They did a superb job.  I would like all 
members of the House to congratulate them.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
why strike a subcommittee to study sports in Canada?  Is it 
because our national passion, hockey, is going south?  Do we need 
a study to know the NHL is a multi-billion dollar, multinational 
business funded by $80 tickets, special viewing box seats and TV 
revenue from mass markets? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>NHL owners and players are pricing hockey out of its cradle, our 
home, Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee mandate, with an emphasis on hockey, will also 
touch on other sports, both professional and amateur, in 30 
meetings and will table a report by June 1998.  This is 
completely unrealistic, resulting in either a lightweight study 
having no real value or worse a request to expand the hearings 
tenfold.  The study is either a waste of time or a blank cheque. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are we doing it?  Donovan Bailey, Silken Lauman, Nancy 
Green, Kurt Browning, Sylvie Frechette and of course Paul 
Henderson.  Need I name more?  Canadians are proud of their

work done by the government that has resulted in today's healthy

and continue the process of debt reduction and fiscal restraint. 
We are all looking forward to the elimination of the deficit 
during this Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My constituents have told me that we should reinvest any surplus 
dividend in health care, education, youth employment and the 
environment.  As well, my constituents would like to see 
continuing support for small business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It may interest my hon. colleagues across the floor to learn 
that we did not talk about sweeping tax cuts.  Canadians, 
especially those in Ontario, know too well the real costs of 
these tax cuts borne by them in the areas of the health care 
system and the education of their children.  They are not willing 
to pay this huge price for political pandering.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the prime minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just hours before the Liberals called the spring election 
cabinet pulled another fast one on Canadians, approving $1.5 
billion in financing and agreeing to circumvent an environmental 
assessment of a Candu reactor sale to Turkey. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In six years this reactor reported 1,100 nuclear incidents. 
Politically unstable, Turkey has a disturbing human rights record 
and it is an alarmingly high credit risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does this sordid deal promote environmental safety abroad 
and Canada's good reputation in the world community? 
<P><A NAME="LINK55"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Natural Resources and 
Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, if and when AECL is successful in its bid and actually 
negotiates a contract to sell a Candu reactor to Turkey it will 
of course comply with all applicable Canadian standards and 
Turkish requirements. Those Turkish requirements are in fact one 
of the very bid specifications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a matter of policy AECL conducts an environmental analysis of 
all its projects. 
<P><A NAME="LINK56"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I hope 
the prime minister will address this question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ever since he was energy minister 13 years ago, the prime 
minister has been bound and determined to sell nuclear technology 
to Turkey.  Now he is at it again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the prime minister not find a better way to rack up club 
Kyoto points than spending billions of dollars to promote the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister for International Trade,

misunderstanding about the whole financing. This is not a 
giveaway.  This is a repayable loan at commercial rates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, Canada has sold thus far nine nuclear reactors.  The 
Canadian public has not lost one cent on any repayment.  In fact, 
not only has it made money but it has also created jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last, the state of Turkey is guaranteeing this loan and as a 
member of the OECD and as an ally in NATO and as a country that 
has kept up with its international repayment schedule—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
difficult for the House to take the government seriously when the 
Minister of Natural Resources tells us that AECL is doing an 
environmental assessment on itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know from the Prime Minister, since he is ready 
to manipulate the courts and also circumvent the law by producing 
a secret shadow assessment on the Turkish deal, if a secret 
shadow assessment has been done on the China deal.  If yes, will 
he take it out of the shadows, allow it to glow in the dark and 
take the credit that he wants but that he does not deserve? 
<P><A NAME="LINK59"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, everything was made public when we signed the deal with 
China.  Everybody knows everything.  We always respect the law. 
<P><A NAME="LINK60"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, when 
he was the environment critic in 1991, today's finance minister 
said “I unconditionally support the principle of the 
environmental assessment legislation in Canada”.  I guess he 
just does not support the practice.  He then went on to say “The 
environmental assessment process in this country must not be open 
to political manipulation”.  If selling nuclear reactors to 
other countries without environmental assessment is not political 
manipulation of assessment laws, what is political manipulation? 
<P><A NAME="LINK61"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Natural Resources and 
Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, as I have indicated, the policies of AECL are to conduct 
environmental analysis of all of its projects.  The bid projects 
from other countries around the world typically include 
environmental requirements with which AECL must comply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, in terms of the application of the Canadian 
Environmental Assessment Act, the hon. gentleman will know that 
is a matter of litigation at the present time and neither he nor

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
according to senior government sources, the Kyoto deal is going 
to cost Canadians billions of dollars. We want to ask the Prime 
Minister a straight question and we want a straight answer.  I 
ask him not to evade it or avoid it but to just answer it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How is the government going to pay for the Kyoto deal, by 
raising the gas tax or by cutting into the surplus?  Which will 
it be?  How is it going to pay for it? 
<P><A NAME="LINK63"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, we have a very good record.  We have run a good 
government and have managed to reduce the deficit to almost zero 
in four years.  Therefore, we know how to manage the affairs of 
the nation.  Among the responsibilities of the nation is to make 
a contribution to the problem of climate change, something the 
Reform Party does not want us to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to have a strong position because we believe in the 
protection of the environment on this side of the House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK64"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I asked a straight question and I got another crooked answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why will the Prime Minister not tell us— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Sit down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  We are pushing the envelope a little bit 
today.  The question, please. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, yesterday the cabinet 
apparently made a decision to rack up costs on the Kyoto deal. 
How is the government going to pay for it?  Is there going to be 
an increased gas tax or not?  Is the government going to reduce 
the surplus or not?  How is it going to pay for the billions of 
dollars of cost implied by the Kyoto deal? 
<P><A NAME="LINK65"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Natural Resources and 
Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is exclusively the Reform Party that is talking about 
this doomsday scenario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. gentleman should know that there are a variety of ways 
by which the climate challenge can be addressed:  by broadening 
and deepening the voluntary initiatives in the private sector 
which the private sector is already anxious to do; strengthening 
energy efficiency, encouraging co-generation; promoting science 
and technology and the commercialization of science and 
technology; fostering renewables; the whole point about jointed 
limitations; the whole point about credits trading throughout the 
world.  All of those will be part of the equation.  Canada will 
have a position that works.

We are in this House and we are speaking to the government. The Minister

</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the Minister of Health claim to have the agreement of the

them like that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the hon. member from Roberval to pose his question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier:</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is very simple. Is 
the minister aware of the letter signed by the present Deputy Minister 
of Health and sent to his environment colleague in Quebec, and of the 
denial by the Quebec Minister of the Environment of what the minister 
has just said in this House? 
<P><A NAME="LINK70"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this is

about this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh! 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock:</B> The simple fact is that the provinces have 
jurisdiction over the quality of drinking water and that the federal 
government has the power to make laws concerning the materials used to 
transport water. Our bill deals with this and it is an area of federal 
jurisdiction.

Island, British Columbia and he should know better than to ask 
such a foolish question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that the salmon resources on the west coast are 
shared between Canada and the United States. To have a decision 
which will be lasting and in the best interests of fishermen of 
both countries and at the same time to protect conservation, it 
is essential to have a joint agreement with the Americans. There 
is no other way of handling this matter except through an 
agreement which both sides feel is in their interests.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of British Columbia have heard talk for five years 
from this government and they are sick and tired of it. They want

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans,

the rhetoric in the House.  What counts is an agreement with the 
Americans. We must have a lasting agreement that we have not had 
because of the flaws in the Mulroney treaty which was negotiated 
in 1985. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are attempting to overturn that through the 
Strangway-Ruckelshaus process. The hon. member is well aware of 
that process. Instead of coming here and putting forth the 
comments he has, he should be supporting the process so we can 
get to an agreement which will solve the problem we face on the 
west coast.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ask a question of the Minister of Human Resources 
Development. The Community Fisheries Development Centre has 
prepared an excellent active labour market transition plan 
costing $375 million over three years. On the east coast fishery 
so far, $3.4 billion was spent. I want to ask the minister to 
finally meet with representatives from British Columbia who are

pleasure to present a petition, pursuant to Standing Order 36,

from the Kamloops constituency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They call upon the government to do away with section 745 of the 
Criminal Code, the section which in a sense does not mean that a 
life sentence is a life sentence.  It means it is only a 
shortened sentence and it allows criminals like Clifford Olson 
and so on to make appeals.  Thousands of people from my 
constituency are saying that this does not seem right at all and 
should be repealed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have another petition that has to do with section 43 of the 
Criminal Code of Canada.  That is the section that permits people 
to violently beat their children.  I suppose we could put it that 
way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners feel that it is not right for parents to inflict 
physical pain on children at young ages.   When they are 
determining their values and the basic morals of society it is 
not right for parents to inflict pain on children for 
disciplinary purposes and goes against the spirit of the Charter 
of Rights and Freedoms.  They are asking for a repeal of section 
43.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I do, since this is my first opportunity to rise in the

say what a great pleasure it is.  You are a fellow Edmontonian. 
We have contiguous ridings.  On behalf of my constituents in

in extracurricular activities.

</I></B></P><P align=left>For other parents, however, this is a difficult task. Divorce is 
a complex and emotional time in people's lives.  As parents, most 
will want to try to do what is best for the children, but they 
may be confused, hurt or angry.  They may be unable to agree 
about what arrangements are best for their children. They may vie 
for the loyalty of their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There can also be genuinely complex issues that need to be 
resolved.  In these contested cases is the family law system that 
governs custody and access determinations. I know that many 
criticisms have been raised about the current family law system. 
Courts that address family matters are the forums for deciding 
parenting disputes and there are many complaints about the high 
costs and delays associated with the legal process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also concerns that parents who cannot agree about 
parenting issues involving their children must often resort to an 
adversarial system that tends to promote the anger and hurt 
associated with separation and divorce.  Many believe that the 
very terminology of custody and access in family law legislation 
reflects a winner and loser approach that encourages the parties 
to compete with each other for the status of real or best parent. 
Too often the legal process contributes to the conflict between 
the parents and results in outcomes that do not resolve matters 
but in fact further promotes ongoing difficulties and pain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recent experience with child support reforms suggests that these 
issues to be dealt with by the committee will promote vigorous 
debate, dare I say at times probably contentious debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many different views about what problems should be 
emphasized and about what reforms are required. The difficult and 
controversial nature of the issue should not dissuade us from 
beginning the process of reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The many transitions and reorganizations that accompany family 
breakdown greatly affect the children involved.  While the long 
term effects of divorce should not be exaggerated by any of us, 
there is no doubt that divorce is a painful experience for 
children. There is a real need to look at custody and access 
issues and attempt to reform the family law system to minimize 
the negative impacts of divorce on children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion asks that the committee specifically look at the need 
for a more child centred approach to family law policies and 
practices.  I believe this is very important. The goal must be to 
identify the legal rules, principles and processes that will 
emphasize what is best for the children. This can be done if the 
committee is steadfast in focusing on children.  I believe there 
is an obligation to examine this issue through the lens of the 
needs and rights of children.  All concerned Canadians, ourselves 
included, must reject the temptation to cast this debate as one 
between the interests of mothers versus fathers.  If we are to 
move forward in dealing with the challenge of parenting after 
divorce, both individually and in our public policy, we must be 
vigilant in making the needs and rights of children our primary 
source of inspiration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To help in this task the committee can review the professional 
literature about the developmental needs of children and examine 
models being used in other jurisdictions that have attempted to 
alleviate the negative impact of divorce on children. The 
committee can also meet with and listen to the many individuals 
and groups that care about the quality of life for our children. 
I know there is a great deal of interest, concern and insight 
that Canadians will bring to these issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge all members of the House to support the motion.  It is 
time to find ways to help parents better resolve their 
differences and focus on what is in the best interests of their 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, because of prior engagements, I have to leave the 
House in a few minutes.  But I want everyone to know that I am 
going to follow and review with interest the speeches that follow 
in this debate because I do believe this is an opportunity for 
all of us, in the Senate and the House of Commons, all parties, 
to work together to do something that is not only right but very 
important to ensure a better quality of life for all our children 
and families as we approach the millennium.

<P><A NAME="LINK208"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster—Coquitlam—Burnaby, 
Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak to the motion to 
establish a joint committee of the House of Commons and the 
Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last February a rather historic and public discussion ensued 
across the country on Bill C-41, an act to amend the Divorce Act. 
By the time the bill got to the Senate, alarm bells began to be 
heard in the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The groundswell was enormous and powerful.  Public support for 
the Senate's actions to slow down and review Bill C-41 was 
profound and unprecedented.  Public concern for fairness in the 
divorce law was strongly expressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We only have the motion today because the government was forced 
into a situation in order to get Bill C-41 passed in the last 
Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government ignored the pleas of Canadians last time.  Now 
that we have a committee we hope to make it work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government, in rushing the bill to passage, rushed the 
committee's work.  In fact, public support for the position taken 
by the Senate surprised the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The dominant public wish and the one which most frequently and 
repeatedly was articulated was the wish that we in Parliament 
would return balance, fairness and equilibrium to the Divorce 
Act, to the practice of family law, to the courts and to the 
administration of justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I quote one letter written by Toronto lawyer Bruce Haines, 
Queen's counsel.  He wrote in part: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For over thirty years I have practised family law in Ontario and 
during that time I have watched the development of the law and 
the dramatically changed social conditions which have not only 
seen a very high percentage of married women move into the 
work force in most every area but have also seen a significant 
narrowing of the income differentials between men and women. 
During that same period I have watched spousal social 
expectations change in that husbands have embraced a full 
participation in all aspects of family functions, particularly in 
the nurturing and raising of their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Changes to the divorce law have rarely kept pace with changing 
attitudes and, despite the gender neutral language of the Divorce 
Act, its actual implementation in the areas of child custody and 
child support has continued to be marked by an entrenched 
systemic gender bias that “mother knows best and father pays 
best”. The administration of justice does not treat spouses 
equally when it comes to assigning child custody.  By and large, 
custody is almost always assigned to mothers and the most fathers 
can hope for is a generous access order.  Where fathers interfere 
with custody orders they will ordinarily bear the full weight of 
the law while mothers who flaunt access orders will, by and 
large, receive judicial admonitions with usually little other 
consequence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 16(10) of the Divorce Act requires courts to take into 
consideration the willingness of the person for whom custody is 
sought to facilitate contact of the child with each spouse. 
Practising family lawyers know that this section is almost never 
invoked. 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—you have an opportunity to correct at least some of the mischief 
inherent in this deeply flawed legislation. 
</UL></UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge—to reject Bill C-41 in its present form and to approach 
all of the issues on a remedial basis.  In considering custody 
and child support, there is a need to restore greater balance 
between the rights of mothers and fathers.  I have not ventured 
into other areas of family law where the similarly entrenched 
systemic gender biases seems to exist.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This was one of the many letters of the view that divorce 
legislation must be balanced and fair.  That was widely held 
across the country by most Canadians, men and women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Senators amended Bill C-41 and passed the amended bill on 
February 13, 1997.  The House of Commons concurred with the 
amendments the next day.  As part of the passage of Bill C-41, 
the government, in response to the concerns of senators and 
non-custodial parents, committed itself to studying the issues of 
custody and access.  The Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada said: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—this government will take the steps necessary to introduce a 
motion in this session to establish a joint Senate-House of 
Commons committee to study issues related to custody and access 
under the Divorce Act.  The government is offering this 
commitment in response to concerns raised by some senators on 
behalf of non-custodial parents, who believe that this issue 
should be re-examined. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Family issues are fundamental to our society.  In the last 
election our party made a commitment to make families a priority. 
We said among other things that we made a commitment to the 
country to make families a priority and ensure that government 
policies and regulations are family friendly.  We said that we 
would extend the $3,000 to $5,000 child care deduction to all 
parents including those who care for their children at home.  We 
would increase the spousal amount from $5,380 to $7,900, 
levelling the field for parents who chose to stay at home to look 
after young children and help families to meet the needs of a 
more demanding economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would help provinces and local governments ensure that 
deadbeat parents live up to their responsibility to support their 
children when families break down.  We would ensure that 
agreements concerning access to children are respected an 
enforced.  A zero tolerance policy would be enacted on family 
violence and we would crack down on child prostitution and child 
pornography. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also said that we would make families a priority.  I quote 
from our literature: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the federal government has been catering to special 
interest groups, the voice of Canadian families in the policy 
debate has grown weaker and weaker.  This has resulted in social 
and economic policies that undermine the security of Canadian 
families, causing unnecessary levels of stress, burnout, and 
financial hardship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Family time is not a luxury.  It is absolutely essential if we 
are to preserve health and happiness in our homes. It's time to 
make families a priority again. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For too long these issues of custody and access have been 
begging Parliamentary committee study.  Witnesses related to the 
numerous and extensive problems in the areas of custody and 
access and the problems facing non-custodial parents.  They also 
described many problems including parental alienation syndrome, 
commonly known as PAS, and false sexual abuse allegations in 
divorce and custody disputes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new payment guidelines of Bill C-41 sound good, but I have a 
letter from one parent who claims that the change has brought a 
loss to the children, a loss of relationship.  He says in part: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As you may have gathered I am one of the so called non-custodial 
parents.  I have paid my share of my children's expenses through 
child support payments for the past eleven years. Now the 
government has decided that I am really just a wallet for my 
kids—It seems to me that pressures have swung the pendulum 
all the way to the other side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am now having to pay so much to my ex and Revenue Canada that 
I will no longer be able to visit with my children or have them 
come to stay with me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that when the law was enacted too much consideration was 
given to the custodial parents—and not enough to the 
non-custodial parents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again I tell you that this law has now made it so that this will 
be the last summer that I will be spending with my children and I 
don't anticipate visiting as often as I live 600 kilometres away. 
I just cannot afford the luxury and that is what the new law has 
made it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope you understand what is happening and can do something 
about the law to make it fair. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parental alienation syndrome is an effort by one parent, the 
custodial parent, to eliminate access between the children of 
divorce and their non-custodial parent.  Elimination of access is 
often a significant indicator in an effort to alienate the 
non-custodial parent, eliminating access on a permanent basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dr. Richard Gardner coined the term parental alienation syndrome 
to describe the process whereby one parent initiates the 
systematic vilification of the other parent by manipulation of 
the child with the intent of alienating the child from the other 
parent. 
The manipulation of time becomes the prime weapon in the hands of 
the alienator.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parent alienation syndrome occurs when one parent is engaged in 
an attempt not merely to destroy the other parent and the other 
parent's relationship with the child but also to cause the child 
to join in the process.  The child enters the dynamic becoming a 
weapon, a spokesperson, a co-combatant in the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another problem is the use of false sexual abuse allegations in 
divorce and custody proceedings. The use of false allegations in 
divorce and custody proceedings has become epidemic in this 
country and it has been described as the weapon of choice in 
custodial disputes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of particular note is that these peculiar false allegations 
arise in the context of divorce and custody disputes. False 
allegations, as in the case Plesh v. Plesh, the trial judge, Mr. 
Justice Carr of the Manitoba Court of Queen's Bench in his 1992 
judgment stated about an applicant “I conclude she never 
believed that their son had been abused, not when she reported 
the abuse and not now”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are only some of the many problems in the operation and 
application of the law with respect to custody and access. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last Parliament, former member of Parliament Daphne 
Jennings championed a grandparents' right private member's bill 
to extend better legal standing for grandparents in court 
contested custody cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of access, the 1995 Supreme Court of Canada 
decision in Gordon v. Goertz was significant. The issues for 
adjudication were custody access and contact between the child 
and non-custodial parent. In her reasons for judgment Madam 
Justice Beverley McLachlin wrote “Important as contact with the 
non-custodial parent may be, it should be noted that not all 
experts agree on the weight to be given to such contact in 
assessing the best interests of children”. That statement and 
judgment caused a lot of anxiety and anguish to non-custodial 
parents across this land and caused many to ask Parliament to 
study the issues of custody and access. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Mr. Haines pointed out earlier in the letter that I quoted 
“Marriage and society in general have moved toward joint 
parenting and joint responsibility for children.  You may divorce 
your spouse, you don't divorce your kids”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So too in many jurisdictions has divorce law moved toward joint 
or shared parenting.  Some jurisdictions have even abandoned the 
antiquated term “custody” in favour of the modern term 
“parenting”.  As a former divorce mediator, I have special 
awareness of these kinds of problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in 1991 the justice minister, then professor of law, 
wrote a discussion paper for the Alberta Advisory Council on 
Women's Issues entitled “Women and the Process of Constitutional 
Reform”.  In this paper she argued that constitutional 
devolution of federal government powers to the provinces would 
give provincial governments control over the family, such as that 
certain proceedings in separation and divorce would fall under 
provincial jurisdiction by virtue of the provinces' power over 
property and civil rights.  Such devolution, she believes, would 
result in joint custody after a divorce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She apparently was not in support of it.  She stated “If 
through constitutional reform, divorce became a matter of 
exclusive provincial jurisdiction, provinces could legislate 
comprehensively in the area of the family.  Some provincial 
legislatures may choose to impose a presumption of joint custody 
and require mandatory mediation in the resolution of family 
disputes”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister also said “An increasing number of commentators 
now suggest that joint custody may simply perpetuate the 
influence and domination of men over the lives of women”. What 
an incredible statement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public's rejection of ideology in family law drove the 
public support for a second look at Bill C-41. Therefore I 
support the terms of the committee.  The terms have been read out 
by the Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In general the courts typically deal somewhat acceptably with 
money, but they deal very poorly and handle with great difficulty 
custody, access and guardianship.  The federal Divorce Act and 
similar provincial family court acts leave a messy jurisdictional 
problem within the area of family law. 
Therefore, the renewed parliamentary attention to outstanding 
issues on family law is welcome.  Reformers recognize the 
fundamental importance of family to society and Reformers agree 
that changes to family law need to be addressed to ensure the 
rules are more family friendly.

raised in Parliament in order to raise the profile of the family 
and family issues as it clearly is a priority topic in the 
community.  Consequently we will fully participate and will work

we also ensure we have balanced deliberations.

<P><A NAME="LINK209"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
this is a rather odd motion we have before us today.  When I first 
looked at it, I was not all that surprised at the government's 
approach, because as justice critic I have had to look at a number 
of bills and am becoming increasingly aware that the federal 
government is, under the guise of the preponderance it claims to 
have under the Constitution, under the guise of peace, order and 
good government, or under the guise of criminal law, encroaching 
more and more on areas under provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This week we had another striking example, Bill C-14 on 
drinking water.  Is there any area more provincial than water? 
No, yet the federal government is interfering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Things are getting more and more complicated with the 
government over there.  A while ago, we found it somewhat amusing 
to watch the matter of which jurisdiction the St. Lawrence River 
came under.  You will see that there is a parallel in this.  What 
they said was “The bottom of the St. Lawrence is federal.  The 
water is provincial.  The fish swimming in the St. Lawrence are 
provincial.  As soon as they are caught, taken out of the water, 
and put into the boat, they are provincial fish in a federally 
registered boat, constructed under provincial regulations, and 
governed by federal safety regulations”.  So there you are, what a 
fine great country Canada is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, we address a subject similar to this motion.  When a 
couple separates in Canada—this is referred to directly in the 
motion—this is provincial legislation.  But when they divorce, 
this is federal legislation. 
And if that were not sufficiently complex, the federal government 
has decided in its wisdom as a centralizer, of course, to table a 
motion and mandate some of the dear senators.  I hope they will 
find enough of them awake to fill the positions.  There will be 7 
senators and 16 MPs with the two co-chairs, making up a nice little 
committee to examine child custody, visiting rights, parenting and 
so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion is worded so broadly that it encompasses large 
areas directly under provincial jurisdiction.  I will give you a 
few examples of this.  In Quebec, the mechanisms for implementing 
custody and visiting rights when there is a separation come under 
the Civil Code.  The federal government has nothing to do with it. 
Parenting of children comes under parental authority, a 
jurisdiction of the Quebec National Assembly.   The federal 
government has nothing to do with this. 
As regards the school system, which is under provincial 
jurisdiction, the federal government has no business intervening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there is the federal government's unwarranted intrusion 
in the lives of individuals.  The motion talks about “practices 
that would emphasize joint parental responsibilities and child-focused 
parenting arrangements based on children's needs and best 
interests”.  What is the federal government doing in this area? 
Tell me.  It is provocation, pure and simple.  It has no business 
in this area of jurisdiction.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wondered how the people opposite, who are supposed to be 
intelligent, can be guilty of such provocation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> They are supposed to be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B> Yes, they are supposed to be, as one 
of my colleagues said. But, perhaps we should look at the 
background to this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to go back to the 35th 
Parliament, where little deals were made here in the House, not 
with the duly elected members sitting here, but with the two or 
three senators who were not sleeping in the other place.  Deals 
were made with the federal government and they were told “Let Bill 
C-41 on child support pass, and we will find you a little something 
to do. 
We will arrange it so you can look at the issues of custody and 
access after divorce”.  That was the deal made at the time to get 
C-41 through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is this motion about?  It concerns both divorce and 
separation.  It is much broader.  However, the many members 
opposite who support the minister's motion should open their ears 
to what a member of the Bloc Quebecois has to say on the matter 
rather than watching what is happening above.  Our comments are 
important, and perhaps if they paid a little more attention to 
Quebec's historical demands, we would not be here discussing the 
distribution of powers or anything else.  The problem between 
Canada and Quebec would have been settled 35 years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That having been said, I understand that the topic, which has 
to do with child custody from a financial or parenting point of 
view after separation, is a serious one.  We are not saying that it 
is not serious or important.  On the contrary, it is very much so, 
but it is up to the provinces, not the federal government, to 
legislate in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as Quebec is concerned, I am well placed to address 
this issue, first because I am an MP from Quebec, and second 
because I am a lawyer.  I argued matrimonial cases before I was 
elected to office.  Since that time, things have even improved in 
Quebec with the recent reforms introduced by the PQ government, 
some of which took effect on May 1, 1997, and others of which took 
effect recently on September 1, 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in Quebec have a model for setting support payments that 
reflects the importance Quebec places on its children.  This model 
takes into account the income of both parents and the length of 
custody. 
In addition, a form and a guide for determining amounts are made 
available to parents, mediators, counsel and judges.  The model is 
so good that the federal government has agreed to apply it in cases 
of divorce, while we naturally applied it in cases of separation, 
since separation comes under provincial jurisdiction.  And all this 
has been in effect since May 1, 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are talking about family mediation as though it were the 
discovery of the century.  Family mediation was already around in 
Quebec when I was practising law, between 1986 and 1995, but since 
September 1, we have improved our approach, making it much more 
structured. 
This family mediation, which we have Minister Serge Ménard to thank 
for, is free for the first six sessions and may be conducted by 
lawyers, notaries, guidance counsellors, psychologists, social 
workers and so on.  In 1996, there were 459 mediators in Quebec; 
today there are 735.  There is therefore a market, and this service 
is used in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation provides for a process of registering 
decisions with a special clerk in order to speed matters up, 
because there is also an important issue at stake:  there is no 
stalling around when it comes to children's rights, parents' 
visiting rights, salary, family income; decisions must be taken 
quickly. 
A follow-up committee will submit a report on the process to the 
Minister of Justice, in the fall of 1998. Serious work is being done; 
measures are being applied and a follow-up will take place.

children's rights, the right to attend school, alimony, etc., Quebec has 
already adopted major legislation on all these issues. Today, if the 
federal government really wanted to show its good will in this regard, 
it could withdraw without any problem from family law and even divorce 
matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It could immediately decide to get out of these areas. A whole 
section of the Quebec civil code has been passed but is not being 
applied, because it is beyond our jurisdiction. The National Assembly 
could immediately and without any problems start dealing with divorces, 
which would improve harmonization and better reflect what really goes on 
in Quebec, with a very comprehensive civil code. Our code deals with the 
appropriate issues and truly meets the needs of Quebec families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can dream, but we know the federal government will not do it. In 
the last 30 years, it has been increasingly interfering in areas under 
provincial jurisdiction, including those of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion shows that, when it comes to parenting, the federal 
government does not hesitate to get involved in this area, which comes 
under provincial jurisdiction. 
As I said earlier about the federal government interfering in people's 
lives, I think that too is not its jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All this to say that my initial reaction to this motion was to say 
“We in the Bloc Quebecois must not take any part in this charade. We in 
the Bloc Quebecois must not be a party to this centralizing approach, an 
approach that does not in any way reflect Quebec's demands”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, after talking the matter over with the hon. member for 
Longueuil in particular—she is very sensitive to the needs of 
women's groups in Quebec and has met with many groups involved in 
this matter—I realized that these groups also agree that the 
federal government is stepping in areas that are none of its 
concern. They nevertheless wanted us to be involved. They wanted 
us to be there to voice our opposition to this extremely 
centralizing bill. And that is what we shall do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Longueuil, whose professionalism is well known, 
will take part in this committee to represent Quebec's point of view. 
She will also make the point that, in Quebec, we are at the forefront in 
several areas, and family issues in particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If at all possible, because I am a perpetual optimist, we in the 
Bloc Quebecois will try to bring the government and those senators who 
are not asleep round to our opinion. We will try to convince them that 
they should not interfere in this area but rather give it over to each 
province's legislative assembly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But if we are unable to change their minds on a matter as important 
as this one, I am confident that the hon. member for Longueuil will let 
our caucus know and, if the government does not yield to the Bloc's 
arguments, in her wisdom, she will table a minority report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That having been said, you will understand that, yes, we will take 
part in the work of this committee if it is struck. We will pay close 
attention and very strongly insist that Quebec's demands in this area of 
jurisdiction be met. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been hearing all sorts of comments coming from the other 
side since I rose to take part in this debate. 
There is one thing I would like to say: if it is true that the members 
opposite are so committed to the interests of children, why then have 
they not yet endorsed the Quebec-France agreement on child support? This 
agreement directly concerns the children of Quebec, and yet the 
government opposite is wrangling over procedures, scrutinizing every 
comma and preventing thousands of Quebec families from receiving child 
support from overseas.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government is truly committed to the interests of children, 
it should endorse the agreement that has been signed between Quebec and 
France, and maybe then we will be able to believe them when they say 
they are committed to families, to sound management in this area of 
responsibility that does not belong to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will be showing openness by attending the hearings to be held by 
this committee, although we find it useless and a waste of time, and I 
hope that the government opposite will at least be smart enough to 
listen to our demands and to take them into account in any future 
legislation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK210"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Drouin (Beauce, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was listening to 
my colleague opposite speaking about his experiences and his background 
in the legal profession. I was once a policy advisor at the provincial 
level and I can tell you that I have seen more than one woman having 
difficulties with provincial laws. I don't think there is much to be 
proud of in this respect. Either he is out of touch, or he was being 
selective in his choice of cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He often makes reference to the senators. I can introduce him to 
some of them and he will realize that they are people with a lot of 
experience and knowledge and that, even if a few were caught with their 
eyes closed, that does not mean they are all sleeping. It is important 
that he realize this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question for the hon. member. If a couple separates and 
one of the partners moves to another province, would national standards 
not make it easier to settle matters? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was my comment and my question. 
<P><A NAME="LINK211"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I would ever so politely say to the hon. member that he ought to 
have remained a political adviser, because as a politician, at 
least as an MP representing a Quebec riding—unless I am mistaken—he 
ought to know that the remarks he has made are totally 
inaccurate, totally coloured by very negative stereotypes on 
Quebeckers, who have passed family legislation that is superior to 
what there is in many other provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many MPs who speak in this House but are rarely seen 
in committee.  I invite the hon. member to the justice committee, 
among others, where subjects like this will be discussed.  I hope 
that the hon. member will, at the very least, be appointed to the 
joint committee which will examine this matter and which will hear 
qualified witnesses in this area, from Quebec and elsewhere. 
Very often, people from outside Quebec are the ones who quote 
Quebec legislation.  I often heard, during the 35th Parliament, 
people from Vancouver, from Alberta, from the maritimes, quoting 
legislation, citing Quebec's various social measures as examples. 
I think that the hon. member across the way is completely unaware 
of this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For that reason, I repeat that he might have been better off 
remaining a politicial adviser.  I can understand that perhaps 
giving opinions like that to the MP he worked for before may be 
what put an end to his career as a political adviser. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the rest, I do not understand the hon. member's 
question on how divorces in Ontario, in Quebec, in some other 
province, can be handled if it is not the same law that applies. 
What happens with separations?  The same law does not apply, it 
depends on whether it is in Quebec, Ontario, British Columbia or 
the maritimes. 
But do some people end up worse off as a result?  No. Because the 
provinces have passed legislation which reflects what they are.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We in Quebec do things differently than they can in Ontario, 
for example, or in western Canada.  The men of the 1990s in Quebec 
are not the same as those of the 1970s.  Nor are the women involved 
in cases of divorce and separation in the 1990s the same as the 
women of the 1970s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our experience in Quebec is not necessarily the same as that 
of Ontario or western Canada.  This is why it is absolutely 
essential that the government opposite understand that it must not 
interfere in the family law sector, that it must back off and leave 
the provinces to deal with parenting, support payments, separation 
and divorce. 
It must understand that, for the well-being of the public and in 
the best interests of Quebec families, among others—I will argue 
for my parish and for Quebec—it must cease to meddle in matters 
that do not concern it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney—Victoria, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is with pleasure that I rise to speak to the issue before the 
House today.  It is one that I have some particular interest in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members indicated in their earlier comments the experience 
they have had.  My own experience in this area goes back as a 
legal aid lawyer for some 12 years, dealing with people in 
society who do not perhaps have the financial ability in many 
cases to afford social workers or counsellors and who find 
themselves locked into litigation of the courts and litigating 
over the custody of and access to their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is no argument that family law lawyers who deal with these 
problems deal with one of the most difficult and fractious areas 
of law in the country.  It is no argument that social workers who 
deal in this area of the law find themselves confronted on a 
daily basis with very difficult decisions.  It is no exaggeration 
to say law enforcement agencies that are forced in some cases to 
enforce court orders dealing with custody and access find 
themselves in very difficult situations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know because I have seen the children put in police cars when 
one parent demands to exercise access.  I have also seen children 
tortured and torn between two parents saying on one hand “I want 
to be with this parent” to please the custodial parent and on 
the other hand “I want to be with this parent” to please the 
access parent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear in the area of divorce and family law that we are 
not dealing in a very sensible and certainly not in a very 
effective way with the needs of the children who find themselves 
caught in that arrangement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of the day there has to be a better way to deal with 
family breakup.  I am pleased to support the structuring of this 
committee.  I welcome its views.  It can perform a very real 
service for all the people I have mentioned who work in family 
law services and in the family courts by helping us come to grips 
with what should not be an adversarial process but a conciliation 
process dealing with children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I was a member of Parliament, as a lawyer and a private 
citizen I submitted a report to the then minister of justice in 
the last parliament which sought to reform the Divorce Act.  I 
dealt with the very issues this committee will be examining, 
whether or not there ought to be a presumption of joint custody, 
whether or not there ought to be other presumptions in terms of 
determining which parent has custody. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at the Divorce Act as it currently stands, 
unfortunately in many ways it encourages litigation and takes us 
away from a reconciliation process or a mediation process. 
The framers of the act did not intend this but once we take the 
family and put it before the courts in a litigious manner, in an 
adversarial manner, then right off the bat we find ourselves 
acting in ways that might be in the best interests of clients or 
might be in the spirit of the legislation, but are not in the 
spirit of the family.

<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just as an example, section 16 of the Divorce Act allows for an 
interim order for custody.  As every family lawyer knows, the 
courts have developed over the years many tests to determine 
which parent ought to be the custodial parent. I can go back to 
the parents patria jurisdiction of the court, the tender years 
doctrine, which was used by the courts for many years to 
determine in most cases that the mother ought to be the custodial 
parent of children who were of tender years. The courts then 
revised that and dealt with the status quo doctrine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course the overriding principle is always the best interests 
of the child but it is the difficulty in determining that which 
the courts have to grapple with.  It is with that difficulty that 
these tests have been developed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the predominant tests is of course the status quo 
doctrine, which is that the parent who has custody of the 
children and provides a good environment for them immediately 
after the separation ought to be the parent who has custody.  It 
is not good for the children to have constant upheaval. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As sensible as that test may be, when we put it into the 
litigation context, it encourages family law lawyers to make an 
application for interim custody right off the bat.  They know 
that in many cases the first one at the bar takes all. If the 
lawyer is successful on the interim application, with the courts 
being overburdened as they are, the actual litigation of the 
divorce process and the custody hearing may take four, five, six 
or eight months, which automatically gives one parent the 
advantage.  However the child does not necessarily have the 
advantage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at it in that adversarial context, that is the kind 
of thing which the act encourages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For families that have sufficient means, and the justice 
minister alluded to some families who are able in many situations 
to work out their own custody and access arrangements, many 
parents can.  Many poor parents can because they put the needs of 
the children first and allow themselves to work within that 
framework.  However there may be more success among wealthier 
people because of course they can avail themselves of mediation 
services which in many provinces are currently privately run and 
run for profit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously there is a need to take this out of the litigation 
process and move it into a more conciliatory process. As I have 
indicated, that is one section of the Divorce Act which 
encourages litigation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While there is a presumption of joint custody or access, the act 
itself looks at other factors.  It says that the court ought not 
to look at the past conduct of a parent in determining which 
parent ought to have custody or access.  Yet we know that many 
judges in the litigation process are influenced by many things. 
While the court says we ought not to look at past conduct unless 
it is in relation to the children, if we are in a win or lose 
situation, it is not unusual for litigation lawyers in a family 
law practice to bring up events from the past which have no 
impact on raising the children but which may appeal to a 
particular judge's sense of what is morally correct and what is 
not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The act itself in its current form may encourage litigation 
which is not always in the best interests of the child and 
certainly does not go the distance in helping to determine a 
better mode of dealing with the children who are the subject of 
divorce proceedings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tests that I have indicated filter down into provincial 
legislation.  My hon. colleague in the Bloc talked about the 
jurisdictional problems.  Those jurisdictional problems are 
there.  There is no question that upon separation, the family 
finds itself in family court.  Upon divorce, they find themselves 
in the federal or supreme courts.  Therefore what has been 
determined by a lower court is not necessarily binding in the 
federal court.

<A HREF="#LINKT28"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is extremely difficult.  Those of us who have practised 
family law will know the absolute incredulity of our clients when 
we tell them “I know we have litigated all of this in family 
court. Now you are proceeding to divorce and yes you have a 
custody order but it is not binding and it reopens the door”. So 
the jurisdictional problem is one I think this committee could 
look at in a very real way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be remiss if I did not say, coming from a legal aid 
background, that unless we look at resources in the legal aid 
system which deals with the vast majority of family law cases in 
this country, unless we look at ensuring there is a solid legal 
aid system in place in each of the provinces, all of the rhetoric 
about the best interests of the children and all of the 
conclusions this committee can come to will be nothing more than 
a report placed on a shelf to be dusted off occasionally.  Unless 
we are committed to putting in place mediation services, legal 
aid services, family court services, then it may well be a waste 
of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I respect the comments made by the hon. member, my colleague 
from the Reform Party, when he talked about the presumption of 
joint custody.  I think most parents would agree on that until 
such time as there is a breakup.  At that time families need 
someone to discuss with them the interests of their children 
separate and apart from maintenance payments and support payments 
in a way that they can understand the joint obligations as well 
as the joint rights that parents have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been some indication that this committee will look at 
all of those questions.  It may well lead to guidelines in the 
Divorce Act that can then be applied to provincial acts.  I look 
forward to hearing and examining the situation in Quebec that has 
been referred to by my hon. colleague.  I would support the 
committee and the creation of the committee.  It can only benefit 
the children and the families of this country as they struggle in 
what is obviously a difficult situation.

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>September 2, 1997 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Montreal this morning, Quebec's Minister of Justice 
and Attorney General, Serge Ménard, unveiled the new family 
mediation program.  As of yesterday, there is a new way to 
approach separation or divorce in Quebec and it is free.  Bill 
65, an act adding family premediation to the Code of Civil 
Procedure and amending other provisions in this Code, which 
was passed by the National Assembly on June 13, came into 
effect on September 1.  For the first time in Quebec, it will 
now be possible for couples with children to reach agreement 
on custody, visiting rights, outings, support payments and 
even the division of property, at no cost.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is pretty clear, as press releases go.  I also think it 
is pretty clear as to the approach taken by the National Assembly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question for the member who has just spoken is this:  Does 
he think that the other provinces should follow Quebec's example in 
the treatment of families when they separate, and under the new 
bill, when they divorce as well, with respect to mediation? Does he 
not think the federal government should withdraw entirely from the 
family law sector and leave this completely up to the provinces? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to answer the 
hon. member's question in French, but my French is not good enough. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So I am forced to answer in English.  I certainly would concur 
with my colleague that the model he cites which is being used in 
the province of Quebec is the kind of thing that I certainly 
would be advocating for the province of Nova Scotia.  In fact I 
should advise him that the legal aid system under which I worked 
took some of our own tight budget and directed it toward a pilot 
mediation program to attempt to indicate to the provincial 
government the need for this kind of program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately the program is not in place in the way that we 
would like in the province.  I would see an opportunity at the 
federal level.  If this kind of program could be enacted as 
divorce mediation at the federal level, the different provinces 
might then see the benefit in this kind of a program and follow 
the federal lead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I certainly commend the province of Quebec in taking this type 
of action but I would not at this point indicate that the federal 
government ought to withdraw completely.  I think it has a role 
to play, as a leader, in those provinces that might not be as 
forward thinking as the province of my hon. colleague. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member does 
agree with my point about Quebec's being at the forefront in this 
area.  However, he concluded by saying that the federal government 
ought not to withdraw completely, because it has a role to play, as 
leader. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know exactly what he means by “role to play, 
as leader” in the area of child custody, alimony, education in 
terms of level of studies and access.  I would like him to tell me 
not in terms of the Constitution we want, but in terms of the 
Constitution of 1982. There is something we must not forget.  There 
is a Constitution where Quebec's hand was forced.  Perhaps not the 
hand.  I should say it was jammed down our throat, because we did 
not sign it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini:</B>  Mr. Speaker, perhaps my English is not 
as good as it could have been in delivering the previous answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the role I see for the federal government.  I will use 
as an example my own province.  Obviously the parties have the 
option of separating and dealing with provincial jurisdiction 
later on, or immediately the option of divorce and dealing with 
federal jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In provinces that do not have the types of mediation services or 
programs alluded to by my colleague from Quebec, and if the 
committee was to determine that there ought to be federal funding 
in place for mediation at the divorce level which is a federal 
jurisdiction, then certain individuals in a province where there 
may not be provincial mediation available could avail themselves 
immediately of the Divorce Act as opposed to the provincial 
statutes under which they might otherwise operate. They could 
avail themselves of what might be available and provided at the 
federal level in the supreme courts of the provinces with federal 
funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That would be the leadership role I would see in child custody 
and access cases.

we are having this afternoon is a very interesting one.

be there to protect his province in the event that there is not 
enough money available to set up family mediation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He says that there might be financial assistance to set up 
mediation.  Should the federal government once again decide to 
stick its big nose into this, we in Quebec already have a mediation 
service, one that costs several million dollars a year. 
Would he be in favour of a bill that would have the federal 
government compensate Quebec 100% for its mediation service?

to start by congratulating the government on presenting this motion 
to set up a joint committee to examine custody and access in 
response to the concerns expressed by certain senators on behalf of 
non-custodial parents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government must provide direction on this issue, as it did 
earlier this year on Bill C-41, an act to amend the Divorce Act, 
with respect to child support payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the course of the debate on Bill C-41, many parents 
requested on behalf of non-custodial parents, whose access rights 
are guaranteed by order, that similar legislation be passed 
regarding support orders.  They wanted legislation that would 
provide for more effective and less costly ways to enforce access 
orders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The points raised by witnesses at the hearings on Bill C-41 
included questions on the effectiveness of existing mechanisms to 
enforce access rights, the rights of second and third families, the 
opportunity for mandatory mediation in the case of divorce, the 
rights of grandparents or third parties to apply for custody or 
access, parents' freedom of movement after the divorce, the right 
to information and other non-custodial parent rights and the 
effects of divorce on a child's mental health and development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must look at the language of divorce in terms of the 
divorced parents and the children, as Senator Jessiman pointed out 
during the debate on this motion. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The language of divorce, the terms used, such as “custody” and 
“access”, come from criminal law and property law and are not 
appropriate to designate the relationship between parents. 
</UL>
<A joint committee should be struck to look at how things are 
done elsewhere, in Quebec or the United States, for example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parental approach to custody and access has been taken in 
a number of states, where joint custody is considered the best 
solution for divorcing couples, and sole custody is accorded only 
if it is in the child's best interest.  Some people are opposed to 
joint custody.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1991, when she was teaching law at the University of 
Alberta, the Minister of Justice wrote a working paper for the 
Alberta Advisory Council on Women's Issues entitled “Women and the 
Process of Constitutional Reform”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If, through constitutional reform, divorce were to become an 
exclusively provincial jurisdiction, the provinces could pass 
comprehensive family law.  Some people would opt for the 
presumption of shared custody and make mediation obligatory in the 
resolution of family disputes.  Increasingly, commentators feel 
that sole custody serves only to perpetuate the influence and 
domination of men over the lives of women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know that education and mediation are the best solution 
in any dispute, and some witnesses have spoken about education with 
respect to divorce, an approach that has been taken in a number of 
Canadian and American cities. Parents seeking divorce take courses 
about the impact on their children of certain behaviours or 
attitudes they might adopt—such as involving their children in 
their dispute—and which are the most likely to have harmful 
psychological effects on the children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the witnesses before the Senate Standing Committee on 
Social Affairs, Science and Technology, Paul Carrier, a family 
counsellor with the Royal Ottawa Hospital, said:  “Disputes over 
custody and access affect children's self-esteem—In the 
interest of children, it is preferable for parents to maintain a 
harmonious relationship.  Money is important, but the quality of 
the relationship is even more important.  Many people have grown up 
in poor environments but are still happy. 
Money is important, but it is not the only thing.  The quality of 
the relationship is still more important”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In connection with Bill C-41, he said: “The bill does not 
address the question of access properly.  Its approach is not in 
the children's best interests.  It could, and should, attach more 
importance to parent-child relationships.  If the division of 
resources does not foster more prolonged contacts between parents 
and children, the legislator will be neglecting one of children's 
basic needs”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Article 9 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child 
states as follows: “A child shall not be separated from his or her 
parents against their will, except when this is in the best 
interests of the child. A child who is separated from one or both 
parents has the right to maintain personal relations and direct 
contact with both parents on a regular basis”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Article 18 states that “both parents have common 
responsibilities for the upbringing and development of the child. 
States shall render appropriate assistance to parents in the 
performance of their child-rearing responsibilities”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have raised some of the questions I wish to see the joint 
committee examine.  This is an important study and one which, I am 
sure, will generate measures that will make it possible to create 
a custody and access system to protect the rights of the child as 
defined in the UN Convention and will also enable children to 
continue to benefit from the presence of both parents.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to ask the hon. member whether she finds it acceptable for the 
federal government to be striking a special committee to examine 
questions of agreements on custody, visiting rights and parenting 
after parental separation or divorce, when separation is known to 
be a provincial jurisdiction and the federal government has no 
right to meddle in this area of provincial jurisdiction? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Diane St-Jacques:</B> Mr. Speaker, the member was saying that 
separation is a provincial matter, but divorce is federal.  I think 
that the committee will be set up in the best interests of the 
children.  It should be set up. 
<P><A NAME="LINK218"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I did not quite understand the hon. member's approach. She cited 
the rights of children and they indeed have the right to visit 
their parents and to have a relationship with them.  I support that 
100%.  Even the UN supports these rights.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the hon. member saying that a province such as Quebec could 
not legislate the rights its children are entitled to?  Is she, in 
her centralist and federalist way, saying that provinces like 
Quebec cannot provide for children the rights they are entitled to? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Diane St-Jacques:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am not saying that Quebec 
is not able to provide the same rights to children.  What I am 
saying is that these issues could perhaps be raised before the 
committee.  I think today's debate concerns the establishment of a 
joint committee to try to find ways to improve the situation for 
children.  That is what I am saying, and we can raise these issues 
before the committee and perhaps they can be decided there.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
enjoyed listening to the speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The questions I have are on the creation of this committee and 
the recommendation that we go ahead with this committee so that 
we ensure that if this type of parenting proposal becomes 
legislation that it recognizes that fathers as well as mothers 
have every right to nurture and provide for the children.  In 
many cases, we have found in the past that there seemed to be a 
preponderance of decisions that favour giving the children to the 
mother when that need not necessarily be the most appropriate 
decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder what the member's thoughts are on these types of 
issues.  As we recognize, the need for equality and for the lack 
of discrimination in this country are extremely important, but it 
shows up in more than one place.  Here is an example where it has 
shown up and it has been quite detrimental for many fathers who 
have made representations to me in my constituency office.  They 
felt that they have been denied access to their children and are 
looked on as a means of providing cash.  It is one of the serious 
injustices that we have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to get the comments of the member as to how she 
feels about ensuring that the legislation, if it does become 
legislation, demonstrates a commitment to equality. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Diane St-Jacques:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think in my speech—I 
am not sure the member was here earlier—I mentioned that we 
preferred the option of joint custody, with both parents having 
access. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should one of the parents be unable to care for the child, 
then things would be different.  But our preference goes to joint 
custody.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
in my riding I have a constituent who is a Canadian citizen.  His 
wife is an American citizen and a Jordanian citizen.  They had a 
two-year-old daughter.  Unfortunately they are divorced.  When my 
constituent was divorced he received custody of the child. 
Thereafter the mother abducted their two-year-old child and took 
her to Jordan. This situation happened seven or eight months ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The father who had legal custody could not have access to the 
child.  He went to Jordan to fight with the government and the 
legal system there so that he could bring the child back to 
Canada because his daughter is a Canadian citizen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legal system had him going up and down and back and forth. 
After many months he could not get the child and bring her back 
to Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the hon. member what she feels about this 
kind of situation when the children are abducted and they are 
carried out of the country. They are not in a position to come 
back to Canada and the Canadian government has been unable to 
follow it up.  What would be the hon. member's reaction and what 
would she feel this motion might do to follow up on these kinds 
of situations?

sought.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
either the member misunderstood the question by the Bloc Quebecois 
member for Drummond or I misunderstood her answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I shall be brief. One thing is clear: the whole area of separation 
is under provincial jurisdiction. Members on both sides will agree that 
separation is under provincial jurisdiction. Divorce, however, under the 
Canadian Constitution, is a federal jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the hon. member in favour of having a joint committee 
consider the issues of custody, visitation rights and parenting 
following separation or divorce? Had the government across the 
way stuck to the deal it made with the other place last year to 
consider the issue of what happens after a divorce, I would 
understand, but can the hon. member, who is a member from Quebec, 
accept that, under the guise of a nice little joint committee and 
the pretence of protecting the rights of children, they jump in, 
with both feet, and interfere with the rights of Quebec—because 
I am a member from Quebec—and discuss separation and divorce 
as a single issue, mixing everything up as they do on a regular 
basis? Can she tolerate that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was my question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Diane St-Jacques:</B> Mr. Speaker, my answer is that, if he 
attends the joint committee, the hon. member will have the opportunity 
to raise his question there and we can discuss it in then and there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The specific purpose of this motion is to set up a joint committee 
and, personally, I am in favour. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK223"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have a few 
short comments to make on this topic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it passing strange that included in the motion is a 
clause saying that the joint committee made up of senators and 
members of the House of Commons be given the authority to incur 
travel costs. There is a cute little phrase in it saying “inside 
and outside the country”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not sure whether they will find it necessary to meet over 
in some foreign countries.  Perhaps in the middle of winter it 
would be nice to go south and have a government paid trip.  Maybe 
this is what is contemplated.  I sincerely hope not.  I find it 
strange that the government should include in the motion the 
phrase that they should be able to travel outside the country as 
well.  Surely what we should be looking at is the experience, the 
needs and the aspirations of Canadian parents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have many children who are the products of relationships 
where the parents are not married to each other.  I am not sure 
the motion will direct the committee to look at the implications 
of that.  Many of those couples stay together for a while.  They 
produce one, two or more children, fall into disagreement and 
walk away from each other.  Those children are just as much at 
risk as those who suffer the experience of a divorce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know if all members have had experience with couples 
who have gone through this, but my wife and I have.  It is heart 
wrenching to see the children being jerked around. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My last comment in this extremely short intervention, which I 
know is unusual for me, is that I think we need to pay attention 
to equality.  We have heard many times today the expression—and 
I know it is often true—that women are automatically assumed to 
be the best parent and the fathers are cut out.  Now there is a 
cry to bring equalization into it so that fathers also have 
access to their children and the children to their fathers.  That 
is a noble goal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My concern is that when it comes to judging these matters it is 
a false assumption that the courts always evaluate it correctly. 
Sometimes we land up with built-in prejudices and biases. 
I am afraid that perhaps the bias could go the other way so that 
in these cases family court judges would have a predilection to 
choosing fathers instead of mothers for equal or greater 
advantage.  That may not necessarily be the case.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I simply urge that in all studies like this one we truly urge 
objectivity and a true evaluation.  That would include much more 
than just highly paid, court appointed counsellors and 
psychologists, very frankly some of whom I am not convinced are 
really competent in their job.  Once again the children are the 
ones who suffer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the few comments I wanted to make in the moments 
available to me.

<P><A NAME="LINK224"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
am pleased to ask a question to the Reform Party member, with whom I sat 
on several occasions, during the 35th Parliament, on the Committee on 
Justice and Legal Affairs. Unfortunately, we had rather different views 
on many matters. But that was part of the debate, and each one presented 
his arguments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the motion we have before us, I have a question similar to 
the one I asked to other members in this House, but I would like to know 
his opinion as a Reform member. 
Does he believe that in the interest of greater harmony, of better 
enforcement of family law, this whole issue of rights relating to 
custody, support, visits, and other rights concerning separation or 
divorce, would be better dealt with if it were the province that had 
complete jurisdiction in this area? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Madam Speaker, I never was on the justice 
committee.  I think the member is recalling days when he 
substituted on public works and government services.  Perhaps it 
was the ethics committee that we worked on, the Bill C-43 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Be that as it may, in answer to his question, where should 
jurisdiction lie?  Is it provincial or is it federal?  It is one 
of those areas where there is a crossover, as I understand it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In general principle the closer to the people we have the 
jurisdiction, the better democracy is served.  Sometimes it is 
very difficult to get politicians in distant Ottawa to hear the 
concerns of the people, whereas those who are in our provincial 
legislatures simply because they are closer geographically will 
sometimes be able to get the message a little better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I give guarded support to saying let us have the legislation as 
close to the people as possible, in general principle in the 
provinces.  Where a federal law currently has jurisdiction it is 
under the terms of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the committee should look at how to devolve the issue to 
provincial courts, provincial child care agencies and so on, the 
people who deal with these issues, so that we get the absolute 
best expression of concern for the children and their welfare. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B> Madam Speaker, I wish take the opportunity 
to set a matter straight for the member. We sat together on the ethics 
code committee. We did not succeed in agreeing there more than on the 
justice committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He made a particular comment that I agree with 100%. He said that 
very often we should ask ourselves which jurisdiction could more 
properly deal with the matter. He said that we should always give the 
responsibility to those who are closest to the people. I do not think 
there is a matter more appropriate than this one, on that score. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Which jurisdiction, the province or the federal government, can 
more properly apply the law on divorce or separation? I believe that the 
answer is obvious, it is the provinces. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1655"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT35"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is already a lot of social legislation to assist families. I 
think this is like a puzzle and there is a piece of this puzzle that is 
missing and without which Quebec and the other provinces cannot have 
full jurisdiction, and that piece is divorce legislation, which would 
complete the whole area of family law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But my question is the following: Is the Reform member familiar 
with the Quebec example in the area of family law, including separation? 
Also, is the Reform Party member familiar with how we have decided to 
proceed in Quebec since September 1, 1997 in the area of family 
mediation, which is offered to everyone free of charge, which 
accelerates the process for separation and divorce, and which deals with 
the issues of custody, child support, joint accounts, assets and other 
things? Is the member familiar with the Quebec example and does he 
recognize that it goes well beyond what the federal government can 
provide by asking a committee to review this issue? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Madam Speaker, I must concede that I am not 
aware of the full details of the Quebec bills.  I have heard of 
them and he has alluded to them in the debate today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the very valuable things that happens in the House is 
that we get to know more about each other.  We understand each 
other better and we see where we are all coming from.  I 
certainly agree with the member that if there is a good system in 
place in that province it should be allowed to work.  There is 
absolutely nothing wrong with that idea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, when we are talking about the welfare of children it is 
very important for children to be in a home in which there is a 
stable relationship between their parents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is distressing to me when I look at the demographics across 
the country that there is a variation among people who enter into 
long term, permanent, legal relationships with each other in 
order to make a family and have children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I simply respond to the member by saying that the issue in 
Quebec is no less than it is in any of the other provinces with 
respect to the care of children.  We need to make them our focus. 
There is a great need there.  Many of our children are growing up 
in homes where the parents are not permanently committed to each 
other.  In those situations statistics show that children are at 
greater risk in terms of their own personal well-being and 
welfare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Personally I think we ought to emphasize more the stabilization 
of families.  One book I read recently indicated that one of the 
greatest stresses in a marriage relationship is financial.  More 
husbands and wives argue about money than just about anything 
else.  In this country we are nigh taxed to death.  The 
government with its high taxation rates is adding to the stresses 
of families and thereby contributing to family break-up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we could only get that part solved and leave more money in 
the hands of families so they could provide for each other and 
their children, we would have less stress and a smaller problem 
in terms of looking after children from broken homes and from 
broken relationships where there was no marriage.  We should be 
placing the greatest emphasis on the welfare of those dear 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a grandparent now.  When I had my own children they were 
very special to us.  Now we have grandchildren.  They just touch 
my heart.  When I see how important they are, how I wish that 
every family would look at their children with respect, deep love 
and caring so that we could keep our families together and keep 
the children in a nice, stable home where they have the best 
advantages and the greatest security that are important to them.

</I></B></P><P align=left>You will understand that this motion is of great concern to us 
in the Bloc Quebecois.  The subject of children strikes a chord. 
We believe—not only do we believe, but it is a legislative fact—that 
the education of children is a matter of provincial 
jurisdiction. 
Separation is a provincial matter as well.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Going further, to divorce, which is federal, application of 
custody rights come under the Civil Code of Quebec.  Allow me to 
point this out very loudly and very indignantly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the federal government decides to strike a committee to 
examine a question, I have never seen it—in my short experience at 
any rate—spend time addressing a subject and then come up empty, 
saying “Oh no, we are not going to deal with that any longer”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why, when writing these lines, this motion, did the minister 
or ministers concerned not say “That's not really our jurisdiction. 
We have no business messing about where we don't belong.  There are 
provisions already in place”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They say that the purpose of this is to clarify things for 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would just like to address the comment by the Reform member 
who has just said that this issue merits examination because 
children undergo great upheaval at the time of separation.  Yes, I 
can imagine.  It is precisely to avoid having both a provincial and 
federal inspector looking into the welfare of the child. I do not 
want to see any more battles over who is in charge of what, 
jurisdictional squabbles between the province and the federal level 
when parents separate, ending up with the children having two sets 
of people concerned with their well-being, looking into their case. 
It is all the more confusing when the children are already the 
victims of a problem between their parents, children who are 
undergoing the emotional shock parental separation or divorce can 
represent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The wording of the motion embraces—a fancy word—areas under 
of provincial jurisdiction just a little too much.  The word 
“embraces” may be rather inappropriate when used in connection with 
divorce or separation, but it is important to point out that what 
this committee wants to examine embraces areas under provincial 
jurisdiction too much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have already said this, but it bears repeating. The 
mechanisms for implementing custody and visitation in the case of 
a separation in Quebec come under the Civil Code.  Child rearing 
comes under parental authority, and when it involves the education 
system, under the province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The strangest part of the motion is the tail end—and I would 
say that it is scary—as it refers to an approach that will focus 
on the responsibilities of each parent to assess the children's 
true needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This approach focusses on the responsibilities of each parent, 
on the needs of the children and their best interests at the time 
agreement is reached on their education.  If education is a 
provincial matter, what business do they have sticking their noses 
in this? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Meddling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Bernier:</B> Yes, meddling. I thank the hon. member 
opposite.  Sometimes you have to grab their attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think this is inexcusable intrusion by the federal 
government in family matters.  I recognize that the federal 
government wants to get involved in a relationship where the family 
is on its last legs, but this means going into the bedroom after 
the parties have left it.  It means going into the parents' bedroom 
to see if the parents are making the right decision on the 
education of their children.  I find that outrageous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the benefit of members from other regions besides Quebec, 
I would like to mention certain elements of Quebec legislation.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past year, Quebec has passed two laws.  I will identify 
them and then we will discuss them a bit.  The first is a model for 
setting support payments.  It has in effect since May 1997 and 
reflects the importance Quebec accords its children.  The second 
concerns family mediation and has been in effect since September 
1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does this mean?  It means that Quebec looks after parents 
who are separating or divorcing.  The model for setting support 
payments takes the incomes of both parents into account along with 
custody time. A formula and a guide for setting the amount of 
support are also available for the parents, mediators, lawyers and 
the courts. 
It is already set up. Family mediation is a new program allowing couples 
with children to agree at no cost on issues such as custody, visiting 
rights, child support and the division of assets in every judicial 
district. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The important thing in all this is that people are doing something. 
I see some movement across the floor. Members opposite are waking up, 
finally. Some are even laughing at me. It does not make sense. I realize 
it is getting a little late. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make sure we will not let the federal government stomp 
all over areas under provincial jurisdiction. That is the purpose of my 
speech this afternoon. I want people to know that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, I do not understand why a committee is being set up to 
review this issue, when everything is already in black and white. 
As I said earlier, I have never seen the federal government review 
something and then say that it does not make sense, that the government 
will not to come up with something.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This new legislation, Bill C-14, the drinking water materials 
safety act demonstrates our continuing partnership with the 
provinces and territories and the vigilance with which we guard 
the health and safety of all Canadians.  According to the 
Constitution acts of Canada, drinking water quality from the 
source to the tap falls under the provincial and territorial 
jurisdictions.  The federal government however is responsible for 
protecting Canadians from unsafe materials that come into contact 
with that water along the way, from the raw water intake through 
the filtration plant and then through the water mains to our 
faucets. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new act will help better protect drinking water by guaranteeing 
the safety of the materials that come into contact with that water while 
it is moved to the consumers. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again we are doing this with the support of the provincial and 
territorial health authorities.  Canada has one of the largest 
safest supplies of fresh water in the world.  We want to keep it 
that way. But the quality of that water has often been threatened 
and in the 1990s it is falling prey to some new hazards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A rapidly increasing population puts more pressure on the 
existing water supply and distribution systems.  There are new 
concerns about the use of pesticides and chemical effluents 
runoff from spraying farmers' fields.  In recent years there has 
been an alarming increase in cases of animal waste washing into 
municipal water systems and making many people sick. This has put 
provincial and municipal governments under growing pressure to 
safeguard their drinking water.  The public at large is becoming 
more and more concerned about its tap water and is rightly 
demanding guarantees of safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Municipalities need to replace aging infrastructures and they 
need health based standards to ensure that new materials they buy 
are safe.  In some cases costly new kinds of treatment systems 
are required to deal with the emerging problems such as 
cryptosporidium infections which cannot be eliminated by 
chlorination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of these concerns and more were cited when the provinces and 
territories put their support behind the drinking water materials 
safety act currently before this House.  I cannot emphasize too 
strongly that the distinct federal, provincial and territorial 
jurisdictions with respect to drinking water quality will 
continue to be recognized after the introduction of this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact this bill affirms both the federal government's 
responsibility to provide guidance and expertise in the area of 
drinking water quality and the right of the provinces and the 
territories to define legally enforceable standards within their 
own areas of authority. This bill also acknowledges the federal 
government's role in developing water quality research in 
collaboration with the provinces and territories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Responsibility for the overall quality of water that flows 
through the system will remain with the provinces.  The federal 
government with this new bill will guarantee that all the 
materials that come in contact with our water are certified to 
national health based standards.  We will be responsible for the 
regulation of drinking water materials that make up the 
distribution system along the way.  These fall into three 
categories:  treatment devices, treatment additives and system 
components. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quite simply, drinking water materials can be anything, 
including products and substances, that comes in contact with our 
drinking water from the time it leaves the water supply until it 
touches our lips.  That includes the chlorine added to municipal 
water supplies, the pipes that carry the water, right down to the 
filters you may attach to your faucets at home.  All of these 
products and many others I have not mentioned will fall under 
this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do we need to do this?  Because safe drinking water is an 
essential resource.  Because Canadians expect their water to be 
protected.  And because present federal legislation and existing 
voluntary compliance on water materials safety are inadequate. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1720"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT40"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that just moments ago I was boasting about our enviable 
supply of safe drinking water.  Indeed we have some of the best 
drinking water in the world.  This is partly a fortunate 
circumstance of history and geography. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the ongoing protection of our fresh water is no accident. In 
partnership with the provinces and territories, we have spent 
years developing the guidelines for Canadian drinking water 
quality. Since 1968 Canada has published these guidelines for 
safe drinking water. They recommend maximum levels of many 
chemicals, micro-organisms and radioactive substances.  We are 
pleased to note that the sixth edition of these important and 
respected guidelines was published last fall. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These guidelines serve as the basis for drinking water quality 
enforcement in the provinces and territories.  Alberta and Quebec 
have both enacted water quality regulations based on these 
guidelines.  Other provinces are enforcing them through their own 
provincial mechanisms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This partnership has been working extremely well but we must do 
more.  These guidelines do not have the added weight of being 
federal law.  The provinces and territories have asked us for 
that added leverage in protecting drinking water materials right 
across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill will ensure that drinking water materials are 
certified to health based standards enforced by law.  They will 
give Canadians better control over potentially hazardous drinking 
water materials that could contaminate drinking water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Home water filters are a good example.  There are many of these 
products available to consumers at every hardware store, 
department store and shopping mall. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we buy one of these filters, we have no guarantee that it will 
do what the maker claims, which is to improve the quality of drinking 
water. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact we know that while many of these products are reliable, 
a full 50% would fail a health based test.  This is a growing 
industry.  There are false health and safety claims being made 
and consumers do not always have the means to compare one product 
against another. This bill will allow direct comparison based on 
the same standards tests. These devices are just one area of 
concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the sale of chemicals of uncertified quality to water 
treatment plants and the leaching of contaminants, such as lead 
and cadmium, from water storage and delivery systems. This bill 
will guarantee the quality of these chemicals and the safety of 
water system components. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also proud to say that the drinking water materials safety 
act will build upon the unique collaborative and co-operative 
working relationship Canada has enjoyed with the other 
jurisdictions in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Assembly of First Nations in partnership with Health Canada 
and the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development is 
currently working on a project to identify solutions to assist 
First Nations communities in protecting and enhancing the quality 
of their drinking water. This project is known as the drinking 
water safety program for native people.  Since the drinking water 
materials safety act is national legislation which will regulate 
all drinking water materials on the market in Canada, it would of 
course affect future purchases of material for use on Indian 
lands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ongoing discussions with provincial and territorial members of 
the subcommittee on drinking water indicate continued support for 
federal legislation to improve the safety and effectiveness of 
devices, additives and components.  Direct consultation with the 
provincial departments of health also revealed strong support for 
this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Health Canada crafted this legislation, its officials 
wanted to make sure they were not adding a layer of red tape to 
the existing guidelines.  This proposed legislation will not 
duplicate or replace local and provincial plumbing codes for 
example. 
In fact it will give much needed support to the provinces in 
their efforts toward compliance and enforcement of these codes. 
Current Canadian plumbing codes do not contain health based 
performance standards and the vast majority, a full 70%, of 
plumbing materials are not certified as free from harmful 
contaminants. This is simply unacceptable.

<A HREF="#LINKT41"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again provincial drinking water authorities have asked the 
federal government to act as a clearing house by guaranteeing 
health based standards through a process of third party 
certification.  This bill will do that. It would be far too 
costly for each province to run its own separate certification 
program.  If they did, a costly and confusing patchwork of 
legislation would result. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to assure my colleagues that this bill will not 
force the provinces and territories to rip out their existing 
water systems and put in new ones.  What it will do however is 
ensure that those municipalities who need to build new water 
distribution systems will buy safe infrastructure materials. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provinces and territories will also find their home grown 
products on a level playing field, opening the door to 
international markets but closing the door to unscrupulous 
manufacturers and substandard products which right now can easily 
be dumped into Canada because there is no federal legislation to 
prevent it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think many members of this House and many consumers will be 
shocked to discover that a country like Canada has not had such a 
basic piece of legislation in place long before now.  In fact 
drinking water legislation was first proposed by a Liberal 
government in 1983 but it is only now that the Liberals are 
finally in a position to make good on this commitment to protect 
the health of Canadians. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public is worried about issues concerning health and the 
environment, such as the contamination of drinking water. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians will remember this government's strong commitment to 
protect the health of women and children and the need to stop 
long term toxic pollutants from entering our water. This 
legislation will make good on these promises. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said earlier, the protection of drinking water quality is a 
co-operative venture in Canada, one which we can all be proud of. 
We have made great strides in making drinking water safer over 
the past century and we have done so in partnership with our many 
distinct regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge my colleagues to seize this opportunity to once again 
work in conjunction with our provincial and territorial 
constituencies. I urge members of the House to give their 
wholehearted support to this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Before we resume 
debate I should inform the House that the House will be moving to

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take a few minutes to outline the reasons for 
introducing the joyriding bill, a bill I originally introduced in 
December of 1996 and reintroduced in this Parliament because of 
the ongoing problem with joyriding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that joyriding is actually a misnomer for what is 
really a very serious criminal offence.  At one time joyriding 
was equated to someone coming along and borrowing uncle Jim's car 
and going to a barn dance.  That was called a joyride.  Times 
were different when that section of the Criminal Code entitled 
joyriding was brought in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Joyriding is no longer a joy.  It is now very much a serious 
crime.  It is not a victimless crime.  It is something that 
causes a lot of dollar damage, a lot of social problems and 
unfortunately a lot of injuries and deaths. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I brought forward this bill to try to correct this, the Criminal 
Code amendment, because of the problem of widespread auto theft 
in Canada.  In the city of Montreal there are 40,000 auto thefts 
every year.  There is a total of $1.6 billion in damage and loss 
of vehicles in this country due to auto theft and joyriding. 
Most of the vehicles that are taken out for what used to be 
called a joyride are indeed taken, damaged and left.  They are 
not necessarily sold for parts or anything else, just straight 
malicious damage, and it seems the police are having a difficult 
time dealing with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The practice of joyriding is covered under section 335 of the 
Criminal Code under the title “Offences Resembling Theft”.  It 
reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone who, without the consent of the owner, takes a motor 
vehicle or vessel with intent to drive, use, navigate or operate 
it or cause it to be driven, used, navigated or operated is 
guilty of an offence punished on summary conviction. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is that this section of the law dealing with 
joyriders is so weak that young offenders do not even worry about 
it.  Young offenders, underage drivers, are the most common 
abusers of this section of the Criminal Code. They do not do it 
for the money.  They do not do it to sell the cars.  They realize 
that if they get caught there will not be serious consequences. 
So they steal cars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The average joyrider causes $4,000 in damage per car.  That is 
not a joyride.  That is a serious crime and a serious amount of 
damage to the vehicle of the unfortunate victim of this crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This section of the code is unfortunately tailormade for young 
offenders.  It does not want to saddle the teenager who is out 
for a thrill, so it just calls it resembling theft. 
Unfortunately, because of the changing societal problem we have, 
this misnomer means that teenagers caught stealing cars do not 
pay a serious penalty for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The average young offender stealing a car in Canada receives a 
$100 fine.  That is the median fine for car theft. The courts 
allow some discretion for judges.  If it is your car that got 
ripped off with an average of $4,000 damage done to it, it is a 
little disturbing when the penalty does not fit the crime.  A 
$100 fine for $4,000 average damage is out of proportion and 
needs to be fixed. That is why this bill is before us today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are 160,000 motor vehicles stolen in Canada at a total 
cost of $1.6 billion.  There is only $3.5 million a year stolen 
in bank robberies.  We are justifiably worried about bank 
robberies and take the necessary steps to make sure we call it a 
serious crime.  This is a case of $1.6 billion in penalties and 
we shrug our shoulders and say boys will be boys.  I do not think 
we should continue with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say that because too much damage is done and too many innocent 
people are injured by so-called joyriding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A couple of years ago my brother, a logging contractor, was 
going to work in the morning and found a kid on the road all 
covered in mud.  He waved him down and asked for help. 
He stopped and helped the kid.  He had driven off the road, down 
into a creek.  His friend, who was in the car, had a broken back. 
My brother got on his cell phone and called for an ambulance and 
the police.

</I></B></P><P align=left>They took the other fellow down to the police station.  Before 
my brother could get there to fill out the papers about being a 
witness to this event, the young man was on his way out of the 
police station.  He waved at him and said “see you around”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He did that every weekend.  It seemed as though there was 
nothing the police could do.  They caught the guy.  They knew who 
he was and yet that young guy went away, shrugging his shoulders. 
He was an underage driver.  He had almost a chronic problem with 
car theft.  Nothing could be done.  The innocent victim, his 
friend who came along for the joyride, ended up with a permanent 
lifetime disability.  That is very unfortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding of Fraser Valley people held an auto theft 
awareness town hall meeting.  An RCMP officer gave a presentation 
at that meeting.  I was asked to give my point of view with 
respect to a Criminal Code amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The RCMP officer informed us of things we could do to prevent 
auto theft.  ICBC was there as well, our local insurance company. 
They also went through some of the things we could do. They told 
us to always lock our cars and to put an auxiliary lock on the 
steering wheel.  They suggested an increased use of bike squads, 
an increased use of auxiliary police, as well as the use of crime 
stoppers and community patrols, such as block watch and citizen 
patrols.  They went through all the things we could do to address 
the crime of auto theft. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my home town of Chilliwack auto theft went up 90% last year. 
It went up 150% in Prince Rupert.  Manitoba had the biggest 
increase in the country.  It is growing exponentially. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a bunch of things we can do to prevent it, but the 
bottom line is after the patrols are done and the bike watches 
and other community efforts are made, and the cars are locked up, 
put in the garage and everything else, the net result is a 90% 
increase in auto theft. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The average claim in Chilliwack is $4,000.  That does not count 
the disruption and the anxiety.  I would even argue that it is a 
bit like the horse thievery of the old days.  It is more than 
just the $4,000 in damages.  When someone comes out in the 
morning, expecting to go to work, and their car is not there, the 
damage is more than in dollars.  There is the loss of wages. 
There is anxiety.  The family is disrupted.  It is a big problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The RCMP officer went on to say that it is not a police problem, 
that it is a community problem.  It is a national problem. He 
asked how the police could do their job when they go through all 
the work involved in arresting and processing the young offender 
and the courts fine them $100 and ask them not to do it again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill would address that problem.  It would give direction 
to the police and to the courts.  My bill would make this a 
serious offence under the Criminal Code.  It should be treated as 
a serious offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My bill would establish minimum and maximum sentences for jail 
terms; if not jail terms, at least there would be some way of 
dealing with these young offenders.  They could be sent to a 
group home or to another appropriate facility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill also stresses the fact that at times it is possible to 
tell parents of young offenders that they too share a 
responsibility.

<A HREF="#LINKT44"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill particularly addresses the idea that where it can be 
shown and where the judge is convinced that the negligence of a 
parent or guardian has contributed to the crime, then the parent 
or guardian would be obligated to help pay for the damage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, a young offender might have a curfew already 
imposed by the court with restrictions on travel or where they 
could be or whatever the court has imposed. The parent might say 
“What can you do with these young people?  Jimmy steals cars and 
that is the way she goes”.  Under the bill, if the court were 
convinced there was negligence it could tell the parent “Your 
kid has stolen a car.  He was out at one in the morning, but he 
was told to be in at midnight.  Therefore we are going to hold 
you responsible for some of the damages”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that could give parents and guardians some second 
thoughts as to whether they should be negligent in their duties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope people here in the House recognize the seriousness of 
this problem.  I believe it is a national problem and one that 
affects not only the criminal justice system, the courts and the 
police, and the people who have their cars stolen, but it affects 
the victims of joyriding, people who are passengers, people who 
may be involved in a hit and run situation or someone who goes 
along as an innocent person in what they think is a fun trip to a 
show and it turns into a very serious accident. It also affects 
the young people themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would argue that in dealing with young offenders who are 
beginning a habit of breaking the law at a very young age, the 
kinder thing would be for our police, court system and community 
not to shrug our shoulders and say that is the way it goes, they 
are just growing up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a country and as a Parliament I think we have an obligation 
to step in and say that it is serious and we are going to step 
into their lives at a young age, while they can still possibly be 
saved from the hardened criminal life.  We should get them help, 
let them know it is a serious problem that we also take 
seriously.  If we could send that message clearly to young 
offenders, perhaps we could start the clean-up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think of cases in New York where they have now started to 
prosecute very minor crimes such as graffiti, defacing walls, 
breaking windows.  They are starting to prosecute the small stuff 
because they are finding that if they look after the small stuff 
then people do not progress in their criminal activity to become 
habitual criminals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope people will take this into account and I hope the 
minister gets a draft of the bill and of the message I am trying 
to send today.  I hope the House of Commons will accept the idea 
that this has been a long time coming and it is now time to deal 
with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if there would be unanimous consent to make this a 
votable motion, to send it to committee for consideration at that 
stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. member has 
asked that his bill be made votable. Is there unanimous consent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
<P><A NAME="LINK235"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Maloney (Erie—Lincoln, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
hon. member for Fraser Valley has presented several amendments to 
section 335 of the Criminal Code which he claims will create a 
tougher and more effective law, one that will have a real 
deterrent effect on joyriding by young people.  I would like to 
commend him for his work in this field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, these changes will result in a more draconian law.  I 
would like to outline a few of the changes: a minimum penalty of 
six months imprisonment; a minimum fine of $1,000, with a maximum 
of $5,000; a provision for damages to be paid by the offender 
directly to the victim; a clause which would make the parents of 
a joyrider, if he or she is a young offender, liable for any 
fines or damages in certain circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As responsible parliamentarians we have an obligation to examine 
any change in the criminal law very carefully to determine 
whether tougher penalties will be effective and fair. 
We have a special responsibility to scrutinize any law that would 
impose additional imprisonment and fines on young people who come 
into conflict with the law.  As we know, joyriding is 
predominantly a young persons' offence.

<A HREF="#LINKT45"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question I ask is this.  Is there objective evidence to show 
that the existing law in section 335 has failed to do the job? 
In order to answer that question we should examine how the courts 
have actually used the joyriding section. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In case I am accused of diminishing the importance of this 
offence, let me state for the record that I do regard joyriding 
as a very serious offence.  In fact, I was a victim of such an 
offence.  I know firsthand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The involvement of a young person in the appropriation of an 
automobile is always a significant matter.  It is all the more 
serious because joyriding so often results in personal injury or 
costly damage to property. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem with Bill C-209 is that its drafters have not paid 
sufficient attention to the way section 335 is used by 
prosecutors and the courts in relation to other criminal charges, 
in particular the offences of theft, criminal negligence and the 
possession of stolen property. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member suggests that there are a huge number of 
joyriding incidents but relatively few convictions.  I will not 
debate the numbers but I do recommend that he look at the number 
of convictions for theft and possession of stolen property at the 
same time as he analyses the joyriding statistics.  He will 
likely find that joyriding incidents frequently result in more 
serious charges or charges in addition to joyriding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Several decades ago Parliament wisely decided that joyriding 
should be a distinct offence separate from the theft of a motor 
vehicle.  The difference lies in the intention of the person who 
takes the vehicle.  In a theft situation, the thief intends to 
steal a car for purposes of reselling it.  Joyriding, as the name 
implies, is more often an impulsive act and the offender may take 
the vehicle for thrills rather than profit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Supreme Court of Canada upheld the distinction between theft 
and joyriding in a 1972 decision, stating that the joyriding 
offence was created in order to provide a penalty where it may be 
difficult or impossible to establish the offence of theft.  The 
difference lies in the intent of the taker.  The courts have said 
that if the intent is to merely drive a car and then return it 
the owner, then that is not theft but rather a separate offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These decisions provide the key to understanding how joyriding 
should be dealt with under the criminal law.  If joyriding 
charges are not laid as often as the hon. member would like, it 
is because serious joyriding incidents, which result in injury to 
other persons or damage to the car or to other property, are 
often prosecuted with a charge of theft or possession of stolen 
property, perhaps criminal negligence, careless driving or 
dangerous driving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An obvious concern arises here.  Can someone who steals a car 
claim that he really intended to return it to the owner and 
therefore avoid a theft charge?  The courts have provided us with 
the answer.  Each case must stand on its own facts.  For example, 
how long did the offenders keep the car?  How far did he drive 
it?  Did he make an effort to return it?  Did he drive the car 
recklessly?  All the circumstances must be considered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what I am asking the hon. member to ponder.  Rather than 
applying a mandatory minimum jail term in every case, why not 
give the courts some flexibility in structuring the penalties for 
the young joyrider in view of all the circumstances of the 
individual case? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the youth who has no previous record?  There are so 
many ways to handle this problem short of sending every young 
joyrider to prison.  A probation order for a first time offender 
combined with an order of restitution may be quite adequate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also point out that it is unusual to see a custodial 
term imposed for a first offence of possession for stolen goods. 
I do not see why we would opt for mandatory minimum of six months 
jail time for a first offence here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also cannot understand why the hon. member wants to take 
sentencing out of the realm of the Young Offenders Act.  The bill 
says, notwithstanding the Young Offenders Act, the offender is 
liable to a term of imprisonment.  I would point out that he is 
also liable to imprisonment under the Young Offenders Act.  Young 
offenders can also be forced to pay restitution.  The Young 
Offenders Act provides all the remedies needed in conjunction 
with a penalty structure of the Criminal Code.  Section 3 of the 
Young Offenders Act sets out 10 principles that apply to the 
sentencing of youth offenders.  I quote the first principle: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Crime prevention is essential to the long-term protection of 
society and requires addressing the underlying causes of crime by 
young persons and developing multi-disciplinary approaches to 
identifying and effectively responding to children and young 
persons at risk of committing offending behaviour in the future. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These principles should be applied so that all of the 
circumstances surrounding the offence, including parental 
involvement, can be considered.

<A HREF="#LINKT46"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can see that Bill C-209 would continue to require that young 
offenders be tried in youth court but I cannot understand why he 
would want to add a notwithstanding clause that would suddenly 
take sentencing outside the structure of the Young Offenders Act. 
I have no objection to prosecutions under section 335. Joyriding 
is a problem in itself, aside from damage to property or personal 
injury that may result from it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last session, the government introduced a series of 
amendments to the Criminal Code in Bill C-17, which is now 
chapter 18 in the Statutes of Canada, 1997.  These amendments 
included section 335, a change that for some reason is not 
reflected in the hon. member's bill before us today.  The 
amendment deals with the responsibility of occupants of the 
vehicle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Young people who take cars often do so in the company of others 
and these passengers may be aware of their immunity from 
prosecution even when they clearly know that the car has been 
taken without the consent of the owner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, it is often difficult to determine who took the 
vehicle when several young people are involved.  The new law 
solves this problem by making passengers liable to a charge of 
joyriding unless they make an effort to leave the vehicle.  This 
amendment shows that the government does take the section of the 
code very seriously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give an example of how section 335 has been used.  In 
1991 in a Saskatchewan case, an offender took a vehicle and 
claimed that he was going to use it to pull another vehicle out 
of the mud.  However, he made no attempt to restore the vehicle 
to its owner and the accused appeared to be responsible for the 
later destruction of the car in a fire. The offender received a 
conditional discharge combined with 18 months of probation but he 
was forced to pay restitution to the victim for the loss of the 
vehicle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an example of how section 335 in combination with the 
restitution sections in the Criminal Code can be used to benefit 
the victim where property damage and loss have occurred.  The 
amendment in Bill C-209 is not really necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give a quite different example.  This is an Alberta case. 
The offender admitted to taking the vehicle for purposes of 
joyriding.  He began driving too fast, misjudged a turn and 
slammed into a trailer parked on the other side of the road. Of 
what was he convicted?  Not joyriding as the offender hoped, but 
rather dangerous driving, which carries a maximum penalty of five 
years imprisonment and 10 years if there is personal injury. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I wish to comment briefly on the second part of the 
bill which tries to make parents responsible for fines and 
damages incurred by a young person who is convicted of joyriding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This idea was examined recently by both the House of Commons 
committee and a federal-provincial task force on youth justice. 
Neither group recommended that parents be required, under the 
Criminal Code, to pay damages for neglecting to exercise due 
care. The task force did recommend that provinces develop 
legislation governing the civil recovery from grossly negligent 
parents for damages or losses arising from the criminal acts of 
their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand that Manitoba recently created legislation making 
parents civilly responsible to a limit of $5,000 where it is 
proven that the parents bore some responsibility for the offence. 
In terms of the parents actually participating in an offence, the 
Criminal Code and the Young Offenders Act already contain 
offences of aiding and abetting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For these reasons, I suggest that the amendments of Bill C-209 
are not needed and will not improve the capacity of the criminal 
justice system to deter joyriding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Before we return to 
the debate, the Chair would confirm that the member for Fraser 
Valley West did not receive unanimous consent to have this bill 
made votable.  Unanimous consent was not received.  This is for 
the record. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK236"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
sad to see a bill like this one being used to try to misrepresent the 
facts, because of a lack of understanding, exaggeration or what not. The 
problem is not as bad as it seems or as the member from the Reform Party 
made it out to be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the Criminal Code provide in this respect right now? 
Section 322 of the Criminal Code deals with theft per se. Let us call a 
spade a spade. Let us call things by their rightful name. 
To take a vehicle with intent to use it—when there is, in legal 
terms, actus reus and mens rea, that is to say acting wilfully with 
criminal intent—it is just that, theft.

<A HREF="#LINKT47"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other thing the lawmakers saw fit to add to the Criminal Code 
under the heading of offences resembling theft is subsection 335 (1), 
which the hon. member from the Reform Party would like us to amend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does this subsection say? 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>335.(1) Every one who, without the consent of the owner, takes 
a motor vehicle or vessel with intent to drive, use, navigate or 
operate it or cause it to be driven, used, navigated or operated is 
guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is another offence which, while not being as serious as theft, 
is also punishable. 
This is the case where a young person, or an adult for that matter, 
decides to use an automobile or another vehicle without the owner's 
consent, but does not have a criminal intent, has no intent to defraud, 
there is no fraudulent intention, and the lawmakers leave it up to the 
crown to decide whether to prosecute under section 322 of the Criminal 
Code or under subsection 335 (1). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that, in a free and democratic society as ours in Canada 
and Quebec, it is healthy to let those who enforce the law use their 
head in laying charges to try to see what would be most appropriate in 
each case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the government member said earlier, the judges of the 
Supreme Court of Canada, in 1973, however, not in 1972, handed down 
a clear ruling in Lafrance v. Regina to the effect that the offence 
as worded in section 335 (1) is not a lesser offence than ordinary 
theft.  They created two separate offences, each with its own 
characteristics.  The two are distinct and the crown may decide on 
the charge according to the circumstances of the case.  This 
interpretation by the courts seems to show the effectiveness of the 
standard set by the present wording. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments or speeches by Reform members I have heard 
sometimes seem to indicate an interest in seeing everything covered 
in the Criminal Code.  Each situation would have its own section in 
the Criminal Code. 
The goal would be to limit the judge's discretion as much as 
possible.  I have the impression that the Reform Party wants to see 
the courts turned into legal robots, heartless machines operating 
on the basis of sections, statistics, sometimes even stereotypes. 
It looks like they want to remove any possibility of discretion, of 
a decision based on a particular case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the field of justice, I learned very early on that nothing 
is black and white. 
In this field, as in many others, some things must be analyzed, and 
I think that judges in the existing system—if everyone does not 
agree with me on this, we have a big problem—have the training and 
the skill to analyze and judge the offence before them, which the 
crown has decided to prosecute under either section 322 or section 
335 (1). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the Reform member's bill goes further still.  It calls for 
a stiffer sentence.  Once again, the intention is to prevent judges 
from exercising their discretion, from using stiff fines to make a 
distinction between cases. 
It is true that sometimes this will be the result of a joyride, but 
other charges will be laid against the wrongdoer, the adolescent or 
young man who uses a car without the owner's consent, because 
damaging another person's property is also an offence.  And it is 
the crown prosecutors who look at the facts presented to them by 
the police and decide which sections they will rely on in court.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also a major shortcoming in Bill C-209, and you will agree 
with me that it is another reason to reject this bill. It undermines the 
Young Offenders Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that when it comes to the Young Offenders Act, there is a 
tremendous gulf separating the Bloc Quebecois and the Reform Party. I 
think we will never succeed in sharing the same views on this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what I concluded when we studied the Young Offenders Act 
last year. With Bill C-209, an attempt is made to quietly uproot powers 
in the Young Offenders Act, namely a part of that act relating to the 
application of section 335(1) of the Criminal Code. 
There is an attempt to increase the penalties for this offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let it be clear, I do not want to minimize that. I think that 
presently the Criminal Code includes all the necessary tools for the 
administration of justice, provided of course that the courts apply it 
properly. I have every reason to believe that today the courts are 
applying properly sections 322 and 335(1) of the Criminal Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another reason why we should reject this bill—this will 
my last point—and it concerns parental responsibility. In fact, I 
remember when I was 15 or 16, I was attracted to cars. Are not all young 
people at that age attracted to cars? I am not saying that I stole cars, 
I am not saying that I used cars without my parents' consent, but I was 
nevertheless attracted to cars, especially in a county like 
Berthier—Montcalm. 
Berthierville is in that county, and with the Villeneuves, it is natural 
down there to be attracted to cars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can it be said that parents are negligent if one day a child sees 
a car with its keys, and, without thinking, gets in the car, takes a 
ride and brings it back to the parking lot where he took it. On a whim, 
the young person used a car. Does this make that child a criminal? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that the members of the Reform Party would want that child 
to be called a criminal, but I tell you that is not the case. That 
child, on a whim, used a vehicle. In such a situation, the crown 
attorney can at his discretion decide to refer to theft under section 
322 or to an infraction resembling theft, use without consent, under 
section 335(1) of the Criminal Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that it upsets Reform members when they are told such 
truths, but that is what is found today in the Criminal Code. I do not 
think the Criminal Code is the greatest thing since sliced bread, and 
there are things in it that should be changed. If we really want to 
change it, let us review it completely, rather than trying to do 
patchwork, as the Reform Party is doing with Bill C-209.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, Bill 
C-209 brought forward by the member for Fraser Valley outlines 
the member's concerns about the serious increase in and problems 
with joyriding and car theft.  No one would question the concerns 
and the seriousness we have seen in Canada with the growing 
problem of car thefts which the bill seeks to address. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Between 1990 and 1994 the number of car thefts increased by over 
40,000 and the number of vehicles stolen per 1,000 registrations 
increased by 50%.  It is generally known in the community that 
most car thefts are used for joyriding, in fact something like 
three-quarters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a concern in the community that dangerous behaviour 
associated with joyriding makes it a threat to the safety of not 
only the police but the public and often tragically the joyriders 
themselves.  Probably most of us are aware of various instances 
and circumstances that have taken place in our local communities 
and neighbourhoods which involve joyriding and often result in 
serious injury or even death.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In addressing this bill, which is non-votable and being debated 
for the record, there is also widespread agreement that we really 
need to examine new ways of dealing with crimes by young 
offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the NDP we believe very strongly—and there is a growing 
sense in the community—that we need to promote a renewed sense 
of social responsibility.  Our focus must be on finding ways of 
making young offenders aware of the consequences of their 
actions.  That is important but most important is that the 
information and studies that have been done show the most 
critical actions we can take and the most effective things we can 
engage in are crime prevention and addressing the underlying 
issues which drive young people to antisocial behaviour and 
criminal activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unless we can understand the issues and provide the resources 
and tools to local communities to address underlying issues of 
antisocial behaviour and crime, the NDP believes that we will not 
make much progress. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are different opinions on how we have to build a sense of 
responsibility among young offenders.  Certainly for the member 
from the Fraser Valley the idea of minimum penalties for 
joyriding requiring parents to pay for their children's actions 
is seen as the way to go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before the House sets out a minimum penalty of a $1,000 
fine or six months in prison.  It also stipulates that parents or 
guardians could be required to pay the fines or other penalties 
incurred by their children if it was felt somehow that their 
neglect of parenting duties resulted in the child committing the 
offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem with this approach is that there is little or no 
evidence to show that increasing penalties will actually work and 
will actually deal with the issue of joyriding or many of the 
other issues facing us in terms of increasing crime among young 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To talk about the position of the Reform Party and how it has 
approached this issue and issues it has raised around crime and 
punishment, commenting in the Alberta <I>Report</I> on the problem 
of car theft in the city of Regina, the member for Calgary 
Northeast suggested that without incarceration young punks have 
nothing to fear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That member ignored that Saskatchewan already incarcerates a 
higher proportion of youth than most provinces and has now 
recognized that it has not reduced crime.  Simply criminalizing 
young people, throwing them in jail and increasing fines, has not 
dealt with the issue most people would recognize as a problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fortunately for the city of Regina, the Government of 
Saskatchewan has recognized the limitations of the approach of 
the Reform Party and what it is advocating.  It is looking at 
more effective ways as one province, and certainly in my province 
of British Columbia, of dealing with the situation of young 
offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also very questionable whether simply holding parents 
responsible for the actions of their children will actually 
impact young people and make them consider the consequences of 
their own actions.  There are cases where better parenting may 
have prevented the child from committing an offence.  However, 
the more important point is that if the relationship between the 
parent and the child is so bad that the courts feel the parents 
have failed, it is not clear at all and there is no evidence to 
suggest that penalizing the parent will improve the situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to point out that according to the National 
Crime Prevention Council, 97% of young people in custody have 
suffered abuse at the hands of a trusted authority figure.  That 
is a very startling figure.  It should lead us to be very 
suspicious of superficial approaches put forward by the Reform 
Party.  It should lead us to understand that these approaches 
have failed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When looking at the bill we must ask ourselves how we will 
address the problem by having parents pay their children's fines. 
Holding parents responsible, even in a limited sense, for the 
crimes of their children sends out a wrong message.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When dealing with young people who have committed crimes, the 
goal should be to persuade them to take responsibility for their 
actions and to prevent these actions from taking place in the 
first place.  Holding responsible someone other than the person 
who committed the crime seems to us to be a step removed from the 
objective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main problem with the bill is that we cannot deal with 
issues like joyriding in isolation.  We must address the social 
and economic conditions that cause these acts of antisocial 
behaviour, criminal acts in the first place.  We must also find 
more effective socially responsible ways to deal with young 
offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Criminal activity by our young people does not happen in a 
vacuum.  While it is important to state that each individual, 
whether a young person of 18 years of age or an adult, is 
responsible for his or her actions, we must recognize that there 
are societal factors at work which often push young people toward 
criminal activity. If young people grow up in poor circumstances 
and in an environment that shows little respect for the rights 
and needs of children, we should not be surprised that children 
grow up not respecting society's rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One approach that is having some impact in terms of dealing with 
young offenders rather than jail sentences or penalties is to 
deal with restorative justice.  The objective is to bring about 
understanding and recognition of the damage that has been done to 
a victim or to a community at large. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a program in Maple Ridge, British Columbia, local businesses 
allow young offenders to pay their fines by working at the local 
businesses.  There is an attempt to bring about better 
understanding of the crime that has taken place.  While some have 
criticized restorative justice or diversion programs as letting 
people off scot-free, the fact is the results are positive.  At 
the Maple Ridge program only 6% of the participants reoffended in 
the following year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe in the NDP that we need to understand the risk 
factors that increase the chances of a young person being 
victimized or engaging in antisocial behaviour.  We need to 
ensure early prevention for high risk youth.  We need to ensure 
we are investing in education.  We need to ensure families have 
good support in the community.  We need to ensure families have 
good paying jobs and that there are family friendly workplaces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our concern with the bill is that the approach of the Reform 
Party is to further criminalize young people.  This is no answer. 
It is an answer that may pander to the concerns of the community 
and may offer a very superficial response, but it does not deal 
with the underlying issues at work in terms of young people at 
risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not agree with the bill and suggest that it is a 
short-sighted measured to deal with what is a very serious 
problem.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the hon. member for Fraser Valley for bringing forward Bill 
C-209.  I also appreciate his thoughtful and rightful initiative 
in doing so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know joyriding is a serious crime and a serious problem. 
It is not a joyful ride.  It should be called a painful ride. 
This problem affects communities all over the country and any one 
of us could be a victim of this crime.  We do not know who will 
be a target tomorrow in our communities.  The hon. member for 
Erie—Lincoln said even he was a victim of this crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is disappointing to hear members from the third and fourth 
parties opposing the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding 27 cars are stolen every day.  Most of them end up 
being used for a so-called joyride, which I call a painful ride. 
The fine imposed for this type of crime is unproportional to the 
loss and damage caused, including the innocent lives which are 
lost in these types of accidents.  As a result of this, insurance 
premiums are increasing.  They are skyrocketing.  Innocent 
victims are affected not only by the damage but also by the 
increased insurance premiums.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. NDP member for Vancouver East stated that an increase 
in penalties, fines or holding the parents responsible will not 
help.  What else will help to reduce this type of crime? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us consider the record of other countries, such as 
Singapore.  There are no more joyrides in those countries because 
the penalties are harsh and tough.  Young criminals know that the 
penalties are tough.  That is the way to control these crimes. 
Someone has to be held responsible for these painful rides. Who 
else will be held accountable?  These young kids are stealing 
cars and going for joyrides.  Why not hold the parents 
responsible? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an excellent bill.  We need to bring about these 
changes.  Measures to deal with joyriding should be in the 
Criminal Code.  Someone has to take the initiative.  The parents 
should be held accountable for the actions of their kids who are 
not properly controlled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate the initiative of the hon. member for Fraser 
Valley.  Considering the seriousness of these crimes, we need to 
take corrective action and hold someone accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I recognize the hon. 
member for Fraser Valley.  The Chair should point out that as is 
the convention, as it is the member's bill, he will have five 
minutes but there will be no further debate at the conclusion of 
the five minutes. 
<P><A NAME="LINK239"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
has been an interesting debate.  It is almost like a take note 
debate.  Of course there will not be a vote on it because not all 
Private Members' Business is votable which is unfortunate. 
Nevertheless it has been interesting to hear the different points 
of view from the different parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I always find it a little unfortunate in Private Members' 
Business that people do not seem to listen to the speeches. They 
all craft a speech in advance and regardless of what anybody 
might say in presenting their opinion, it is as if they had never 
said a thing.  Therefore I would like to run through again very 
quickly the reasons for this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP member mentioned that we have to do things to prevent 
crime rather than just come down like a ton of bricks on someone 
who steals a car. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I went through the list.  I went through what the RCMP said 
would work well.  I fully support that.  The trouble is we cannot 
put all of that in the Criminal Code.  We can only deal with code 
amendments here.  A lot of other initiatives, both provincial and 
federal, are not code amendments.  Of course I cannot put all of 
them into this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I talked about the increased use of bike squads, getting out 
among the kids so they see a friendly police presence.  I talked 
about the increased use of crime stoppers, nipping the crime in 
the bud before it becomes a big problem in the community. Then we 
have the increased use of street crews as we call them in my area 
which deal not only with crime, but also with drug use, drug 
abuse and so on. That is an initiative which works well in our 
area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the block watch program where people look after not 
only their own assets but those of their community.  If they see 
kids trying to break into a car, they can stop the crime.  To 
prevent the crime of course is far better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Citizen patrols have been very successful in my riding.  The 
lock it or lose it campaign initiated by our local insurance 
company has been very successful.  Ten to fifteen per cent of all 
auto thefts result from vehicles not being locked.  That is a 
shame.  It almost entices someone to steal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have an education program in our schools about the serious 
effect of this crime.  It is a very good program which should be 
continued and expanded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of this I believe is Reform Party policy as well. 
I hope the member from the NDP will realize that the object of 
the Criminal Code amendments is not to say this is the only thing 
we are going to do. The object is to say that when all else has 
failed, what can we do?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliament has the privilege and the requirement to say that we 
treat this as a serious crime.  By all means part of the 
restorative justice campaign is to pay back, to make restitution 
for damages, to pay for those crimes by perhaps working at the 
local stores. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One comment made in the speeches here today was that we should 
just make young people aware of the consequences of their 
actions.  They are well aware of the consequences of their 
actions. Right now the consequence is a $100 fine.  Fifty-two per 
cent of young people receive no fine.  They receive total 
probation for a car theft with damages up to $4,000 on average. 
The consequences of the crime are very serious. The loss of a 
person's vehicle.  Often there are injuries.  Two-thirds of young 
people who steal cars end up in an accident of some sort, many 
causing bodily harm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we send the message to young people that if they steal a car, 
wrap it around a telephone pole and get caught, they can figure 
on about $100 fine, those are the consequences. These young 
people think they are immortal, they are young and do not think 
about the damage done to themselves or their friends.  They just 
drive hell bent for leather and often hurt themselves and others 
and the consequence is a $100 fine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to send the message that the consequences are serious, 
that we treat this crime seriously.  We hope the young people 
will treat it seriously and that the courts, police and parents 
will treat it seriously as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the talk about holding the parents responsible is very 
interesting.  I hope that everyone has read the bill and the 
sections that I have tried to amend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In subsection 2 of the bill I brought forward today it says that 
notwithstanding all the other portions of the Young Offenders 
Act, if the court is of the opinion that the case would be best 
met by the imposition of a fine, damages or costs and the court 
is satisfied that the parent or guardian of the young person who 
contributed to the commission of the crime, then they can step 
in.  In other words—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
Oslo conference on child labour reflects a growing and worldwide 
concern about child labour, particularly the urgent need to 
eliminate its most extreme and intolerable forms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the delegates at the Oslo conference agreed that the 
countries of the world must take every step possible to suppress 
such atrocities as the sale and trafficking of children, forced 
and compulsory labour, debt bondage and child slavery, and the 
use of children for any type of work that is likely to jeopardize 
their health, their safety or their moral and social development. 
The use of child soldiers in recent armed conflicts was 
identified as an issue that requires immediate and specific 
attention. 
There was less than consensus opinion, however, on how to best 
address the larger issue of the 250 million child labourers 
between the ages of 5 and 14 who are forced to work to survive.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone everywhere agrees that poverty is both the root cause 
and a major consequence of child labour.  In that light 
strategies to fight poverty are central to any serious efforts to 
alleviate child labour.  Canada falls short in this regard.  The 
international community has targeted 0.7% of GDP as the level of 
industrial development aid.  Canada now stands at 0.34%, a drop 
of $780 million.  Both Norway and Great Britain have announced 
increases to a full 1% of gross domestic product. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada falls short in other tangibles as well.  The Canadian 
government says that it does not support the use of boycotts or 
labelling programs.  It does not agree that projects like the 
Rugmart labelling system will end the exploitation of children in 
the carpet industry even though there is broad support for that 
program in many parts of the world.  The government does not 
believe in legislation such as the Harken bill in the United 
States which bans the importation of goods made by bonded child 
labour.  It has refused for over 25 years to sign International 
Labour Organization convention No. 138 which deals with the 
minimum age of workers entering the workforce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government does not agree that international trade 
agreements must include labour standards in spite of the fact 
that speaker after speaker at the Oslo conference cited 
liberalized trade agreements as a key cause in the escalation of 
the use of child labour in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consumers and governments in developed nations can and must use 
their purchasing power and any other instruments at their 
disposal to put pressure on those who participate in the economic 
exploitation of children.  Voluntary compliance with codes of 
conduct will not help the child who sits chained to a loom as we 
speak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do we know that consumer boycotts and non-tariff trade barriers 
work?  The garment manufacturers of Bangladesh at the merest hint 
of a boycott by the United States cleared their workplaces of 
child labour within three years and now use the fact that they 
are child labour free as a marketing tool. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Critics would say that boycotts result in these children being 
thrown out of the workplace and winding up in the streets or some 
worse form of exploitation.  My point is that there are 50 
million child labourers in India and over 100 million heads of 
households who do not have meaningful work.  It is simple.  We 
take the children out of the workplace.  We put their parents in 
the workplace.  We put the children in schools where they belong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has not done enough.  When questioned on October 
3, the Minister of Foreign Affairs again repeated he was not 
willing to engage legislation and tools such as the Harken bill 
in the United States and he was not willing to sign convention 
No. 138 of the ILO.

Centre. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some child experts question the effectiveness of measures such 
as the one my colleague has just been speaking about, that is 
banning imports of forced or indentured child labour.  The 
underlying cause of child labour is poverty and the long term 
solution is to attack poverty.  This point came out clearly in 
the speech of the minister for international development at the 
Oslo child labour conference last week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The conference was hosted by the Norwegian government in 
conjunction with the ILO and UNICEF.  It unanimously adopted an 
agenda for action which appears consistent with our policy on the 
issue of child labour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our efforts are focused on three issues:  providing affordable 
access to primary education particularly for girls; improving the 
status, role and economic security for women as equal partners in 
development; and encouraging governments to enforce existing laws 
governing the employment of children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is actively supporting the work of the ILO to develop a 
new convention by 1999 on the most intolerable forms of child 
labour including bonded labour.  Canada is to host a preparatory 
meeting in Ottawa for principal donor countries that were invited 
to the Oslo conference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Within our region, the United States, Mexico and ourselves are 
examining the child labour and working conditions of young 
people.  Our labour minister spoke at a trilateral conference in 
Ottawa last month which was attended by over 100 government, 
labour and NGO representatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also believe that business can play a role that reinforces 
international action by government response to ethical, 
environmental and social concerns. 
A private sector alliance developed an international code of 
business ethics for firms operating overseas.

<P><A NAME="LINK245"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, on October 24, I put a 
question in this House to the Minister of Transport. My question dealt 
with a statement made to the newspaper <I>Le Soleil</I> by the secretary of 
state for agriculture and agri-food, and fisheries and oceans, who is 
also the hon. member for Bellechasse, the riding next to mine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The secretary of state was quoted as saying that the station in 
Lévis would close on December 1 and that rail service would be 
transferred to the north shore, in Sainte-Foy. I thought that statement 
was rather strange, which is why I wanted to ask the Minister of 
Transport a question. 
I asked him if the decision had been made at his level, even though 
there had been a recommendation by the national transportation agency. 
He said no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During question period in the House, we do not have much time. I 
would like to use my time today to get further information on the 
subject I raised in my question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I found the answer of the minister very interesting when he said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are looking at a number of options for rail service across 
the country. On the matter of the Lévis station, no decision has 
yet been made. I will gladly consider any idea or opinion my 
colleague or anyone else might have on the subject before I make my 
decision. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Afterwards, I called for public consultations and I tried to find 
out if the national transportation agency had held public hearings, 
because it did hold a few public hearings in 1991. But there were no 
public hearings this time because the NTA decided there would not be 
any. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of public interest, since there had been no agreement 
between Via Rail and CN, the then Minister of Transport, under the 
Conservatives, decided, on March 16, 1993, to close Lévis station. It 
seems that the situation is the same today because, on February 22, 
1996, CN got permission to abandon lines along the St. Lawrence River. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, negotiations between CN and Via Rail have yet to be 
completed. Since there is still no agreement, Via Rail has let it be 
known, probably through the member for Bellechasse, that it would be 
forced to go to Sainte-Foy. 
In the meantime, two trains stopped at the Charny station every day, but 
VIA announced in an internal bulletin that they would no longer stop in 
Charny, which means no more train station on the south shore. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In these circumstances, as a member of Parliament, I decided to 
hold public consultations on November 11 and 12. I will consult the 
people, ask who is for and who is against before the irreparable closing 
of the Lévis and Charny stations so that people who disagree with this 
decision can express their opinion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, I ask the transport minister's representative to help me by 
insisting that VIA Rail make all pertinent documents public, which it 
has refused to do until now, so that people can express an informed 
opinion.

member for Lévis that the minister is very aware of the situation 
involving the Lévis station and he is intent on resolving the 
matter soon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the hon. member knows full well, the problem of the Lévis 
station has been around for a number of years and there are many 
divergent opinions on what to do about it.  Consultations with 
stakeholders and local community leaders have been ongoing since 
1990. 
Because of the very divergent views on the subject of the Lévis 
station and the Montmagny line, a number of extensions have 
already been obtained in order to keep this station open.

</I></B></P><P align=left>First and foremost, the government's primary consideration is to 
ensure that any solution is safe and that it minimizes the 
inconvenience for the roughly 17,000 rail travellers who use the 
Lévis station every year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the hon. member for Lévis is anxious about the situation 
in his riding, but I am sure that, at the same time, he would not 
want the minister to make any decision without first considering 
all the possible options. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister is extremely concerned about looking at all the 
options in order to make the right decision.  For this reason, 
the minister wrote some time ago to Mr. Ivany, the president of 
VIA Rail and asked for opinions with respect to the Lévis 
station. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me assure my hon. friend that his concerns have not gone 
unnoticed.  On behalf of the Minister of Transport, I would like 
to assure him that a decision on this matter will be made 
shortly. In the meantime if the member learns of any opinions 
from his constituents at his hearings next week, please, I would 
ask him to forward them to the minister because I know that he is 
open to suggestions.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les 
Basques, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, on October 29, I asked a question of the 
Minister of National Revenue concerning the employment insurance 
eligibility of tip employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister stated that consultations were ongoing between the 
Minister of Finance, the Minister of Human Resources Development and 
himself to find a solution to ensure that the policy implemented by the 
Quebec government is compatible with employment insurance eligibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wanted to come back on the matter because, in a way, it requires 
urgent action. The bill introduced in the National Assembly is now at 
the clause by clause study stage before a committee and we need to know 
if the federal government will make the necessary technical changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must remember that the Quebec government wants tip employees to 
claim their tips, in consideration of which they could use those 
revenues for their employment insurance entitlement, something that is 
easily understandable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The analysis made led to the conclusion that employers should 
collect only 20% of tips to simplify the process. We are waiting for 
the federal government's decision. We know there was some kind of 
agreement in principle, but the regulatory change is yet to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would it be possible to have an announcement on the matter by the 
revenue minister, the Minister of Human Resources Development, the 
Minister of Finance or the three of them if they wish?  We would like to 
finally go ahead with the new system designed by Quebec. I know that it 
could interest other provinces as well. If the necessary regulatory 
changes were made, the new system could be implemented for the coming 
fiscal year, thus allowing tip employees to earn employment insurance 
benefit entitlement for the tips they actually earned.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Sue Barnes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National 
Revenue, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his question. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its 1997 budget, the Quebec government announced measures to 
help ensure that the tips of workers in the restaurant and hotel 
industry are reported and subject to tax. It announced that this 
would be accomplished in part through new measures to be 
introduced in legislation which would oblige the workers to remit 
their tips to their employers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Quebec budget also announced that tips would be eligible 
income in the calculation of various social benefits, notably 
employment insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prior to the Quebec budget announcement, Quebec officials had 
explained to federal officials that employees would be required 
to remit tips daily to employers who, in turn, would record them, 
withhold the appropriate deductions and return the remainder to 
the employees. On that basis, Quebec was advised that tips would 
be insurable for employment insurance purposes because they would 
be employer controlled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the current employment insurance legislation, tips can 
only be regarded as insurable if they are employer controlled as 
a result of being remitted by the employee to the employer on an 
ongoing basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are aware of the underlying objective of the Quebec 
government to curb the underground economy and address the under 
reporting of income, more specifically tips in restaurant and 
hotel industries.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government also understands that following the 
publication of the Quebec proposals, major concerns were 
expressed by employers as to their added administrative burden. 
As a result, Quebec considered a number of options for 
alleviating this burden and has asked the federal government to 
advise whether these changes would be acceptable for EI coverage 
purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are being actively reviewed.  I will assure the House that 
the federal government is aware of the importance of the issue 
and the tight time frame of the Government of Quebec to implement 
its program by January 1. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is treating Quebec's request as top priority. 
Quebec will soon be advised of the federal government's position 
on the matter.
