</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  My colleagues, we have with us on this sad 
day members of Shaughnessy Cohen's family in the gallery, her 
staff and her very close friends throughout her life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today our procedure will be as follows.  We will have tributes 
from the spokespersons of each party.  Then I will be giving more 
information.  There is no need to remind us that this day is a 
unique day in the history of this parliament.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
behalf of members of my party and on behalf of all members of 
the House, I wish to pay tribute to the member for Windsor—St. 
Clair. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a great family that we belong to.  The member for 
Windsor—St. Clair was the best.  She was a very dedicated 
person, committed to all the social causes in her home town of 
Windsor.  She came here with the same preoccupations.  She was 
chair of the justice committee and she spent all her life 
ensuring that those most in need in society could have a little 
better life. That was her preoccupation every day, in committees, 
in the House of Commons and in caucus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As everyone knows, she was a very outspoken person.  She was 
absolutely not shy to tell me as it was, as she saw it.  She had 
a great sense of humour.  She became everyone's friend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is amazing the deep sorrow I felt last night when I learned 
of her passing and when I saw my colleagues crying.  A sister had 
left us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What people do not understand is that we might have our 
political differences but we all want to do the best to make sure 
we have a better society.  Shaughnessy was like that. She was a 
dynamo.  She got things moving; she pushed. She was very partisan 
in many ways.  Shaughnessy believed in the party and the values 
of our party.  She could also be very critical of moves that were 
made because at times she was not completely happy.  It happens 
once in a while. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Shaughnessy was what is best about parliament.  She represented 
her riding and she felt strongly that the views she gathered 
every weekend when she went back to her constituency should be 
expressed here in the House of Commons and on Wednesdays in our 
caucus.  She did this very forcefully. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For me and my colleagues, we have lost a great sister and a 
great parliamentarian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the occasion a minute ago to speak with her husband and 
her daughter to express my sympathies.  It must be a terrible 
shock and an unbelievable loss for them. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But they know that the time she spent in parliament did not go 
unnoticed.  She was a person of strong convictions but she also 
knew how to make friends.  Although her work was very important 
to her, she knew there was more to life, like sometimes making 
time for fun, creating the odd problem for us and getting me to 
smile anyway.  There was always that balance that not everyone 
has, but she did.  She was truly exceptional. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the members of my party, and of Canadians 
generally, I would like to thank her for everything she did for 
her constituents and for all Canadians. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to tell members that in many ways Canada is a better 
place because Shaughnessy Cohen has been with us.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is with a heavy heart that I rise to pay tribute to 
Shaughnessy Cohen whose tragic death last night has shaken us 
all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In politics partisanship often clouds what is truly important in 
life.  Shaughnessy's tragic death puts everything we do in 
perspective.  On behalf of the official opposition I extend my 
heartfelt condolences to her very many friends and family, 
especially to her husband Jerome and her stepdaughter Dena. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Words are little consolation at a sorrowful time like this and 
expressions of friendship from colleagues will just begin to fill 
the very large void left in so many hearts.  Permit me to share 
my feelings today, if only to tell Canada who it lost last night. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I liked Shaughnessy's style. I liked her energy. I admired her 
tenacity.  I respected her forceful advocacy for the causes she 
believed in and the constituents she represented.  I also 
appreciated her kindness and wonderful sense of humour.  That was 
the amazing thing about this woman from Windsor.  She was a 
seemingly impossible combination of vigorous partisanship and of 
open minded friendship.  Those of us on this side of the House 
should know because we have been on the receiving end of both. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will never be another quite like her.  Shaughnessy led a 
life of public service.  She was a crown prosecutor for years and 
brought her love of justice to parliament in 1993.  Later she 
became chair of the justice committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although we were from different parties, Shaughnessy earned a 
lot of respect from this side of the aisle.  I remember meeting 
with her privately to talk about victims rights, an issue she 
helped champion through the justice committee.  I knew then this 
was a woman who put solving problems ahead of raw partisanship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also witnessed firsthand how she put people first.  When one 
of our MPs was down on his luck and when others would have kept 
their distance from him, Shaughnessy sat with him and spent time 
with him, quietly demonstrating her kindness and compassion in 
his hour of need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She had a sharp mind.  All who had the good fortune to meet her 
quickly sensed that.  She chaired the justice committee with a 
healthy dose of humour and in a manner that always treated 
witnesses with respect and dignity.  She made them feel 
comfortable and she made us feel comfortable too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She came by her public mindedness naturally.  Her parents worked 
for their local community, founding a school, volunteering at a 
food bank and passing on to Shaughnessy a deep commitment to help 
others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my wish that Shaughnessy's spirit, her tenacious 
commitment to her constituents and her keen sense of fun will 
remain in this place for a long time to come.  We will truly miss 
Shaughnessy Cohen.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday, December 9, our colleague Shaughnessy Cohen collapsed 
here in the House.  Strongly committed to democratic values and 
deeply involved in the community, she had devoted herself to 
serving her constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Windsor—St. Clair is no longer with us, leaving 
behind a family, a profession and, I happen to know, a party 
that she loved.

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ms. Cohen was born in London, Ontario, on February 11, 1948. 
After graduating from the University of Windsor with a BA in 
English studies in 1969, she obtained an MA in sociology from 
the same university in 1973, followed by a law degree in 1977. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From 1971 to 1974, she taught at the St. Clair College of 
Applied Arts and Technology.  From 1979 to 1993, she practised 
law, concentrating on criminal and labour law, and served as an 
assistant crown prosecutor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She had represented the riding of Windsor—St. Clair since first 
being elected in 1993, and had chaired the Standing Committee on 
Justice and Human Rights since 1996. 
She was also well known as co-chair of the Liberal Party's caucus 
committee on gun control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having had the privilege of working closely with Ms. Cohen on 
the standing committee on justice, I can easily imagine how 
deeply her loss will be felt by the Liberal caucus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although we did not always see things the same way, I always 
respected Shaughnessy for her sense of professionalism and, 
above all, her passion for the law and for justice.  There were 
many areas in which we shared the same ideals and values.  Once 
again, although we did not always see eye to eye, we had great 
respect for each other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to offer my deepest condolences personally and on behalf 
of the Bloc Quebecois to her husband Jerome and her daughter 
Dena. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe strongly that it is by keeping someone's memory alive 
that we push back the boundaries of death.  Those who had the 
honour of knowing you, Shaughnessy, will remember you as a woman 
of your word, and as a woman of action.  Émile Henriot put it 
well when he wrote:  “It is my firm belief that the dead live on 
in the memories of those they leave behind.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will not forget you, Shaughnessy.  Thank you, Shaughnessy, 
for your time with us and your highly regarded devotion to your 
work. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK6"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
with very great sadness that I rise in this House today to pay 
tribute to our dear friend, our dear departed colleague, 
Shaughnessy Cohen, and to express our heartfelt condolences to 
her husband Jerry, to her daughter Dena and to her dear, dear 
friends who are really part of her extended family, for this very 
great loss. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one ever loved life more than Shaughnessy Cohen.  Few people 
ever loved politics as much as Shaughnessy Cohen.  And no 
politician has ever been more universally loved by her peers than 
the hon. member for Windsor—St. Clair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When my caucus colleagues gathered this morning, one of them 
described the feeling that I know is widely shared at hearing the 
news of Shaughnessy's passing, that of being totally shattered. 
I think that expresses how we all feel from all corners of this 
House.  A sense of great loss fills our hearts today and fills 
these halls today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Prime Minister has said, this was a woman who represented 
the very best of what politics is about.  She had a deep concern 
for people.  She was a fierce partisan.  The Prime Minister said 
that sometimes she was very partisan.  Shaughnessy was always 
partisan in the best sense of the word.

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>She was someone who was willing to work very, very hard, who 
liked to play hard as well, and who had a wicked sense of humour. 
Shaughnessy saw the very best in people.  As a result of that she 
always brought the best out in people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did not have the opportunity of knowing Shaughnessy for a very 
long time, only in the 18 months that I have been in this House, 
but those who worked with her over a longer period of time came 
to appreciate the magic of Shaughnessy Cohen's approach to 
politics.  She was indeed a fierce partisan, but she always 
respected her political foes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She talked recently about how much she appreciated the 
contributions to the justice committee made by various members. 
She actually singled out members of each of the parties to say 
how much she appreciated their contributions, including the 
member for Wild Rose.  Not all of us would say that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Shaughnessy loved the law.  She loved the practice of law.  For 
her what the law was about was the pursuit of justice.  That is 
why she fought so fiercely for the rights of those who were not 
being fully respected.  Some will remember that in her fierce 
pursuit of justice on behalf of gay and lesbian people she could 
even tell an affectionate joke now and then about her colleague 
Roseanne Skoke. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everybody talks about Shaughnessy Cohen's stories.  I had an 
opportunity this morning to speak with Mary Clancy, who was a 
dear, dear friend of Shaughnessy and one who really thinks of 
herself as a sister.  I said to Mary “If you had an opportunity 
today to tell some of Shaughnessy's stories, what would you 
say?”  Mary said “Most of them are not repeatable, at least not 
here in this House, at least not on this day”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But I think Mary spoke for all of us when she said “Shaughnessy 
was the most joyous human being that I have ever known”.  That 
is why she is going to be greatly missed in this place.  It is 
hard to imagine the depth of the grief and the shock that is felt 
by her family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The greatest tribute that we could pay to Shaughnessy Cohen is 
to learn the lesson that we are in this place to serve our 
constituents.  We are here because we are driven by a common 
purpose of trying to build a better society.  She will be greatly 
missed, but her lessons will not be missed on us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of my colleagues, I want to express my deepest 
condolences to her family and to this great family of her friends 
and colleagues. 
<P><A NAME="LINK7"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today with a tear in my eye, as there are many tears in the eyes 
of our colleagues in the House of Commons.  We have lost a 
wonderful, wonderful Canadian today.  I look over and see the 
flowers that are in her seat and on her desk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Shaughnessy had a sense of humour.  When I was here in 1993 
there were just two in my party at that time.  I sat up in the 
corner and she used to encourage me to stay.  She would joke with 
me when I was on the elevator with her.  Her friend Mary Clancy 
did the same.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say to her husband, to her daughter and to her family, 
thank you for sharing her with us.  Tremendous sacrifices are 
made by families, and people across this country do not realize 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She loved justice.  She had a friend in my colleague here, 
Peter.  They would joke back and forth.  One day she ran over and 
asked “Where do you buy your sweaters, Elsie?  I want a sweater 
just like yours”.  A couple of weeks ago she came in with a 
sweater and asked “Is it as nice as yours, Elsie?”  I said 
“I'm not quite sure, darlin'; it's on a Liberal”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, I have to say that she was partisan, but she was a 
wonderful person.  We were fortunate to have her here.  She loved 
justice.  She just loved being the chair of that committee.  She 
loved all of us here in this House of Commons.  It is truly a 
great loss for the people of Windsor, but it is also a great loss 
for us because she was different.  She was different from some of 
us who are here today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of all of my colleagues, I say to her husband, 
daughter and family, thank you very much for sharing her with us. 
You are in our prayers and she is in our prayers.  You will 
continue to be in our prayers from here on out.  On behalf of my 
colleagues, our condolences to all of you.  Thank you for sharing 
Shaughnessy with us. 
<P><A NAME="LINK8"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I address my few remarks to 
Shaughnessy's family and friends, and to my colleagues in the 
House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Prime Minister said, we are a family.  Just as 
Shaughnessy was part of your family, she was part of ours in this 
House and part of the larger Canadian family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was an umpire in Welland where I grew up and played 
baseball.  His name was Frank Chase.  He was hard of hearing. He 
had a hearing aid.  Every time something went wrong in a game and 
everyone started yelling at old Frank, he would turn off his 
hearing aid.  I think of him sometimes when I am in this House. I 
do not want to wear a hearing aid, but if I had one I would have 
turned it off quite a few times when I heard what Shaughnessy was 
saying down at the other end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Shaughnessy loved the House.  She loved being here.  She loved 
the give and take of Parliament.  She loved the institution.  She 
was a partisan, with no apologies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, she always held me in awe and she always feared me. 
That is why on Wednesday of last week she waved to me from just 
behind the chair over there.  When I came out she grabbed me by 
the arm.  As I said, she always feared me.  She said “Listen 
here, Gib, you have to do something to make sure that the House 
doesn't get out of control”.  I said “Shaughnessy, you could

I did not think we would do petitions today, but I have a number 
of petitions from Canadians who were concerned about the 
multilateral agreement that was being negotiated at the OECD. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure these petitioners welcome the collapse of the talks on 
the MAI.  They are nevertheless concerned that the government 
continues to pursue MAI-like agreements.  They therefore call 
upon parliament to reject the current framework of MAI 
negotiations and instruct the government to seek an entirely 
different agreement by which the world might achieve a rules 
based global trading regime that protects workers, the 
environment and the ability of governments to act in the public 
interest.
