<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL—SPEAKER'S RULING 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK3"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I am now ready to render a ruling on the 
matters raised by the hon. member for Sarnia—Lambton on October 
7, 1997 and by the hon. member for Prince George—Peace River on 
October 2, 1997.  These matters concern the delivery of 
legislative counsel services to all private members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to thank other members who also made comments on this 
question. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following the earlier submission made by the hon. member for 
Prince George—Peace River, I suggested that he speak with his 
representative on the Board of Internal Economy, since 
administrative matters of this sort come under its 
responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When dealing with similar questions, my predecessors have 
repeatedly indicated that these should be brought to the 
attention of the Board of Internal Economy and should not be 
raised on the floor of the House as a point of order nor as a 
question of privilege.

<A HREF="#LINKT1"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although presented as a question of privilege, the matters 
raised by the hon. member for Sarnia—Lambton involve, in my view, 
basic administrative issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Speaker Sauvé indicated in two rulings on December 15, 1982, 
complaints or grievances dealing with the delivery of services by 
the legislative counsel, and in particular the drafting of 
private members' public bills, do not constitute the basis for a 
question of privilege but are, indeed, questions concerning the 
services of the House. I refer hon. members to the <I>Debates</I> 
of December 5, 1982, pages 21603 to 21605. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must therefore rule that the matters raised by the hon. member 
for Sarnia—Lambton do not deal with privileges of members or of 
the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, I wish to reassure hon. members that the matter 
will be revisited by the Board of Internal Economy.  As a 
governing body of the House of Commons, the Board of Internal 
Economy has a long statutory history, originating in 1868. 
Initially composed of five members, its powers were essentially 
the same as they are today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1985, however, in order to meet members' demands for 
opposition and backbench representation from that body, the 
membership of the board was increased to nine members.  The 
intent of this recommendation was to enable private members to 
have “an effective voice in the decisions governing the 
management of the House”. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the fact that only four of the nine members are from the 
backbenches, their opinions and input are crucial, as the 
practice of the board is to arrive at its decisions by consensus. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me now refer to the power and authority of the board as 
provided in section 52.3 of the Parliament of Canada Act: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Board shall act on all financial and administrative 
matters respecting 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(a) the House of Commons, its premises, its services and its 
staff; and 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b) the members of the House of Commons. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, the Board of Internal Economy is entrusted with 
specific administrative oversight functions such as the delivery 
of legislative counsel services to members. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand the concerns of members in respect of the 
legislative counsel services privided to them by the House.  As 
your Speaker and also Chair of the Board of Internal Economy, I 
would like to take this occasion to briefly comment further on 
this matter. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The board reviewed this matter in the last Parliament when it 
established a subcommittee to consider proposed options and 
alternatives for the delivery of legislative counsel services to 
House committees and to private members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the time, the subcommittee considered many related issues 
which are still relevant today and which make this matter more 
complex than simply throwing more resources at it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is, for instance, the matter of what exactly is the proper 
function of legislative counsel, whether in respect of private 
members' public bills or government bills at committee or at 
report stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On some occasions, counsel, who are House staff responsible to 
the Speaker, are asked to play the role of advocate in the sense 
of explaining and defending private members' legislative 
initiatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the practice of legislative counsel giving 
priority on a first come, first serve basis which is sometimes 
challenged by caucus and legislative priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, there is the fact that over half the private members' 
bills drafted in the last Parliament were never introduced in the 
House by private members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As your Speaker I have taken to heart the concerns expressed by 
members regarding these services.  In my capacity as chair of the 
Board of Internal Economy, I have already asked the board to 
conduct a review of these issues as it is the body designated to, 
by statute, act on all financial and administrative matters of 
the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore invite members to submit their concerns directly to 
the board. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank you for allowing me to clarify the Chair's position on 
this very important matter.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Comuzzi (Thunder Bay—Nipigon, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, pursuant to Standing Order 34, I have the honour to 
present, in both official languages, the report of the Canadian 
delegation to the 38th annual meeting of the Canada-United States 
interparliamentary group which was held in Sydney, Nova Scotia 
and Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island from September 11 to 
September 15 of this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The meetings, like previous ones, outline the close personal and 
interpersonal relations between Canada and the United States. 
While we do not always agree on all aspects of this issue, we had 
the opportunity to honestly exchange viewpoints and information 
in a friendly manner showing the mutual respect that each country 
has for one another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the historic fortress of Louisburg we dealt with many 
important issues.  Trade and economic matters, global peace and 
security and transport are questions that affect the billion 
dollars worth of trade a day going across our borders. We have 
not been able to directly resolve some of these important issues 
but we had the opportunity of putting forward in the strongest 
terms Canada's position as we approach the millennium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately the Pacific salmon dispute tainted the tremendous 
relationship that exists between the province of British 
Columbia, indeed all Canadians, and in particular the states of 
Washington, Alaska and Oregon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this in mind it was the consensus of all those attending, 
the Senate from the United States, the House of Representatives 
and members of Canadian Parliament, that they should convene a 
meeting on the west coast to deal with those issues that are 
supportive of the friendly relations that exist between the two 
countries.  We will pursue that and advise the House accordingly 
as we proceed down that path.

in the line of duty.

</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  I am honoured today to have the privilege of moving 
the very first motion of the Progressive Conservative caucus in 
this House on an opposition day on an issue that requires urgent 
attention, given recent events. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also remind the Chair that only a few days ago we 
pressed the Chair for an emergency debate, given the last set of 
events.  We were unsuccessful in obtaining that debate, but we 
are using the very first opportunity available to us to put this 
matter before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The crisis in the fishery on the east coast and on the west 
coast did not happen overnight.  It is important, as we begin 
this debate, if we are going to have any intelligent discussion 
about its future, to recognize that the issues are complex. The 
issues we are dealing with today have developed over many years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the answers were easy, frankly, we would have solved a number 
of problems.  In all honesty, we all have to recognize that the 
problems are not easy to solve.  Governments, both provincial and 
federal, have grappled with these issues, with success in some 
cases.  However we must recognize today, having done our best in 
some circumstances, nonetheless we are faced with a real crisis 
on both coasts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fishing industry affects the communities, the men, the women 
and a lot of rural areas across this country. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not one region of the country is unaffected by this issue, by 
this crisis in the fisheries, whether they be in the Atlantic 
provinces, on the coast, in Gaspé, or in Ontario or some other 
place where they are directly or indirectly connected to the 
industry.  I scarcely need to point out that the entire Canadian 
population is affected. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to refer to the crisis in the salmon industry in 
British Columbia.  That industry employs thousands of hard 
working men and women.  The salmon industry accounts for about 
30% of the total wholesale value of the west coast fishing 
industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year in B.C. was the lowest year in 36 years of commercial 
fleet revenues, totalling less than half the average of the 
1990s.  That in itself tells a story. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Poor resource management tops the list of reasons for the 
decline.  Other factors that have brought the west coast salmon 
fishing industry to its knees include habitat destruction, 
changes in the ocean's climate—a complex issue which also 
affects the east coast—poaching, overfishing, new technology and 
overcapacity in the industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of overcapacity is not new.  For a number of years 
various commissions of inquiry have studied the issue.  Task 
forces, one after another, have all commented on the very 
important problem of overcapitalization within the commercial 
salmon fleet and have recommended that the number of vessels be 
significantly reduced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Among those within the B.C. industry, there is widespread 
recognition of the necessity to reduce the fleet.  Less obvious 
is the question of the best way to make it happen.  What is 
apparent is that the approach taken by the Liberal government to 
date has not worked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the spring of last year the federal government unveiled its 
Pacific salmon revitalization plan and presented it as a panacea 
for the problems in the B.C. fishing industry.  It was called the 
Mifflin plan.  It called for a speedy reduction of about 50% of 
the capacity of the commercial salmon fleet.  Single-gear ships 
and area licensing would be implemented, as well as license 
stacking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people who knew the industry at the time, it needs to be 
said, told the government that this plan would not work, that the 
plan was flawed.  The people who support their families through 
their hard work and earn their living through this industry in 
rural communities along the coast of British Columbia were the 
ones who spoke up.  They told the government that this plan was a 
mistake.  They told the government that the management strategy 
had to be longer term, that the pace of fleet reduction must be 
within the industry's capacity to absorb, and most of all it must 
be within the capacity of individual communities and families to 
absorb these very important changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I regret to say that the government did not listen.  What we got 
was the typical Ottawa knows best and “We are on the eve of an 
election campaign and we have to move”.  The Liberal government 
chose to move ahead with its plan.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Guess what happened.  People were right.  Strong opposition to 
the Mifflin plan expressed valid fears that it would wipe out 
smaller fishers and home fleets in the coastal communities, 
concentrating the industry and fishing in larger boats in urban 
areas.  In too many cases that is exactly what has happened as 
people have been thrown out of work and communities have been 
crippled by the implementation of this plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only that, but from the point of view of resource 
sustainability that must be the cornerstone of anything we 
undertake.  In fact this is the very essence of the motion we 
have put before the House today.  From the perspective of how we 
will maintain and manage this resource, this plan is a dismal 
failure.  While it sought reduction to the actual number of boats 
there was no component to address total fishing effort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has it meant?  It has meant that fewer boats are taking the 
same amount of salmon out of the water.  The result is that we 
now have zero salmon stock conservation benefits.  That is the 
net effect of the Mifflin plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government has demonstrated a fondness about talking 
or doing some consultation in this area.  A good example of it is 
that most of the consultation including some announced recently 
has not come before the implementation of the plan but after the 
implementation of the plan.  Quite a consultation it will be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having inflicted this mess on the men and women of British 
Columbia and the salmon fishery over the course of the 1996 
fishing season, the government now apparently scratches its head, 
shrugs and decides that maybe it is time that it actually talk to 
the people concerned and affected by the changes.  Together with 
the provincial government they have formed a three member panel 
to study the effects of the Mifflin plan, study the damages they 
have inflicted on the people of British Columbia, to find out 
just how badly thought out it was. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sorry to report, without having the benefit of 
consultation, that what we know from the implementation of the 
plan is that some of the damage now incurred in these communities 
may very well be irrevocable.  Many have already been forced out 
of the industry and those who remain have borrowed hundreds of 
thousands of dollars to stack licences.  Now that they have 
borrowed the money and have not been able to generate the revenue 
to pay off the loan they are stuck.  They are stuck in the plan. 
They cannot walk away from it.  They cannot walk away from their 
commitments.  They cannot walk away from their licences.  They 
are struck within the whole framework. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me refer to the Liberal record on managing the Pacific 
fishery documented in the 1996 report for the B.C. Job Protection 
Commission.  The imposition of an ill-conceived Mifflin plan on 
top of what was already a poor salmon season last year resulted 
in the loss of 7,800 direct jobs.  If we apply the multiplier it 
means almost 20,000 jobs have been lost.  That is the net result. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The impact of job losses, it needs to be stated, was felt the 
most in isolated communities, predominantly native communities 
with few alternatives of employment for the people in those 
communities.  They are the ones in British Columbia who are now 
suffering the most from the plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One such community is Masset, British Columbia, home of about 
1,500 people on the Queen Charlotte Island.  It is just one rural 
place where as a direct result of the government's fisheries 
mismanagement the local fish processing plant closed down and 
left people without work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I quote from a letter from someone who lives in that community, 
a women who said: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—Fisheries and Oceans Canada seems to be slowly and 
systematically reallocating the catch away from the traditional 
commercial fishing sector, upon which our small community relies. 
I would add that the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans has seen 
fit to send a letter to the Sports Fishing Institute of B.C. 
indicating that the recreational fishermen can expect an 
allocation of chinook salmon in 1997.  There has been no 
indication of any allocation to the traditional commercial 
sector. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the sector most affected.  Would this be what the 
government considers leadership in managing our fisheries?  If 
the Liberals think that responsible public policies means taking 
shots at the little guy and if success is choking off the 
viability of rural communities along the coast of British 
Columbia, I am sorry to report today that the Liberal government 
would have succeeded.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the longest period the east coast has been dramatically 
affected by this issue.  There are very grave problems in the 
policies of the government with regard to the east coast fishery. 
We have had a lot of pronouncements, posturing, endless study and 
so-called initiatives, but it all speaks to the broader issue of 
the management of the fishery on the east coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the reasons we chose to raise the issue as a caucus in 
the House of Commons today is that the auditor general spoke on 
it so vividly in the report produced only a few days ago.  In 
particular he spoke about the management of the TAGS program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general is a servant of the House.  He does not 
report to any particular department in government.  He does not 
report to cabinet.  He reports to us, Mr. Speaker: to you, to me 
and to members of the House.  The auditor general is at arm's 
length from the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He offered a very vivid report in which he said there was no 
management plan for the fishery.  In the context of TAGS he 
pointed to it as being the major flaw which explains the dismal 
failure of the TAGS program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout most of the Atlantic region cod stocks are at 
historic low levels.  Debate continues about the contributing 
factors.  There are many, as I said earlier in my remarks.  It 
would be nice if we could say in this debate what is precisely 
wrong.  I would like to be able to say that, or that one 
government decision was wrong over 30 years.  If we were able to 
do that I would feel better.  Why?  Then we could fix the problem 
overnight.  We could actually do what we are all here to do and 
help the people involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether it is the inshore fishers, offshore fleets, cold water 
temperature, size of quota, size of mesh, age of fish harvested, 
availability of food, the seal population, accessibility or 
reliable scientific debate, all these things affect the decisions 
we make.  We are all prepared to acknowledge that the collapse of 
major stocks in the Atlantic ground fishery is a complex problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As with any complicated question it may be understandable that 
the solutions are not necessarily easy.  The point of the debate 
today is to look to the future and the men and women who are in 
the industry now.  What is inexcusable and unforgivable is that 
there is not a plan for the future.  There is not an exercise of 
leadership on the government side that offers hope with regard to 
what must be done for the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The crisis in fishery management has been devastating for the 
communities and the families on the east coast.  Literally 
hundreds of fishing communities have been seriously affected.  By 
1995 the groundfish fishery accounted for only 8% of the total 
catch, the value of landings on the Atlantic coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What answer was cooked up?  It was the TAGS program. That was 
the government's answer announced with a great deal of fanfare in 
1994.  A lot of key code words were in there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will quote some that were part of the plan.  It was to 
“provide an integrated approach to capacity reduction”.  It was 
to “call for partnerships with all stakeholders”.  It included 
“career planning and employment counselling” and “sustainable 
development in Canada's long term economic development”.  These 
words were associated with the $1.9 billion allocation of funds, 
with a view to retiring licences.  TAGS would have removed 
approximately 23% of the groundfish licences in place at that 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is much less than half the original target and will still 
leave 10,000 groundfish licences in place.  The TAGS component of 
the program directed at retiring licences has failed even though 
$1.9 billion has been put toward this effort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did the auditor general have to say about the government's 
success in achieving its objectives?  In his recent report he 
drew the following conclusion: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Groundfish harvesting capacity was not significantly reduced 
through TAGS measures.  Active labour adjustment measures were 
halted, and whether they actually contributed to reducing the 
number of persons dependent on the industry is not known.  Excess 
fishing capacity remains, and poses a major risk to the 
sustainability of the fishing industry.

someone in the Chamber, not by someone with any partisan axe to 
grind, not by someone involved in the industry, but by an officer 
of the House of Commons who reports independently to us and has 
at his disposal the tools to evaluate these programs.  He has 
indicted the government on TAGS for its failure to the men and 
women of Atlantic Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a program that will run out of money six months before 
it is scheduled to without any sense or any indication.  Every

that the government came forward with the TAGS program, said it 
would be a five year program and now is telling us that will be 
over in four years? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Their lives have been disrupted.  They have had to reorganize 
their families.  They try to plan for the future.  They planned 
for the next five years on the reasonable expectation that the 
government would meet its commitment.  Now they are told “Do you 
know what, Harry?  Do you know what, Bill?  Do you know what, 
Selma?  The program will end in four years and not five.  We are 
sorry.  You may have wanted to continue on to school but it is 
over.  We are the Government of Canada in Ottawa.  We know 
best”.  Tough luck is the message they are getting from the 
government.  It is a cruel message to people who are in a 
position where they are vulnerable, weak and in transition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Auditor General of Canada seems to see that and understand 
that but for some reason the government does not seem to hear the 
message.  That is not new.  Maybe we should not be surprised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from the riding of Saint John, New Brunswick, 
fought very hard for good reason in the House of Commons when the 
employment insurance legislation was brought in.  The legislation 
had hidden behind it a reduction of $33 million in benefits to 
the fishers in Atlantic Canada through a regulation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Saint John, who is with me today in the House of 
Commons—I remember it well—had me sign a petition so there 
could be debate on the regulation, not change it but debate it. 
She went to the Liberal caucus.  There were 31 members of the 
Liberal caucus from Atlantic Canada out of 32.  She asked them not 
to change the regulation but to sign a petition so we could 
debate it in the House of Commons and Canadians could hear what 
we had to say.  Not one member would sign the petition.  This was 
over and above everything else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, if we are to be successful in dealing with the issue we 
have to press the government, the House and all political parties 
to look to the future and move to a plan based on maintaining 
resource conservation, which has to be the cornerstone.  Canada 
is a resource based economy whether it is the fishing industry, 
the forestry industry, the mining industry, the agriculture 
industry, the energy industry, hydrocarbons or hydroelectric 
energy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those who understand our economy would know that maintaining 
these resources on a sustainable basis is key to our future 
economic success and the success of our children.  The same is 
true for the fishing industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government needs to answer the cry of Canadians who want to 
know what exactly it intends to do so that they can move ahead 
and allow the industry to survive in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I followed with great interest the debate of the government on 
the Pacific salmon treaty signed in 1985.  Certainly from my own 
experience I freely offer some advice to the government today.  I 
do not know whether it will be followed.  I refer to an issue I 
dealt with in the 1990s when I was minister of the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With my colleague at the time, the minister of fisheries, we 
fought hard in the international community to get an 
international convention on overfishing at the summit in Rio de 
Janiero on the environment and the economy.  We were successful. 
We did it in only six months.  But we were successful for a 
reason.  We pressed every cabinet member to raise the issue with 
other governments at the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see that my time is running out.  There will be further 
opportunity to add some comments in the question and comment 
period.  I look forward to that.  I look forward to the next few 
minutes and in the day of debate today to offering some ideas 
from our caucus on how the issue must move forward and how we can 
help Canadians on the east and west coasts to regain propriety of 
their communities, their pride, the opportunity to work and the 
opportunity to make their contributions to Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
this motion certainly is a very straightforward motion.  I have 
not conversed with my colleague the fisheries critic so I am not 
sure where we are coming from but from my perspective, I think it 
is a good motion.  That is not the point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point is that this leader has a tremendous amount of gall. 
This leader was in government.  He just finished saying he was in 
government as the environment minister working with John Crosbie 
who at the time was the fisheries minister. What was going on was 
that the fisheries science was being completely swept aside. Just 
take a look at the political interest from a Conservative 
perspective on that day in 1990. The problem has been created by 
successive Liberal and Conservative governments.  It has never 
been more true that Liberal, Tory, same old story when it comes 
to fisheries issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it absolutely amazing that this leader would stand up and 
make this kind of speech when it was he, his department and his 
party that actually were the major contributors to the problem in 
the first place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where the Reform Party is coming from on this issue is we 
respect the perspective of the people of the Atlantic and the 
people of the Pacific.  The people in the area should have had 
the input.  The people in the area who know what is going on 
should have had the input but they did not have an opportunity. 
It was centralized.  It was drawn into Ottawa.  The bureaucracy 
made the decision and it was at the time when the Progressive 
Conservative Party was in power that the issue absolutely peaked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask this leader, how in the world he can stand up in this 
House condemning the Liberals as they should be condemned when in 
fact it was his policies that in the first place created this 
mess. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jean J. Charest:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the 
member for Kootenay—Columbia for announcing that the Reform 
Party will support our motion.  I sincerely appreciate that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to regret that he gets up and makes my point about one of 
the problems we have in this place.  He started by saying he did 
not know how they would vote on it.  He lives in British 
Columbia.  This is a motion that is tabled today and he does not 
know how his party will pronounce. He is from British Columbia 
and he does not know what his critic's position is on this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One would think that being from British Columbia where this is 
one of the main issues discussed over the last few months the 
member for Kootenay—Columbia would have a position.  I am 
disappointed he does not. I imagine his constituents will be 
equally disappointed that he did not take the time to make out 
his position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we got instead, I do not want to comment on it.  We have 
heard it a thousand times.  It is the grandstanding.  Notice the 
style, pointing the finger and saying it is the Tories' fault or 
the Liberals' fault. I can only imagine that the people who are 
affected by all these decisions today cannot be feeling very 
good.  I do not understand what that does for them.  For any 
unemployed British Columbian today, the member has offered zero 
in terms of any kind of hope for the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead, I would like to speak of what I would like to see the 
government do, contrary maybe to their approach.  Who knows, 
maybe the Reformers during the day will give us come concrete 
ideas of what the future should be about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, in the case of the Pacific salmon fishery, what I think 
is important is that the government and the Prime Minister give 
very real instructions, strict instructions to his ministers to 
raise this issue at every opportunity with their American 
counterparts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was Minister of the Environment, every time we met with a 
minister of another government we systematically, no matter what 
the issue was, no matter what the responsibility of the minister 
may have been, whether it was trade or transport, would raise the 
issue with our counterpart of the other country. Why?  Because we 
wanted to drive home the point that this was a very important 
issue for Canada.  By forcing that issue and by raising it at 
every opportunity we were successful in doing exactly that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the government today to make a commitment to do 
that and to have every minister of the crown opposite raise the 
issue with every American counterpart.  No matter what the 
circumstance or the issue of the day is they should take that 
opportunity to raise the issue. 
That would be the first thing to do.  In other words keep the 
issue on the table. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1050"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT10"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second is the matter of the treaty.  This is a treaty which our 
government signed in 1985.  No treaties are perfect. The member 
was alluding to what had been done.  In 1985 the government of 
the day was able to secure this treaty.  In the years that 
followed there was a management plan.  It has only been in the 
last four years that there has not been a management plan. That 
is even more important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The principle of equity that is found within the treaty is 
extremely important.  We need to secure that principle, to press 
it.  We need to keep it front and centre in everything we do to 
ensure that as we move forward with our American counterparts 
that the principle of equity will be front and centre with 
respect to any agreements we make in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third thing we need and which is sorely lacking is an 
industrial adjustment strategy.  I regret that the hon. member 
for Kootenay—Columbia did not speak about that because it 
actually affects the people of British Columbia.  What about the 
men and women who do not care about Liberal, Tory, same old 
story, and the huff and puff of the House of Commons?  They have 
kids in school.  They have bills to pay.  They would like some 
help. This government should have an adjustment strategy which 
would allow them to make the transition into new jobs and give 
them some training.  Some money should be put toward that end. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK43"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia—Matane, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened carefully to the words of the hon. member for Sherbrooke. 
It is true that he is not all that bothered because things did not 
go any better for the fishers of Gaspé when his party was in power. 
The fishers tell us now it was a fiasco.  It started in their time 
but it seems that the hon. member is repenting a bit, and that is 
all for the better.  He wants to help the government, but he ought 
to have helped his own at that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I, however, agree with him on two points.  When he says 
decisions are made in Ottawa, that is true.  In my former riding we 
had the Institut Maurice-Lamontagne, whose opinion is respected 
throughout the world. 
Its highly competent researchers have carried out studies in the 
Gaspé, the St. Lawrence, the Atlantic Ocean.  The federal public 
servants have now come up with another study, and of course the 
study by the federal public servants takes precedence over the one 
by our own public servants, who are independent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask my colleague from Sherbrooke what he himself would 
do, if he were the government, for these little fishers in Gaspé 
who will go on unemployment this winter, if they have enough 
“stamps”. Yet these fishers are hard-working and want to work but, 
because of their profession—nearly all the cod quotas have been 
cut—they end up with nothing, or next to nothing.  What would he 
do? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jean J. Charest:</B> Mr. Speaker, I travelled extensively in the 
Gaspé area. Actually, I worked very closely with someone he knows well 
and a very respected person in the Gaspé, namely Dr. Charles-Eugène 
Marin, a former member for Gaspé. I can see the hon. member nodding his 
head in agreement. I think that Dr. Marin has made extraordinary efforts 
for fishers in the Gaspé. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that one of the changes made and imposed by the federal 
government that have affected them the most and hurt them the most—and 
I am sure my hon. colleague will agree with me on that—is the 
unemployment insurance reform, including the fact that their benefits 
were cut by $33 million. That is what I was talking about earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague, the hon. member for Saint John, New Brunswick, 
circulated a petition asking that a debate be held in this place on this 
issue. 
I think that approximately 40 signatures were needed. She was unable to 
get a single member of the Liberal Party of Canada from the Atlantic 
region to sign. This explains in part this government's arrogance and 
contempt for these men and women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seasonal workers depend not only on fisheries but also on forestry. 
Let us not forget the Eastern Plan, which was important to our region as 
it created jobs. Forestry is also important in the Gaspé region.

<A HREF="#LINKT11"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government may cut left and right but try as it might, 
it cannot cut seasons. They can certainly not make winter disappear and 
privatize seasons in Canada. And unless they can cut one season, we will 
continue to live in a seasonal economy where these needs must be 
recognized. Our party, which, I hope, will form the next government, is 
committed to ensuring through the employment insurance legislation that 
these realities are recognized so that these people can earn an honest 
living. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will finish with a little word of poetry.  There is no 
position coming from the Reform Party.  I will quote for 
Reformers the official position of their party in regard to the 
fishery.  This is a direct quote from their leader in response to 
a question about TAGS.  He repeatedly said that displaced 
fishermen and their families in the TAGS program were receiving 
“the last big social megaproject engineering thing to come out 
of Ottawa”. I quote the Leader of the Opposition's plan for the 
future of the resource,  “All you can do is say it is over”. 
There is the plan of the Reform Party for the fishery of Canada. 
<P><A NAME="LINK44"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to see 
that the leader of the fifth party has recognized this serious 
crisis did not happen overnight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We on this side of the House welcome this debate which will 
allow us to put on the record the many ways we are moving as a 
government to address this crisis. The member for Sherbrooke 
criticized that there is not a plan for the future.  Nothing 
could be further from the truth.  We will show today where we are 
at in moving forward with a plan for the future to protect the 
resources and to protect the communities and the fisheries. As 
members opposite try to do in question period, I will put a few 
things in perspective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As has been indicated this issue did not happen overnight. Where 
was the member for Sherbrooke in 1984 when the collapse of the 
groundfish stocks really took place? Where was he when the former 
fisheries ministers in the Mulroney government basically ignored 
the scientific reports of the day? The individual who just spoke, 
the leader of the fifth party, is none other than the same 
individual who served as the Minister of the Environment in the 
Mulroney government while foreign fleets were allowed to destroy 
the northern cod and the Grand Banks stocks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We took on that issue when we formed the government in the last 
term. We challenged the issue and got some agreement.  We are 
doing what we can with what is left.  It is hard to conserve a 
stock that has been left in the kind of condition that the 
previous government left it in, but as a government we are 
showing every day that we are willing to take up that challenge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mover of the motion, the leader of the fifth party, is the 
very same individual who outlined under the so-called Charest 
platform a plan that would make the Department of Fisheries and 
Oceans disappear.  Under the Charest platform the Department of 
Fisheries and Oceans would disappear and would be lumped into a 
department of sustainable development with several other 
departments.  The voice for the fisheries at the cabinet table 
would disappear along with it.  That is the kind of background 
the individual comes from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current minister has been speaking out at cabinet, standing 
up for fisheries issues across the country and around the world. 
The minister has made it very clear that the objective of the 
Government of Canada is the conservation and protection of 
Canada's fisheries resource and the achievement of a sustainable 
fishery and fishing industry, building a future for our resources 
and our people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know the outlook for the next two years will prove to be very 
challenging but we are moving forward. 
This will involve several role changes for stakeholders for the 
delivery and funding of programs.  Contrary to what the leader of 
the fifth party states, we have identified several priorities to 
advance industry and program renewal.  One such area is fisheries 
management itself. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1100"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT13"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT13"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1100

<A HREF="#LINKT12"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are moving forward on the implementation for the renewal of 
the fishing industry, the necessary reform of the government in 
Canada's fisheries management programs and achieving fundamental 
changes in relationships with fisheries and other client groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are rapidly moving ahead with the establishment of integrated 
fisheries management plans for all the major and most sensitive 
fisheries and eventually extending this approach to all fishers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are developing with stakeholders in individual fisheries 
additional co-operative management arrangements which will form 
the basis for future partnering agreements.  We are establishing 
other institutional mechanisms which will establish arm's length 
licence sanction tribunals for the decriminalization of many 
fisher violations and allow greater responsibility in 
allocation and management of decision making. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another priority is Atlantic reform.  On the domestic front 
industry restructuring has been initiated to build a fishery that 
is ecologically sustainable and commercially viable.  The long 
term strategy for change is based on establishing a balance 
between resource supply and industry capacity, including a 
smaller more self-reliant industry, a core of professional full 
time fishers, controlled access to the resource and a 
co-operative management approach between government and industry 
for management of the fisheries resource. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also moving forward in Pacific reform, another area that 
the leader of the fifth party mentioned.  Like the Atlantic, 
Pacific stock conservation is a growing public concern. 
Allocation conflict prevails and the economic viability of the 
salmon fishery has been jeopardized by cyclical declines in 
abundance, by low market prices and high fishing costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following much consultation and independent review, 
recommendations have been produced on intersectoral salmon 
allocations involving the commercial, recreational and aboriginal 
sectors.  Decisions on these recommendations will be required and 
are likely to be contentious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reforms designed to reduce capacity and participation and 
promote economic and ecological sustainability have been 
implemented.  However, we recognize that these changes have been 
and will continue to be controversial.  Staying the course on 
industry reform will be a continuing challenge but the minister 
and this government are certainly up to that challenge, as we 
have already shown. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The recently signed Canada-B.C. fisheries agreement on federal 
and provincial roles and responsibilities in the management of 
the west coast salmon fishery has major implications on the way 
the government of Canada will carry out its salmon conservation 
and fisheries management mandate in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The challenge will be to find ways to cultivate constructive 
provincial involvement in departmental programs and processes 
through such institutional mechanisms as the new council of 
ministers, the Pacific fisheries resource conservation council, 
which will be in place for 1998, the Pacific stock assessment 
review committee and the proposed licensing and allocations 
board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Arctic fisheries are also a priority of this government.  These 
fisheries play an integral role in the lives of northern 
Canadians.  Harvesting of fish and marine mammals provides a 
considerable portion of the food requirements and one of the few 
sources of income and employment in northern communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pressure on Arctic fishery resources is increasing because of 
rapid human population growth and because protein, 
self-sufficiency and fishery development especially off Baffin 
Island are priorities of aboriginal groups and the territorial 
government. The focus of fishery management will continue to be 
on conservation for sustainable utilization through close 
co-operation with the legislative co-management boards.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Jointly, the government of Canada and the boards will establish 
fishery co-operative management plans and will fulfill their 
responsibilities under these plans.  The negotiation and expected 
settlement of additional land claims would produce the formation 
of other co-operative management boards with fisheries management 
responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a growing global concern about the health of oceans and 
the sustainability of the world's fishery stocks.  Governments 
around the world are being increasingly challenged to demonstrate 
that their fisheries, as well as those managed through 
international arrangements, are environmentally sustainable. 
Working in partnership with the fishing industries we will move 
forward in those areas of creating international agreements to 
benefit Canada and the fisheries resource around the world.  We 
are showing leadership in dealing with difficult choices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to propose an amendment.  I move:

tired when I am in the House of Commons and listen to members 
turning around and always talking about the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have people who are hurting today.  I cannot help what 
happened in the past.  I want to change things around today for 
the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had fishermen in my area come in to see me on Monday this 
week.  One man sat there with tears in his eyes. He had his wife 
with him.  They said: “We were loosing everything. We have lost 
our home and we are loosing the boat.  We have no way to earn our 
living anymore”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say to the hon. member from P.E.I. that I realize that 
he has fishermen in P.E.I. as well, but we want to know why the 
playing field is not equal.  The people in my area, district 36, 
earn only $17,000.  That is it. Yet in district 35 they earn 
$50,000 because they have a longer period of time for lobster 
fishing.  The people in the other districts have longer periods. 
All they are asking is that DFO please treat them fairly.  Will 
it please look at it, change it around?  They want their dignity. 
I am sure that the hon. member from P.E.I. wants them to have 
their dignity as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am so tired that every time it gets up in the House the 
opposition talks of the past.  Let us deal with the present and 
the future.

straighten this matter out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter:</B>  Mr. Speaker, one of the reasons I 
mentioned the past is so we do not continue to make those 
mistakes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We recognize there is an over harvesting capacity.  We have to 
reduce that capacity.  The government is trying not to do what 
was done in the past, which was to ignore the scientific advice, 
continue harvesting and let people believe the resources were 
endless and abundant.  We know they are not.

being a waste of money.  It was no such thing.  Yes, it may have

are stuck paying for it, the same fishermen seeing cuts 
everywhere. Licences have been increased by 1000% which again is 
an attack on fishermen.  Conservation does not exist when it 
comes to fishing.  Fishermen are now speaking on lobster because 
the cod is gone.  They are now speaking out about the 
conservation of lobster, but no one is listening. There are no 
consultations. The EI program is attacking the fishermen. If this 
is called continued planning, I would not want them to admit they 
were planning something. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can they explain cutting off all funds to the wharfs, some 
of which are closing because people cannot afford them?  There is 
only so much volunteer work that can be done.  People have no 
money to give.  How are they going to make sure that the lobster 
will still be there?  People in Ottawa love to eat lobster, but 
the way our seasonal industry is being attacked they will not be 
there in five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the member please explain to me how they are going to make 
sure our fishing industry will survive all this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I cannot imagine the 
member saying there is no consultation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fisheries resource conservation council and the Department 
of Fisheries and Oceans through its personnel hold all kinds of 
consultations with people in fishing communities.  We are taking 
those recommendations of the fisheries resource conservation 
council seriously.  We are looking at the stocks and trying to 
move forward in a way which will conserve and build those stocks 
so that they are sustainable in the future for the fishers and 
the fishing communities. We are working in partnership with 
fishermen for the future.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to speak on the motion of the hon. member 
for Sherbrooke. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member's motion refers to the urgent need for action to 
address the serious problems in Canadian fisheries on the Pacific 
and Atlantic coasts.  Fishermen on the east coast say they 
identified the problems to the government of the day in the early 
1980s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member from Sherbrooke assumes in his motion that there 
are no problems in Canada's third commercial fishery located 
inland.  I will return to this fishery in a moment, but first let 
me make an observation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my 50 years of living on the prairies I have seen so many 
times occasions when the previous Progressive Conservative 
governments and the previous and current Liberal governments 
ignored the aspirations and problems of the citizens living in 
northwest Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and the 
Northwest Territories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been many acts, errors and omissions by both these 
governments over the years, like the goods and services tax, the 
firearms act, the reduction in health care transfer payments, and 
I could go on and on.

<A HREF="#LINKT15"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point is that once again in dealing with the problems in 
Canada's fisheries, the hon. member and leader of the Progressive 
Conservative Party, which aspires to become a national party, has 
ignored important parts of Canada. The parts of Canada I 
previously referred to I would like to name again because some 
members in this House seem to forget they are part of Canada 
also. They are northwest Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta 
and the Northwest Territories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do these Canadians have to do with commercial fishing, many 
are possibly wondering.  Would it surprise anyone in this House 
to know that there is a multimillion dollar freshwater fishery in 
these areas sometimes referred to by politicians from central 
Canada as the hinterlands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the Reform Party recognize that when national problems are 
addressed, such as the Canadian fishery, we should always 
consider all of the problems along with solutions for all of the 
Canadian people affected. This freshwater fishery has problems 
and it is just as important that they are addressed along with 
those on the Pacific and Atlantic coasts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to point out to members of this House and to the 
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans that he is responsible for the 
Freshwater Fish Marketing Corporation which has its headquarters 
in Winnipeg, Manitoba.  It also has its fish plant located there. 
It is from these facilities that tens of millions of dollars of 
fish products are shipped across Canada and exported to places 
like Europe and the U.S.A. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will get to the problems in this fishery in a moment, however 
due to the apparent lack of knowledge or lack of concern by the 
hon. member for Sherbrooke and possibly others in the House, I 
feel it necessary to describe this fishery, the people, the 
employment it creates and the hardships that will ensue if our 
problems are not dealt with as part of an overall solution to the 
problems identified in the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The commercial fishermen who sell their fish through the FFMC 
include both aboriginal and non-aboriginal men and women.  To 
many of the aboriginal fishermen there is little or no 
alternative to fishing as a way to be self-sustaining 
contributors to Canadian society. Would the government or the 
leader of the Progressive Conservatives have them go on welfare 
because there is no employment as a result of failing to deal 
with problems in the FFMC? For those with the possibility of 
other employment, why should they lose their business and way of 
life just because their problems are not being addressed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would now like to discuss the problems.  I assure members I 
will relate how the fishermen's problems in the FFMC district are 
caused by the Liberal government and by motions that if supported 
by this House do not take into account the Canadian national 
fishery big picture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The FFMC fishermen have problems with high water levels in many 
of our lakes and spawning streams reducing the number of fish. 
High input costs for items like fuel, boats, electronics, 
marketing and processing the catch are of great concern.  There 
are concerns with high taxes, high employment insurance premiums, 
reduced employment insurance benefits and many others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One could argue that some of the problems are the responsibility 
of the provinces, such as in Manitoba where our major lake water 
levels are subject to control by Manitoba Hydro for 
hydroelectricity production. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The major threat to the inland fishery at this time involves the 
blatant, outrageous, pork-barrelling patronage appointment of all 
time in Manitoba.  I refer to the announcement of the hon. 
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans on October 16, 1997 that 
ex-Liberal member of Parliament Ron Fewchuk has been appointed 
president of the Freshwater Fish Marketing Corporation effective 
November 28, 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all remember that Ron Fewchuk was elected in 1993 and when 
the 1997 election was imminent, he declined to contest the 
Liberal nomination.  The major portion of his old riding was 
Selkirk—Interlake where Jon Gerrard ran unsuccessfully. What did 
it take to get him not to run?  I think we all know now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This patronage appointment will have an immense negative impact 
on the profitability of the FFMC because, in essence, the FFMC 
will now be paying two president equivalent salaries, one to the 
former president, Thomas Dunn who I understand is staying on at 
his president's salary, and one to the new president. 
The salary range is from $88,000 to $103,000.  Remember that the 
FFMC gets no government moneys.  Therefore, as the actions of 
this government drive up FFMC administrative costs, the lowly 
fishermen will make less if any profit.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Dunn, an accountant and FFMC president for many years, saved 
the corporation from bankruptcy and was an outstanding president. 
Why did Mr. Fewchuk have to be appointed?  Sadly the only 
conclusion I can come to, and I am sure a majority of Canadians 
across this great country will do likewise, is Liberal patronage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have spoken to members of the elected board of the FFMC and to 
fishermen, all of whom oppose Fewchuk's appointment because they 
have no faith in his capabilities to run the day to day operation 
that management of the FFMC requires. This kind of administration 
and policy making is a big reason why there are few fish on the 
east coast and the B.C. and FFMC fisheries are under financial 
threat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the major problem in the Canadian fisheries 
today, as it has been under successive Liberal governments, is 
the total ineptness of the ministers of fisheries and oceans. We 
must take action now to ensure the survival of the remaining 
fisheries and restore the east coast fishery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister can take an important first step by rescinding the 
appointment of Ron Fewchuk and restore Mr. Dunn to the 
presidency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I move: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the amendment be amended by deleting the words “continue 
the implementation of” and substituting the following therefor: 
“implement”. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The Chair has very great reservations 
about the admissibility of this amendment.  It appears that the 
subamendment appears to change the intent of the amendment back 
to what the motion originally stated.  Accordingly, since it 
appears to be contrary to what the amendment intended to do, I 
must rule the subamendment out of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Elk Island may have a submission on the 
point before I make a final ruling and I will hear him. 
<P><A NAME="LINK49"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a 
point of distress to us that when a member of the opposition puts 
forward a motion of the day, as the Conservatives have done 
today, the government can hijack the purpose of that motion that 
we are debating by basically negating it.  We have had such 
absurd cases where the government has actually moved an amendment 
as to say “delete all the words after the word `that' and 
substitute therefor”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to Beauchesne's citation 567, “the object of an 
amendment”—and this would certainly apply to a 
subamendment—“may be either to modify a question in such a way 
as to increase its acceptability—to the House”. I am just 
citing parts of it.  What we are doing here is we are talking 
about increasing the acceptability of this particular motion to 
the House, the government's amendment having hijacked the thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I hear what the hon. member is 
saying, but I think the point is that when the government or any 
member moves an amendment to a motion, its admissibility is 
determined on the basis of whether it is acceptable as an 
amendment to the motion.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am suggesting to the hon. member is that the subamendment 
negates the original amendment's intent, which was to change the 
first motion.  I appreciate the fact that the hon. member may 
disagree with the amendment.  I do not think that is the point in 
issue.  The question is can a subamendment change an amendment by 
in effect negating the amendment.  I suggest that it cannot. 
Therefore, I must rule it out of order. 
<P><A NAME="LINK50"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo—Chilcotin, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, before you make your final ruling, may I ask you, sir, 
if the intent of the amendment to the amendment is any different 
than that of the amendment to the original motion, it does change 
the character of the motion, but that was also the position of 
the government in the amendment which it brought to the original 
motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask you to consider that, sir. 
<P><A NAME="LINK51"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  With great respect, I have 
considered the matter.  My recollection is that the original 
motion said that the government should establish something and 
the amendment said that it should continue the implementation of 
something. That is a change from the original motion.  It is a 
change which in the Chair's view is in order because any member 
is entitled to move an amendment that changes what is alleged to 
be a statement of fact in the first motion and turn it into 
something else.  It did that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The subamendment sought to move that back in effect to the 
original position.  That is what is out of order.  That is what I 
am ruling out of order.  I think we should move on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There may be questions or comments on the speech of the hon.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  If the hon. member is rising on the 
same point of order, I have heard him once and I have heard the 
hon. member for Cariboo—Chilcotin.  I am not disposed to hear 
more argument on this point.  If it is a different point I will 
hear him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is clearly additional and 
relevant information and it was just pointed out to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Citation 923 deals specifically with allotted days.  Citation 
923(3) states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Opposition prerogative is very broad in the use of the 
allotted day and ought not to be interfered with except on the 
clearest and most certain procedural grounds.

</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we are seeking to undo what the government has done 
in violation of this principle of Beauchesne. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I hear the hon. member for Elk 
Island.  I want to stress to him that in making a ruling in 
respect of an amendment or subamendment, the Chair is bound to 
have regard to what has previously transpired. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When an amendment is moved, the amendment must be to the main 
motion.  It is constrained.  It can only seek to amend the main 
motion.  A subamendment must amend only the amendment.  That fact 
restricts the scope for amendment on a subamendment because it 
must follow in as part of the amendment itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case the subamendment is negating the amendment.  The 
amendment is not negating the main motion.  Accordingly— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> [<I>Inaudible</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> That is a matter for interpretation by

deals with freshwater marketing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Being from that part of the country, I know that the appointment 
which has been announced and has not yet been tabled in the House 
has created great consternation among many of the people involved 
in the fishery.  I wonder if the member would like to elaborate

by the people and how widespread those concerns are about this 
appointment.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for 
his question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Problems have arisen out of this appointment.  I refer to a 
comment made by the hon. member for Malpeque who stated that 
bread and butter on the table was the important part for 
fishermen.  Mr. Fewchuk will be receiving a president's salary. 
Mr. Dunn will not work for less than the salary he was already 
receiving, no no doubt in the hundred thousand dollar range.  We 
will have the FFMC, an unsubsidized corporation, paying two 
salaries out of the profits of fishermen on the lake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These fishermen are not wealthy by any means.  Native fishermen 
on the lake have no alternative employment.  The problems we are 
talking about transfer to their families.  It is actually a 
matter of sustenance and living an acceptable lifestyle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, there are also political 
levels and other jurisdictions than fishermen that are expressing 
great concern over the appointment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not sure how free the hon. member is to elaborate on this 
point, but we do not have the full breadth of concern about the 
issue or what a terrible precedent it sets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison:</B>  A precedent in this government? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan:</B>  It is only a precedent for the FFMC.  We 
have certainly seen it in most other aspects of patronage 
emanating from this administration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the FFMC board is 
compromised of an appointed president and four appointed members 
by the government, along with five elected members by fishermen. 
These elected members and fishermen in the boats are coming to me 
expressing concern about the appointment and the qualifications 
of the appointee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Problems have been brought to the attention of the provincial 
government of Manitoba.  I understand one of its minister has 
been in contact with the federal fisheries minister.  I have not 
spoken to the provincial minister, but it is my understanding 
that he too is expressing concern about the appointment and the 
negative impact it will have on the management of the 
corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could end up in a situation with two presidents in effect 
arguing with each other.  Being a smaller fishery there is not 
the money for the kind of waste that will be created by the 
appointment.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les 
Basques, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to speak to the opposition 
motion on the lamentable failure of the federal groundfish strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take the liberty of pointing out that this is nothing new for me. 
A few years ago I wrote a document on the fact that eastern Quebec was 
the laboratory for the failure of federalism and the symbol of the 
results of the inefficient intervention of the federal government and 
other levels of government. 
I feel today that I am living a similar nightmare, since now all of the 
Atlantic provinces and the entire eastern region of Quebec and the North 
Shore are in the same situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion asks us to “recognize the urgent need for action to 
address the serious problems in Canadian fisheries” and also criticizes 
the lack of a national policy. I think everyone is quite aware of this, 
and the amendment proposed by the Liberal majority is totally 
unacceptable. They want us to say that the government will maintain the 
same approach.

<A HREF="#LINKT19"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This reminds me of the time when Réal Caouette, the Créditiste 
leader, said that we were on the edge of a precipice and that the 
Créditistes would move us forward. The Liberals have much the same 
attitude today. The auditor general himself and not the opposition said 
that the Atlantic groundfish strategy was poorly designed and poorly 
managed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general added that there had been a kerfuffle between 
the Department of Fisheries and Oceans and the Department of Human 
Resources Development, a lack of rigour on the part of the departments 
involved and a poor estimate of most of the parameters used in 
developing the program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, the government struck out on all fronts. 
It did not properly assess the number of people that would be covered by 
the plan and then it did not ensure compliance with the criteria that 
were set. A lot of clarification is needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general was doing his job when he said that the program 
that had been defined had not been followed. Instead of acknowledging 
this, the Liberals accused the auditor general of being inhuman, because 
the program had provided subsistence for the people of the region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is that the government is not there to provide a 
subsistence living for people, but to ensure that economic development 
allows the regions to become self-sufficient. When a program that 
changes and diversifies regional economies is set up, it must be 
followed through and the desired results obtained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the program became a means of survival, it is not the fault of 
the communities in Atlantic Canada, eastern Quebec or Quebec's North 
Shore region. It is the government's fault. The auditor general is 
condemning the fact that the program was not properly managed and does 
not achieve the desired results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After several years of involvement in a critical sector for which 
it is responsible under the Constitution, the federal government has 
failed miserably. All that is left is what I saw in Gander, 
Newfoundland, when the human resources development committee travelled 
to that region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I expected to find in employment centres documentation on how to 
develop our economy or how to exploit our local assets. I did not see 
any of that. 
What I found in the display stand of the employment centre was a nice 
prospectus explaining how to find a job in western Canada. This, I 
think, accurately illustrates the current problem in Canada. The 
government has been using a strategy whereby people are expected to go 
where the jobs are, instead of promoting local opportunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should be noted that at the end of the 19th century and at the 
beginning of the 20th century, eastern Canada, and particularly the 
maritimes, was totally self-sufficient from an economic point of view. 
The region was then producing what it needed, and was playing an active 
role in North America's economy. However, the federal government, 
particularly during the Trudeau era, came up with a terrible deal for 
the country: to concentrate production and processing activities in 
Ontario and give transfer payments to eastern Canada and Quebec. 
For 20 years they have been telling us:  “Federalism works very 
well.  We give just as much money to the poorer provinces, and it 
comes from the rich provinces”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What most people, including senior federal officials, have not 
understood, is that people do not want subsistence policies.  Of 
course, they want to survive, be able to eat three meals a day, 
have their children attend school, but what they want most of all 
is programs that will make it possible to create strong regional 
economies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the auditor general is telling us is that, in order to 
improve matters in the fishery, steps should have been taken to 
reduce the number of people involved in this sector and to assign 
them to other functions, so as to diversify regional 
entrepreneurship.  Today we are looking at a terrible failure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that both government members and the public will 
understand the difference in the present situation.  There is no 
point in criticizing the auditor general for having done his job. 
There is no point in blaming local communities and citizens who are 
trying to survive.  What we must do in the present situation is ask 
ourselves whether the federal government handled the fisheries 
issue properly.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that the answer is a resounding “no” on every count. 
I would go so far as to say that one of the fundamental reasons for 
this state of affairs is that, for some time now, the federal 
government has managed the fisheries from Ottawa, rather than from 
the regions by means of a truly decentralized approach directed at 
the regions' individual needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For eastern Quebec, the Gaspé, the North Shore, and the 
Magdalen Islands, fishing is very important.  It represents a 
relative percentage of the Quebec economy as a whole, but for the 
regions, it is very important. 
What is required is a targeted approach, unlike the approach that 
might work for the other Atlantic provinces or the western 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has never managed to achieve this 
degree of fine-tuning.  If ever there were to be a so-called 
national fisheries strategy in Canada, the first component would 
have to be complete decentralization to the provinces, who want to 
assume responsibility for this sector in order to avoid results 
like those we are now seeing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Three years ago, people noticed that there were no longer any 
fish in the Atlantic.  Since then, the government has told fishers 
they should find something else to do and promote entrepreneurship. 
But three years have gone by and nothing has been done.  There is 
no evidence today that the result will be a transformation of 
regional economies.  The only result we see is that the subsistence 
program will have to be extended.  People cannot be allowed to 
starve to death. 
We will, however, also have to make sure that things are back under 
control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are faced with an example very much like what happened in 
the 1980s, which led to a ghastly deficit.  Today, in the fisheries 
sector we are faced with the same failure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe it is important for the House to understand clearly 
that, all partisan politics aside, there are some interesting 
elements in the motion, statements which must be taken into 
consideration, but what is the most important is that the amendment 
proposed by the Liberals must absolutely not be accepted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals are asking us to continue along the same path, 
while the auditor general has just said that the entire strategy 
was badly thought out and badly administered.  They tell us that 
the financial support ought to represent 36% of the budget over 
five years, while the auditor general indicates that it will 
represent close to 76%. 
Do you think their evaluation was wrong? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last federal election sent a message.  Some regions of 
Canada sent a clear message to the government.  I believe it ought 
to assume the responsible attitude of accepting major changes in 
its approach, and particularly ought to give local communities the 
necessary tools for development instead of sticking to the 
principle of providing mere subsistence to regions that may 
experience regional economic development problems.  They must be 
given all of the tools they need to develop, instead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government cannot use the Conservative government 
as an excuse. 
They have been in power for three and a half years, soon coming up 
to four, and I believe they must be judged severely.  The 
population of the Atlantic provinces has judged them, and the 
government must acknowledge this. The Atlantic Groundfish Strategy 
is the symbol par excellence of this at the present time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that the government's amendment will not gain the 
support of the Liberal MPs for the maritimes, for if it does they 
will be contradicting themselves.  They have already done so on 
employment insurance reform, and we have seen the results of that 
in the last election.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I take issue with 
some of the remarks of the hon. member.  He is trying to leave 
the impression that the federal government believe subsistence is 
sufficient for fishing communities in the province he comes from. 
Nothing could be further from the truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the number of programs that he talked about in 
terms of the Atlantic groundfish strategy and the partnership 
agreements we are moving forward with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He sat on the committee in the last parliament where we ensured 
there would be employment insurance for communities in seasonal 
industries to protect the livelihoods of those people in the off 
seasons. 
So we are moving forward.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The member basically made allegations that we are not taking the 
region into consideration. The minister of fisheries held a 
bilateral meeting with his Quebec counterpart to discuss a number 
of issues of concern to Quebec on October 5 and 6. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that meeting there was an agreement on the importance of 
quickly passing a modernized fisheries act which will deal with 
these fishers and communities that are affected. There was an 
agreement on the need for the federal minister to consult with 
provincial and territorial colleagues prior to the introduction 
of the legislation. That will happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was an agreement to reconvene the meeting of ministers in 
six months time to review progress. There was also agreement with 
the Quebec minister to support the need for an ocean strategy. 
There is all kinds of discussion.  It shows that federalism is 
working and that we have a strong national government in 
consultation with the various provincial ministers, recognizing 
the concerns of the regions and the concerns of communities and 
coming up with the appropriate policies to address them. We are 
on track for the future. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased by the question of my 
colleague opposite and I will let the people judge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He says we are accusing the government of failing to allow local 
communities to develop. I would remind him of certain things, however. 
In Quebec alone, the situation affects 4,000 people. Problems with 
funding shortened the program by a year so the $1.9 billion budget would 
not be exceeded. So, because money has not been spent in the right 
place, it will be available for less time.  It was used for subsistence, 
but regional economies were not allowed to develop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then a serious error was made. The Canada manpower adjustment 
program was cut by $190 million. 
It was decided that there was not enough money for it and that the money 
would be given to people daily in order to keep them alive. In the case 
of young men and women who completed two or three years of high school 
and signed up for fishing or took related courses, it was decided that 
they would not complete their training, that they would not be given any 
option and that their entrepreneurial skills would not be developed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why people find that the Liberals' amendment proposing to 
continue this policy is not a very good idea. The Liberals should at 
least acknowledge that errors were made and that significant corrections 
are necessary. However, the amendment proposed is to carry on as before. 
This means that they will continue to spend money on people's 
subsistence, that regional economies will not be developed and that 
things will go unchanged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The licence retirement program was even cut to $30 million instead 
of $135 million. Under the policy, $135 million had been set aside to 
retire licences so that people could find other work. This amount was 
reduced to $30 million, and now nobody wants to give up their licence. 
A person keeps it, it is not usable and they subsist off the plan. This 
strikes me as a poor show. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all these reasons, therefore, I am asking people to judge 
whether it has been effective, and if it is relevant, as the government 
is saying, to continue the policy as it stands. I think the answer is 
right there for all to see. A change in direction is absolutely vital. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec had an administrative agreement with the federal government 
from 1922 and to sometime in the 1980s. This agreement provided for 
reasonable management. A certain fishing practice had been developed so 
that, for example, costal fishers with small boats would have a big 
enough catch. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government cancelled the agreement with the provincial 
government, and I close on this point, at the very time it was 
discovered that the fish had disappeared. That fact is very clear. The 
federal government's action in recent years has been totally 
ineffective, and Parliament should never support this amendment, which 
would just have things go on as before.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Eastern Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, thank you for the opportunity to speak on the 
Conservative motion.  When I saw the motion from the leader of 
the Conservative Party I was very impressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is obvious that my role in Parliament to work with other 
political parties to come up with political solutions to grave 
problems is working.  I commend the leader of the Conservative 
Party and his caucus for the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time it is reprehensible that the Liberal government 
would try to amend the motion to satisfy its own needs.  It is 
simply scandalous that it would try to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must say to the Conservative Party that I only wish that when 
its leader was in government for the nine years it had developed 
some kind of national policy back then.  We might not be in the 
state we are in today.  That is old history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a new government that has been in power for over four 
years.  I believe that it has to answer to the 20,000 fishers and 
their families in Atlantic Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish the motion had also included not only the west coast but 
the Arctic and the inland fisheries as well.  These are serious 
problems which we have and they intend to be ignored in the 
proper debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support the national fisheries policy as long as the policy 
recognizes that harvesting the resource can only be sustainable 
through the use of small boat inshore fishers and not through the 
corporate trollers, and as long as there is an independent 
judicial inquiry into the Department of Fisheries and Oceans and 
its policies and practices in Atlantic Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason I have been so adamant in calling for a judicial 
inquiry is that science has been literally ignored.  There is 
evidence galore throughout history, at least since 1983 that I am 
aware of, that science has been ignored, ripped up and altered to 
satisfy the needs of the government of the day.  Only through a 
judicial inquiry will the scientists from the Atlantic and west 
coasts be allowed to speak freely without the fear of job 
retribution or so-called gag orders which they are under right 
now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe that the current management of the DFO has the 
intelligence and capability of instituting a national policy 
unless we have a judicial inquiry to find out exactly where 
things went wrong.  I do not believe, according to the Minister 
of Fisheries and Oceans, that it would a waste of time and money. 
I firmly believe that a judicial inquiry would go a long way in 
solving the problems of the current fisheries crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding the auditor general's report.  He went a long way on 
the fiscal side of the TAGS program but he unfortunately left out 
the humane aspects of it.  This is most unfortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look at Newfoundland. When it joined Confederation in 1949, 
unknown to it it also transferred its entire responsibility of 
the fishing industry, which survived well over 400 years, to the 
government of the day. In less than 50 years it is completely 
destroyed.  This is completely unacceptable to the people in 
Newfoundland as well as the rest of Atlantic Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the typical thing.  This is why the west coast is so upset 
now.  We have central Canadian views being forced on those in the 
west and those in the east.  It simply does not work anymore. 
What needs to happen is complete consultation with the people 
within the industry; not just select groups that the government 
of the day chooses to speak to, but the people who work the 
resource in the small communities throughout Atlantic Canada and 
the west coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why I have constantly asked for the inquiry.  I would 
hope that in my constant asking for it more groups will join and 
ask for it as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A report commissioned by the fisheries department director of 
Newfoundland stated that department scientists were routinely 
silenced while ill informed spokespersons conveyed false 
information to the public by inflating stock estimates to defend 
high quotas and by emphasizing the role of seals and cold water 
in the cod collapse instead of overfishing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could give example after example of what has been going on 
with these people.  What has happened now is that 35,000 Atlantic 
Canadians are literally out of work and on an income support 
program.  I find it reprehensible that the government would 
promise in 1994 the TAGS program for five years; not four but 
five.  There are many thousands of people who made their 
financial commitments based on the fact that the TAGS program 
would run out in May of 1999, not May of 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In question period and in other areas I have been given the 
answer that the government has consulted people within the 
industry to say “yes, we are the ones who consulted the cabinet 
to make the decision to cut the program from five to four 
years”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can hardly stand in this House of Commons and honestly believe 
that the government would go to fishers in Atlantic Canada and 
say “would you like your income support dropped off by a year?” 
and getting an overwhelming yes to that response.  I find it very 
difficult if that happens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, an inquiry of that nature would get down to the truth, to 
exactly what happened and who cut that program off.  I am of the 
firm belief that the finance department made that decision, not 
the fishers of Atlantic Canada and of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We go on and on with this.  It gets almost to the sound of a 
broken record.  This government does not have the capability of 
instituting a national policy on its own. It must institute a 
national policy with comprehensive consultation with not only the 
fishing groups but other political parties as well.  Only then 
will we have the solutions to a long term sustainable fishery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I honestly believe that there are many thousands of people 
fishing in the industry who can still be fishing 10 years from 
now if we just come up with a comprehensive plan in order for 
them to do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members know, if people go out to the outlying areas of 
Canada and speak to the fishermen and fisher women of Atlantic 
Canada and the west coast, fishing is in their blood. In most 
cases many of these people are under educated in terms of 
academics.  What they know is fishing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we are in the government, in the House of Commons, saying 
to many of them they will no longer be able to have that way of 
life.  To me it is completely unacceptable to say that to them 
because it is not the fault of the fishermen and fisher women of 
Atlantic Canada for the collapse of the ground stock. It is 
government policy.  It is mislead information from the 
scientists, overcapacity by the huge trawlers that are out there 
now.  We have trawlers out there now that are still dumping 
by-catch.  We still have fish being dumped over the side as we 
speak today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have Cuban trawlers inside the 200 mile limit fishing our 
stock, but we have fishermen and fisher women sitting at home 
collecting TAGS program.  It is simply unacceptable that we would 
do that.  I would love the government to be able to respond to 
that at a later time, during question period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One fisherman from the Sambro area who had a grade 5 education 
said to me “Peter, it is like this.  You can have one fisherman 
making $200,000 a year or you can have seven of us making $30,000 
a year.  Make your choice”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the choice is quite clear, to be able to put as many of 
these people back into the fishing industry which they so desire. I 
am not saying that every single person will get back into the 
fishing industry. Obviously there has to be reallocation of some 
of these folks to other areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That can be done through an attrition process, through either 
retirement of the licences when they reach the ages of 50 or 55, 
retiring these people completely so that they can retire with 
dignity and with respect, as well as going out of the ITQ 
systems, the corporate individual transfer quotas, and move back 
to the way it used to be on a community based allocation.  I 
believe that would be a firm response and a positive method on 
the way to go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I again compliment the leader of the Conservative Party for his 
motion.  I can assure him that the New Democratic Party caucus 
will be supporting him in every way we can. 
<P><A NAME="LINK56"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (Charlotte, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, it is 
certainly nice to see you in the chair.  I think this is the 
first time I have had the opportunity to speak while you are in 
the chair.  I want to make a few comments, most of them with regard 
to the fishing industry in my riding of Charlotte.  Of course, that 
is the one I am concerned about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What really appalls me are the licensing fees and the changes 
this government has brought in in the last number of years. There 
are lobster fishermen in my riding whose licensing fees have gone 
from $17 to $3,000 in a single year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How could any fisherman in any jurisdiction in any country in 
this hemisphere survive those kinds of charges?  Nobody can.  It 
is forcing individual fishermen out of the business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have done the same thing with our scallop fishermen.  Small 
fishermen now are being required in the riding of Charlotte to 
put monitors on board. 
In some cases it costs up to $350 a day to put a monitor on board 
just so matters can be checked.  It is like the big eye of 
government looking down on a small fishermen who can hardly 
afford to put fuel in his boat.

<A HREF="#LINKT24"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most discouraging thing is that the laws, the rules and the 
regulations for these fishermen are applied differently, 
depending on what side of the bay they live on.  Some of the 
restrictions do not apply to fishermen, for example, that are 
lucky enough to live in some parts of Nova Scotia.  It is 
ridiculous.  I have no quarrel with fishermen in Nova Scotia, but 
if the government is going to apply a policy to fishermen it 
should be applied evenly across the board. The government is 
putting fishermen in my riding at a tremendous disadvantage to 
people 40 miles across the water. It is absolutely insane. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same applies to wharves and the reconstruction of wharves. 
New Brunswick does not have enough money in the budget, for 
goodness sakes, to buy 50 pounds of spikes for the number of 
wharves that are in the riding.  This is absolutely ridiculous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We pretend we have a multimillion dollar fishery, and we do, but 
how can fishermen survive? The government is actually forcing 
fishermen who are making the meagrest of all livings, to take 
money out of their back pocket at the end of the day to repair 
the very wharves for which the Government of Canada should be 
responsible.  How in the name of goodness can the fishermen, 
under those set of circumstances, survive?  The answer is very 
clear.  They cannot survive under those kinds of circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not the end of it.  The fisheries department entered 
into agreements with the Department of Indian and Northern 
Affairs to bring natives into the fishery, which is fine.  We 
want to see that happen.  However, there is no co-ordination 
between the two departments.  Neither department knows what is 
going on. They have no long term strategy.  Again, it is throwing 
money at a problem with no vision for the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People are at a tremendous disadvantage now because of that lack 
of co-ordination.  Fishermen in my riding are being sacrificed 
because neither of those two departments, fisheries nor Indian 
and northern affairs, want to take responsibility for their 
actions. We cannot continue.  The fisheries in Atlantic Canada 
are on the rails and this government wants to simply abdicate its 
responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This type of motion should be on the floor of the House every 
single day for the next year so that Canadians can get the 
message that the fisheries are in tough shape.  It is time that 
the government took responsibility for the very fishermen who it 
is supposed to be representing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer:</B>  Madam Speaker, again we can hear the 
frustration in the voice of the hon. member from the Conservative 
Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to advise him that this is the typical divide and 
conquer attitude that the current government is displaying with 
our fisher people in Atlantic Canada, not only between the 
fishers but as well as the First Nation fishers, not only between 
New Brunswick but also P.E.I., Nova Scotia and Newfoundland.  It 
is the old divide and conquer with its quota systems that do not 
work.  It is unfortunate because there is a lot of infighting 
among the fisheries.  I expressed the same frustration that the 
member is speaking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the last time I will call for this today because I am 
being cut off.  We have a judicial inquiry into the practices of 
DFO.  I think we can come to a reasonable solution and solve some 
problems in the Atlantic fishery. 
<P><A NAME="LINK57"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Matthews (Burin—St. George's, PC):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I will be sharing my time.  I guess there is not enough 
time today to talk about this motion and the situation in the 
fisheries on the west and east coasts of our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning I was at the parliamentary committee on fisheries 
and oceans listening to three inshore fishermen from Newfoundland 
and Labrador.  Yesterday I travelled to the riding of Burin—St. 
George's to two isolated communities, Burgeo and Ramea where the 
fish plants have been closed for approximately five years. 
I witnessed firsthand the frustration of the inshore fishermen 
this morning and of the people in those communities yesterday, 
whose futures are so uncertain.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Out migration is a terrible problem.  The youngest and brightest 
people who could be the most productive members of those 
communities are leaving.  People do not know if they will be able 
to keep the very social fabric of those communities together. 
Town councils are trying to run the municipalities with a 
shrinking tax base.  They do not know if they will be able to 
provide the services.  On and on the problem goes throughout 
Atlantic Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A parallel crisis is looming on the west coast with the Pacific 
salmon situation.  If government does not react very quickly it 
will have an identical situation on the west coast to what is now 
being experienced on the east coast. Somehow government likes to 
pretend things are going well, that it is making the right 
decisions.  There is no doubt in this case that it is the great 
pretender. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of people on the west coast of the country have already 
experienced bankruptcy or are about to experience bankruptcy 
because they cannot make a living from where they traditionally 
fish.  The Mifflin plan and other federal Liberal government 
plans have not worked in British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the last four years the government has failed to enter into 
a fish plan, agreement or arrangement with the U.S.  There is 
talk now that the U.S. may even abandon the treaty.  What will 
that do to salmon stocks on the west coast?  They will be 
obliterated, wiped out.  Yet the government seems to think 
everything is moving along okay, it has lots of time and the real 
enemies in this situation are British Columbians and Premier Glen 
Clark. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to this government and to the parliamentary secretary who 
sits there listening and taking his notes that they should 
pressure the minister of fisheries, pressure the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, pressure the Prime Minister to recognize this 
very serious crisis on the west coast before the government finds 
itself in the same situation we have with Atlantic Canada.  That 
is what I ask of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people are now starting to talk about the need for some 
kind of compensation and financial relief because they are losing 
their enterprises, because they cannot feed their families, 
because they are about to lose their homes.  It is just not good 
enough that this sort of situation is allowed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Solutions were suggested to the former minister of fisheries and 
to the current minister of fisheries who is from British 
Columbia.  Changes need to be made to the area licensing 
management plan off British Columbia.  It is too restrictive. 
Fishers cannot make a living under that system.  Why does 
government not look at the suggestions that have been made?  Why 
does it not consider these suggestions?  Why is it so stubborn? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals get so inwardly drawn and are so stubborn about 
issues that they will not listen to the people concerned, the 
real people affected.  The real people who understand the 
situation better than anyone else in this country and in this 
government are the fishers on the west and east coasts. These 
people know best.  These people have made their livings for 20 or 
30 years from those fisheries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government pretends it knows best.  It completely ignores 
the fishers.  No wonder the people in British Columbia say that 
the minister of fisheries is more interested in the steelhead 
than he is in the fishermen.  Maybe it is because he has a steel 
head.  Maybe it is because he is that hardheaded they compare him 
to a steelhead.  I do not know, but something has to happen and 
happen fast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know the situation on the east coast.  Our east coast is 
in crisis.  It is not only those people who have been TAGS 
recipients.  I want to say this today because I feel so strongly 
about it.  What we are trying to deal with in Atlantic Canada is 
not just for TAGS recipients but for the entire economy of 
Atlantic Canada.  It is for every retail business in Atlantic 
Canada, for every wholesale business in Atlantic Canada, for 
every car salesman, every clothing salesperson. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If something is not done in Atlantic Canada after May 1998, 
there will be a lot more out migration, many more jobs lost. That 
will happen if the government takes those millions of dollars out 
of Atlantic Canada. 
What choice is there?  The government is saying to them “Get out 
or go on welfare”.  That is the question the government has to 
answer.

regeneration of those fish stocks in certain areas, those same 
fisher people are being ignored and neglected again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those fisher people know better than the Minister of Fisheries 
and Oceans.  They know better than the officials in the 
Department of Fisheries and Oceans.  They know the real science. 
Why is the government not listening to them?  Because they 
believe there is a scheme to get rid of them; to get them out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to direct a comment to members of the Reform Party. 
They have to make up their minds whether they are an ally to 
Atlantic Canada or an enemy.  Every second day they change their 
message.  They have to make up their minds.  Do they believe 
there is a future for Atlantic Canada or do they believe that 
Canada should end at Ontario and go no farther east?  That is the 
choice they have to make. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an Atlantic Canadian member of Parliament, I find some of the 
statements which these people make revolting.  They do not 
understand the issues of Atlantic Canada.  How can they 
understand the issues of Atlantic Canada any more than I can 
understand the issues of the west? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, I feel today that I understand the problems 
and the issues in the Pacific salmon fishery better than they do. 
That is because I am sincerely interested in it.  I bring passion 
to the issue.  I am not here for the sake of talking about this 
issue, I want to talk about this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I grew up with this issue.  I have family in the industry.  I 
have friends in the industry.  I worked in the industry to help 
put myself through school.  It gets annoying when people who have 
no feeling for or understanding of Atlantic Canada make 
statements and try to influence the government of the day as to 
what it should do.  They try to influence the government as if 
they know what the solutions are for Atlantic Canada.  They do 
not have a clue what the solutions are for Atlantic Canada.  They 
really do not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sorry I have to stand here today to say this, but I could 
not live with myself if I did not say exactly what I am saying to 
them.  I hope that they come around and realize that this country 
is diverse and different.  We need special attention in Atlantic 
Canada, not because of a problem which we created, but because of 
mismanagement by successive governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to Reform members that if someone in the Progressive 
Conservative governments of the past made a mistake, so be it. 
It was a mistake.  It was wrong.  Just as it is a mistake and is 
wrong today.  Let us rise above that.  We could live in the past 
forever.  It is what will happen in Atlantic Canada after next 
May that I am worried about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Madam Speaker, I guess I have to sit down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  No, you don't.  You are sharing your time

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Matthews:</B>  Is that all right, Madam Speaker? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  We can go for 20 minutes, can't we? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  If the House agrees, 
I have no problem with it. Are we in agreement? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott:</B>   No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer:</B>  Let the man speak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Kilger:</B>  Madam Speaker, in the normal course the 
member can speak for the full 20 members, but he is splitting his 
time. But if they are not splitting their time and they want to 
somehow reconfigure their speeches to 20 minutes from 10, that 
would certainly meet with our approval.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>   Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Matthews:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank the members for 
their concurrence.  Now I have forgotten where I was.  I know 
where I am, but I have forgotten where I was. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  You are here in Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Matthews:</B>  Yes, I say to the hon. member from the 
Reform Party, I am here in Ottawa.  But my life is not dictated 
to by Ottawa, I say to him and others.  My life is dictated to by 
the people I was sent here to represent and they are in Atlantic 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there was a legitimate need in the west which there is in 
British Columbia, I can say to members I will stand here, 
highlight it and support it.  I will support the people of 
British Columbia because there is an identified problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I only ask that those immediately to my left would recognize and 
identify the legitimate problem in the east that was not created 
by the people in the east.  It was created by people who sat here 
in successive governments— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom:</B>  From the west? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Matthews:</B>  Yes, and people from the west who 
happened to be in the cabinet who did not know a fish from that 
mace— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott:</B>  How about John Crosbie, did he know 
anything? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Matthews:</B>  Yes he did and he still knows a lot. 
John Crosbie knows more than the whole 60 of them put together 
not only about fish but about anything else I say to hon. 
members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one thing I can stand in this House and say about John 
Crosbie.  I am not shy about defending John Crosbie.  John 
Crosbie would not expect me to stand here today and say that 
everything he did was right.  John Crosbie was always a man who 
if he made a mistake he admitted it.  The first clue to success 
and the first way to be successful is to recognize when one is 
wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I guess today we are asking the government to recognize that 
there are things that have been done wrong over the years which 
are really impacting upon our people today.  And TAGS is a part 
of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, TAGS was necessary.  If it was not for TAGS 
the Reform wish of Atlantic Canada disappearing may have already 
been realized.  I say that quite sincerely.  It may have already 
been over but the question is now what will come after TAGS. We 
are hearing many suggestions.  We are preoccupied with it these 
days in Atlantic Canada.  Many people there have very good 
suggestions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Mr. Harrigan and others go around this country I hope they 
talk to the people who are really involved in the industry, the 
people who have had to try to stay alive for the last four or 
five years on a meagre income.  There is a perception that has 
been portrayed throughout this country by certain groups that 
this has been a total waste and this dependence has to end.  I am 
sure people to my right know who I am talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people have been only kept alive. They have not been able 
to live in mansions.  They have not been able to drive new cars. 
They have not been able to pay for their children's tuition for 
post-secondary education.  They have only been kept alive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What was wrong is that successive governments of Canada 
mismanaged the fishery to a degree that those people could no 
longer earn a living from that resource, a common resource, a 
people's resource.  What was wrong with the government 
recognizing its mistakes and the problem it has created? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is wrong now when we ask as a party and other parties in 
this House ask for solutions to the problem and to help those 
people in Atlantic Canada after May 1998?  We must not forget 
that this program was designed to continue to May 1999. The 
federal government has cut a year off that program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why has there been a year cut off the program?  Because there 
were 52% more take up on the income support component than was 
anticipated.  I ask you, Madam Speaker, to think about that.  How 
could anyone underestimate by 52% the take up on income support 
of a program that followed NCARP, the previous program?  All the 
government had to do was transfer the files from NCARP to TAGS, 
from DFO to HRD but can you imagine that they underestimated the 
income support take up by 52%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So people wonder why I am here today and why I am so frustrated 
and why I behave and speak the way I do.  I want members to 
listen to this.  It is because my worst fear is that after NCARP 
and TAGS it is most conceivable that if there is something after 
TAGS, we could even make it worse.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There should be no lessons left to be learned about TAGS.  We 
should already know the answers, we should know what will follow. 
There are certain components that are going to be compulsory. 
There is going to have to be early retirement. There is going to 
have to be effective licence buy-out if we are going to reduce 
the harvesting capacity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans this time not to 
just buy the licence out from the fisher person and pay him the 
$100,000, $150,000 or $200,000 and allow his boat and gear to 
remain fishing.  If we are really sincere about reducing 
harvesting capacity, it should come out of the industry. That is 
where there has been a big failure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week when the House was not sitting, I met with fisher 
groups in two areas of my riding.  I say to the Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans and to members that today there are more 
people fishing in those areas, more boats, more vessels fishing 
than there were before the moratorium.  And there is a reflection 
cast upon Atlantic Canada and Atlantic Canadians that they seem 
to be the problem.  Can you blame us for wanting to make a 
living, for trying to stay alive? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government program has failed and I have to say to the 
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans since he is listening that this 
is a very complex problem that has taken a number of years to get 
to this point.  I have to very seriously question whether the 
Department of Fisheries and Oceans has the ability or the 
competence to straighten out the Atlantic fishing problems. I am 
not saying that just for the sake of saying it. But I question 
the department.  I have to ask if it is really capable of dealing 
with the complex problems in the east and the west.  I do not 
take great comfort that it has the ability to deal with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I guess I am running out of time but I want to repeat the 
problems in the west for the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.  I 
plead with the minister and the government to get more involved 
than they have already been in the Pacific salmon issue.  There 
is a direct parallel, an identical situation brewing in British 
Columbia as is now taking place in the east.  If the minister and 
the Prime Minister do not roll up their sleeves and get more 
involved in the issue, we will be here in the not too distant 
future talking about the Pacific salmon crisis and the people 
affected just as we are talking about Atlantic Canada and TAGS. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does no good just to pay lip service.  Why is the Prime 
Minister not more involved in the issue in the west?  Why is the 
federal government more preoccupied with attacking Premier Glen 
Clark?  Why have Glen Clark and British Columbians become the 
enemies?  The Americans, the Alaskans are the problem.  They are 
the ones who have consistently overfished. The Alaskans are still 
fishing at pre-1994 catch rates, yet the British Columbians are 
targeted as the bad guys. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to the minister that if he had gone to the troubled areas 
of British Columbia we would not have had that altercation with 
the blockade of the ferry.  If he had gone there and talked to 
those people, we would not have had the problem.  We would not 
have had the blockade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Norman Doyle:</B>   Why didn't he go? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Matthews:</B>  I have no idea.  You will have to ask 
him that.  He may have been fishing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a very, very complex problem.  However I am very proud to 
say that at least my party and our leader have initiated this 
debate.  As my colleague has said, we should have more days like 
this because we are dealing with the future of regions of the 
country, particularly the Atlantic region.  If we do not debate 
and suggest solutions, then there is a region of the country that 
may just disappear.  It is the role and responsibility of the 
federal government to find solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This country is so diverse and our problems are so different. 
All that the people of Atlantic Canada are asking is to continue 
to be a part of this great nation and to be treated with dignity 
and respect and be allowed to stay where they have lived, worked 
and been educated.

“implement”.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Why I say that is, how can you continue the implementation of 
something that you have never implemented, such as a national 
policy on sustainable fisheries?  How can you continue to 
implement something when the auditor general so clearly 
highlighted in his report that there is no clearly defined 
national policy on sustainable fisheries? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Questions and

receivability of the amendment and will get back to you very 
shortly.  In the meantime I think we should proceed with 
questions and comments. 
<P><A NAME="LINK58"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, what solutions 
does the hon. member for Burin—St. George's have?  He had a lot 
of criticism in his remarks.  Having sat through several 
fisheries meetings now, I would like him to soon get to the point 
of proposing some solutions that we could add to what we are 
already proposing in terms of our national fisheries policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his passion he got a little carried away and I would like to 
clear up a couple of facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He tried to leave the impression that this government is doing 
nothing on the west coast in terms of the salmon treaty.  Nothing 
could be further from the truth.  On that issue, the minister of 
fisheries has travelled extensively, to Oregon and Washington and 
has met with senators and congressmen and people in British 
Columbia.  The Prime Minister has appointed two special 
representatives to report back to him. We are dealing with that 
issue and we are making progress. It surprises me that the member 
for Burin—St. George's is now crawling into bed with the NDP 
premier of the province of B.C.  I can hardly believe that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope he is at least admitting that we did what we had to do on 
the east coast in terms of dealing with the initial crisis in the 
downturn of the fishery.  We tried to be there to support the 
communities and the fisher people.  We in fact have welcomed the 
auditor general's critique of that particular program and what 
fisheries and oceans is doing.  We said in committee the other 
day that we are going to use those results to learn some lessons. 
And we have in fact.  I think the hon. member agrees with this 
point.  We have appointed Mr. Harrigan to look at the impact on 
those communities and he is doing that at the moment in going to 
those communities now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that and having tried to clear up those facts, out 
of all his remarks could the hon. member highlight for me a 
couple of areas where he is proposing solutions in terms of a 
comprehensive national fisheries policy which the motion 
suggests.  I have not heard anything in terms of solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Before proceeding 
with questions and comments, I advise the House that the 
subamendment has already been ruled out of order by the Deputy 
Speaker this morning.  Therefore, that decision stands and we 
will proceed with questions and comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Matthews:</B> Madam Speaker, I listened with interest 
to the parliamentary secretary asking about solutions. 
We are talking about a national policy for a sustainable

</I></B></P><P align=left>Can we imagine being minister of fisheries and oceans and trying 
to make management decisions about fisheries on either coast 
without adequate research and adequate science?  Therein lies a 
big problem.  The government has gutted the research and science 
budgets of DFO.  The solution is to get money back into the 
research and science budgets and to get research and science 
activities operating on both coasts to determine exactly what 
fish are there and what environmental problems are being 
experienced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hear talk on the east coast about the effects of cold water, 
the effects of seals and the effects of foreign overfishing.  We 
are now talking about a fishery of the future without in essence 
a budget for science and research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the parliamentary secretary and the Minister of Fisheries 
and Oceans how they can make any management decisions.  How can 
we ever hope to have a sustainable fisheries if we do not have 
proper and adequate research and science?  Excuse the pun, but we 
have been floundering around too long. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was indicated at the parliamentary committee this morning 
that a former minister of fisheries set a total allowable catch 
of double what the scientific community recommended.  That is bad 
enough.  We can blame that on the minister.  However, to be 
making management decisions when they do not have anything to 
base them on and then trying to shift the blame on to people in 
those regions of the country for all they have done— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Do you want to spend money or cut 
taxes? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Matthews:</B>  I have not met the hon. member.  Maybe 
I should never meet him.  Does he realize the value of fish 
resources to the people of Canada?  Both of them are in big 
trouble. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member is saying that they would not spend any money on 
research and science.  They would keep on making the same old 
mistakes.  They would let the stocks go down the tube and more 
people would be unemployed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does it not make more sense to put money into science and 
research so that we make sound management decisions, have a 
sustainable fishery and keep people employed on the Atlantic and 
west coasts?  What is wrong with spending some money to do that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are they going to cut spending money on everything?  Maybe that 
is the member's solution.  If they do that they will wipe out 
Atlantic Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  I am trying to help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Matthews:</B>  He is not trying to help me.  He is 
not trying to help Atlantic Canadians.  He is trying to help Paul 
Martin and his quest to become prime minister.  He has lost sight 
of his priorities.

and listening to the member referring to the finance minister by 
name. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if you would admonish the member, Mr. Speaker, and 
advise him not to use the minister's name. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I have been making gestures to the 
hon. member who was speaking.  I thank the hon. member for 
Mississauga South for drawing the rules to the attention of the 
House.  I have been striving to do that.  Given his distance from 
the Chair, perhaps he was unable to hear me.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I fully respect the member and the passion he brings to the 
debate.  I mean that with all sincerity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can take a look at the fact that the department had adequate 
research and science and consistently under the government of his 
party made political decisions that created the problem.  He says 
we have been floundering around too long and guess who has been 
in charge. He talks about the mismanagement of successive 
governments.

still hope. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This member and the member for Saint John say that we should not

wrong and they have all the answers, what hope do the people of

fisheries of the House, namely Mr. John Crosbie, who said “No 
one will pressure more for short-sighted and bad decisions than 
provincial fisheries ministers”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member was a former minister in Newfoundland.  Month after 
month, year after year, Mr. Crosbie had to put up with the 
pressure of bad decisions being made that led to the collapse of 
the fishery.  He is as responsible as any member here. 
It is amazing that during the time Mr. Mulroney was in government 
the Liberal Party did not make decisions.  I wished to explain to 
the hon. member of the Reform Party.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer to the problem Mr. Crosbie outlined in his new book.  I 
recommend that hon. members buy it; it is cheap at the price. The 
book points out that people like the hon. member were the cause 
of the decline of the Atlantic fisheries.  Indeed they were the 
cause of the collapse of the Atlantic fisheries.  For him to come 
here today and happily say that he is new here and not here to 
defend mistakes, as he literally did two minutes ago, is a bit 
thick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer to the motion before the House: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House recognize the urgent need for action to address 
the serious problems in Canadian fisheries on both the Pacific 
and Atlantic coasts, and calls upon the government to establish a 
comprehensive national fisheries policy that demonstrates real 
commitment to resource conservation, leadership on the issue of 
resource sharing with foreign interests, and sensitivity to the 
individuals, families and communities whose futures are linked to 
the health and sustainability of the Canadian fisheries industry. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have put an amendment forward.  My hon. colleagues, the 
parliamentary secretary, has put an amendment forward pointing 
out that the objectives outlined in this resolution are in fact 
the current policy of the government which took over from the 
Conservative Party and changed the very policies that created the 
problem we have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member, typically Conservative, forgot one basic.  He 
talked about from coast to coast.  There are three coasts to 
Canada.  The Arctic coast is also important, with important 
fisheries.  He should recognize, like many of his Conservative 
friends, that he is living in the past when he refers to only two 
coasts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He mentioned science.  Recently I had the opportunity to travel 
in the Arctic region.  I was on a coast guard vessel, the 
<I>Louis St. Laurent</I>, now the world's premier platform for 
scientific work in ice regions.  Some first class work is being 
done under the surface heating and Sheba-Jois programs.  This 
program involves freezing the ice-breaker in the ice for 12 
months.  People are coming to us wanting to work with DFO 
scientists in this very important area.  It refers to global 
warming and other issues, namely reflection of the surface and 
other problems we face in the Arctic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At least 20 American organizations including all the premier 
research organizations in the United States, for example Scripts 
and Woods Hall, are putting up $5.1 million of the total $8.1 
million cost.  They would not come to Canada to work with us if 
they knew that our science was not the best in the world.  The 
American organizations involved could go anywhere in the world to 
work with any other nation or could do it themselves.  They come 
here because we do the best work in the world.  Our scientists at 
the Department of Fisheries and Oceans and in our universities 
are the best in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important for the hon. member to recognize that his 
criticisms are off the mark when it comes to science.  They are 
cheap shots at our good scientists.  As a member of the fisheries 
committee he should ask its chairman and the parliamentary 
secretary to make sure the committee has the scientists before 
it.  Then he can learn what he obviously does not know now, which 
he admits by getting up and saying that he is new here and knows 
nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He referred to the Atlantic groundfish stocks and the 
consequence of the collapse.  We have had to cope with the 
consequence to business, communities and individuals.  They have 
all had to change a way of life and a tradition their families 
practised for generations.  I know the hon. member has experience 
with that.  We needed a national effort to assist those in 
trouble and to rebuild a sustainable Atlantic fishery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members opposite, members of the Conservative Party and the 
member who was a provincial minister of fishery, cannot sit here 
and pretend they had nothing to do with it. They cannot pretend 
they had nothing to do with the state of the groundfishery off 
Atlantic Canada in their years of government when the cod stocks 
collapsed and 40,000 Atlantic Canadians were out of work. 
Rather than sit on the sidelines and look for someone to blame, 
this government has applied what we have learned from the lessons 
of that groundfish collapse.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have learned that the stocks are not inexhaustible.  I quote 
a former department of agriculture publication about codfish and 
the east coast fisheries in 1885: “Unless the order of nature is 
overthrown, for centuries to come our fisheries will continue to 
be fertile”. We proved that wrong in Atlantic Canada.  We proved 
that the fishery is exhaustible and the policies that created 
that were the policies of the previous Conservative government 
and the policies of the previous speaker who was the minister of 
fisheries of the province of Newfoundland and Labrador. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had to recognize that we need to change our ways.  Fleet 
sectors have changed their ways, individuals have changed their 
ways, processes have changed their ways, governments have changed 
their ways.  The people who have not changed their ways are the 
reactionaries of the Conservative Party who sit opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Studies have dissected the failings of the past.  Prescriptions 
have been put forward as the way for the future.  We have all 
embraced the need for change with the sole exception of the 
Conservative Party.  We have all attempted to face the future 
with new prescriptions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fishery of Atlantic Canada is being downsized and 
restructured.  It has secured new sources of raw material and 
focused on new products.  Some of that raw material comes from 
the Bering Sea.  It has been and is becoming more resilient, 
adaptive and despite all odds has moved forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through the painful lesson of stock reduction and moratoria we 
have been reminded that we must always put conservation of the 
resource first. We in government have learned the need to change 
our relationship with the industry and we know now that we cannot 
do it ourselves, that partnership and co-operation with the other 
players are essential.  I offer to the hon. member and his party 
that co-operation, that willingness to work with them so we can 
get away from the attitudes that so dominated the Conservative 
Party year after year in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will quickly mention the international commitment to 
conservation through our efforts to negotiate the United Nations 
fisheries agreement on straddling stocks and through NAFO, the 
Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization.  In recent years we 
have worked successfully through NAFO to put in place the 
necessary control mechanisms such as onboard observers and port 
inspections as well as management decisions in accordance with 
the best scientific advice, international scientific advice as 
well as Canadian advice, which is still the best of all 
international science available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes into force, the UN fish agreement will provide the 
foundation in international law for effective conservation of 
straddling and highly migratory stocks on the high seas.  That 
means groundfish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Opposition members come into this House and call for a national 
fisheries policy.  Unfortunately the only thing they can say 
about their proposed national fisheries policy is that they would 
like it to be “comprehensive”. When my parliamentary secretary 
even asked the gift question to the Tories of what they would do, 
they had no answer for him whatsoever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So let us look at what does constitute a national fisheries 
policy.  Does it mean a national policy across the country which 
my hon. friend was hinting at when he started to talk about 
British Columbia, a national standard, one size fits all policy 
at a time when we are recognizing the importance of diversity? Of 
course not.  Does it mean, and this is even more troubling, that 
opposition members have ignored the views and input of fishermen 
and their organizations from across the country?  Does it mean 
they are so divorced from reality that they are not even aware 
there are differing views of what the fishery of the future 
should be?  Are they pretending that our job as legislators is to 
be responsive to those views or not?  Are they asking us to do 
what they did, which is to ignore the very people who make their 
living from the fishery? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have met with fishermen from coast to coast to coast. 
Had the hon. member not had such a comfortable summer, had he 
looked at what was going on within the fishery, he would have 
known that instead of making the errors which he did in his 
earlier presentation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been to St. John's, his city, six times since becoming 
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First in the national policy we must develop an environmentally 
sustainable fishery.  Conservation must be first.  We must accept 
the notion that conservation is central to the economic viability 
of individuals and companies engaged in the fishery and of the 
well-being of the communities that depend on the fisheries for 
their very existence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I challenge any member opposite to tell me that environmental 
sustainability is not the best principle for the fishery. 
I challenge any member opposite to rise and tell me that there 
is any better way of putting in place that conservation concept 
than through the precautionary principle of making sure we err on 
the side of caution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I challenge any member opposite to rise in their place and tell 
us why they did not put conservation first and why they did not 
apply the conservation principle in the decade they were in power 
here in Ottawa and in the similar period when they were in power 
in St. John's. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second principle which I have put forward very clearly is 
that the fishery of the future must be economically viable.  It 
must be managed so as to provide participants with a good 
livelihood, something better than subsistence.  The fishery must 
not been seen, as it has been in the past, as the employer of 
last resort or as the doorway to some government program of 
support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a nation we have been blessed with a diverse and valuable 
marine resource base.  We must continue to develop that base and 
develop the tools to manage it so that we have a good return for 
the participants to be able to sustain their coastal communities, 
not just in the best years but year in and year out in the 
fishery.  That means there must be a recognition that the fishery 
will be smaller. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again I refer the hon. member to the words of wisdom of my 
predecessor, the hon. John Crosbie, when he discussed this in his 
book.  If he looked at the St. John's newspaper this morning 
he would know that there are excerpts quoted in that very paper. 
He would see in those excerpts Mr. Crosbie's recognition of the 
errors of the past and his commitment to a sustainable fishery in 
the future based on that reduced size. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have to be fewer participants and harvesting capacity must 
be more in balance with the capacity of the resource. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fishery of the future must be internationally competitive. 
The vast bulk of our fishery resource product is sold overseas. 
We must continue to focus on quality.  We must continue to pay 
more attention to stability of supply, ensuring a competitive 
price. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The final principle that I will put forward of this government's 
sustainable fisheries policy is that the fishery must be 
self-reliant.  Fishermen must continue to work with us as 
partners in management, not as adversaries, as marked the 
situation when the hon. member was the provincial minister of 
fisheries for Newfoundland and Labrador. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That adversarial relationship is another aspect of the fishery 
which we inherited from the very party which has put forward this 
motion in the House today.  Those members should rise in the 
House and explain how they allowed the fishery to deteriorate to 
the state it did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Fisheries Council of Canada has said that fact that the 
groundfish stocks collapsed to such an extent should serve as a 
warning that the fishery of the future should not mirror the 
fishery of the past.  The warning is clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the day I was appointed Minister of Fisheries and Oceans I 
declared conservation to be my major goal and it will remain so. 
It means that when I take a tough decision, as I did in 
Newfoundland on the recent food fishery decision, I will not be 
put off course by complaints from opposition members.  A 
Conservative member, a colleague, a former member of the 
legislature, headed up an organization simply to oppose me on 
that science based decision of the food fishery.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me quickly turn to the west coast.  I have no apology to make 
with respect to the west coast.  The policy we have followed is 
to get the best deal we can for British Columbia fishermen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member was making some rather foolish remarks about the 
west coast fishery.  We have learned the lessons from the east 
coast fishery and we are applying fleet reduction on the west 
coast fishery. We are reducing the number of fishermen.  We are 
introducing area licensing so that we can avoid the problems that 
have plagued the east coast fishery over the years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have here the list of 
targets and achieved targets.  For example, area 23 in Barkley 
Sound, the sockeye return has reached 260,000 fish.  The 
escapement target is expected to be achieved.  In area 
B, the south coast seine, the catch of 3.6 million sockeye toward an 
allocation of 3.8 million, only 200,000 out and the fishery was 
continuing.  In the same area 2.7 million pinks have been 
harvested out of an allocation of 2.5 million.  In other words, we were 
over .2 on the pinks and under .2 on the sockeye. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Area D, allocation is very closed to being achieved.  In Area 
E, which the Fraser River, Juan de Fuca, an allocation of 1.4 
million sockeye has been achieved. In Area F allocation has been 
achieved. In Area G the fishery closed September 21 with an 
estimate catch of 1.307 million sockeye toward an allocation of 
1.377 million.  We were under by 70,000 in that fishery.  In area 
H a catch of 713,000 sockeye was recorded against an allocation 
of 688,000.  We are over again there.  We are meeting targets. We 
are meeting the allocation levels despite the difficulty of 
marine forecasting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest to the member that he pay particular attention to what 
is taking place on the west coast.  I would also like to point 
out that when it comes to dealing with Americans we have followed 
the policy of making sure that we worked with the measures that 
have the best chance of achieving the best deal for our west 
coast fishermen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is easy to attack the Americans roundly by such measures as 
the blockade of a ferry. That is easy to do. What it does not do 
is achieve the results for west coast fishermen. The member knows 
because of his experience that if we are to have an international 
area of fishery such as the west coast of North America and the 
northeast Pacific, the United States and Canada must work 
together. He knows that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week the premier of the province recognized that and after 
all his months of complaining and criticizing that we kept 
contact with the Americans and discussed this with the Americans, 
he has now reversed himself and said that we did not discuss it 
enough. We did not have enough contact with them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even the premier of B.C. has made a 180 degree change of 
direction, done his somersault.  The only person who is left out 
there preaching the concept that we should continue to attack the 
Americans is none other than the hon. critic of the Conservative 
party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have adopted the measures that are most likely to achieve 
success.  I want that understood.  I would be happy to answer any 
questions he may have. 
<P><A NAME="LINK62"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo—Chilcotin, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am gratified to hear the Minister of Fisheries and 
Oceans talking about erring on the side of caution and of his 
concern for conservation.  I share those goals very much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the minister two or three questions in that 
regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I live in an area on the upper Fraser River.  Not much fishing 
takes place there, but a lot of fish spawn there. There have been 
a lot of problems in that area for a good period of time.  For 
example, why was a young rancher charged with disrupting a fish 
habitat when he cleared out a beaver dam to make stale, stagnant 
water fresh so that the fish could live there again? 
Why was another person who wished to rescue young fry from the 
back waters that had begun to dry up told he could be charged if 
those fish were rescued and put into an environment where they 
could live instead of becoming bird food?  That person was told 
it was simply nature's way and the birds need food too.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The real questions I want to ask are with regard to the Likely 
hatchery. That hatchery was cut back from a production of about 
two million fish to about 200,000 fish and then shut down because 
it was uneconomic.  Now local volunteers are raising about $1,500 
a month to feed the fish that they strip and put into spawning 
channels and care for throughout the year. Why will there be no 
assistance to these people in the conservation of the chinook 
salmon? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This fall the spawning channels in the Horsefly River have been 
left closed so that the sockeye salmon cannot spawn there.  These 
salmon are destroying the natural spawning of the riverbed 
because there is no room for them.  Yet these spawning channels 
have remained closed.  It is a large run this year and the 
devastation of that fish stock is evident to everyone who has 
been there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Cariboo—Chilcotin hold the conservation of these 
fish stocks to be a very high priority.  Yet we have had no 
co-operation from the Conservative government, from Mr. Tobin 
when he was the minister and now from this minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the minister to answer these questions on the basis 
of his concern for caution and conservation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Anderson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is at 
liberty to make me aware of the particulars of the young 
rancher's case, which I do not know, or the issue with respect to 
the beaver dam on somebody's property in British Columbia.  Again 
I am unaware of the details of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest to the hon. member that the measures taken by 
the Department of Fisheries and Oceans are not the only measures 
sometimes taken with respect to water courses. The department of 
agriculture and the ministry of agriculture for the province of 
British Columbia are involved as well.  Enforcement may not be by 
DFO officials.  It may be by members of the fish and game branch 
of the province of British Columbia. I simply do not have the 
details.  If the hon. member will give me those details I am 
willing to look into those cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member spoke about hatcheries.  They do have remarkably 
successful results in some instances but not all.  It depends on 
what type of salmon the hatchery is designed to produce, whether 
it is chum, sockeye, chinook, coho or indeed whether it is 
steelhead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am happy to look into the issue for him to find that out but 
the assumption that every hatchery is an improvement is not 
entirely correct in all instances.  I have to point out to him 
and his colleague who is sitting next to him that there are major 
genetic problems with taking a small group of fish and flooding 
the entire gene pool of a particular species of salmon. Genetics 
is a problem that we are facing with hatcheries around the 
country.  It is a worldwide problem and if that is the situation 
I certainly will be in touch with him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the Horsefly sockeye channel I simply do not know why that 
would be the case.  If the hon. member will discuss it with me 
later I will get him the details.  Sometimes we have closed 
artificial spawning channels when the optimum number of fish have 
spawned. That is appropriate because any extra fish simply stir 
up the gravel and do not increase the production of fish. I will 
have to check on that. I am happy to do it on the member's 
behalf.

I am reluctant to rise on a point of order, but I feel compelled 
to do so. I wish to say to the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans

minister of fisheries in Newfoundland and Labrador.  It is on the 
record and I want to correct it and inform the minister, speaking 
on a need for money for—

order.  The hon. member may get an opportunity in debate 
subsequently to refute a point but I do not hear a point of order 
in anything the hon. member is saying at this stage, but I will 
listen further. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Matthews:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am reluctant to do 
this, but if something has been put on the record of this House 
that is incorrect and untrue, then certainly the member who was 
referred to should have a chance to stand and correct the record. 
If that is not a point of order I do not know what a point of 
order is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  A point of order is an argument about 
the rules of the House and whether they are being correctly

that are made in debate.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Bonaventure—Gaspé—Îles-de-la-Madeleine—Pabok, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to comment on the statement by the 
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will do my best to keep it short as I believe we only have 10 
minutes for questions and comments. The minister listed four principles 
that should, in his opinion and according to the amendment, continue to 
improve the overall policy. One of the four stated principles is 
emphasis on sustainability versus prudent harvesting. He wants to 
balance the harvesting capacity with the biomass production capacity. He 
wants the fisheries to become more self-reliant through joint 
management. 
His ultimate goal is preservation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could perhaps agree with him on the last of the four principles, 
but I have serious concerns about the others. I encourage the minister 
to listen to my speech this afternoon. But what about the minister, who 
this morning talked about balancing the harvesting capacity with the 
biomass? What does his department have in mind? How do they think this 
can be done when, according to the auditor general's report, nothing has 
been done to even begin rationalizing fisheries? I wonder how they can 
talk about improving something when the machine is stuck in neutral. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the minister to explain to us how he intends to start 
balancing all that. I know that the minister has not been fisheries 
minister for long, but I would like to give him food for thought. He may 
want to consult his predecessors. 
I understand that a major problem is precisely that the provinces were 
largely left out of the process. Perhaps the federal government did not 
co-operate enough with the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do I make this point? Some will say: “Sure, you Bloc Quebecois 
people are only interested in achieving sovereignty”. But before 
achieving sovereignty, we would like to leave a legacy of good 
management to Canadians. Why is it important to talk with the provinces? 
It is the provinces that finance the boats and issue the processing 
permits. Did the minister think about offering quotas to his provincial 
partners in order to reassure them so he could achieve some form of 
rationalization? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My second point to the minister is that when he talks about 
making fisheries somewhat more self-reliant, he is in fact 
talking about co-management. But I hope he is not referring to 
the same type of co-management as that provided in the bill 
introduced during the last Parliament. The reason is very simple: 
fishers are tired of having to pay the bills. Co-management means 
“you will help me pay operating costs”. I have yet to see any 
place where fishers are allowed to manage or enjoy profits, and 
particularly to take advantage of the options available. There 
was a clause in the former bill to the effect that it is up to 
the minister to invite this or that group. That is why fishers' 
associations feel their rights are being infringed upon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, here are my two questions: First, how does the minister intend 
to balance the harvesting capacity—what does he do with the 
provinces? —and second, does co-management simply mean to him that 
costs should be shared with the fishers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Anderson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am happy that the hon. 
member has asked these questions.  First of all, I want to tell him 
that I am anxiously awaiting his speech and will listen carefully 
to the first points he will raise.  I will read his speech 
afterwards, and perhaps we can have lunch together and discuss some 
of the points on which we are not in complete agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for his first question on co-operation with the provinces, 
I met with Quebec's Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in 
Saint-Jean a few weeks ago. 
Our discussions were very constructive.  He was very nice, and in 
the interviews he gave after our meetings, he mentioned that we had 
got along well together and that we will continue to hold 
discussions regarding close co-operation.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member has put his finger on a specific problem. 
Without this co-operation at the provincial level, there may be an 
increase in the capacity of fleets at the same time as the federal 
government wants to, and must, reduce the size of the catch. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for his second question, it will be in the new legislation, 
but I think that the rules do not allow me to speak about it before 
the bill is tabled in the House.  We can also get together to 
discuss the changes sought by the hon. member. 
Like his colleague who used to sit on the Standing Committee on 
Transport, he is well aware that I am very favourable to 
suggestions from the opposition regarding bills.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (Charlotte, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on 
a point of order.  I want to bring to the minister's attention 
that he was dead wrong in his facts when he was referring to the 
hon. member for Burin—St. George's as a former minister.  He was 
never ever a former— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I think the hon. member will 
recognize that that is not a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Anderson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I apologize if I have 
mis-described him, but I understand that he was on the resource 
policy committee of cabinet which included oversight of the 
department of fisheries— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  We are getting into debate rather 
than a point of order, as I suspected we might.  We will move on.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, whenever I take part in something like this I am most 
unhappy with the fact that we finally have everybody in the room, 
we can ask some really good questions and get answers and 
comments, but there is never enough time for it to happen.  There 
is something inappropriate about the way this place works because 
that is inevitably the result. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  It is called democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan:</B>  It is called democracy, but there are 
some democratic reforms which are necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has prime responsibility for one natural 
resource and that is fish.  Without a doubt, it is the worst 
managed resource in Canada.  It has a terrible track record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To quote my Liberal colleague from Huron—Bruce this week at the 
Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans, if fisheries were 
agriculture they would be managed properly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian fisheries have sustained a tremendous number of 
Canadians for a long time in every region of the country, but 
there has been a betrayal of the entire fishery through 
mismanagement, lack of serious consideration of legitimate 
scientific research, and betrayal of the fishermen dependent on 
good management by both this Liberal administration and the 
previous Tory administration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The taxpayer pays taxes in good faith, expecting that money 
spent for accurate scientific data will be put to its best use 
and the data collected will be used to make wise management 
decisions, not ignored or altered for political expediency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The open politicization of fisheries management was demonstrated 
very clearly by my colleague from Selkirk—Interlake in his 
speech earlier today when he indicated how the minister is using 
his appointment powers at the expense of the Freshwater Fish 
Marketing Corporation to tidy up Liberal patronage for an MP from 
the previous Parliament who did not qualify for the MP pension 
scheme. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The politicization of the fisheries puts the resource at risk. 
When the resource is at risk the fish stocks suffer, the 
fishermen suffer and the communities which depend on fishing 
suffer, not the politicians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Newfoundland and Labrador lost 25,000 people in the last year. 
That is sad.  No one has ever apologized for the largest layoff 
in Canadian history.  No one seems to be accountable.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been an ongoing front page dispute that has revolved 
around the Pacific salmon treaty with the United States all 
summer long and it continues to this day.  The Pacific salmon 
treaty was a rushed document produced during the Mulroney era in 
1985. It was rushed to completion to meet a signing ceremony for 
the shamrock summit between Reagan and Mulroney. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the major architects of the treaty told me earlier this 
year that much to his dismay the treaty as it currently exists is 
unworkable, that it is a failure.  There has been no fishing plan 
attached to this treaty since 1993 when this government came into 
power and prior to this year there has been no priority on paying 
attention to the Pacific salmon treaty. Even now the commitment 
from our foreign affairs department as to the priority of 
resolving issues around Pacific salmon with the United States is 
questioned by many.  Our federal fisheries minister has failed to 
demonstrate that resolution of the treaty is his number one 
priority. People involved— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Rubbish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan:</B>  Well if it is true I would like to have 
that on the record.  If that is the minister's number one 
priority I would be absolutely delighted to have him put that on 
the record.  We have a window of four or five months this winter 
to get that resolved.  Is the minister of fisheries the one who 
is primarily accountable or is it the minister of foreign 
affairs?  We do not know right now.  People are questioning who 
is the accountable party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Anderson:</B>  We both work on it.  So does the 
Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan:</B>  That is not clear responsibility. 
Somebody has to take the lead.  In the absence of hearing 
anything clearly I would have to assume that the minister of 
fisheries will wear it if it is not resolved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People involved with the west coast fisheries know one thing 
clearly.  Without a working treaty the salmon resource on the 
west coast is at great risk.  In September I wrote to the 
Canadian envoy, Mr. Strangway, who is dealing with the Pacific 
salmon treaty.  I asked him to act as a catalyst for a Pacific 
salmon symposium where we can get scientists from both Canada and 
the U.S. to put fisheries science on the table with respect to 
the migratory salmon on the west coast.  This could be a possible 
turning point in educating the public and could bring political 
resolve to fix this intolerable dispute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A week after I sent the letter, I received endorsement of this 
concept from American federal politicians from Alaska and 
Washington.  We are looking for a commitment from the minister to 
endorse this concept so we can expedite this symposium.  I would 
like to hear that too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The science from both sides of the border needs to be in the 
public domain at the same time and needs to be subject to peer 
review.  We need a commitment from the minister that DFO 
scientists will be allowed to attend this symposium and to speak 
publicly about the state of fish stocks without a muzzle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general makes a very strong statement in last week's 
report about sustainability in the fisheries.  The department has 
stated that its mandate is conservation of the fisheries resource 
base and that is implied in current legislation.  Nevertheless 
the auditor general found no clearly stated national policy for 
sustainable fisheries. How does the minister reconcile his claim 
that conservation is his priority when his policy on the west 
coast this summer was to ignore conservation principles? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On July 27 the minister said “Conservation is my first, second 
and third priority.  Glen Clark has asked me to fish aggressively 
and jeopardize conservation of the stocks.  I have refused”. 
Three days later the minister gave fishermen the order to “fish 
aggressively to overwhelm the efforts of the smaller U.S. fleet 
intercepting Fraser bound fish”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Anderson:</B>  That is wrong.  I never used that 
word.  Vigorously is the word I used. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan:</B>  That is a quote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Anderson:</B>  It is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan:</B>  On the east coast we had a collapse of 
the cod fishery which essentially occurred as a result of the 
actions of the previous Tory administration and the fallout from 
this collapse has been exacerbated by the Liberals.  We know the 
Tory government knew for at least five years before the 1992 
moratorium that cod stocks were seriously declining.  The then 
environment minister and now leader of the Progressive 
Conservatives, the member for Sherbrooke, could have used this 
information to save dwindling cod stocks while there was still 
hope. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1320"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT40"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Scientific studies said cod stocks would not recover until the 
end of the decade.  Why was the moratorium put in place for two 
years only?  They hoped the problem would go away.  Rather than 
address the problem, the former government decided to experiment 
on fishermen.  They wanted this program to get them past the next 
election.  The Liberals then put in a five year program to get 
them past the next election again.  This would take it to May 
1999, but now that we have had the election early, they want to 
cancel the program early.  Politics is rampant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In April of this year the minister of fisheries announced he 
would re-open three areas of the cod fishery in Atlantic Canada 
without any support from fisheries scientists anywhere.  With 
many fisheries scientists actually condemning the act, how could 
the minister have even contemplated such a move given the 
disastrous state of the Atlantic cod stocks? Now we have one set 
of information and two opinions.  The former minister, Brian 
Tobin, recently stated that Atlantic cod are being “fished to 
the point of extinction”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a happy story. We have fleet overcapacity on both 
coasts.  We end up with these gigantic social upheavals, fleet 
restructuring, displaced fishermen and communities marginalized. 
DFO has proven itself to be inept in handling these 
circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One more example of political incompetence, this morning in the 
<I>Globe</I> the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans stated that he 
wished the United States would live up to its obligations under 
the Pacific salmon treaty. I agree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also think that Canada should live up to its obligations under 
the international treaty which since 1955 allows the Great Lakes 
Fisheries Commission to run a very successful sea lamprey 
program.  It has run successfully for 40 years and is the 
backbone of the Great Lakes commercial and recreational 
fisheries. Two years ago it was put at risk by the Liberal 
government.  The government is currently $200,000 in arrears and 
has not responded to requests for budget allocations at least 
since July 2 of this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We went through the auditor general's report last week which 
condemned the government for turning the Atlantic groundfish 
strategy from what was supposed to be a fleet restructuring to 
primarily a poorly managed income support program and seriously 
criticized the lack of conservation focus on the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the west coast the combination of restructuring the industry 
and low prices has resulted in the displacement of fishermen, 
associated workers, their families and communities.  The minister 
announced in November and again in January an aid package for 
B.C. that consisted of a $7.7 million retirement program which 
has come to nothing, and a $30 million transition program.  With 
this $30 million program we have seen a lack of strong commitment 
from the minister and the affected parties are very concerned 
that the government will renege on this commitment as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister this past winter went further and said they would 
spend whatever it takes.  I can tell the minister that federal 
commitments are much less than $30 million and there are 
demonstrated transition proposals.  What is he waiting for? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why should any fisherman believe the government when it is 
reneging on TAGS and failing to deliver on its retirement and 
transition programs in B.C.?  Why make announcements, raise 
expectations and affect personal plans and then renege?  This is 
not fair to fishermen or their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously a primary alternative employment for displaced 
traditional fishery workers is in alternate fisheries.  We have 
heard many examples of DFO foot dragging in terms of responding to 
enlightened proposals to deal with putting people to work but 
still in fisheries related work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have correspondence on abalone on the west coast, sealing 
proposals on the east coast.  Why is the government still sitting 
on the Liberal task force report on aquaculture which has been in 
the hands of the government since November 1996? 
We understand that there are some enlightened proposals in there.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need a vision for the fishery.  There is a need for more room 
at the table for fisheries managers from the provinces and 
communities because they are the most directly affected and are 
most directly accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a better way.  We need to depoliticize the licensing 
process.  We need to separate scientific research from political 
control within the Department of Fisheries and Oceans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the minister that the scientists we have in Canada 
are among the very best in the world and in many cases are the 
best in the world.  But we also have many documented cases this 
year of these very scientists complaining about the political 
interference and manipulation under which they suffer. The 
<I>Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences</I> ran a 
major article on this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had many scientists sign on.  We had our previous fisheries 
critic for the east coast make appointments to visit fisheries 
scientists working for the department in the Atlantic provinces. 
When he arrived he was told he had no business going to visit 
scientists, that he must talk to the assistant deputy minister of 
science in Ottawa.  This is total politicization and it is 
unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have some proposals that I think would work across the 
country in terms of helping fishermen, helping their families. We 
know that disposable income is an important concept. A family of 
four with one income of $30,000 would see 89% shaved off their 
tax bill with our proposals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By cutting unemployment insurance premiums, what we have is a 
circumstance whereby employers will begin to add to their 
payrolls rather than lay off workers because Liberals and Tories 
put a tax on jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that the long term solution relies more on the people 
in the affected fisheries than on programs and plans designed by 
the federal government and operated out of Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a transition measure we are convinced that money currently 
devoted to regional development and a program such as TAGS should 
be given directly to municipalities or provincial governments. 
It would be money delivered in a much more focused and much less 
wasteful fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I understand I have three and a half minutes left. 
I would like to use that time for questions and comments.  I 
would particularly like to have a discourse with the minister, 
but of course that is dependent on his co-operativeness in this 
regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I appreciate the hon. member's 
wishes.  Unfortunately, the rules do not permit me to add the 
extra time to the 10 minutes allowed for questions and comments 
following on the hon. member's speech, unless the House gives its 
consent to do that.  We will start with questions and comments.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member has said that nothing has been done to assist 
displaced west coast fishermen. I want to ask him this question. 
Is he aware that 54 weeks ago the job protection commissioner of 
the province of British Columbia and the province of British 
Columbia requested that the federal government spend $20 million 
on assistance for displaced fishers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is he aware that since then we have in fact under programs with 
HRD in co-operation with local community groups spent $21 million 
under that initial program, that we have another $7.6 million 
being spent under that program and that we have in addition $15 
million for habitat programs out of the Department of the 
Environment, of which $7.25 million will be put out this year and 
the remainder in later years?

British Columbia over one year ago? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the $15 million the 
minister refers to is a separate announcement.  It has nothing to 
do with the $30 million that was promised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The political apparatus of the Department of Fisheries and 
Oceans is playing a shell game with people in British Columbia. 
It wants to count the same money two, three or four times and 
make two, three or four announcements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand that the money that has been allocated, without the 
shell game and depending on how you count it, is somewhere 
between $12 and $18 million.  These are the best numbers I have. 
The minister is saying it is $21 million and $7.6 million.  If 
those numbers are correct, I would be very happy to receive 
documentation from the minister.  I will certainly go out of my 
way to apologize to him if those numbers are clean and do not 
reflect previous announcements, which is what keeps happening in 
most people's opinion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK68"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Eastern Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, my question for the Reform member from Vancouver Island 
is more or less a statement and is a clarification of what the 
minister said earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that no one has defended the rights of scientists to 
speak more than I have in the House of Commons by continually 
asking for a judicial inquiry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I reiterate two points for the member from the Reform.  First, 
because he has a lot of concerns with the science that is going 
on and the misinformation that is appearing, will he join me in 
calling for an inquiry? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the minister spoke earlier about the faith that he has 
in the expertise of the scientists within the DFO.  He failed to 
mention that the DFO still has to go through another two years of 
cuts. He failed to mention that the coast guard, since its merger 
with DFO, has turned one of the finest institutes in the world, 
the Bedford Institute of Technology, into a morale mess. It is 
one of the finest institutes of the world for fisheries and 
oceans studies.  The morale in that building in Bedford, Nova 
Scotia is at an all-time low because of the policies of the 
federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will he now join with me in asking the minister and the 
government to remove this suppression or gag order from 
scientists so that they can speak freely about their findings and 
their interpretation of science, without fear of losing their 
jobs? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for the 
questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take the three questions I detected in the 
intervention in reverse order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In regard to the DFO and the coast guard, depending on which 
part of the country you go to, there are regional differences as 
to who has had the most dramatic impact on whom.  In some cases 
the coast guard has been the loser.  In other cases DFO has been 
the loser in this amalgamation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not think there has to be a loser.  We think the mandate 
of the coast guard is best fulfilled not through an amalgamation 
with fisheries and oceans. They have a mutually exclusive 
mandate.  We think the coast guard should be a part of the 
military.  That would fix the whole problem.  We are in some 
general concurrence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This certainly has created problems with respect to the cuts the 
Department of Fisheries and Oceans is suffering.  Our major 
observation is that the field operations and the regional 
services are the ones that take the brunt of the cuts. 
The centralized operation, particularly in Ottawa, has actually 
added personnel in a high-priced category over the last two or 
three years.  We think this is absolutely and totally 
inappropriate.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for calling for an inquiry, we are talking about the rights 
of scientists.  Science should be on the table.  The public 
should know what the science is.  That will keep the politicians 
honest when they make moves which might go against the science. 
The way to make that happen is through structural change and 
legislation which ensures that scientists have freedom in making 
their opinions known. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the way to go, as opposed to a full blown inquiry, 
because an inquiry will inevitably get bogged down.  As well, if 
the inquiry is not going the way the administration wants it to 
go, it will end up being ineffectual, just like several of the 
inquiries we have seen in recent times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a more practical and immediate way for us to go.  That 
is what I would promote.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
would ask the member to comment on a news item which was recently 
reported.  A well known premier in the Atlantic region decided to 
step down and, having stepped down, he was free to speak his 
mind.  Mr. Frank McKenna announced that he felt the grants and 
subsidies which had been provided to the Atlantic region had 
effectively become an opiate for that region.  He was advocating 
that maybe one of the best thing that could be done would be to 
have a tax reduction in that region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the hon. member would be willing to speak to that 
particular item. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I certainly spoke about tax 
measures which could be taken. We also have other things in mind 
for the Atlantic region which we think are very positive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a market of 14 million people between the Atlantic 
provinces and New England and there are very poor infrastructure 
links at the current time. A very solid way for government to 
invest in the Atlantic region would be to ensure that those 
infrastructure links are strengthened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen a strong report from the port of Halifax.  The 
Halifax Chamber of Commerce estimated in 1996 that conversion to 
a post panamax port would result in 24,000 full time permanent 
jobs in that area.  That is the kind of proposal which we think 
the federal government should be strongly behind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that one of the major problems in developing a 
non-subsidized seal industry on the east coast is the 
bureaucratic inspection system on meat products coming from seals 
which basically categorizes the seal as a fish rather than a 
mammal.  It has become a real problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We think the government has shown a lack of resolve on the 
Voisey's Bay operation.  This is a major employer. Thousands of 
people could be put to work and it is being held up because of 
bureaucratic red tape and a lack of resolve emanating right here 
in Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are some very strong ideas.  As I mentioned before, we 
have alternative fisheries, we have aquacultural opportunities, 
and they just get totally bogged down because the department is 
playing by old, timid rules.  There is no advocacy going on, 
other than for the way things have been done before.  It is just 
not working.  We need major structural, systemic change.  We need 
to re-focus.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charles Hubbard (Miramichi, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
will be sharing my time this afternoon with the hon. member for 
Vancouver Kingsway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning the fisheries committee met and we heard from 
various fisher people in Atlantic Canada and some of their 
concerns with the TAGS policy.  They are concerns which we hope 
we can hear in the committee on fisheries and oceans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the weeks ahead under the capable leadership of our 
chairperson, we will try to hear the reports from Atlantic Canada 
and the concerns with the fishery, and hopefully provide some 
solutions to what their concerns might be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come from a community in which the fishery is very important. 
In fact, the community has approximately 10 small fishing wharves 
and approximately 400 boats that are out on the water during the 
fishing seasons.  There are three fish plants relying on the 
resources from the sea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we in Atlantic Canada appreciate the fact that the sea 
is a great resource for all of us.  We go out with our boats, we 
get our gear, our nets together and of course, hopefully we will 
have a successful fishing season. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those involved with the groundfish, especially cod, the last 
10 years have not been good.  In fact the past five years when 
they were not able to fish in most areas has been a tremendous 
blight on the economy in Atlantic Canada. I am glad that the 
House has taken a day to look at these problems of the Atlantic 
fishery, and also to discuss some of the problems on the west 
coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This year we celebrated the 500th anniversary of the landing of 
Cabot's ship on the shores of Newfoundland.  For at least 500 
years, in fact before 1497, the Grand Banks and those waters off 
the coast of Newfoundland were looked on as a tremendous resource 
for fish, that great protein source that our people have.  For 
almost 500 years we have had a successful fishery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think all of us in this House recognize that in the last 30 or 
40 years our fishing techniques, our new methods and all those 
ships that are coming from offshore to visit our waters have put 
a tremendous drain on that great fishery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of our own area, the Miramichi, which I mentioned 
before, we have had to look at difficult situations in terms of 
our own fisheries.  In fact, if we look at the last decade, most 
of the fishermen on the Miramichi who hold groundfish licences 
have not been able to fish groundfish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>None of them have participated in the TAGS program because, as 
fishermen, they saw the decline of the cod stocks in the last 
generation as a reason why they should not be out fishing that 
resource.  They have waited for a return of the cod fishery and 
they have waited in vain because right now, we still do not see 
prospects of the cod returning to Miramichi Bay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen in terms of our Atlantic salmon that, since the 
1970s, the Atlantic salmon has no longer been a commercial 
fishery.  In fact, the several hundred fishermen who had that as 
part of their licences in the early 1960s and into the 1970s, 
have had to give up those licences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of them sold them back to the government.  In any case, the 
Atlantic salmon fishery has declined to the stage where today it 
is only a recreational fishery and then only in terms of a 
limited catch that can be kept by any recreational fisherman. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact this year the recreational fishery in the Miramichi is 
allowed approximately eight tags.  Among those eight tags, they 
are only allowed to keep the smaller fish which are referred to 
as grilse, which are less than 26 inches in length. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard across the House the problems of the hatcheries.  I 
think I would be remiss if I did not point out that I was a bit 
disappointed to find that this year DFO has closed all the 
hatcheries in Atlantic Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my own case of the Miramichi, we had the oldest fish hatchery 
in Canada trying to promote and enhance the Atlantic salmon. That 
hatchery, which existed since before Confederation is a 
historical site in terms of our sites and monuments.  It is 
sometimes called the oldest hatchery in North America and was 
turned over this month to a local group that is attempting now to 
run it on a limited budget. 
DFO should be criticized for having closed the Atlantic salmon 
hatcheries.

<A HREF="#LINKT45"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of our lobster fishery we have to look at the concept 
of gear.  Most of our lobster fishermen, for example, had 350 
traps they could put in the water.  Historically they were traps 
made of wood approximately three feet in length.  Putting out 350 
traps has been changed now to the concept of putting out steel 
traps which are four feet in length.  Many lobster fishermen are 
concerned what effect a change in gear will have on that fishery, 
the main source for fishermen on Miramichi Bay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have to think about what fish really are.  They are a 
resource.  They travel across the great oceans of this continent. 
They are available not only to Canadian fishermen but to many 
other fishermen who visit our waters and fish sometimes within 
the 200 mile limit with the permission of our country and often 
times outside the 200 mile limit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We think of the Americans, our neighbours.  We think of the 
French fleet that sometimes fish off the shores of St. Pierre and 
Michelon.  We think of the Spaniards and other members of the 
European Union who fish off our shores.  In other words, they 
have tremendous pressure on the Atlantic fishery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister and his officials have worked hard through such 
organizations as NASCO and NAFO to try to make international 
arrangements by which our fishing resources could be enhanced and 
conserved for future generations.  The Department of Fisheries 
and Oceans and the Department of External Affairs have to look at 
concepts and agreements among the various nations of the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We think of the tremendous tuna resource we have today.  It is 
worth as much as $30 a pound to some of our Atlantic fishermen. 
Those tuna are being chased not only by our Atlantic fishery but 
by other nations of the world, especially Japan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the minister will look at some of the communications 
problems of his department.  If we look at politicians in the 
House today, some criticize us for what has happened to the 
fishery.  Others will criticize our scientists.  Some criticize 
the very management of DFO.  We have to recognize that there has 
to be better communications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For a good period of time we have heard concerns about seals and 
how they are affecting cod stocks off the coast of Atlantic 
Canada.  A tremendous report produced by our science division 
indicated that the seals were not a major source of difficulty in 
terms of how many cod stocks they were eating.  The report went 
on to say that seals were caught and dissected and their stomach 
contents indicated they had eaten very few cod. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I showed that report to some fishermen in the area of Hardwicke. 
After reading the report an elderly fisherman said to me “When 
there is no codfish for fishermen, how could there be codfish for 
the seals?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometimes we look at science but science has to be measured 
against the people who are out there fishing, the people with 
experience, the people who know what their jobs are all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we hear of the many changes happening within DFO.  We hear 
that fees are being charged.  We hear there are observers out 
there and that various methods are being used.  We commend the 
department for some of those steps it has taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any case, as a member from Atlantic Canada I want to say that 
it is very complex.  We cannot point fingers but we have to look 
at the fact that this resource has tremendous pressure on it.  We 
cannot really blame those who are here today or those who were 
here before us.  Many people have relied on that source of 
income.  Certainly many fishing people, especially in 
Newfoundland, relied on TAGS and are concerned.  We have to be 
concerned that the human needs of every person in this great 
country of ours are met.

Kingsway.  I am sure she will take some time to talk about the 
west coast fishery, but in terms of the east coast I hope we as 
parliamentarians can work together to offer some vision and some 
possible solution to a very complex and difficult problem. 
<P><A NAME="LINK71"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills—Grasslands, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am interested in the fact that although he comes from 
the Miramichi the hon. member has extended his comments to the 
outer shelf, which is what I want to address in my question.  I 
know there are no sharks in the Miramichi except perhaps for a 
few Liberal bagmen, but we will not worry about them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to speak for the sharks.  I wonder what the hon. member 
thinks about the fact that the shark population in the north 
Atlantic, including our territorial waters, is being decimated. 
The sharks are being taken in almost unlimited quantities.  It is 
a fishery of unbelievable cruelty.  It makes any other branch of 
the fishery or the sealery seem utterly benign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When they destroy sharks as they surely will—these things will 
become extinct—we will lose the main control on the seal 
population that exists.  This in turn filters down to the fish 
which provide the increased numbers of seals with their 
sustenance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the DFO not out there doing a little surveillance, some 
controlling and keeping people from decimating the shark 
population? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charles Hubbard:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I certainly want to try 
to reply to the hon. member.  I know he has been in the cattle 
business and in the oil business.  I believe he has a son who has 
been connected with the Bedford Institute of Oceanography.  He 
has a very broad knowledge in terms of all this, a knowledge that 
probably surpasses some of my own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to look at the fact that Canada alone cannot control all 
of that.  In terms of the tuna, swordfish and sharks, it is part 
of our international obligations.  We have to negotiate with 
other countries in terms of those species. 
<P><A NAME="LINK72"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I have the pleasure of representing 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough which is almost three-quarters 
surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean.  I have a great number of 
fisher persons in that riding who are having tremendous 
difficulty in getting consultation with the government, members 
of DFO, and in particular members of the ministry of fisheries 
office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to consultation and the idea of fisher persons 
having direct input into the policy process and procedure by 
which they are governed, what is the government doing in a 
substantial way to foster this ability for actual input and 
consultation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canso Trawlerman's Association and Pat Fougere have been 
repeatedly trying to have a meeting with the minister of 
fisheries as have the zone 18 fishermen and crab fishermen.  The 
idea of information flowing back and forth is a substantial 
problem that needs to be addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very interested to hear what the hon. member proposes in 
terms of increased consultation and input from those in the 
industry who have the most working knowledge of the problems that 
face fishermen on both coasts of this great country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charles Hubbard:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member mentions a 
good point.  Only this morning our committee met by video 
conference with Mr. Sam Ellsworth, president of the Halifax West 
Commercial Fishmen's Association, and Mr. Ron Newell, president 
of the Southwest Fishermen's Quota Group, Halifax.  Our committee 
will certainly be visiting the east coast.  I hope we will hear 
input from all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my speech indicated, fishermen with experience are just as 
important to us as those scientists who have Ph.Ds but have never 
set foot on some of the great ships and boats out there fishing 
on our waters.

Speaker, the member for Miramichi is quite aware of the situation 
in our region where the cost of unemployment insurance has made 
it extremely difficult for people to survive in rural 
communities.  On top of that the federal government, DFO, has 
opted out of the funding of wharfs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member for Miramichi recognize that this is a problem? 
Is he willing to work on making sure that our fishermen have 
secure decent wharfs from which to fish? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charles Hubbard:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is not often one is 
given an opportunity to speak of constituent concerns directly on 
the floor of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do have 10 wharfs.  We are very pleased that in most of those 
areas fishermen's committees have been set up.  In terms of the 
member asking the question, the nearest one I have to her 
constituency is the wharf at Saint-Louis de Kent which together 
with the wharfs at Point Sapin and Escuminac are attempting to 
provide resources.  A significant amount of money was granted to 
the wharf at Saint-Louis.  The committee, under the leadership of 
Gerald Robichaud, has done very well in trying to meet the needs 
of the fishermen in that area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I believe the time for questions and

that he may attempt to gain custody of his daughter who witnessed 
the killing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked if they had made request for notification in writing as

not because nobody told them that they should.  They were merely

the second annual YWCA Week Without Violence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This important international initiative is being held in 17 
countries and recognizes the devastating economic, social and 
health consequences violence produces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consider these statistics.  More than 100 women are victims of 
domestic homicide every year by an actual or former husband or 
common law partner.  Approximately one-half of women 16 and over 
have been victims of violence as defined by the Canadian Criminal 
Code.  The great majority of personal crimes committed against 
women are not reported to the police.  Sixty per cent of women in 
Canada are afraid to walk alone in their neighbourhoods after 
dark.  Boys who have witnessed violence against their mothers 
eventually tend to be more violent toward their spouses. Violence 
costs the Canadian economy approximately $4 billion every year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This year 36 YWCAs and YMCAs across Canada are working to find 
solutions to violence.  I am proud to offer my support to the 
YWCA—

<I>Sun</I> of October 15, 1994 where this quote appears in 
relation to certain forms of taxation, not a carbon tax but other 
forms of taxation related to the environment.  It reads:  “It is 
worth consideration.  If it is truly an environmental tax then I 
do not have a serious problem.  I think the public is, by and 
large, willing to pay a reasonable amount to address an 
environmental problem.  I guess our greatest fear was a carbon 
tax imposed on the wellhead”.  That quote is attributed to

judge a position from one set of meetings going back to 1995.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Emergency shelters for the homeless across the country are 
running out of space and the cold weather has not yet hit.  The 
government has abandoned programs that help the poorest and most 
vulnerable in society.  The cuts have been devastating, including 
in my own riding of Vancouver East. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the minister take responsibility for this crisis of growing 
homelessness and outline what specific steps his government will 
take to shelter the homeless? 
<P><A NAME="LINK176"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, no one can remain impervious to the terrible scenes of 
homelessness.  No one can remain impervious to the degradation in 
which a large number of our fellow citizens find themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result the government has consistently refused to engage in 
scorch and burn policies advocated by others.  When we had to 
cut, which we had to do, we did it in a humane way with plenty of 
notice.  At the same time we engaged in a series of programs such 
as the child tax benefits and the reinjection of $6 billion into 
the CHST to enable the provinces and the municipalities— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The hon. member for Vancouver East. 
<P><A NAME="LINK177"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
that is not good enough.  The government has cut billions of 
dollars from social programs and thrown in the towel on jobs and 
housing.  Its child tax benefit does not help the poorest of the 
poor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When will the minister establish national standards and give 
real support to ensure that no one goes hungry or homeless 
because their income has been pushed below survival levels? 
<P><A NAME="LINK178"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, no one, and certainly not this government, wanted to 
find themselves in the financial difficulty that we found 
ourselves when we took office.  The fact is that if we had not 
acted our ability now to take positive action to help the people 
the hon. member is referring to would have been severely 
circumscribed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are now in a position to do that which a Liberal government 
and a responsible government wants to do.  I would simply say 
that the hon. member ought to read what some of her own people 
have said.  Don't be misled by politicians who make expensive 
promises.  Saskatchewan followed that path in the 1980s and—

the <I>Vanessa</I>, a Dutch owned tanker vessel, just sunk at 1 
o'clock Atlantic time.  There are 30 people in lifeboats waiting 
to be rescued.  Naval Lieutenant John Larson from the Halifax 
rescue staff has told my staff “Our helicopters can't go because 
it is just out of range”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When are we getting our helicopters? 
<P><A NAME="LINK181"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence,

available and ships that may be available in the area I am sure 
we will do all we can in terms of that rescue situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the helicopters, I anticipate that we will have 
this matter brought forward very soon.  We are anxious to get on 
with making sure that the fine, dedicated people who are involved 
in our search and rescue missions have proper equipment.  We want 
to make sure we get good value for the taxpayers' dollars and 
that we get the best operational aircraft to carry out search and 
rescue. 
<P><A NAME="LINK182"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Price (Compton—Stanstead, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
those 30 people are facing eight metre waves out there.  Canada 
is not properly equipped for today's operation.  We hope it all 
goes well and they all get back safely.  However we have waited 
long enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the minister of defence again where our helicopters are. 
When are we going to get them?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence,

we will do all that we possibly can in terms of those 30 people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Meanwhile we have for some period of time been going through a 
process of evaluating the proponents for the new search and 
rescue helicopters.  If in fact the member's party had not fouled 
the matter up previously we might have had something today.

the interests of the supply managed sector.  We have also very 
effectively put in place tariff protection for the producers of 
dairy, egg and poultry products in this country.

prisoners assault guards without fear of consequence, sue for

opportunities.  There is not one area of the country that will 
not be negatively affected by the results of climate change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada will be working collaboratively with Quebec and every 
province of the country to find appropriate resolutions.  If we 
do not, we risk our water, agriculture, fisheries and forests. It 
is a serious issue.

Canada's aboriginal peoples are used to hearing a lot of words 
but seeing very little action from the government which stressed 
the importance of partnership in the throne speech.  Almost one

competitive disadvantage as other countries around the world have 
shipbuilding policies that give them bank loans, equity funding, 
lease packages and shipyard credit.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

very generous and substantial subsidies.  Canada continues to 
participate in the group concerning shipbuilding at the OECD 
trying to put an end to these unfair subsidies.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>THE LATE FRED MCCAIN 
</H3><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK211"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (Charlotte, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as you 
mentioned, Fred McCain served in this House many years. Mr. 
Speaker, you served with him, as did the leader of our party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to pay tribute today to Fred McCain.  Fred served the 
people of New Brunswick and Canada for 34 years, 18 years as a 
member of the provincial legislature and 16 years as a member of 
the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fred was a great orator, a tremendous speaker who spoke always 
from his heart with deep rooted convictions, convictions he held 
and defended to his last breath.  He loved his country and 
certainly dedicated his life to that end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In what I consider one of the most prophetic speeches ever made 
in this House, Fred McCain rose in his place on October 21, 1980 
during the Constitution debate to say: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—this is indeed an historic debate and one in which, in a way, 
I find no great pleasure in participating. I think it implies 
that we either recognize the concept on which this nation was 
founded or we may be laying the foundation of its destruction. 
This is a debate on a resolution that has the potential to alter 
the face of this country like no other before it. I believe that 
if this resolution is accepted in its present form it will change 
the shape of federalism as it has existed historically and that 
it may not be accepted as a favourable change. 
</UL></UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it would be valuable to spend time examining the force 
of federalism over the last century, because if this is to be 
called an historic debate, then, I say, history should play a 
part in the determination of its climax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The precedents set by the wise men of the past, and the examination of 
these precedents, should not be overlooked—. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The good of the proposed nation as a whole was the primary 
objective of those who gave this nation their earliest 
consideration. Although these men had differences, they put those 
differences behind them and proposed a union that would be 
mutually beneficial to all parties concerned. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On October 24, 1986, again he rose in support of a united Canada 
with these strong and eloquent words: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not divide the voters of this nation.  Let us not put 
culture against culture, region against region, man against 
woman, women against everybody and man against all concerned for 
the political purposes and for the gain of votes.

</I></B></P><P align=left>During the very contentious debate on the issue of the 
Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement, with his quick wit and memory 
for quotes, he chose to say this in response to a challenging 
colleague's retort: “The hon. member is never lucky in the 
coincidence of his facts with the truth”. Fred went on to quote 
Sir Winston Churchill:  “I think it hardly possible to state the 
opposite of the truth with more precision”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Always the gentleman, Fred was always the gentle man. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How familiar to New Brunswickers are Fred's phrases, quotes,

sister Deanne, two sons, Fred and David, two daughters, Susan and 
Patricia, two step-children, Susan and Richard, and 10 
grandchildren. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His first wife, Marjorie, as many of us know, passed away in 
1988 while Fred was still a member of this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I offer to this House these thoughts. Fred was my 
mentor.  He was a great Canadian with a great capacity to listen 
and understand people.  He had a remarkable record which was a 
tribute to his natural affinity for people. He worked hard and 
was eager to help others regardless of their political stripe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He will be greatly missed by his family, friends and all of us

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would also like to rise today to pay tribute to Fred 
McCain.  I welcome the opportunity to do that following the fine 
words of the hon. member for Charlotte. I know they were 
heartfelt.  I know the people of his constituency would see many 
similarities between the good representation provided by Mr. 
McCain and the present member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I never met Mr. McCain, but he served in the New Brunswick 
legislature as the representative for Carleton county for 18 
years before he moved to federal politics as the member of 
Parliament for Carleton—Charlotte in 1972.  He served as the MP 
for what became known as the fish and chip riding until his 
retirement in 1988. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. McCain was a classic example of a gentle rural politician 
who moved easily from the potato farmers of Carleton county to 
the weir fishermen of Charlotte county, always willing to work 
for his people and listen to their concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>New Brunswick and Canada have lost one of their longest serving 
and distinguished politicians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the Government of Canada, to Fred's wife, Frances 
Manning Crompton, to his four children, two step-children, 10 
grandchildren and to his sister we extend our deepest sympathies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. McCain, a father, a grandfather and a brother, was a man who 
held service to the public in high esteem and, in turn, was 
greatly admired and respected by the public.  We all benefit as 
politicians from the esteem which he brought to the job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>May Mr. McCain rest in peace and be an example to all of those 
who follow in his footsteps.

also rise to pay tribute to the memory of Fred McCain and to pay 
my respects to his family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although I never had the pleasure of meeting Mr. McCain, his 
reputation as a strong grassroots politician is well known.  As 
others have mentioned, he served in this House from 1972 to 1988. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. McCain was a politician with a hands-on approach to matters 
relating to his constituency.  He had a genuine concern for his 
constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I read over the material about Mr. McCain, it struck me that, 
in particular, in his first year as a member of Parliament he 
logged over 50,000 miles travelling to each of the communities in 
his riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the final years of his life his constituents would approach 
him and offer their thanks for the fine work he had done as their 
member of Parliament and in the legislative assembly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. McCain promised to do what he could for his constituents. He 
did what he promised.  This was evident as he remained in 
politics, in elected life, for 34 years.  I think all of us in 
this place can learn a thing or two from Mr. Fred McCain.  He 
placed his constituents first and worked hard every day of those 
34 years for his constituents.

rise today on behalf of the Bloc Quebecois to extend our deepest 
condolences to the family of Fred McCain, who passed away recently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For 34 years, Fred McCain took up the difficult challenge of 
representing part of the population of New Brunswick both in the New 
Brunswick legislature in Fredericton and here in the House of Commons. 
He had decided to devote the best part of his career to serving his 
fellow citizens. His only promise, he said, was to do his very best to 
serve those who voted for him. This vision of political accountability 
does him credit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As parliamentarians, we know how demanding political life is, 
requiring both commitment and generosity. 
That is why we want to recognize the outstanding professionalism of 
Fred McCain in his political career. His family and relatives have every 
reason to be proud of him and of what he achieved for his fellow 
citizens.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I did have the pleasure of knowing Fred McCain and I did have the 
honour of serving with him in this House for nine years. Although 
he preceded me in this place by seven years, I did have the 
opportunity to serve with him for nine years between 1979 and 
1988.  I have very fond memories of Mr. McCain as a gentleman and 
a gentle man, as was said earlier by his Conservative colleague, 
who loved debate and who loved this House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think I tangled horns with him on a couple of occasions, but 
he was always the gentleman in debate and always the kind of 
person with whom you could discuss the issue afterwards.  He was 
the kind of person who, when I first arrived here as a rookie, as 
a senior member at that time, would be willing to talk to newer 
members and give them the benefit of his experience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recall seeing him in the last year or so.  I do not know if he 
was here for a meeting of the Canadian Association of Former 
Members of Parliament or what brought him to Ottawa but I 
remember bumping into him in the hallway, just before the last 
election.  We had occasion to renew our acquaintance and talk 
about Canadian politics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say to his wife and family that his memory will always 
be honoured among those of us who had the opportunity to serve 
with him.  I extend our condolences to them on behalf of the NDP 
caucus.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique—Mactaquac, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
on October 12 Canada lost a man who dedicated over 34 years to 
serving the people of his community, province and country. Canada 
lost a statesman held in the highest regard by all those whose 
lives he touched in so many ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On October 12 the people of western New Brunswick and Canada as 
a whole lost a friend.  Fred McCain died two Sundays ago and left 
behind a family and a province who loved him dearly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fred was a man who became the yardstick by which all other 
politicians are judged.  Throughout both his public and private 
life, Fred always acted with a genuine concern for those around 
him.  Fred was a man who did not see himself to be above those he 
represented but rather would take the time to walk through a 
potato field to check on the year's harvest and chat with the 
local farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the last times I had the opportunity to see Fred was 
during the recent election campaign.  The leader of the 
Conservative Party had taken the time out of a busy campaign tour 
through Atlantic Canada in order to stop by and say hi to an old 
friend.  The look on Fred's face as the Charest tour bus pulled 
up and Jean stepped out is something I will never forget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even in his last months, Fred took the time to grant an 
interview to local newspapers.  He took the opportunity to stress 
to the people of Carleton county the importance of a return to a 
Progressive Conservative government was in the best interests of 
our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fred's commitment to the Progressive Conservative Party and to 
the people of this nation will never be forgotten.  I consider it 
a privilege to have known Fred and to represent the portion of 
the riding he so proudly worked for just a few years ago.  It is 
an honour for me to pay tribute to him in this House.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>THE LATE RODRIGUE BOURDAGES 
</H3><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK218"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, for the benefit 
of those who did not know Rodrigue Bourdages, or who did not have the 
pleasure of meeting him, let me say that Mr. Bourdages was a major 
builder of the City of Laval, in addition to having been a Progressive 
Conservative member of Parliament under the leadership of John 
Diefenbaker. Mr. Bourdages was elected for the first time in 1958. 
Unfortunately, he passed away last weekend, at the still young age of 
73. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, I want to begin by offering my most sincere condolences to 
Mr. Bourdages' family, his wife, children and grandchildren, and his 
party colleagues. I also want to pay him a well deserved tribute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While it is not usual for us to do so, I wish to mention that some 
members of his family are here in the gallery. Johanne and Raymond 
Bourdages, as well as Rodrigue's sister, Thérèse, are here to relive 
fond memories of a father and brother who served in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Bourdages, who was of Acadian descent, was born in Halifax, in 
1924. As I said earlier, he became known in part for his central role in 
the building of Quebec's second largest city, Laval. At the time, Laval 
was made up of a number of cities and villages that were experiencing 
spectacular growth and needed someone who could bring them together, so 
they could be in a position to provide modern services. Rodrigue 
Bourdages was the one who rose to the occasion and provided his 
leadership for this extraordinary effort. He was indeed at the centre of 
one of the greatest achievements at the municipal level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, he decided as well to run as a candidate in the 1958 
election. Pierre Sévigny, who was the organizer for the Conservative 
Party in Quebec at the time, recounts a rather funny story that well 
illustrates Mr. Bourdages' character. When he contacted this person he 
did not know, Mr. Sévigny had a candidate in mind for the riding, but 
Mr. Bourdages said that he would be the candidate and the next member of 
Parliament. And in fact Mr. Bourdages did run in the election and became 
the next member of Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He served in the House of Commons until 1962. Subsequently he 
continued his political activities serving as an organizer for our party 
in Quebec. After that he was, of course, very active at the municipal 
level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of his achievements in the House still give food for thought. 
He accomplished things that are noteworthy today, because they are 
relevant to the debate on our future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was, for example, the first French Canadian to respond in French 
to the Speech from the Throne in January 19, 1962. That is not so long 
ago.  I should remind those in this House and elsewhere in the country 
who feel that French is taking up too much room that 1962—the first 
time a member rose to respond in French in the House of Commons—is 
not so long ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He instituted simultaneous interpretation and bilingual government 
cheques. It was a real revolution at the time: bilingual federal 
government cheques, when francophones had founded Canada and lived 
there. He got Mr. Diefenbaker to agree to the idea of Expo 67, which was 
being considered at the time, thus enabling Montreal to become an 
international city a few years later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned earlier, Mr. Bourdages then became an organizer for 
our party. And he was an exceptional one. He later worked as a property 
administrator for the Quebec department of public works. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Bourdages has left us something, fortunately, an autobiography. 
Written in 1988 with great sincerity and warmth, it describes a past 
that is not so distant and pays tribute to all those who, like him, 
wanted to do things, to build things, to make a contribution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have an indelible memory of Mr. Bourdages from election time. You 
will pardon a little partisanship. The year was 1988. He was on the 
podium. In 1995, during the referendum, he was there to give us a hand 
and in 1997 as well. I even proposed to Mr. Bourdages that he run again, 
but he cited his family. 
He said: “You know, Jean, I don't think my wife would agree to it.  I 
have done my bit”.  Rodrigue Bourdages, in fact did a whole lot.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Raymonde Folco (Laval West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, like the 
hon. member for Sherbrooke, I too wish to pay tribute to Rodrigue 
Bourdages, who died on October 12. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On March 31, 1958, Mr. Bourdages was elected to the House of 
Commons in the 24th Parliament as the representative for 
Montreal—Laval.  He was born in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and 
graduated from the Collège Jean-de-Brébeuf in Montreal.  He 
married Évelyne Arsenault, a native of Saskatchewan, and they had 
three children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, I did not have the pleasure of knowing 
Mr. Bourdages, who played a major role in the building of Laval and 
was very involved in the community.  He was also a Knight of 
Columbus.  He was viewed by many residents of Laval as a successful 
entrepreneur, and he was an excellent manager at the Société 
immobilière du Québec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was also vice-president of the Corporation 
d'investissements de Laval, director of the Dicana corporation and 
vice-president of Rapidco.  As a contractor, he was responsible for 
the construction of several schools and churches, which are now 
part of Laval's rich heritage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Bourdages was proud to be a Canadian and was an example to 
all his French speaking compatriots.  In 1962, he became the first 
French Canadian member of Parliament since Confederation in 1867 to 
give the address in reply to the Speech from the Throne in French. 
During this address, he expressed a wish that has since come to 
pass, for Canada now has the distinction of being the world leader 
in trade missions with its team Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said, and I quote:  “We have reason to hope that other 
markets will soon be opened for our products and that the efforts 
of free enterprise ably seconded by the officials of the trade and 
commerce department will be successful”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this same address, Mr. Bourdages expressed his deep love 
for Canada, and I quote:  “Canada is strong because it is united, 
because we have the feeling that its unity will develop into a 
closer and more efficient association—Canada is a great and 
grand country.  Certainly in its geography, but even more so in its 
citizens”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1989, out of a desire to give wider expression to his love 
for Canada, Mr. Bourdages published his memoirs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am honoured to pay tribute to him today, because it is 
through the pride of builders like Rodrigue Bourdages that Canada's 
francophones, whatever their province of origin, can proudly 
proclaim that they are part of our great country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the Government of Canada and the people of the 
riding of Laval West, I extend deepest condolences to Mrs. 
Bourdages, their children and his entire family.

It was so warm to hear these kind comments from the other 
parties.  I am glad to see members of the family here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Bourdages was a strong community worker and family man who 
played a leading role in the building industry in Laval and area. 
As a long time member of the Knights of Columbus, he achieved the 
fourth degree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his desire to help his community he ran as federal member of 
Parliament in 1957 and again in 1958 when he was elected to 
represent his constituents from the riding of Ile Jésus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To his family, who are here, I would like to extend on behalf of 
the Reform Party and members of Parliament our sincere 
condolences. I am sure Mr. Bourdages will be sorely missed by all 
who have had the very distinct privilege of knowing him.

extend our condolences to the family of Rodrigue Bourdages, who died on 
October 12. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Born in Halifax, Rodrigue Bourdages settled in Quebec and first got 
actively involved in the development of Laval-des-Rapides, one of the 16 
municipalities on l'Île Jésus, and later, after 1965, in the development 
of the city of Laval. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a building contractor in the 1950s, he pioneered the development 
of the city on the basis of urban planning standards and helped set up 
the Laval-des-Rapides police department, later to become the Laval 
police department as we know it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Between 1958 and 1962, he served his fellow citizens as the federal 
member of Parliament for l'Île Jésus, then became the administrator of 
the Montreal courthouse and the manager of the Société immobilière du 
Québec. The man who passed away last week was more than a former 
parliamentarian, he was also one of the builders of Laval, the second 
largest city in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the Bloc Quebecois, in my capacity as MP for Laval 
Centre, I want to acknowledge his contribution to the development of the 
Laval community. He served his fellow citizens with conviction and 
sincerity. He will always be a symbol of pride for his family, his

</I></B></P><P align=left>I take this moment to ask the House to remember Rodrigue Bourdages, 
who passed away on October 12, 1997 at the age of 73. Mr. Bourdages was 
born in Halifax, Nova Scotia, on October 22, 1923. He is the son of Mr.

</I></B></P><P align=left>He studied at Brébeuf school and then became a general contractor 
in Montreal. As president of Bourdages Construction Ltd., vice-president 
of Laval Investments, director of Dicana, and vice-president of Rapidco, 
he excelled as a building contractor and as a manager for the Société 
immobilière du Québec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Bourdages was a third and fourth degree member of the Knights of 
Columbus, a member of the international order of the Alhambra, and a 
member of the Knights of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was elected to the House of Commons on March 31, 1958, under the 
Progressive Conservative Party banner, and he represented his 
constituents well during his four years of tenure, until his defeat in 
1962. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Bourdages is mourned by his wife, Évelyne Arsenault, his two

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Sophia Leung (Vancouver Kingsway, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I wish to speak on habitat management in British 
Columbia.  B.C. enjoys salmon resources which are valued at 
hundreds of millions of dollars each year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Fisheries and Oceans pointed out that his 
priority for the department is conservation.  DFO's effort to 
protect the habitat has three principal goals:  fish habitat 
conservation, fish habitat restoration and fish habitat creation. 
Those goals are met through several strategies which combine 
enforcement of the Fisheries Act, scientific research and 
activities with the co-operation of local communities. 
With respect to habitat conservation, DFO staff work closely with 
developers to ensure that development proposals such as mining, 
power generation, urban development and forestry do not have a 
negative impact on the fishery.  Habitat biologists make sure 
that there will be no damage to the fishery. They advise 
developers to avoid harming fish when they are spawning or are at 
other critical stages of their development.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>DFO spends approximately $6 million and has about 75 people 
dedicated to the conservation and protection of fish habitat in 
B.C.  In addition, $2 million and 20 people work every day to 
restore fish habitat in B.C.  A further $25 million and 180 
people are involved in stewardship and salmon enhancement 
activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In all, $33 million are spent each year by DFO in managing the 
habitat and enhancing the salmon stocks in B.C.  The large 
habitat management program in B.C. reflects a strong commitment 
to that region, a recognition of the importance of the salmon to 
the people of B.C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last January the minister of DFO announced that the federal 
government would contribute $15 million over three years to 
habitat restoration and salmon enhancement.  Furthermore, the 
minister challenged the province of B.C. to match those funds. 
Today B.C. has not yet come up with the funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The goals of the program are to restore habitat, rebuild weak 
salmon stocks and to promote resources and watershed stewardship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can go on and on.  We have initiated many programs. The 
T'Sou-Ke First Nation, the South Island Streams/Community 
Fisheries Development Centre and the Island Stream and Salmon 
Enhancement Association are making vital contributions to the 
conservation of the resources and this government is proud to 
support those efforts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On October 15 the minister of DFO announced a further $2.7 
million for habitat conservation projects in Vancouver Island 
communities of Port Alberni, Port Hardy, Port McNeill and 
Courtenay.  On the Fraser River, which accounts for 60% of the 
B.C. total salmon catch, the minister of DFO recently announced 
more than $2 million for habitat restoration and salmon 
enhancement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a part of this funding, the Langley Environmental Partners 
Society and unemployed fishermen are working to protect habitat 
in the Salmon, Nicomekl, Yorkson and Bertrand river systems 
threatened by urbanization and farming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Community Fishery Development Centre in Vancouver will 
receive $150,000 to co-ordinate a coast-wide habitat data

in the collection of habitat data.

First Nations, government agencies, industry and the citizens 
around Salmon Arm will use $100,000 to help rebuild the coho 
stocks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Shuswap Nation Fishery Commission will, with $160,000, 
collect data on juvenile coho and adult abundance in the various 
streams in the North Thompson system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Community and environmental groups are also working closely with 
DFO to protect and to restore salmon and the habitat in several 
streams near Prince George.  The Baker Creek Enhancement Society 
and a local landowner have rebuilt a side channel for young 
chinook and rainbow trout. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on and on and recite many projects in which the 
government has been involved.  I would like to also mention a 
special project that is currently under way in Campbell River, 
known as the Discovery Coast Wetlands Restoration Project.  In 
this case the regional district of Campbell River is serving as 
the umbrella organization and the overall administration for a 
variety of community groups which have joined together to submit 
a comprehensive plan to improve the habitat for chinook, coho and 
steelhead in the Campbell River area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Partnering Organization is an almost $500,000 project which 
includes hake, brown, kingfisher.  The Creek Society, the 
district of Campbell River, the Steelhead Society of B.C. and the 
local developers, Campbell River Elementary School, Campbell 
River Guides Association and stream keepers, among many others, 
have been working together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My point is that many groups and the people of B.C., with the 
support of the government, are joined together to conserve the 
important natural resources, especially the salmon resources of 
the west coast. In all the government is supporting over $7 
million worth of projects this year alone and will be supporting 
over $7 million for habitat restoration and salmon enhancement 
work next year. This is a commitment to the resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I submit that this is responsible action by the government to 
protect the important fishery resources of B.C.

done in that community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a matter of fact, the transition moneys that have been 
dedicated to Campbell River and North Island fisheries 
initiatives are probably some of the best spent moneys when it 
comes to training displaced workers than is spent anywhere in 
Canada right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main program, out of a through put of 336 people, had a 
placement rate of 102 people, which is a virtually unheard of 
figure.  It works out to something like a 30% success rate. That 
compares with a success rate for the northern cod adjustment

</I></B></P><P align=left>The best numbers that I have been able to come up with for the 
TAGS retraining component are closer to 1%.  I recognize direct 
comparisons like that cannot be made.  Nevertheless, the program 
in Campbell River is being looked at by many as one that should 
be emulated in many regards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly I am a proponent of that.  I think when the federal 
government decides that it is going to allocate money, we want 
full accountability, a demonstrated set of measurable standards 
to which we will operate and to try, in one way or another, get a 
return on our investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of this, of course, has a very human dimension to it.  One 
of the things that continue to concern me is that the government 
continues to make announcements of a nature that it has no plan 
or no commitment to meet later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, we had an announcement of a $7.7 million retirement 
program for fishers on the coast. That announcement was made in 
January.  We have some older fishermen who were very much 
interested in that.  Their expectations were raised and now we 
see no commitment from the government to follow through on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member have any knowledge that there will be 
follow through from the federal government on that issue?

Madam Speaker, it is encouraging to hear both hon. members from 
the west coast speaking on this issue.  Certainly it is an issue 
that spans the entire country and touches on the Arctic Ocean as 
well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Department of Fisheries and Oceans has clearly stated that, 
based on recent program reviews, conservation is a key and core 
role of the Department of Fisheries and Oceans and a 
responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to that responsibility, I would suggest that the 
government has not lived up to that.  I am asking this member, 
specifically to the conservation of salmon in the rivers in 
British Columbia, whether she can inform us what her government 
intends to do with respect to continued support for the 
preservation for both Atlantic and Pacific salmon hatcheries.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Bernier 
(Bonaventure—Gaspé—Îles-de-la-Madeleine—Pabok, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I see we have an audience of the faithful here this 
afternoon.  We will take advantage of the opportunity to teach 
the adult class of hon. members seated across the way a thing or 
two, because they certainly need it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to speak today on a subject as crucial as the 
future of the fisheries.  I note that the Conservative Party has 
made it an opposition day topic.  That is a step in the right 
direction, but I would like, if I may, to clarify where I stand on 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree that the fishery should be discussed every day.  I see 
the Conservatives calling in the preamble to their motion for the 
House to recognize the urgent need for action to address the 
serious problems in fisheries. Well yes, there are serious problems 
in fisheries. And hooray for them, the Conservatives have woken up 
and realized it.  I must also point out they were part of the 
problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where they go off the track, however, is that their motion 
identifies the problem but is way off on the solution.  The 
Conservative motion asks the government to establish a national 
policy. I will explain why they are on the wrong track. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this motion, the Conservative Party forgets that British 
Columbia called for an agreement on co-operative management, which it 
obtained in part, and their premier, Mr. Clarke, whom I 
congratulate warmly on it, wants more because it is his perception, 
along with all the BC fishers, that the federal government is 
negotiating from a grovelling position with the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Conservatives also forget that the Government of Quebec has 
called for repatriation of part of the management of the Quebec 
fisheries, particularly the non-migratory species, and for a 
co-operative management agreement for the migratory species.  If 
a party wants to regain power, it needs to treat the east the 
same as the west. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion speaks of resource conservation, that the 
government must assume leadership. 
I must remind you that the Conservatives and the Liberals were in 
power over the last ten years, and that the problem originates with 
those two parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened this morning to the speech and the response to a 
question asked after the speech by the Conservative Party critic. 
He was replying to a question by the Parliamentary Secretary for 
Fisheries who asked him “What would you have as a national 
policy?” His reply: “More research.  More research”.  Studies 
we've got. Both the Conservatives and the Liberals have their 
studies, but they are commissioning more.  They accept the ones 
that suit them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is that they are both judge and accused.  They 
look at the biomass, for instance, determine the total allowable 
catch, and then when that figure is not high enough to suit their 
little buddies, they just cook the figures and raise the TAC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that it was an NDP colleague who called this morning 
for an investigation. 
We are in favour of one as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not in agreement with the motion, and I will explain a 
little more.  We are not in agreement with a policy that is styled 
as national and overall, but we are still less in agreement with 
the amendment proposed by the Liberal government, to continue with 
the policy already in place.  That is a free translation of what 
was said: continue the implementation of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How could I possibly give my blessing to a government that has 
been the downfall of the fisheries.  The auditor general's report 
is still fresh in everybody's mind.  The auditor general was not 
exactly kind to the Liberals. 
He told them point-blank “You created a strategy to rationalize the 
industry and allow it to survive”. What mark does he give them? 
Let me tell you: 0% because, in their obsession to reduce the 
deficit, cuts were made in manpower training, in licence buy-backs, 
in early retirement programs.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hearings started this morning in fishing communities. 
Witnesses from Newfoundland, the Gaspé, the Magdalen Islands and 
Nova Scotia were heard.  People are saying that they still need the 
Atlantic groundfish strategy because they have not yet started to 
diversify.  In some cases, it is almost out of the question.  The 
program is still needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Better still, however, people are coming with ideas on 
improving things.  They are looking to the future, something the 
government opposite is not, obviously.  The government should keep 
a close eye on the work of the standing committee. 
I think the coastal communities will show us the route to take. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not dwell on the policy of the Conservatives, because 
I learned nothing new this morning.  However, I was surprised that 
the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans actually spoke on the subject. 
I consider him brave for setting out four principles this morning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He spoke of what, in his view, could guide a national policy. 
He spoke of trying to establish a relationship between 
sustainability of the stocks and the advisability of issuing 
quotas.  That is all very well, but I heard nothing in the 
minister's speech of his course of action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also spoke of trying to strike a balance between catch size 
and fish stock renewal capacities.  Here again, the minister 
indicated no course of action. 
He provided no specifics, only principles.  I recognize that 
principles is what we are dealing with, here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister's third principle was about ensuring 
self-sufficiency for fisheries in the future.  He wants to try to 
make coastal communities and fishing associations 
self-sufficient.  He talked of his way—and here a way is 
offered to achieving independence—he spoke of co-operative, or 
joint management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every time I have heard the Liberals opposite talking of joint 
management it always translated as: “Well, ladies and gentlemen, we 
are going to manage jointly, that is, we are going to share the 
bill with you”.  And it is true, fishing licence fees have gone up, 
and, as we saw in the previous bill, under the system of joint 
management, the government was preparing to unload part of the bill 
for biological and management costs.  I still have not seen the 
benefit of this. 
The fishing community, whether coastal or midshore, has yet to see its 
share of benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fourth principle stated by the minister, and the last speaker 
boasted about this quite a bit, is conservation, the ultimate goal. For 
that I must commend the minister. No one can argue with that, not even 
a sovereignist Bloc member like me. We are all for conserving our fish 
stocks. But let us wait and see how this will be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To continue with this adult education class for the members across 
the way, with your permission, I could table before this House a 
document I released last February. We had a different fisheries minister 
at the time; it was long before an election was called. This goes to 
show that the we in the Bloc Quebecois do not wait for an election to be 
called to put proposals forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this document, I set four prerequisites to a reopening of 
fisheries; indeed, last spring, the minister was toying with the idea of 
perhaps starting to reopen fisheries. But there was not much 
consultation with fishers. The biomass threshold at which fisheries 
could reopen was not determined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were no discussions with fishers either to let them know how 
this would be done, because it has to take place gradually. We expected 
a reopening but with small quotas.

<A HREF="#LINKT72"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nothing was done to identify fishers and on what basis. Nothing was 
done in terms of identifying the nucleus of fishers who will make up 
tomorrow's fisheries. This is a serious problem. Everyone in the 
industry agrees that there are too many people active in the fisheries. 
Some will argue the harvesting capacity is too big. We will see within the 
prerequisites I will identify how a balance can be struck between the 
harvesting capacity and the number of individuals who will be able to earn 
a living fishing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us start by looking at my four prerequisites. First, the 
downsizing, or reduction of the harvesting capacity. Second, we must have 
some idea of what we will do with fishers once they start fishing again. 
This refers to versatility, to the possibility of catching various 
species. The third point critical to any reopening, to any negotiation 
and to the future of fisheries is provincial quotas. I will elaborate on 
this in a moment. The fourth point is the delegation of powers to the 
provinces, as I briefly mentioned earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How will we achieve this streamlining and why do we have to do it? 
Under its Atlantic groundfish strategy, or TAGS, the Liberal government 
promised to streamline operations. This was the ultimate goal. In return 
for this upcoming streamlining, the government was to provide income 
support. Everyone waited. People thought if they were not designated as 
surplus fishers or workers, it would mean that, some day, they would be 
able to work in the fisheries again. 
However, the Liberals fooled us, because not long after the first year 
of implementing the TAGS program, everything was stopped as regards 
buying back permits and offering preretirement programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The objective behind the streamlining was to match the harvesting 
capacity with the available biomass, once the moratoriums were over. So, 
when the minister says he wants to try match this with his second 
principle, I have suggestions for ways of doing it. An assessment of the 
situation must be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The worst as regards streamlining, and I will say it again, is the 
definition of the core group of fishers. Those who said this morning 
that the harvesting capacity must be reduced are on the right track. 
They recognize that it might be necessary to reduce it by 50%. This is 
a laudable objective. Some will suggest using more ecological fishing 
gear. I know there are several schools of thought on the issue. 
Some will say that only longlines should be used.  For those who 
have never heard of them, these are lines with nothing but baited 
hooks.  It takes a fish of a certain size to be able to take the 
hook and the bait.  That is one approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I myself am of another school of thought that says that the 
various types of gear used nowadays are aimed at different year 
classes.  In the category of mobile gear, longlines and gill nets 
each catch different year classes.  Each of these year classes has 
a mortality rate.  I think that the Department of Fisheries and 
Oceans could examine the mortality of each, and of course, if we 
wanted to catch more slightly older fish, we could perhaps reduce 
the catch of those who are taking a bit more.  But we shall see. 
I am indicating an approach, and I am open to other suggestions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is variety so necessary?  Everyone began talking about 
variety when the moratoriums were being introduced.  People said 
that when they began to fish again, they would like to be able to 
count on fishing from one freeze-up to the next, because everyone 
knows that, when winter comes in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, there is 
the problem of ice and it is very difficult to go fishing.  Or, as 
our NDP colleague said the other day, it is not easy to pick 
strawberries in January and blueberries in February. Our activities 
depend on the seasons. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1605"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT73"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why am I talking about variety?  Regardless of the gear 
fishermen have, there is always a risk that they will catch a 
species other than the one they were looking for or the one on 
their permit.  People should therefore be allowed an incidental 
catch that is a bit larger than present limits.  And there should 
be monitoring of all catches landed as to size and variety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I say variety, I am not talking about someone who sets 
out to catch herring but who sets his nets for salmon—even when he 
no longer has a commercial fishing permit for salmon.  That is not 
what I mean by variety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When fishers are after groundfish, they can end up with 
species other than cod—monkfish and rake, for example—which 
would add to the value of catches.  These are species we are not 
much used to catching at present, and particularly unused to 
selling.  But it is important that we go in that direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That will also enable us, while avoiding waste, to return to 
the sea certain of the species classified as non-commercial.  That 
would also allow us, since we are entering new markets, to say that 
the small fish taken accidentally—even though no one wants to take 
the small ones—can also be sold. 
When they are deep fishing, any fish that is brought up must be 
expected to die, because when they are brought up fast through 
several atmospheres, their guts will burst. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I see in multi-species licensing is that everyone can 
have access to various fisheries.  We often hear people calling for 
crab quotas, and they are not traditional crab fishers.  Some call 
for shrimp quotas, and they are not traditional shrimp fishers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we took the time to properly rationalize by type of 
commercial fishery, identified by name at present, the time to do 
the exercise so that each of these fisheries would be in a 
position to support the number of fishers and others working in 
it—first of all there would have to be a fishery-by-fishery 
exercise.  What I am then proposing is that, when it can be 
identified that such and such a fishery is capable of supporting 
such and such a number of persons, the type classifications 
should be removed.  The main problem is that the principal 
lucrative types of fisheries we have are highly specialized and, 
in many cases, operated only by single-licence fishers.  They do 
not, therefore, have access to diversifying their catches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I would propose is that a mechanism be put in place that 
could be called something like an individual transferable quota. 
It already exists in areas such as shrimp fishing in the St. Lawrence 
River or midshore cod fishing, but it should be expanded to other 
groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why suggest an individual transferable quota? Because, with 
individual quotas, it is possible to control the fishing effort 
of any given catching vessel. I would like this quota to be 
transferable so that, some day, groups of midshore cod fishers 
can trade quotas—against cod of course—with shrimpers using 
essentially the same type of gear, that is to say mobile gear. We 
could take similar measures regarding so-called offshore crab 
fishers whose gear is called fixed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through these mechanisms, we could establish a relationship between 
the various fishery stakeholders. 
The cornerstone of this whole downsizing process is, of course, the 
provincial quota—and in this respect the minister will have to come 
to terms with what went wrong with the TAGS program the first time 
around: insufficient involvement on the part of the provinces. Why did 
the provinces not want to get involved? Precisely because they had no 
guarantee that provincial quotas would be protected.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>How could a fisheries minister, say in Newfoundland, agree to 
reduce the number of existing plants without any guarantee that his 
quotas will be protected? It goes without saying that, in order to 
resolve the deficit problem and effect downsizing, powers will have to 
be transferred to the appropriate provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important that the minister be made aware of these four 
prerequisites and I think these four principles give him something to 
work on. I am now prepared to entertain questions and comments from my 
hon. colleagues. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK232"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Malpeque, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
enjoyed the remarks from the member for 
Bonaventure—Gaspé—Îles-de-la-Madeleine—Pabok. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member opposite makes suggestions very different from 
what I heard from the Reform Party, especially the allegations 
from the member in the back row that really what we should be 
giving people in fishing communities when they have had disasters 
is tax breaks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will tell the Reform Party that tax breaks do not work when 
there is no resource for the people to fish.  We want to change 
that.  That was the allegation from the member in the back row. 
That is the kind of stuff we hear from the Reform Party all the 
time, as if they do not care about Atlantic Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was very good to hear some of the hon. member's remarks. 
There are some suggestions that make a lot of sense.  I am 
particularly interested in his comments on transferable quotas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having come from a strong farming background, I certainly favour 
a supply managed industry and quotas which will manage the supply 
according to demand.  One of the problems with the quota system 
in the past has been that over time it concentrates the ownership 
in fewer and fewer hands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the concerns on ITQs put forward by fishers and fishing 
communities is that if they went to a transferable quota system, 
the quotas might be concentrated into corporate hands and 
therefore not meet what the real objective is which is to ensure 
long term viability for the fishing community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How in terms of the transferable quota system does the hon. 
member foresee preventing transferable quotas from becoming 
concentrated in fewer and fewer hands? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Bernier:</B> Madam Speaker, I am happy to see that the 
government party is interested in my proposals. I will continue to 
provide those opposite with a little adult education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Transferable individual quotas are arranged by and for the people 
who work in the fishing community. Before I get into politics, I would 
point out that I have worked for a fishing association in Gaspé. We 
developed one of the individual quota systems, and as we did so for and 
by the fishers, we knew who it was for and so could set a certain limit 
within the rules. I will explain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has to be anticipated because at some point it becomes 
difficult when quotas are held by only two or three. No association is 
possible. 
The maximum share of the total eligible catches that can be taken by the 
various parties must be anticipated. It is possible to go even further. 
It is possible to establish a dollar value by mutual agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If you take the time to meet with the fishers, they will tell you 
that they want an opportunity to get out. They want to be equipped to be 
able to work.  In many cases this is not possible. I do not need to be 
a dyed-in-the-wool sovereignist to come up with that. I am happy to see 
my colleague opposite, who does not share my political philosophy, take 
interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will go even a bit further in the context of multiparty 
management of catches and of individual quotas.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A provincial partnership is necessary and there has to be a 
provincial quota so that the provinces can say: “Okay, with such a small 
percentage, we will streamline our processing industry”. If a province 
had this type of undertaking, with Ottawa if necessary, individual 
quotas could be established. In other words, the available resources 
would be put on the table and we would look at how many fishers could 
live off them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And here I will go a little further. Things could be organized not 
only by province but also by coastal region. If I take the example of 
Quebec—I will leave it up to the parliamentary secretary from Prince 
Edward Island to speak for his region—it is because we in Quebec have 
four main pillars. 
There is the north shore of Quebec, the north part of the Gaspé, the 
south side of the Gaspé, that is, the baie des Chaleurs and the Magdalen 
Islands. I would not want fishers in the northern Gaspé to be drawing on 
the quotas of the people of the Magdalen Islands and vice versa. If we 
protect each other in our communities, the provinces should also protect 
one another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the fishers who are fishing at moment. Some licences are for 
processing plants. Some have a grandfather clause.  Perhaps we could 
look with them at ways to manage things, except that the plants need 
resources to process. 
There is always some give-and-take in negotiations. However, the 
government must show from the outset a will to provide provincial 
protection, to allow a system of individual quotas, and to put in place 
a structure that will prevent any concentration. We want fishers to have 
access to that process themselves. It may be decided that the permit 
holder will be the operator of the boat. All this can be included in the 
system of transferable individual quotas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes without saying that this implies something in return, as 
fishers must go through the controls at the docks. Some things must be 
included in the package. 
When we talk about partnership and co-management, if fishers are 
designated and told which group they can join, if they know where the 
minister is going and at what negotiation table they will be invited to 
sit, in return, they will say “Okay, we know the number of players 
involved, now we can talk”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had this discussion with many associations. Sure, I still have to 
establish some contacts. However, I want hon. members to realize that 
the issue of protection through provincial quotas is extremely 
important. If I were a provincial fisheries minister, I would never 
agree to reduce the number of processing plants without a guarantee that 
my percentage would remain the same. We must always be prepared. This is 
why we have everything to gain by examining the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I still have the floor, I would like to say that I thought 
the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans would provide an answer. But it is 
his right to leave the floor to his parliamentary secretary. I would 
have liked to talk to him in more detail about the Atlantic groundfish 
strategy and how he intends to go about identifying the core group of 
fishers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also have liked the minister to be here, because there are 
rumours concerning the closing of a coast guard radio station in the 
Magdalen Islands. Based on the discussions I had with the minister at 
lunch time, this station is not slated for closure. The minister even 
confirmed he was prepared to look at the most recent arguments in favour 
of keeping the radio station in operation. 
Therefore, allow me to question the government's will to establish a 
partnership, given the marks it received from the auditor general and 
its attitude regarding management in other areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am still prepared to answer questions from the parliamentary 
secretary.

transition.  Leaving more money in people's hands, no matter what 
they are doing, is very important.  A focus on retraining and a 
focus on fewer boats fishing is also crucial.  All of the 
transition strategy cannot be based on income support.

to talk again with the Reform Party member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I understood the first part of what he said clearly, he is 
saying that he would rather leave more money in taxpayers' hands 
and that that is why they are calling for a halt, if I understood 
correctly, to extending TAGS.  I am not in agreement.  If they do 
not want these amounts to keep coming up every year, the right 
action has to be taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If members take the time to read the four conditions I am 
proposing, they will find solutions that will cost the government 
nothing later on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> It is my duty, pursuant to 
Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the questions to be 
raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows: the 
hon. member for Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les 
Basques-employment insurance; the hon. member for Scarborough 
East-human rights. 
<P><A NAME="LINK234"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Martin Cauchon (Secretary of State (Federal Office of 
Regional Development—Quebec), Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am pleased 
to speak to the motion tabled by the leader of the fifth party.  I 
would like to tell the House right now that I will be dividing my 
time with my colleague, the hon. member for Gander—Grand Falls. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Martin Cauchon:</B> You see how enthusiastic the members 
opposite are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give a report on the famous Fonds Québec Côtier.  The 
results are so good that the members opposite are already excited. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion tabled by the leader of the fifth party raises an 
important issue in that it addresses the problem of the fisheries, 
particularly the Atlantic fishery.  In this sense, I must say that 
the motion has some merit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, where the government differs fundamentally with the 
motion by the leader of the fifth party is when the latter mentions 
that the government has done nothing to help, that it is 
indifferent to the fate of fishermen and their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is to largely ignore the measures put in place by this 
government, by my colleague, the Minister of Human Resources 
Development, beginning in May 1994.  Furthermore, it will be 
recalled that the measures had several components.  They were seen 
in part as emergency measures because, obviously, economic issues 
were involved, as well as more humanitarian ones.  It was necessary 
to act immediately, on an urgent basis, to help these families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In May 1994 my colleague introduced a multi-faceted program. 
Obviously, there were income support measures, which were 
transitory, but there were also economic and community measures. 
In the Province of Quebec, these measures were assigned to the 
Federal Office of Regional Development, which I have the pleasure 
to head up, and we implemented the Programme Québec Côtier.  I 
recently had an opportunity with others to look at the situation in 
the Gaspé last October 14.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The aim of the program was to ensure that we could intervene in the 
regions and communities affected by the groundfish crisis, to help not 
only the fishers affected but also all of the communities, so that the 
Canadian government together with all the people involved in economic 
development can rebuild an economic safety net by repositioning the 
fishing industry and developing new sectors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the start of my speech, I heard members of the Bloc shouting and 
enjoying the fact that I was rising to speak. 
I can understand that, because they have had little opportunity to 
become familiar with my report. I must say it is rather an eloquent one. 
It exists because of the government's intervention and because people in 
the regions affected were particularly dynamic. They knew how to roll up 
their sleeves and work together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this report, which covers the period from March 30, 1996 to 
September 30, 1997, in the context of the Québec Côtier program, 229 
requests for financial assistance were submitted to the department. Of 
this number, 121 received offers worth a total of $5.3 million. A total 
of 380 jobs were created or maintained as a result of these joint 
ventures. These figures clearly attest to the quality of the Canadian 
government's commitment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member for Sherbrooke, the leader of the fifth party, 
pointed out in his motion, these figures testify to the seriousness of 
our commitment, the quality of our leadership in this matter and our 
sensitivity to the problems of the families and people affected by the 
groundfish crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now if we look a little closer at this intervention by Québec 
Côtier, and break it down into sub-regions, in the Gaspé region, 70 
projects worth a total of $2.8 million were implemented and 200 jobs 
maintained or created. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the subject of partnership, the community futures development 
corporations, which are prime movers in the area of rural and local 
development, were brought on board. They were stakeholders in the 
program. They helped deliver the front line services of the Québec 
Côtier program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague from Abitibi pointed out, these corporations are 
without equal in regional development. The quality of assistance and 
expertise that they offer is remarkable. When we talk of accurately 
targeting interventions, we are, obviously, talking about intervening in 
technological sectors, in cutting-edge sectors but also in areas that 
are a bit more traditional. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I indicated, results are encouraging, and the results are 
encouraging because we in the Government of Canada were concerned and 
because the interventions were true to our philosophy of working in 
partnership and in tune with regional realities. This is why we joined 
up with a policy committee, and I would like to thank the members of 
this committee, and especially its chair, for having helped develop and 
implement the program. 
All of the objectives for this program for economic intervention were 
met. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As you know, my colleague has indicated that income support 
measures would end in May 1998. He also announced that he would set up 
a committee, an individual to determine the impact of the end of these 
income support measures. 
Of course the government will pay close attention to all of this 
study's recommendations.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to point out to the House that, when the time 
comes to examine future courses of action, if the government deems 
it appropriate, and particularly if my colleague deems it 
appropriate in light of the studies' findings, I must say that the 
model of the Québec Côtier program is one that had considerable 
success and, although it was an interim measure like all those 
announced, might prove to be a formula we could continue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, since I am getting the sign that my time is up—ten 
minutes is always too short, unfortunately—I would like to 
sincerely thank the people who worked on the implementation of 
this program, the members of the advisory committee, and all of 
the public, because this was obviously not an easy undertaking. 
Families were affected, but with all of the people helping, we 
have been able to take a certain number of steps that, without a 
shadow of a doubt, may make it possible for the regions affected 
to, essentially, cast their economic nets in different waters and 
to build quality businesses and, as a consequence, to develop 
quality lasting jobs, so that not only the major centres but all 
of the regions will be able to move on into the 21st century.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, as the Bloc 
Quebecois critic for regional development, I am pleased to be 
here for the first speech of the Secretary of State responsible 
for the Federal Office of Regional Development for Quebec. I 
listened carefully and noticed right away that the minister is 
very self-congratulatory. We have a self-congratulatory secretary 
of State. It is quite remarkable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He mentioned projects, indicating that some 70 projects, 
totalling $2.8 million, created 200 jobs. But the hon. member for 
Bonaventure—Gaspé—Îles-de-la-Madeleine—Pabok tells me that 
4,000 jobs were needed. So, to congratulate oneself for creating 
200 jobs is all fine and well, but 200 jobs are a far cry from 
the 4,000 that were needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this context—I listened carefully and did not miss a word of 
what he said—he congratulated the president. That is but one 
person. If he claims to have consulted the Gaspe by 
congratulating one person, the president of the steering 
committee, he is off the mark. He must do more than that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He mentioned local community futures development committees. 
That is fine but there are regional development structures in 
place in Quebec. He did not say a word about these structures, 
which have been recognized by the Quebec government, and not a 
word either about co-operation, consultation, 
collaboration—these are all good words—with the Quebec fishery 
minister, who is also the agriculture minister. He did not say a 
word about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am giving him an opportunity to tell us how well he works with 
the regional officials within structures under the jurisdiction 
of Quebec and I would like the Minister of Agriculture, or else 
the Secretary of State responsible for the Federal Office of 
Regional Development for Quebec, to explain how he intends to 
proceed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Martin Cauchon:</B> Madam Speaker, I am pleased to hear the first 
comments of the official Bloc Quebecois critic on regional development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Based on his comments, and given the information provided by the 
government, there seems to be a lack of experience or understanding on 
the part of Bloc members regarding regional development, including the 
number of interventions, the spirit of co-operation and the drive that 
are required not only from governments but from people in every region 
to succeed in creating jobs.

<A HREF="#LINKT79"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this respect, I want to point out that, in my main speech, I 
first thanked the members of the steering committee and the residents of 
the communities affected, because these people displayed an incredible 
drive. It was unfortunate on the part of the critic on regional 
development to say that a mere 300 or 400 jobs were created. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Two hundred jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Martin Cauchon:</B> Two hundred jobs. For them, 200 jobs is 
nothing. We should have created 4,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such a disconcerting attitude shows to what extent Bloc members can 
be disconnected from regional reality. I am pleased that the government, 
in co-operation and in partnership with all those affected by this 
crisis, managed in a short period of time to create or maintain such a 
high number of quality jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I stand by what I said earlier, namely that the role played by the 
Québec Côtier program was appropriate and meshed with other measures 
taken by the Canadian government on regional development, including 
investment funds for community future development corporations and for 
youth, and also the programming of the Federal Office of Regional 
Development, through the EEDI-EMP, and the strategic regional 
initiatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since our government took office in 1993, we have managed to 
establish good relations with the regions—in Quebec and across 
Canada—and we will continue to do so to ensure our expertise 
can be of help to the regions in their development, so that they 
can enter the new millennium with a strong momentum.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. George S. Baker (Gander—Grand Falls, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, after listening to the leader of the Progressive 
Conservative Party introduce this motion in the House and 
listening to what he said were the disaster points in the 
Canadian fishing industry, I only wish he had listened to the 
member for Sackville—Eastern Shore this morning or the MP from 
Îles-de-la-Madeleine yesterday before the committee because he 
might have learned something. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us set the record straight on one thing.  The major mistakes 
in the destruction of the northern cod were made when the 
Government of Canada decided to destroy the food of the cod.  The 
first action it took was in 1990 off the coast of the hon. 
member's riding, Sackville—Eastern Shore. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The squid caught on the Quebec coast and the coast of Nova 
Scotia and the coast of New Brunswick and the Gaspé coast and the 
coast of Newfoundland are actually born in Florida. They travel 
up the coast of the United States in a thin black line.  The 
fishermen call it the trans-Canada highway of the squid.  They go 
up the coast of Nova Scotia and into the gulf and around Quebec 
and P.E.I. and up around the coast of Newfoundland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1990, the federal government approved five foreign nations 
using factory freezer trawlers to put down nets with one-half 
inch mesh— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  One-half inch? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. George S. Baker:</B>  Yes, the fishermen used to call it 
the panty hose zone.  The fish plant workers called it the hair 
net zone.  The federal government called it the small mesh gear 
zone at that time.  Five foreign nations with licences to fish 
inside Canada's 200-mile zone interrupted the run of the squid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the leader of the Progressive Conservative Party who 
introduced this motion, were the Liberals in power in 1990 when 
this was done? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. George S. Baker:</B>  No, Madam Speaker.  Who was in power 
in 1990 when this was done? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Brian Mulroney. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. George S. Baker:</B>  It was the Tory Party of Canada. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1640"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT80"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second biggest error that was made was for the other major 
food of the codfish.  If you want to catch a codfish using bait, 
you first of all try squid.  You would then go to a fish called 
capelin.  The great capelin capture in Canada took place in 1991 
when the Soviet Union was given a quota of 100,000 tonnes of 
capelin in Canadian waters, which is more than any recorded catch 
of capelin in Canadian history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1991 was it the Liberals who were the Government of Canada? 
No.  It was the Tory party of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third greatest mistake that was made by the Government of 
Canada involved mackerel.  The greatest spawning area for 
mackerel in the world is the Gulf of St. Lawrence.  The mackerel 
enter the Gulf of St. Lawrence from the Atlantic Ocean at the end 
of May.  Prior to 1957 when the causeway was built to Cape Breton 
Island they would come in between Cape Breton Island and Nova 
Scotia.  Now they go up the coast of Cape Breton Island and in 
through Sydney Bight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1990 three foreign nations were given what were called 
experimental quotas to catch mackerel in Sydney Bight. In 1991 
five foreign nations were given so-called developmental quotas to 
catch mackerel as they entered Sydney Bight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Was it the Liberals who were the Government of Canada in 1990 
and 1991 when this was done?  Who was the Government of Canada? 
The Tory party was the Government of Canada in 1990 and 1991. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What was the greatest error ever made as far as the spawning 
grounds for codfish are concerned?  It just so happens that in 
1990 an internationally recognized spawning ground for cod, 
commonly referred to as the Flemish Cap, had had international 
protection for 10 years.  This great Canadian government in 
Ottawa went to international meetings and sat down with the 
international community under NAFO and decided to lift the 
moratorium on codfish on the Flemish Cap, on an internationally 
recognized spawning ground where a moratorium was in existence. 
That was the Canadian government in January 1991. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Was it the Liberals who were in power in 1991?  No.  The leader 
of the PC party forgets it was the Tories who were in power at 
that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  A selective memory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. George S. Baker:</B>  Yes, the Tory leader has a selective 
memory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is four or five disasters.  Let's go to another one.  It is 
what we commonly refer to on the east coast as the Greenland 
halibut disaster. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the codfish were disappearing the Government of Canada came 
into this chamber and announced the great find of the century. It 
was called an underutilized species.  It was identified as a 
Greenland halibut.  The government announced that there was so 
much of this Greenland halibut that it was going to allow 
foreigners to catch it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fishermen in the maritimes and Quebec were wondering what 
the Greenland halibut was until they saw a picture of it. 
The picture showed a flat fish called Greenland halibut, commonly 
referred to as blue halibut in Britain, black halibut in Germany, 
and a hellefisk in Denmark.  Here it was with one of the eyes up 
this way and the other eye halfway around looking like a Cyclops 
and the fishermen said “Ah, that is a Newfoundland turbot”.

<A HREF="#LINKT81"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That turbot that was classified in 1991 by the very government 
of the leader of the Tory party became the catch-all for foreign 
nations.  That fish was, it just so happens, the mainstay of the 
fishermen of eastern Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the early spring all of our fishermen would go out in the 
trap boat fishery for cod and then in the summer they would 
switch to turbot.  And the great Canadian government here in 
Ottawa made the decision that there was so much of this species 
that now foreign nations could catch it.  That was the year 1991. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Was it the Liberals who were in power in 1991?  Who was in power 
in 1991?  The Tories were in power, the very party that has moved 
this motion before the House of Commons today. The mistakes 
continued until the year 1992.  It is a great thing that in 1993 
the Liberal Party was elected so that we could try to clean up 
the mess. 
<P><A NAME="LINK237"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron (Fundy—Royal, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, I was 
very interested in the comments made by the hon. member.  I know 
that he is an individual who is deeply concerned for the welfare 
of all Atlantic Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a fellow Atlantic Canadian I also understand the tragedies 
that the families in Atlantic Canada and in British Columbia for 
that matter have actually undergone over the collapse of the 
fishery, particularly with respect to groundfish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not even live in a riding that actually has groundfish to 
speak of.  However it does not take very long for us to realize 
and contact some of our friends and our families who have 
actually ended up leaving Atlantic Canada for other places. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is important for us to recognize the real issue here. 
It is not necessarily a matter of which government was in power 
at this point.  It is not a matter of which government was in 
power before us. I know the hon. member understands this is an 
issue that has to be addressed today.  The solutions that we need 
are solutions that we need today for the future of all Atlantic 
Canadians.  I know the hon. member respects that comment. The 
motion before us today is to discuss constructive solutions about 
the future of Atlantic Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the hon. member was sincere in terms of not making this a 
partisan issue.  He has spoken often with respect to the fishery 
in Newfoundland.  I know he is a very respected member in 
Newfoundland.  This is an issue in which we are trying by this 
motion to ensure that we can find solutions in terms of helping 
these families who are desperately in need.  That is the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will point to my colleagues on this side of the House as well. 
I know it is in everybody's interest from time to time to make 
political hay in terms of who was in government.  But the issue 
in play is that we need to find solutions for the families who 
are hurting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. George S. Baker:</B>  Madam Speaker, I appreciate the hon. 
member's comments but I simply brought forth these examples 
because the leader of the Progressive Conservative Party during 
his speech had laid blame.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even today we are left in Canada with the decisions that 
governments made years ago.  Today a blue fin tuna would get you 
about $30,000 yet we entered into agreements years ago during the 
period of time I was talking about in which another nation has 
five times the quota of the hon. member's riding for blue fin 
tuna inside the Canadian zone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a ridiculous situation which again is a leftover from 
the early nineties.  We have to slowly try to get out of these 
agreements because it is difficult to break them immediately. 
There were 11 Cuban trawlers off the hon. member's riding in Nova 
Scotia a couple of weeks ago.  One of them had a national quota 
inside Canada's zone.  The other 10 were hired by Canadian 
companies while our fishermen sit ashore with nothing to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bottom line is that we have to try to correct the mistakes 
of the past.  That is exactly what the Government of Canada is 
trying to do and what we are trying to do as a standing committee 
with members from each side of the Chamber.  I think everybody is 
operating in unison to try to find the solutions just as the 
Government of Canada is trying to do.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to once again return to this whole question of the 
amendment that has been put forward by the Liberals on this 
opposition motion.  I would like to refer to section 566 of 
Beauchesne's. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think these amendments should be posed in such a way that they 
are more acceptable to the House of Commons.  How can that be 
when the very amendment that has been put forward by the Liberal 
government which talks about calling upon the government changes 
“establish” to “continue the implementation of a comprehensive 
national fisheries policy that demonstrates real commitment to 
resource conservation”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My point is that just last week the auditor general in his 
report said very clearly that the department has stated that its 
mandate is conservation of this fishery resource base and that is 
implied in current legislation.  Nevertheless we found— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  The motion has

an amendment in this House. I would like to refer you to 
parliamentary rules on amendments, Beauchesne's citations 567 and 
568.  The point my colleague is making is that there is a 
substantive change in the motion that was put forward by the 
Conservatives, and the fact that the Conservative motion is 
attempting to establish—

substantially different.

this under consideration.  It is not a revisitation of the same

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont—Dundas, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
there is a longstanding tradition in this House that when the

best parliamentary tradition notwithstanding the interests of the 
parties opposite to, I would simply say, expand the negative on 
the amendment by using the word, and I believe the word was 
“implement”, but that is secondary.  The principle that has to 
be maintained, defended and upheld is that of the Chair making a 
ruling and having the final decision.  There is no appeal to that 
ruling.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was very interesting to hear the history lesson by the 
government member from Gander, Newfoundland.  However, it is very 
curious that his history only went up until 1993.  What we are 
concerned about today is what is happening in terms of our 
fisheries on the east coast and the west coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pacific salmon stocks have been depleted to crisis 
proportions.  The impact that this depletion has had on the 
environment and on the lives of west coast fishers and their 
families and on coastal communities has been devastating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only has the federal government refused to support B.C. 
fishers against the tide of American commercial exploitation of 
the fisheries, but it has taken action that has devastated 
coastal communities and small and independent fishers and their 
families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my constituency of Vancouver East, many of my constituents 
are reeling from the government's utter lack of commitment to the 
Pacific fishery.  There are 10,000 commercial fishers and 6,400 
shore workers in B.C. who depend on salmon for their livelihoods. 
The average annual wholesale value of the salmon harvest in B.C. 
is approximately $500 million.  The Americans are overfishing the 
Canadian salmon and the cost to all Canadians is $60 million a 
year.  That means that four million fish are being illegally 
harvested by the Americans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The basic problem is that the U.S. is ignoring the terms of the 
Pacific salmon treaty originally signed in 1985 and under 
renegotiation since 1995.  Instead of respecting the principle 
that salmon belong to the country of origin, Alaskan fishers are 
stealing Canadian sockeye salmon returning to spawn in Canadian 
waters where they were born.  As they pass through Alaskan waters 
American fishers are taking four or five times more sockeye than 
they are entitled to under the terms of the treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even more recently, the U.S. has been aggressively overfishing 
the early run of salmon heading up the Fraser River in the south. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the devastating effect of this overfishing on the west 
coast and the blatant disregard that the Americans have shown 
Canadian sovereignty, the federal government has done little to 
change this situation.  In fact, the plan that the federal 
government has put in place is woefully inadequate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If anything it does more to hurt the majority of B.C. fishers 
than help them, indeed the Mifflin plan named after the former 
Liberal fisheries minister actually punishes Canadians because it 
forces B.C. fishers to choose one specific zone to fish and 
allows licence staffing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Mifflin plan has been an ecological and sociological 
disaster.  Internationally it has been proven that fisheries work 
when they are community based.  However, what is the federal government 
doing?  The federal government has undercut the community in 
favour of mega-companies that care more for the bottom line than 
for the preservation of our environment and our coastal 
communities.  It edges out the fishers who live and work and 
raise their families in these communities and who have a real 
vested interest in the preservation of salmon stocks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Simply put, the Mifflin plan has been a disaster in Atlantic 
Canada.  It has been a disaster in western Canada and it has been 
a disaster for all of Canada.  Even the promises that have been 
made about transitional funds have been a disaster. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government had promised $30 million to the 
transitional funds for community fisheries development program. 
In a meeting with the president of the fishers union in B.C., Mr. 
John Radosevic, I was told that the people involved in that 
transitional plan are still waiting to have an answer from the 
federal government as to whether there will be multi-year 
funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague, the member for Burnaby—Douglas, who is the critic 
for the west coast fisheries for our party, raised this in the 
House on October 1.  What did the minister say?  He said be 
patient. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fishers of the west coast and the east coast have been more 
than patient.  They have been waiting to see if this government 
will put an action plan into place to ensure there is 
preservation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only real leadership that we have seen in dealing with the 
west coast fisheries crisis has come from the premier of British 
Columbia and from many other people in my home province who 
clearly recognize that the time has come to take a stand. Premier 
Clark has been making tough decisions and what has the response 
of the federal government been? 
When the premier of B.C. moved to cancel the sea bed lease at 
Nanoose, did the federal government move to support B.C. efforts? 
No. The federal government is now suing the B.C. government and 
claiming that B.C. does not have the power to cancel the sea bed 
lease.

<A HREF="#LINKT85"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can tell the House that the federal NDP has long held the 
position that Nanoose should be closed as a sea bed testing range 
for U.S. submarines.  Why?  It is a relic of the cold war and an 
environmental hazard. My colleague, the member for 
Burnaby—Douglas, tabled a motion on this precise issue in the 
House on September 23. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, when Mr. Clark initiated legal action against Alaska and 
Washington to enforce the terms of the treaty, the federal 
government refused to support the action and went even further 
and undermined the B.C. position by releasing legal opinions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a more recent development, when the U.S. Congress recently 
held congressional hearings on the issue, the federal government 
refused to send government representatives. So Canada's position 
was not at those hearings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The leader of the NDP raised this issue in the House on 
September 25.  Now there is real concern that the U.S. may walk 
away from the treaty altogether. Clearly the federal government 
has to do everything in its power to prevent this from happening 
because chaos will ensue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The present fisheries minister, a British Columbian who we had 
hoped would take tough action, has done little to ease the burden 
of west coast fishers.  By contrast, the minister did not even 
meet with B.C. fishermen until they had been driven out of 
frustration and need to take desperate measures in blocking the 
passage of an American passenger ferry.  Even then, I am sure 
that the minister was persuaded more by American reaction than he 
was by Canadian desperation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A recent provincial public opinion polls shows that the majority 
of British Columbians support the strong actions taken by our 
provincial government to achieve a fair and workable Pacific 
salmon treaty. Why will the federal government not do the same? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals say that they want to address westerners' feelings 
of alienation, but when push comes to shove they continue to 
ignore western concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not good enough for the finance minister to attend a 
meeting on the west coast as he did last week and say “we are 
addressing your concerns”.  Instead of spending his time 
publicly bashing the premier of B.C. as he did in the House of 
Commons, the minister of fisheries should be trying to emulate 
the tough stand that our premier has taken on behalf of B.C. 
fishers and coastal communities. The only real action that the 
federal Liberals have taken is to appoint someone to monitor the 
situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>New Democrats have stood up in the House and will continue to 
stand up in the House to fight for the survival of coastal 
communities and sustainable jobs and a healthy fishery. We 
believe this must be the primary goal of the federal fisheries 
policy.  The most important step toward achieving this goal is to 
genuinely share the control of the fishery with the women and men 
in the coastal communities that catch the fish. 
<P><A NAME="LINK244"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I stand in 
amazement at what I have just heard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member said we are not doing enough to achieve a 
fair and workable fisheries treaty. That is in fact what we are 
doing.  This debate is about trying to make suggestions and all 
we heard from this member was some political rhetoric and an 
attack on the minister of fisheries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To set the member straight I will outline it again, as I have 
done many times.  Nothing can be learned in the House if members 
do not listen.  Obviously members of the NDP are less interested 
in listening and more interested in trying to protect the premier 
of British Columbia in terms of some of the errors he has made in 
terms of our trying to achieve a fair and equitable treaty with 
the U.S. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Protect Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter:</B>  We are.  Maybe the member was not 
present earlier today when the minister spoke in response to a 
question.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He clearly said that he has worked as strongly in Canada's 
interest in establishing the fishery treaty.  The fact of the 
matter is that a task force was called to explore possible 
measures on July 19.  The minister met with Premier Clark, as 
well as Minister Eggleton in Vancouver.  Minister Anderson met 
with those in the blockade to try and remove that problem.  The 
task force reported to the minister.  Minister Anderson met with 
the senators of Alaska, Oregon and Washington State. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order.  I urge the parliamentary 
secretary to refer to ministers by their title and not by name. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter:</B>  Mr. Speaker, my mistake. The Minister 
of Fisheries and Oceans met, as I said, with the senators of 
Alaska, Oregon and Washington state, with Secretary Daly and 
senior state departmental officials in Washington, with fisheries 
and environmental organizations, with Governor Knowles of Alaska, 
and the list goes on and on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we already know, this strong pressure from Canada goes right 
up to the prime minister.  We have appointed special 
representatives who will report to the prime minister and to the 
president on this issue.  The minister and the government have 
been fully engaged in efforts to resolve the Pacific salmon 
treaty dispute, doing everything we can within our power while 
the members opposite want to talk about political rhetoric.  It 
amazes me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his comments and I agree that it is important to listen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I invite the member to British Columbia so he can hear firsthand 
and listen to the concerns of fishers in coastal communities who 
feel they have been abandoned by the federal government.  When 
the member says that the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans has 
been fully engaged, fully engaged in what?  Certainly not in 
defending the interests of fishers in B.C. and supporting the 
Government of British Columbia which has been standing up for the 
fishers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Fisheries and Oceans has been engaged in soft 
peddling this issue.  Yes, it is important to listen.  It is 
important to listen to the people who are directly affected by 
the lack of a national fisheries program.  That is what this 
issue is about. 
<P><A NAME="LINK245"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, to the hon. 
member, her party, which is the governing party in British 
Columbia, has chosen to take some actions against the Americans. 
We all agree that there is need of action, a real concern on this 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Al Gore and Bill Clinton wanted a park created up in 
Tatshenshini, Mr. Harcourt said “I'll bend over and give you 
anything you want”.  He did.  What was the prime reason for 
creating the Tatshenshini? It was the unreal concern of the 
Alaskan fisherman over the downstream impacts on the Alaskan 
fishery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the member not go back to her friend, the premier of 
British Columbia, and ask him to reverse that decision on the 
Tatshenshini and put 2,000 British Columbians to work? That would 
really get the the attention of Al Gore and Bill Clinton. They 
have been sitting there watching this whole drama unfold without 
taking it seriously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think the member is 
confusing the issues.  We are here debating a motion about our 
fisheries on the east and west coasts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of British Columbia when it made the decision, a 
historic decision, to establish the Tatshenshini park, it was a 
decision that was for the environment and for our future 
generations.  It shows the commitment of the British Columbia 
government to live up to its responsibility to ensure that these 
unique areas of our province are preserved for future 
generations.

willing to stand up and take on the U.S. government over this

not be in the mess we are in today over the situation with the 
treaty.

<P><A NAME="LINK246"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, through 
you I indicate my support for the motion with respect to the 
fisheries put forward by my Conservative colleagues.  The motion 
asks the House to recognize the urgent need for action to address 
the serious problems in the fisheries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an extremely important issue for me because it has a 
direct impact on the people in my riding.  The fishery is a very 
important industry for us.  Entire villages are dependent on the 
viability of this industry.  We depend on a great number of 
resources to put bread on the table of families who survive by 
fishing. We fish for crab, shrimp, lobster, herring and some 
plaice. 
But I am going to dwell a bit more on a species we no longer fish, 
cod, and on the reduction in crab, herring and lobster quotas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the moratorium on cod, each time there are incidental 
catches of cod when people are fishing for plaice, plaice fishing 
gets shut down too.  To all intents and purposes plaice fishing is 
shut down for 50% of the season. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although I congratulate the Conservative Party for drawing 
attention to this very important issue, I find it somewhat ironic 
that they are asking the Liberal government to take action when it 
is they who are partly responsible for the crisis in the fisheries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know that the disappearance of the cod stock is due to 
poor management of the fisheries.  And who is responsible?  Our 
Liberal friends, yes, but also our friends in the Conservative 
Party.  It was the Conservatives who were irresponsible in their 
management of the fisheries throughout Canada from 1984 to 1993. 
And what was the result? 
A crisis in the cod sector that became critical and that has 
remained so to this day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Conservatives can now say that they are concerned about 
the difficult situation facing fishermen, but it is too little and 
too late.  They should have been concerned by these issues when 
they were in power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know which is worse: Conservatives who mismanaged the 
fisheries for ten years, or Liberals who are indifferent to the 
difficulties caused by the crisis.  The Liberals are like ostriches 
who stick their heads in the sand and are surprised when they pull 
them out to see boats landing empty at the docks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals are refusing to do something about the suffering 
of people by proposing immediate solutions.  The Liberals are 
refusing to recognize that some people have nothing to eat. 
As a result of the changes they brought in to employment insurance, 
fishers and plant workers have no incomes for a certain period of 
the year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is still more unforgivable, however, is the refusal to 
address the structural problems related to fishing.  We are 
debating this issue today because of a crisis that is happening 
now, and will continue, and yet this government remains passive. 
The government even says there is no fishery crisis.  It ought to 
visit the Atlantic provinces, not just the hotels of Moncton, but 
where the fishing is really taking place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government does not always react, and when it does, it 
reacts badly.  We need a proactive government that formulates short 
term strategies to deal with people's suffering but also, and 
primarily, we need long term strategies to diversify the economy of 
the communities hardest hit by these difficulties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to put into place a forum that will bring together all 
of the stakeholders affected by this issue.  This means that the 
federal and provincial governments must give up a bit of their 
power and must listen to the communities directly affected, and 
accept their proposals.  This means that everyone needs to be 
represented, people in industry and the various levels of 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This undertaking needs to be guided by certain basic 
principles.  Initially, we must ensure that resources are 
conserved.  It is very simple.  If we do not take care to manage 
the stocks, there will be no more fish and no more industry. 
Communities like ours will then disappear.  A long term preventive 
approach must therefore be the primary objective of the forum.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This forum must address the sharing of resources. We must ensure 
that every member of the community shares in the success of lucrative 
fisheries. If we want to get out of this difficult situation, we must 
all be prepared to put in an equal effort to ensure that the community 
as a whole benefits. This problem will not be resolved by going it 
alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, we must ensure that funding is available for processing. 
Why should we send our fish abroad for processing when we have the skill 
to do it at home? 
This would necessitate collaboration between the various levels of 
government as well as a commitment from industry stakeholders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fishers and plant workers are looking for work. Here is a long term 
strategy that could help ease the pinch these groups are feeling. In 
addition, this kind of initiative will promote a degree of 
diversification in our local economies. There is no quick fix, but there 
are better solutions than those put forward by the Liberals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People in the fishing industry want their government to be 
concerned with the difficulties they are facing. They do not want the 
government to penalize them, like the Liberals did, on account of the 
depletion of fish stocks. They want a proactive government capable of 
developing short term and long term solutions. 
The Liberals did not meet that challenge. When will they wake up and 
protect the interests of fishers and plant workers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, the government should in the industry to support second and 
third level processing in addition to rationalizing fisheries and 
plants, buy a few vessels, as used to be done, and give a pension to the 
people over 50 in the fishing industry who had never benefited from the 
fruits of this industry up until a few years ago, to help improve the 
situation of the fishery industry.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate 
the hon. member for Acadie—Bathurst for his speech. I also congratulate 
him for defeating the former Minister of Human Resources Development who 
contributed to causing a great deal of damage in that region with the 
employment insurance program. Today, however, we are debating the issue 
of fisheries. In a way, there is a connection between the two, because 
the Liberal government made hundreds of fishers lose their jobs, many of 
them in the Acadian peninsula, where the hon. member comes from, and 
many more in New Brunswick and throughout the maritimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question for the hon. member. Everyone knows the Liberals 
have all but disappeared in the maritimes. 
Does the hon. member think it is primarily because of the cuts to 
employment insurance, or because of the government's inaction on the 
fisheries? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would say it is both. Maybe they 
both had something to do with ousting the Liberal member from the 
Acadian peninsula, with throwing him out and replacing him with an NDP 
member. Sometimes, I refer to myself as the new NDP member in New 
Brunswick, because our party is a novelty in that province, at the 
federal level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals were ousted from the riding of Acadie—Bathurst, and 
in fact right across the Atlantic region. Earlier our friend from 
Gander—Grand Falls talked about the situation up until 1993, but he did 
not keep going because his party came to office that year. The reason 
the Liberals were ousted is that after the mess left by the 
Conservatives, they too left us a mess, after making promises to 
Canadians when they formed the opposition. 
They said they would save employment insurance, which would be a 
disaster for the Atlantic provinces.  That is what the Liberals 
said.  When they came into power, they did the same as the 
Conservatives.  They even went further. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the changes to employment insurance, they went even 
further than that.  Now people can no longer connect two fishing 
seasons, because of the problems with the fisheries.  What they 
call that now, down home, is “the black hole”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will tell you how July's changes to employment insurance 
work, in case you did not know.  I will educate you a little, if my 
predecessor has not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In May and June, we catch crab.  In July and August, there is 
nothing to fish for, where we are.  Then the herring fishery starts 
around August 28, or after the fête des Acadiens on August 15.  So 
our people suffer.  They have no employment insurance in July and 
August, because they have not had the chance to accumulate enough 
weeks with the crab fishing to be able to get employment insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government is ignoring this problem completely, 
washing its hands of the whole problem, letting our people suffer, 
and this is totally unacceptable. 
That is why the people of Acadie—Bathurst showed Doug Young the 
door on June 2. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK248"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, when the member 
mentioned New Democrat I thought he really meant new.  What we 
heard from the member for Acadie—Bathurst was similar to what we 
heard earlier from the member from B.C.  It was rhetoric about 
the minister not going into the area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will have to establish those facts because the minister 
travelled extensively in the member's riding, meeting with 
fishermen, the Sea Coast Advisory Board, the Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans for New Brunswick, the Maritime Fishermen's 
Union, the P.E.I. Fishermen's Association and the Nova Scotia 
fishing groups.  He was down to the joint meetings on fisheries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would wager a guess that if the member does not know the 
minister was in the area maybe the minister has spent more time 
in Atlantic Canada trying to resolve the problems than the member 
has spent in his own riding, from the sound of things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He talks about New Democrats.  I would like to see them come up 
with new ideas and give us some proposals we could consider 
rather than the rhetoric they are throwing at us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We moved on the EI issue to try to protect fishermen and the 
fishing communities, and we in fact have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the motion today we on this side of the House 
have begun to bring forward a comprehensive national fisheries 
policy that demonstrates a real commitment to resource allocation 
and conservation.  We have shown leadership on resource sharing 
with foreign interests.  The turbot question is a prime example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are showing sensitivity to the individuals, families and 
communities that are affected.  TAGS was an example.  There were 
some problems but we were there when we were needed and we will 
continue to be there when we are needed in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What new solution will the member propose rather than 
misrepresenting the real facts? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will reply to my colleague and 
I will use the same words he used earlier.  When he is in the 
House, he should perhaps listen and stop preparing a second 
question without listening to what is being said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I said in my speech was that I invited the Liberal 
government to visit our community.  First, I will set the record 
straight:  I never said that the minister never came to New 
Brunswick.  Second, what I said was that I invited the federal 
government to organize a forum in our community, to get the people 
in the industry together, and I made a suggestion to the effect 
that I want to get to the root of the problem and find a solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will come back to the fact that they say they wanted to 
solve our problems.  I will tell you something. 
People in my riding tried to escape the cycle of poverty because 
they could no longer work in the fish plants for a living.  All 
they were told, according to the government's recommendations, was: 
“Go and work somewhere else. Go and make some wreaths or in other 
sectors”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do you know what the Liberal government did three years ago? 
It turned around and did a poor job.  The Minister of Human 
Resources Development began checking into those who had received 
employment insurance.  What did he do?  He investigated 150 people. 
Now he is telling them: “Sorry, we made a mistake; now you owe us 
$20,000, now you owe us $25,000, because our department made a 
mistake and gave you employment insurance.  We are sorry, but you 
poor folks who can hardly put bread on the table owe us Liberals 
$25,000. 
We want you poor people to give us $40,000”.  That is what the 
Liberals have done.

during this segment of business. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members know, on Friday, October 10, the House passed new 
Standing Order 95.  This is the Standing Order that governs the 
length of speeches during the hour reserved for the consideration 
of private members' business. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The adoption of this new standing order results in the

from the last Parliament, that is, the member moving the item has 
up to 20 minutes and all other members up to 10 minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For non-votable items, as is the case today for the motion 
standing in the name of the hon. member for

up to 10 minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After all members who wish to speak have spoken and provided 
there is still time remaining, the member moving the item may 
speak for up to five additional minutes. Copies of the revised

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert Bertrand (Pontiac—Gatineau—Labelle, Lib.):</B> moved 
that Bill C-202, an act to amend the Canada health Act (nutrition 
services) be read the second time and referred to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said: Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to speak to 
Bill C-202, an act to amend the Canada Health Act.  The bill is 
intended to amend the Canada Health Act by inserting the words 
“nutrition services”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada Health Act lists insured services, and nutrition 
services are not insured. 
We all know that dieticians and nutritionists are specialists in 
nutrition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They promote the distribution and application of nutritional 
principles, advise on food choices and help prevent or treat the 
consequences of inadequate nutrition in people of all ages and 
groups from all communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They perform a professional function, whose aim is to promote 
health through healthy food choices.  Their services are used in 
hospitals, sports centres, food markets, government and 
international agencies, medical clinics and educational 
institutions, to name but a few. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public hears and reads a great deal about nutrition.  The 
industry is constantly putting new products on the market or 
promoting particular ways of eating. Because of the difficulty to 
understand and interpret this information, people often turn to 
the dietitian nutritionist, someone who understands nutrition 
because of his or her university training in this science.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dietitians and nutritionists in their concern to protect the 
public are worried about the quality of information disseminated 
about food and nutrition and want to warn people not to believe 
everything they read and hear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dietitians and nutritionists are experts in nutrition.  All that 
is medically and nutritionally required falls within their field 
of specialization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reform of the health care system, the shift to ambulatory 
care and the subsequent redeployment of professionals increase 
the number of situations where the protection of the public and 
appropriate health care need to be improved and prioritized 
despite the economic climate. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dietitians and nutritionists are in a good position to help people 
suffering from hunger. By linking their knowledge of foods with respect 
for others, they come up with creative ways of appeasing the hunger of 
thousands of people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the places that comes to mind is the Dispensaire diététique 
de Montréal, which was established over 50 years ago and which has 
helped some 2,600 pregnant women in difficulty, a third of which were 
disadvantaged, and which established a model for effective dietary 
counselling in order to be able to answer society's greatest need: child 
poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When children suffer from malnutrition, the first thing that 
springs to mind are health problems: anemia, underweight babies, delays 
in growth, deficiencies in nutritional elements such as calcium, iron, 
zinc and vitamins A and D, to name the main ones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, low birth weight is a risk factor in perinatal 
mortality and in physical and mental handicaps. It can also affect 
performance at school, reduced attention, fatigue and mood changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>School programs also try to help young people from disadvantaged 
communities eat better. For example, milk has been provided in certain 
schools for over 20 years. Programs offering snacks, soup, low cost 
meals, food banks providing non-perishable items and nutritional 
education have been set up to help young people eat properly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In another area, assessing needs, determining quantities and 
measuring effects on the organism are factors that must be taken into 
consideration in planning an expedition or athletic training. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, polar exploration requires very specific nutritional 
logistics. Everything has to be calculated. To ensure full nutritional 
value is obtained from prepared food and beverages, various factors must 
be taken into account: the explorer has to fight cold and wind, he will 
have long distances to travel, he will be carrying weight and the 
expedition may last a number of days, if not weeks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This knowledge enables the dietitian or the nutritionist to be an 
invaluable partner in organizing such an adventure. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As mentioned earlier, dietitians and nutritionists are 
specialists in nutrition. They work to disseminate and apply 
nutritional principles, guide dietary choices and help prevent or 
treat the consequences of inadequate nutrition in groups of 
various milieu and individuals of all ages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The dietitian's professional goal is to promote good health 
through proper nutrition.  An ever-increasing number of 
individuals, businesses and organizations are utilizing the 
services of a dietitian.  As members certainly know, the Canadian 
government recognizes them as a key resource in drawing up health 
policies such as Canada's food guide which provides guidelines 
for a healthy diet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Historically the first nutrition programs were offered by the 
University of Toronto in 1902 and Toronto's Hospital for Sick 
Children was the first hospital to hire a professional dietitian 
in 1908. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada there are two professional orders of dietitians: one 
in Ontario and one in Quebec.  All the other provinces and 
territories have associations recognized by their respective 
provinces and territories. 
We must therefore conclude that the profession of these persons 
is recognized by their province but not by their country.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We will remember that, in 1992, at the international conference on 
nutrition in Rome, the participating countries, including Canada, 
supported a world declaration on nutrition and made a commitment to 
develop national nutrition strategies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health Canada set up a steering committee to prepare a national 
strategy on nutrition, and the committee presented its report 
providing strategies on nutrition for new directions in health in 
the spring of 1996. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The document on the subject of nutrition as a source of savings for 
the health and social services network issued in June 1997 by the Ordre 
professionnel des diététistes du Québec indicates that good nutrition is 
very cost effective and that it rapidly improves the health of those who 
are sick, cuts medication and the risk of complication, shortens the 
length of hospital stays and reduces the rate of return to hospitals and 
transfers to chronic care centres. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A look at the particular needs of the most vulnerable groups, 
including pregnant women and elderly persons, indicates that nutrition 
is indeed a source of significant saving for the health and social 
services network. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People aged 65 years and over have twice as many chronic health 
programs as those in all other groups in the population as a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Chronic illness and physical disability combined with a reduced 
appetite seriously affect seniors' nutritional balance. The result, 
among others, is a greater risk of infection, dehydration and 
osteoporosis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The effectiveness and efficiency of health care could be 
significantly improved through early nutritional examination of people 
at risk, through special nutritional intervention and a joint action by 
all decision-makers and interveners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should remember that the population aged 65 years and over has 
almost doubled in the past 30 years, and the proportion continues to 
grow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Persons aged 65 years and over on the average have twice as many 
chronic health problems as the population as a whole. Reduced mobility 
often leads to difficulties in obtaining and preparing meals. 
A number of social factors also effect seniors' health, including loss 
of a spouse, retirement, isolation and insufficient income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because they eat less, seniors have a hard time meeting nutritional 
requirements for vitamins and minerals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is acknowledged that during chemotherapy and radiation 
treatments for cancer, multiple alimentary distresses can affect the 
individual's appetite and quality of life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why good nutrition is essential to keeping the immunity 
system healthy. Malnutrition, even low level, may upset this immunity 
balance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of the people displaying malnutrition on leaving the hospital, 29% 
are rehospitalized unexpectedly within the three months of their 
leaving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Appropriate nutritional action provides the most appropriate 
treatment of protein-caloric malnutrition in seniors preventing their 
return to hospital in the short term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An American experiment, in which elderly persons were fed 
nutritional meals at home, shows that it is possible to reduce the 
number and the length of infections as well as the number of hospital 
stays and medical complications. It should be noted that the annual cost 
of this service amounted to the cost of a single day's hospitalization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In another area, everyone has heard of osteoporosis, the 
deterioration of bone which may result in very severe fractures.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Osteoporosis patients must pay continued attention to the way they 
eat. Dietary intake of calcium and vitamin D is a decisive factor in 
prevention and treatment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One can conclude that all of these physical difficulties, linked to 
a loss of appetite, can significantly affect the balanced diet of 
seniors, who can then become weaker and weaker. They become more 
vulnerable to infection, do not have the reserves to heal fast and 
therefore they need more health care services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is obvious, as many studies have indicated, that well adapted 
and timely nutrition services can help to limit the costs of health 
services, by reducing the number of days spent in hospital, 
prescriptions and medical examinations and by delaying or even avoiding 
admission to an institution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, let us talk briefly about cardiovascular diseases, the main 
cause of death in Quebec. These insidious diseases develop throughout a 
period of at least 20 years and are linked to our lifestyles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Risk factors on which we can have some kind of influence are 
hypercholesterolemia, high blood pressure, smoking and an inactive 
lifestyle. A single one of these factors doubles the risk of disease, 
two of these factors quadruple it and three multiply it by eight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Strokes are the main causes of brain damage among adults. This 
alarming trend can be altered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995, the Massachusetts dietetic association released a study 
that showed that nutrition is the most effective and least expensive 
initial approach to the treatment of patients with low or moderate 
hypercholesterolemia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to another American study carried out in 1987 among 
patients with high blood pressure who were taking hypotensive drugs, in 
50% to 69% of all cases, nutrition can replace hypotensive drugs during 
the first year of treatment. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, my purpose today is not to convince members of 
the great value of the services provided by this group of 
professionals.  We are all convinced of that value.  In practice, 
however, this group whose national association has over 5,000 
members, over 90% of them women, is not recognized by the Canada 
Health Act. 
<P><A NAME="LINK253"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I appreciate the way in which the bill underscores the importance 
of nutrition services for Canadians.  Studies have shown beyond 
any shadow of doubt that a proper diet is very crucial to the 
healing process.  It also provides a needed preventive measure 
against illness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reformers and I are definitely in support of preventive and 
holistic measures.  I endorse the way in which the bill 
constitutes a vote of confidence in Canada's dietitians who are 
skilled professionals and who serve the Canadian public well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However I cannot support the bill for a few reasons.  First, it 
is because I am not convinced and have not been convinced by the 
member's speech that it merely extends gracious recognition to 
dietitians.  Rather it seems to put dietitians on a par with 
physicians as far as their ability to invoice the government 
directly is concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would appear that the bill will have the effect of creating a 
massive increase in expenditures due to the inclusion of 
nutrition services in the Canada Health Act.  The summary of the 
bill shows us that the bill's purpose is to include nutrition 
services in the definition of insured health services.  In fact 
they are already covered when a physician refers a patient to a 
dietitian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It occurs to me that there has to be something more about the 
bill that I am not fully aware of to this point.  If this is only 
about affirming health care providers, why not include 
physiotherapy, optometry, chiropractic services and all dentistry 
and not just surgical-dental services as the Canada Health Act 
now provides?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given my concern I cannot support the bill because it fails to 
reckon with the economic forces at play in our country right now 
in relation to the budget.  We have had a $7 billion shortfall 
from the Liberal government during the course of the last term in 
health and education.  It fails to reckon with what is going on 
with medicare in our country at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party strongly supports the public funding of 
medicare as an essential, comprehensive, universally accessible 
national health service publicly funded and portable across the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reformers also know that supporting such a program requires a 
great deal of funding.  In order for that to happen across the 
country, the funding needs to be there.  As I said before, 
funding of late has been insufficient to meet the needs of 
Canadians because of some of the cuts that have occurred over the 
course of the last number of years, expressly to the tune of some 
$7 billion for health and education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must be sober and acknowledge that the context of our debate 
today is a widely acknowledged crisis in health care funding.  It 
is in this context that we need to ask a question.  Can we afford 
to pay the additional costs that would be associated with adding 
nutritional services to the Canada Health Act?  I would say that 
the answer at this point is no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also cannot support the bill because it further complicates an 
already existing strained, tense relationship at times between 
federal and provincial governments justifiably upset with being 
short-changed in respect to provincial health dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Provincial health ministers are not waiting with bated breath 
for decrees from the House requiring additional expenditures. The 
provinces will simply not ask how high when Ottawa issues the 
command to jump.  Nor will they ask how many when Ottawa issues 
the command to make bricks out of straw. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>National standards will be meaningful and well received by the 
provinces only if they are backed by the funds needed to meet 
those standards, which is not currently the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few quick phone calls I made this afternoon divulged to me 
another concern of mine, that there has not been a consultation 
process across the country.  There has been no consultation with 
deputy ministers, health ministers and other key stakeholders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be presumptuous for us in Ottawa to tell the provinces 
what their priorities in spending should be.  There is no 
justification for fast tracking this through and giving it 
precedence over other health care services that are also 
interested in having more money to work with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In some of the health districts in Saskatoon their concerns 
revolve around MRIs and keeping beds open since 70 beds will be 
closed in the Regina District Health for two weeks over 
Christmastime.  Those people are more concerned about the 
shortfall of funding in those areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have big concerns in other areas.  Why would we add another 
area when there are big concerns and shortfalls in other areas 
that need to be shored up? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recall a story from my province within the last couple of 
weeks of a 79 year old woman from Coronoch, Saskatchewan, who had 
to wait six days to have a hip pinned.  Her life was endangered 
because of the policies of the government in terms of shortfall 
in funding.  I am sure that she and her general practitioner 
would tell us that there is need for extra funding in other areas 
before we add more areas, which is the implication of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For these and other reasons that we do not have time to get into 
I oppose the bill as it stands.  I would be open to further 
discussion in the future with the member opposite about the

am pleased to say a few words in support of Bill C-202, 
introduced by my colleague who is a physician and the hon. member 
for Pierrefonds—Dollard, and seconded by the hon. member for 
Pontiac—Gatineau—Labelle, whose riding is just beside mine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois has always been in favour of measures aimed at 
improving the health of the population. However, we always insisted on 
respecting the jurisdiction of Quebec and other Canadian provinces in 
the area of health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nutrition services can be of great help to Quebeckers and 
Canadians. 
Whether they work at the community level, in food services management, 
in education or in clinical practice, nutrition professionals help the 
population to better balance their food intake, hence their health in 
general.

<A HREF="#LINKT95"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the present context of tremendous pressure due to budget cuts 
imposed by the Liberals since they came to power, it is clear that any 
measure aimed at improving the health of Quebeckers and Canadians can 
only be welcomed. When people are in better health—something good 
eating habits can only promote—they are less likely to become 
frequent users of health services; and this relieves pressure on the 
system and reduce costs in general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That having been said, Bill C-202 is not without raising a few 
questions. 
The Canada Health Act, which would be amended by Bill C-202, sets 
out the conditions for the payment of the amounts provided under 
the 1977 Established Programs Financing Act, now part of the 
notorious Canada social transfer, for insured health services and 
related services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As you know, the Bloc Quebecois has always taken a very firm 
and very clear position on health:  the administration of health 
care is a provincial matter. It is necessary to be vigilant and 
ensure that a province that does not wish to comply with this 
measure or that wishes to introduce a similar service is 
compensated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must therefore be clear.  Nutrition services cannot help 
but have a positive impact on the health of the general public. 
And if this is done with respect for the respective jurisdictions 
of each level of government, a point that has yet to be thrashed 
out, broadening access to nutrition services will help thousands of 
Quebeckers and Canadians to achieve a better lifestyle, better 
nutrition and, therefore, better health.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour (Beauséjour—Petitcodiac, NDP):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, Canada's New Democratic Party supports the concept and 
believes the idea could be implemented with political will but 
without opening up the Canada Health Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health care is about much more than hospitals and doctors.  That 
is why the NDP has been standing in the House talking about 
issues like jobs, poverty, education for our young people and the 
social safety net. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>About 1.4 million children live in poverty in Canada.  Over 50% 
of aboriginal children both on and off reserve are living in 
poverty.  The National Forum on Health says people who have been 
unemployed for any significant amount of time tend to die 
prematurely.  That is why we continue to raise in the House daily 
the issues of employment and employment support programs like EI. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's NDP has been a long time advocate for expanding 
medicare.  We have been advocating for a national pharmacare 
program to include coverage of prescription drugs under the 
public insurance system.  Liberal cuts to federal transfers for 
health have led many provinces to de-list drugs and impose 
increased user fees.  These cuts hit poor Canadians and seniors 
hardest.  A national pharmacare program would reverse this trend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately the Liberal promise on pharmacare rings hollow. We 
have had no assurances that Liberals intend to follow through on 
their election rhetoric. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's NDP has also advocated change in the area of home care. 
A national home care program would encourage innovation in the 
area of health care and help provinces deal with the changing 
roles of hospitals and doctors.  The huge burden placed on women 
in the home, the ones who are primarily left to care for 
patients, would be reduced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's NDP will continue to fight for better health care.  We 
will fight to stop the $1.2 billion cut in federal Liberal health 
transfers this year.  We will fight for programs to relieve 
poverty and for jobs.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is important to take a look at what is happening in 
health care.  Our situation in New Brunswick is very critical, and 
I think it is very important to talk about it, because every day 
New Brunswick's newspapers carry articles about our seniors in 
nursing homes. Because of the Liberals' cuts to the provinces, 
these are no place for our seniors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My mother would not go into one of these homes, that is for 
sure.  There are some frightening stories in New Brunswick today; 
there are a number of investigations taking place into health care 
in the province. Why? 
There are two reasons: health care cuts, and cuts in provincial 
transfer payments.  In addition, our provincial Liberal government 
would rather put money elsewhere than in health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was also very surprised at the comments by the Liberal

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise to speak on this private 
member's Bill C-202, an act to amend the Canada Health Act.  I 
compliment my colleagues for the initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I want to address today the difficulty of reconciling 
the proposed amendment with the fundamental purpose and the 
intent of the Canada Health Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me say at the outset that I, and I think all other members 
of my party, are sympathetic to the concerns raised in the bill. 
Although the promotion of better nutrition is important, 
unfortunately the Canada Health Act, in my opinion, is the wrong 
instrument to achieve this objective.  I hope to illustrate that 
over the course of this intervention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada Health Act sets out the broad principles under which 
provincial plans are expected to operate.  The act establishes 
certain criteria that provincial plans must meet in order to 
qualify for their full share of the federal health care transfer 
payments.  Federal transfer payments may be reduced or withheld 
if a province does not meet the criteria and the conditions of 
the act. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These critera are the cornerstones of Canada's health care 
system. They are: reasonable access to medically required 
services, unimpeded by charges at point of service or other 
barriers; second, comprehensive coverage for medically required 
services; third, universality of insured coverage for all 
provincial residents on equal terms and conditions; fourth, 
portability of benefits within Canada and abroad; and finally, 
public administration of the health insurance plan on a 
non-profit basis. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to the above criteria, the conditions of the act 
require that the provinces provide information as required by the 
federal minister and that they also give appropriate recognition 
to federal contributions toward health care services in order to 
qualify for federal cash contributions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The act also discourages the application of extra billing or 
user charges through the automatic dollar for dollar reductions 
or withholding of federal cash contributions to a province or 
territory which permits such direct charges to patients.  In 
fact, the threat that user charges and extra billing would erode 
accessibility to needed medical care was a major impetus in the 
development of the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada Health Act was enacted to protect the fundamental 
principles of our publicly financed, comprehensive, portable, 
universally accessible health insurance system.  I think 
everybody in this House would agree that these are laudable 
objections. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our system of national health insurance, or medicare, as it is 
popularly known, is close to the hearts of Canadians and 
something too precious to tamper with for no valid reason. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians support the five principles and feel that medicare is a 
defining feature of Canada. Time and time again, polls 
demonstrate high public support for medicare. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments presented by my hon. colleague and friend, if 
adopted, would affect the definition of insured services under 
the act.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, this means that if Bill C-202 is passed by this House 
the provinces and territories would be required to provide on an 
insured basis to all of their residents nutrition services. This 
is not the purpose of the Canada Health Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the Canada Health Act is to ensure that Canadians 
have access to medically necessary hospital and physician 
services without financial or other impediments.  Moreover, 
Canada Health Act principles deal with the organization and 
delivery of health care services on the level of provincial and 
territorial plans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The addition of nutrition services to section 2 of the act would 
be intrusive and interfere with the provincial-territorial 
responsibility for health services management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly the Canada Health Act is not the proper place to 
regulate matters such as nutrition services which properly fall 
under provincial jurisdiction and are better handled at this 
level.  Even if the Canada Health Act were the appropriate place 
for such a provision it would probably not achieve its objective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The act places conditions on payments to the provinces and 
territories and can reduce or withhold transfers if these are not 
met.  It cannot dictate to a province or territory how to run its 
health care plan much less its institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government recognizes that provinces and territories 
have the primary responsibility for the organization and delivery 
of health care services and that they require sufficient 
flexibility to operate and administer their health care insurance 
plans in accordance with their specific needs and institutions. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why the flexibility inherent in the Canada Health Act 
has always been one of its strengths. Since the enactment of the 
Act in 1984, the federal government has always attempted to work 
with the provinces in order to make the act a viable piece of 
legislation. It could be dangerous to tamper with the provisions 
of the Act when they have received such wholehearted support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we want medicare to survive, we must be vigilant against 
blatant threats such as user charges. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to come back to the point that while nutrition is a 
serious concern the Canada Health Act is not the appropriate 
place in which to address this issue.  As it stands now the 
Canada Health Act does not require that the services of 
nutritionists be provided on an insured basis.  It does not 
forbid provinces and territories from providing coverage for 
these services as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the federal government the decision to provide nutrition 
services as part of a package of insured health services should 
be left to the provinces and to the territories.  This does not 
mean that the federal government has no interest in the nutrition 
issue.  Quite the contrary. The federal Department of Health has 
always been involved in the promotion of good nutrition in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1992 Health Canada released Canada's food guide to healthy 
eating. The guide provides Canadians with information on 
establishing healthy eating patterns through the daily selection 
of foods.  To date, and this will be of interest to colleagues in 
the House, over 21 million copies of the guide materials have 
been distributed. That means that every man, woman and child 
capable of reading in this country has a copy in his or her 
possession potentially. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The food guide then is currently serving as the basis for a wide 
variety of nutrition initiatives across Canada implemented by a 
broad range of partners including provincial, territorial and 
municipal governments as well as non-governmental organizations, 
consumer groups, the private sector and school boards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most recent national population health survey shows that 
more and more Canadians are taking steps to improve the quality 
of their nutrition.  This is encouraging.  I believe that it is 
important that we continue to support the efforts that promote 
the importance of good nutrition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposal put forward by my hon. colleague and friend is very 
commendable.

problems I have outlined.  That is why I cannot support the bill, 
regrettably. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Normally I would speak for much longer, but I see that my

<P><A NAME="LINK257"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Beth Phinney (Hamilton Mountain, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I also rise to speak on the subject of private member's 
Bill C-202, an act to amend the Canada Health Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the respective roles and responsibilities of the federal 
and provincial territorial governments in the area of health 
care, I believe that amending the Canada Health Act may not be 
the best approach to address the concern of our hon. colleague. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As you are already aware, under the Canadian Constitution, the 
responsibility for health care lies with the provinces and 
territories.  In other words, the provinces and territories are 
responsible for administering and delivering the health care that 
is available to Canadians. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means that the provinces and the territories act as 
planners, managers and administrators of their own health care 
systems.  In practical terms, this includes negotiation of 
budgets with hospitals, approval of capital plans and negotiation 
of fee agreements with medical associations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government, for its part by law, is responsible for 
the promotion and preservation of the health of all Canadians. 
Health Canada is responsible for bringing together parties on 
health issues of national and interprovincial concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government also assumes the responsibility for 
setting national policies and for providing health care services 
to specific groups such as treaty Indians as well as Inuit.  It 
is appropriate when describing federal responsibilities in health 
care to note what the federal government cannot do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It cannot interfere in provincial territorial responsibilities 
as defined under our Constitution, nor can it be seen to be 
infringing on these responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-202 attempts to require provinces and territories to 
provide nutrition service on an insured basis.  As it is the 
provinces and territories that are responsible for matters 
dealing with the delivery of health services, to require that 
nutrition services be added to the list of insured health 
services would be perceived as an unacceptable intrusion on the 
provincial territorial responsibilities under our Constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government cannot and should not act unilaterally in 
an area of provincial jurisdiction.  Any decision to extend the 
scope of the Canada Health Act requires extensive consultation 
and support from the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1984 concerns over hospital user fees and extra billing by 
physicians led to the passage of the Canada Health Act.  This was 
achieved with all-party support.  The federal government's aim in 
passing the Canada Health Act was to reaffirm its commitment to 
the original guiding principles expressed in the earlier 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was also to provide a mechanism to promote the provinces' and 
territories' compliance with the act's criteria, conditions and 
extra billing and user charge provisions. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, the purpose of the Canada Health Act is to allow 
Canadians reasonable access to necessary prepaid health services. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provinces and territories have retained the responsibility 
of administering their health insurance plans under the Canada 
Health Act and for managing their respective systems.  The 
management of health care personnel and related issues, such as 
the one proposed in Bill C-202, is also their responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The criteria of the Canada Health Act are known to most 
Canadians and regarded as the defining principles of medicare. 
The principles of public administration, comprehensiveness, 
universality, portability and accessibility are valued and 
cherished by Canadians who will not accept changes to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Poll after poll indicates great public support for these 
national principles. 
Even while discussions of health care reform are taking place, 
the values which are reflected in each of these principles are 
not being debated.

modernized to ensure that all Canadians continue to have access 
to needed health services.  This is of particular importance as 
delivery methods, as well as venues, change over time.  However, 
governments at all levels have articulated their support for the 
five principles of the Canada Health Act.

adjournment debate. On October 10, I asked the Minister of Human 
Resources Development a question concerning the procedure for setting 
the criteria to determine the amount of the surplus in the employment 
insurance fund. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1820"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT100"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The answer the minister gave at the time was somewhat incomplete, 
and I would like him or his representative to clarify this answer for 
me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to remind the hon. members that the auditor general 
finally came to the same conclusions as the people who rallied 
against employment insurance reform in my riding, in 
Rivière-du-Loup, l'Isle-Verte or Saint-Antonin. While the 
terminology may be different, he said essentially the same thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people asked, and so did the auditor general, how the 
employment insurance surplus is managed. We finance the EI fund by 
paying premiums, but we have no control over it. 
We do not know exactly how this works, what the criteria are and how 
large the surplus will be allowed to get. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is keeping our money in a separate account. The 
auditor asked the very same question. He suggested that there be a 
separate employment insurance account so that we will know if the 
premiums paid by employers and employees to secure an income for 
themselves between jobs is actually used for that purpose or for some 
other purpose, such as making up the government's deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all agree on the need to reduce the deficit, but we must realize 
that people are putting money into the EI fund not to reduce the deficit 
but to ensure workers have a decent income while they undergo training 
for a new job. There is nothing about that in the existing policy, and 
the auditor general backed this position in his report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The greatest concern for the public—and the auditor general 
echoed this concern after realizing in his analysis that this was not 
being done—is to determine how the reserve fund amount is set. The 
employment insurance surplus is approximately $12 billion. We started 
off with a $6 billion deficit two years ago and will end up with a $12 
billion or $13 billion surplus by December 31, 1997. 
This means that over a two-year period, the government will have taken 
between $18 billion and $19 billion from employers and employees to 
manage a fund, and we do not even know how the amount of the reserve 
will be determined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the surplus have to be $6 billion, $8 billion, $10 billion or 
$12 billion? Will it be $20 billion, $22 billion or $25 billion in a 
year? There are no set criteria and this is very surprising, because the 
immigration board is supposed to do this on the advice of the governor 
in council. One can see a pattern developing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the one hand, the Minister of Finance will, of course, want to 
reduce the deficit. This means recovering as much money as possible, 
eventually by reducing the number of weeks during which people can draw 
benefits, while increasing the number of weeks required to become 
eligible. 
On the other hand, the Minister of Human Resources Development must ask 
himself whether there will be an adequate level of income for those who 
collect employment insurance benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the program provide seasonal workers with a sufficient income 
by the end of the year? Will there be enough money for training? All 
these questions remain unanswered for the time being. We do not really 
know how the amount in the reserve will be determined. We do not know 
how the government will make rational choices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since we are in the pre-budget consultation period, this should be 
a priority. The government must tell us what will be an acceptable 
surplus for the coming year.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Patry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Indian 
Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, first I want to 
remind the hon. member that, as the Minister of Human Resources 
Development recently pointed out, the last federal budget and the main 
estimates already contain a great deal of information on the employment 
insurance fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This being said, there is no great mystery about the reserve in the 
employment insurance fund. A reserve is necessary because it allows us 
to set more stable contribution rates throughout the economic cycle, so 
that we do not have to increase these rates should a recession occur. It 
also helps us ensure there is enough money to pay the benefits when 
these benefits are most needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take a look at what happened during the last recession. 
Within a period of two years, the employment insurance fund went from a 
surplus of $2 billion to a deficit of $6 billion, and the government had 
to increase contributions by 30% at a time when it was already difficult 
to create jobs. Given these facts, the government believes it is wise to 
have a reserve in the employment insurance fund.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reserve itself can vary at any given time.  It goes up and 
down with the payment of benefits.  Right now, it is estimated to 
contain about $12 billion.  However, this amount is going to be 
reviewed and the government will soon announce its decision in this 
regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us remember that the money is held in the account against 
future expenditures that could be required under the program.  As 
for the interest, it is credited to the employment insurance 
account.  As indicated in the Main Estimates for 1997-98, the 
interest this year was $345 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The employment insurance premiums paid by workers and 
employers make it possible to offer income protection, which is 
very important for those who unexpectedly lose their jobs.  But 
best of all, employment insurance helps the unemployed to obtain 
stable jobs as quickly as possible.  That is why—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
asked the question in the House of the Minister of Foreign 
Affairs concerning the legislation passed by the Russian 
parliament disenfranchising religious minorities.  It is an 
affront to those who believe in religious freedom, democratic 
values and human rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To his credit, the minister raised the issue with 
representatives of the Russian government and expressed Canada's 
dismay at the passage of the legislation.  Coincidentally, the 
Prime Minister was in Russia on that very same day trying to get 
President Yeltsin to sign on for the land mine treaty and to 
stand up for the legal rights for Canadian investors in Russia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>News reports disclose a potential $70 million loss on a Canadian 
investment despite international and Russian judgments in favour 
of the Canadian investors.  News reports also disclose the 
climate of fear and intimidation to the Canadian employees and 
investors of that company. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the Prime Minister's intervention, President Yeltsin had 
the nerve to complain that Canada was not investing enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is there a connection between the abuse of religious minority 
rights and the abuse of investors' legal rights?  I would submit 
that the two are inextricably linked.  Religious minority rights 
in particular but human rights in general are the canary in the 
mine shaft. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A country which abuses its religious minority rights will abuse 
other legal rights as well.  Abuse of religious minority rights 
and abuse of other legal rights go together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Canadians contemplate investments in countries which 
routinely abuse minority rights, they put their investments at 
risk.  It is part of the bottom line and should be part of the 
government's advice to Canadian companies contemplating 
investments in countries whose human rights' records are somewhat 
dismal.  It is as important a consideration as dollar 
fluctuations, interest rates and workforce skills. Losing one's 
investments is the most significant cost of doing business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to move to the protection of religious and human rights 
from the fringe agenda to the concerned and make it part of the 
business agenda.  The only language that Russia and other nations 
that abuse religious minority rights understand is money. If the 
investment money dries up, there may just be an incentive to 
provide a legal framework for the protection of those citizens 
and the international investors which will lead to prosperity and 
protection for all.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, as the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs said in the House on October 20, we have 
expressed our concerns about Russia's new religion legislation 
consistently and at the highest level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister has just spent five days in Russia.  He spoke 
about the new religion legislation with President Yeltsin, Prime 
Minister Chernomyrdin, the chairman of the Federation Council and 
the speaker of the Duma Parliament.  He told each one of them 
that the legislation appears to discriminate against certain 
religions and that it is sending a negative message 
internationally about Russia's democratic reform efforts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He reminded the Russian political leaders of Russia's 
international obligations as a member of the Organization for 
Security and Co-operation in Europe, the OSCE, and of the Council 
of Europe and of the United Nations.  He cited, in particular, 
the UN Commission on Human Rights' resolution 53 on religious 
intolerance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not all.  The Minister of Foreign Affairs raised the 
issue with Russian Foreign Minister Primakov during the latter's 
visit to Ottawa on September 29 and 30. 
In July we expressed our concern about the proposed legislation 
at the OSCE meetings.  The Canadian Ambassador to Russia took up 
the issue with the Russian Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs.

countries the law has been passed.  The Kremlin has given 
assurances that minority confessions will not be adversely 
affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This gives us some margin for further interventions.  We have 
advised the Russians that we will continue to monitor 
implementation of the law very closely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many Canadian citizens and religious organizations in Canada are 
watching this issue.  We will continue to provide updates to the 
House on appropriate occasions.

the House is now deemed to have been adopted.  Accordingly the 
House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m., pursuant to 
Standing Order 24(1).
