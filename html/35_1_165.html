	The House resumed from Friday, November 25, consideration 
of the motion that Bill C-232, an act to amend the Divorce Act 
(granting of access to, or custody of, a child to a grandparent), 
be read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> When the matter was previously before 
the House, the hon. member for Elk Island had the floor. He has 
seven minutes left in his intervention.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am delighted 
to continue my speech. It is the first time that I have had 108 
days to contemplate the next sentence in the middle of a speech. 
I shall carry on. I am not going to waste my time.
<P>
	We are dealing with a very important matter. It is very 
important to recognize we are dealing with the lives of real 
people. Quite often in this place we can sink into a way of 
thinking and we forget the people behind the rules and laws we 
are passing.
<P>
	It is the same when we deal with a budget. The budget affects 
real people. This is another bill that does the same. It is a bill 
that deeply affects the lives of people, grandparents in particular 
but also grandchildren. It also affects the parents.
<P>
<B>(1105 ) </B>
<P>
	When I was contemplating what to say next, I decided I would 
try to put a human face on my remarks. I want to share the 
importance of the legislation before us concerning the rights of 
grandparents to have input into the lives of their children's 
children. Nothing is more precious than this.
<P>
	I would like to share correspondence I received on this 
subject. I received a very moving letter after I had participated 
in the debate last November 25. This letter came from people in 
Ontario who told a story of how they have been separated from 
their grandchildren. They simply asked for a measure that will 
safeguard the vital  connection and relationship between 
grandchildren and grandparents.
<P>
	We live in a age in which many people are disconnected. 
Many young people, many children have had their roots ripped 
away from them for one reason or another. The connection to 
grandparents is a very important connective root for these 
people.
<P>
	This lady said: ``For us it is over three years since we have 
heard from our only grandchildren''. I read this letter several 
days after receiving it. Just as many MPs do, I work on 
correspondence in the evening and I answered this letter quite 
late at night. This is what I said: ``I am sitting here at 10.25 p.m. 
miles away from my wife and son in Alberta, my daughter, 
son-in-law and only grandson in Saskatchewan and half way 
around the world from another son and daughter-in-law in 
Rwanda. When I read your letter I detected the pain you must 
feel. I cannot imagine the hurt you feel when you cannot talk to, 
cannot touch, cannot hug and spoil your own grandchildren. My 
family is so precious to me and I am sure that you feel the same 
about yours''. I really felt the pain that evening because the 
story so touched my heart.
<P>
	When we contemplate legislation that will grant grandparents 
reasonable and fair access to their grandchildren, there can be no 
reasonable doubt in the minds of parents or of the courts, if they 
are involved, that there is anything detrimental to the children, 
but only favourable to the children, we then proceed to provide 
this.
<P>
	Many people across the country are watching this on 
television right now. Certainly here in the House we have 
observers that have been touched by this issue. It is incumbent 
on us as legislators to do all we can.
<P>
	I received another letter from this lady after Christmas. She 
said: ``Nothing new has happened regarding news from or about 
our grandchildren. It was our fourth Christmas of not hearing, 
despite our sending cards and letters, even by registered mail. 
We feel so helpless in all this''. This is the crux of the matter. 
There is a helplessness and nowhere to turn for assistance.
<P>
	We are not asking for anything in this legislation that will be a 
great hardship on anyone. We are asking for legislation that will 
grant a point of connection between children and grandparents.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10356"> 10356 </A></B>
<P>
	I cannot help but relate this to my own situation. I really 
cannot tell members how much I really love my little grandson. 
I might as well tell the whole world that he will soon be having 
a little brother or sister. It is such a tremendously touching 
experience for us. We are so privileged to have a wonderful, 
loving relationship between our children, our son-in-law and 
our grandchild.
<P>
<B>(1110) </B>
<P>
	I cannot, for the life of me, see why anyone would put a barrier 
between children and their grandparents. Therefore we are not 
dealing here with people who have a normal relationship. That is 
true for probably 95 per cent of people whose relationships are 
not torn. As in almost all legislation, we are trying to introduce 
measures that will accommodate those people where a 
relationship is broken and there has to be some kind of 
intervention.
<P>
	We are asking all members of the House to support the bill. In 
this way people who cannot reach out and touch and hug their 
grandchildren will be given at least occasionally the privilege of 
doing so. We are asking that those parents who would stand 
between their children and the grandparents to carefully think 
about what they are doing when they introduce these barriers.
<P>
	Barring a response from parents we need legislation that 
would require them to give to some disinterested party, like a 
court if necessary, their reasons. If there is a valid reason for 
maintaining the barrier I am sure that the courts would 
understand. If there is not a valid reason then we believe it is in 
the best interests of children and grandparents to be able to see 
each other, to talk to each other, to send and receive letters, to 
send and receive phone calls in order for them to be able to 
communicate and to build on their relationship.
<P>
	In conclusion, we have so many young people in our society 
who are anchorless. They have had so many disruptions in their 
lives. Nothing is more solid than a familial relationship between 
children and parents, between children and grandparents that 
will give them, on an ongoing basis, a sense of security and 
belonging.
<P>
	I urge all members to support the bill. Let us do what is right 
for the children of our country.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Beth Phinney (Hamilton Mountain, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
1994 was declared the International Year of the Family. The 
theme as defined by the United Nations is Family, Resources 
and Responsibilities in a Changing World.
<P>
	In making this proclamation, the United Nations outlined 
some basic principles. The first of these principles is that the 
family is the basic unit of society and therefore deserves special 
attention.
<P>
	The widest possible protection and assistance should be given 
to families so that they can assume their responsibilities in the 
community. Another principle is that families take different 
forms and serve different functions from one country to another 
and within each country.
<P>
	This is very important. Changing social and economic 
conditions are bringing to the fore new issues affecting families, 
particularly children. One of the realities that cannot be ignored 
is that many marriages in Canada now end in divorce. A related 
fact is that many children are directly affected by these divorces 
although it is difficult to determine the exact number because 
there is no official information about out of court custody 
decisions. We know, for example, that in 1990 approximately 
34,000 children were involved in divorce cases in which the 
courts made custody decisions.
<P>
	From a social policy perspective, this means that Canada's 
laws, policies and programs should take into account the many 
diverse needs of families today. More specifically, our laws 
restricting divorce should reflect our society's changing needs 
and continue to ensure that the best interests of the children are 
met. That is why I am pleased to be given the opportunity to 
comment on Bill C-232 which proposes amending the Divorce 
Act to promote grandparent access.
<P>
<B>(1115) </B>
<P>
	I want to start off by saying very clearly that I believe the 
relationship between grandparent and grandchild is something 
very special, especially after the parents divorce. Grandparents 
can be an important resource to children. They can offer care and 
support and buffer children from the many changes and stresses 
associated with family breakdown. I therefore agree 
wholeheartedly with the basic principle that a child's continued 
contact with grandparents, indeed with all members of the 
child's extended family, is something that very often is in the 
best interests of the child.
<P>
	I emphasize that the best interests of the child test is a 
standard that has come to be accepted both in Canada and 
internationally as the appropriate standard to apply with respect 
to matters relating to children. It means that laws directly 
affecting children should focus on the needs and best interests of 
the child rather than on the rights of adults.
<P>
	In applying this standard it is important to acknowledge the 
writings of sociologists and psychiatrists on the subject of the 
effect of divorce on children. Researchers generally agree that 
the breakdown of the parents' marriage brings about a major 
crisis in the lives of most children and adolescents. It is an 
acutely stressful event for a child. Equally important is the fact 
that researchers also highlight the detrimental effects on 
children of ongoing conflict and litigation.
<P>
	There is widespread agreement that the most tragic and 
clinically vulnerable children are those who become the object 
of continued acrimonious custody or access battles. It is not 
difficult to imagine how upsetting such a court battle would be 
to a child with the stress, uncertainty and loyalty conflicts that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10357"> 10357 </A></B>
<P>
would accompany the litigation and with the child right in the 
centre. I bring this up because Bill C-232 seeks amendments to 
the Divorce Act which effectively would provide  grandparents 
with independent standing to apply to the court for access to, or 
custody of their grandchildren at the same time the 
grandchildren's parents are getting a divorce.
<P>
	This bill proposes that grandparents be allowed to make a 
custody and/or access application under the Divorce Act without 
being required to obtain leave of the court. Currently under the 
Divorce Act third parties, including grandparents, must have 
leave of the court to make an application for custody of or access 
to any or all children of the marriage. The requirement that 
grandparents obtain leave of the court to make application 
ensures that only where the truly serious disputes exist will 
recourse be made to the courts. In other words, it discourages the 
use of litigation.
<P>
	I am concerned that despite its good intentions this bill, which 
would allow grandparents to make a custody or access 
application under the Divorce Act as a right, could have the 
effect of encouraging grandparents to formally apply for court 
imposed access orders. I realize this is not its primary goal; 
rather it is an attempt to formally recognize a grandparent's 
legal right to access. It may however have the unintentional 
effect of increasing custody and access disputes and promoting 
litigation. I do not believe that would be in the best interests of 
children because, as I mentioned earlier, the best interests 
standard means focusing on the needs of children rather than on 
the rights of adults.
<P>
	I want to emphasize that I do appreciate the grandparents' 
overwhelming desire to ensure that they continue to see their 
grandchildren. We have to remember however that formal court 
intervention is not always required and should not be 
encouraged.
<P>
	Surely it is preferable to encourage that arrangements for 
grandparent access be worked out on the basis of trust and 
co-operation. I believe that in many cases, indeed in the 
overwhelming majority of cases, regular contact between 
grandparents and children of a broken marriage can continue 
without the need for court intervention.
<P>
	In my view, marriage breakdown is a traumatic personal 
experience for the parents and children. Children who are 
already experiencing the distress of a parental divorce do not 
need to be additionally upset by a courtroom dispute between 
the parents and grandparents concerning grandparent access 
rights.
<P>
<B>(1120 ) </B>
<P>
	Another important point which should be made is that it 
should be recognized there are limitations as to what a court 
order can accomplish and what the law can do to enforce it. It 
would be ideal if a court order awarding grandparent access 
could ensure that meaningful access would occur without 
further problems. Unfortunately this is not the case.
<P>
	A court cannot order people to change their attitudes, feelings 
or manner of relating to one another. In reality, attempts to 
enforce an access order often lead to more conflict and often 
even more litigation.
<P>
	As I said earlier, I support wholeheartedly the idea that 
children should have continued and ongoing contact with their 
grandparents. However, I fear that Bill C-232 could have the 
effect of encouraging grandparents to formally apply for court 
imposed access orders. I do not think that would be in the best 
interests of a child. I truly believe there are more efficient and 
less stressful ways to work out post-divorce access 
arrangements without the need for court intervention.
<P>
	The law is a blunt instrument. A court imposed judicially 
enforced order for grandparent access cannot take the place of a 
relationship that is allowed to occur and develop naturally.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
here we are in the second hour of debate on the bill tabled by my 
colleague from the Reform Party. The aim of this bill is to 
amend the Divorce Act, by simplifying the procedure for 
grandparents to obtain legal custody of their grandchildren.
<P>
	At the moment, grandparents wishing to obtain custody of 
their grandchildren must submit an initial application to the 
courts for leave to debate the legal custody of their 
grandchildren.
<P>
	Grandparents are currently treated like any other interested 
person. All persons other than a spouse must first obtain leave 
from the court to apply for a custody order. Grandparents have 
no special status in divorce proceedings, and the aim of a 
preliminary application is to verify the claims by the 
grandparents and to decide if it is in the best interest of the child 
for them to intervene.
<P>
	Bill C-232 would eliminate the need for grandparents to make 
this preliminary application and would enable them to become a 
party to the dispute in the same way as the spouse.
<P>
	I would first like to say to this House that I am deeply 
saddened by the number of cases in which grandchildren lose 
contact with their grandparents following a divorce. Divorce 
proceedings are extremely stressful, and the break up of the 
nuclear family is traumatic for children. It can have the effect of 
altering their personality or behaviour. Children losing contact 
with their grandparents, in addition, face further hardships.
<P>
	Children kept from their grandparents by mean parents, who 
use them to take revenge on one another, become the innocent 
victims in a form of hostage taking. They become the bargaining 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10358"> 10358 </A></B>
<P>
chip of parents whose meanness is matched only by their 
self-centredness. Nobody wins in this sort of game.
<P>
	In this light it is therefore easy to understand why my 
colleague's bill elicits such sympathy. At first glance, it seems 
to resolve the problem of the additional trauma children must 
face when their parents divorce. However, despite appearances 
and its commendable objectives, it creates more problems than 
it solves.
<P>
	Let us take a good look at Bill C-232. The proposed 
amendments aim to make it simpler for grandparents to request 
custody when parents divorce. In fact, grandparents would no 
longer be required to obtain leave of the court to present a 
request for custody of their grandchildren. Bill C-232 amends 
section 16 of the Divorce Act and places parents and 
grandparents on the same footing when it comes to custody 
requests. Six people will be involved from the outset instead of 
two.
<P>
	This six-way struggle could become an eight-way or 
sixteen-way struggle, since the Divorce Act does not define 
``grandparents''.
<P>
<B>(1125) </B>
<P>
	What about de jure grandparents? Does the term 
``grandparents'' include both biological grandparents and 
grandparents by right? What about a single mother who marries 
the father of a child, which she later adopts, and therefore gains 
a share of parental control? Can the single mother's parents be 
considered the child's grandparents under the Divorce Act? 
What about remarriage after a divorce where custody is shared?
<P>
	Take the example of the parents of Julien and Laurence. These 
children have four biological grandparents. Their parents 
divorce. The two parents remarry spouses who each have a 
child, Isabelle and Christine respectively. Isabelle and Christine 
each have four biological grandparents. If joint legal custody is 
given to Julien and Laurence's parents, these children will 
become part of two reconstituted families.
<P>
	If one of the new couples divorced, no less than eight 
grandparents would be able to obtain custody of the children. If 
both couples divorced, twelve grandparents could be involved, I 
kid you not. Julien and Laurence's four grandparents could each 
demand custody of their grandchildren by way of two distinct 
divorce proceedings. Just imagine the legal wrangling.
<P>
	If its main goal is to foster relationships between 
grandparents and their grandchildren, Bill C-232 is ineffective. 
It simplifies the procedure for grandparents but complicates the 
issue when both parents retain custody and there is no reason to 
take it away from them. In fact, with respect to their access to 
information regarding the education and welfare of the child, 
grandparents are given more rights at the time of the divorce 
than during the marriage. It is as though they have acquired 
parental authority, without the spouses being deprived of it.
<P>
	The children will be subjected to a more complex dispute 
involving a greater number of parties. Everyone will make their 
pitch, claiming to act in the best interests of the child, but it is 
still the child who suffers.
<P>
	With respect to parental authority, this is an exclusive power 
of the provinces under section 92 (13) of the Constitution Act of 
1867. This concept of civil law is the prerogative of Quebec.
<P>
	In granting more rights to grandparents, in interfering with 
the concept of parental authority at the time of a divorce 
proceeding, this bill represents an out and out encroachment on 
the jurisdiction of the provinces. It looks like Bill C-232 is 
trying to accomplish indirectly what direct action has failed to 
accomplish.
<P>
	The common law provinces have no legislation explicitly 
protecting personal relations between grandchildren and their 
grandparents. The other provinces have been concerned with 
protecting the relations between a child and his parents. This is a 
laudable goal, but it is not enough.
<P>
	Quebec, on the other hand, has enacted legislation promoting 
harmonious relations between grandparents and grandchildren. 
Article 611 of the Civil Code of Quebec allows grandparents 
who are denied such relations to make an application to the court 
for a decision on the terms and conditions of their relations with 
their grandchildren. Such an application can be made at any 
time. The spouses can be engaged in divorce proceedings or not. 
The application can be made even if the parents have never been 
married.
<P>
	Article 611 of the Civil Code is the real solution to the 
problems created when there is interference in the personal 
relations between grandchildren and their grandparents. In 
Quebec, the recourse of grandparents is clear if the dispute is 
about a deterioration in harmonious relations attributable to the 
parents. Notwithstanding its honourable intentions, Bill C-232 
is no more than a stopgap solution to the failure of certain 
provinces to bring in legislation in the area of civil law.
<P>
	There is another aspect of Bill C-232 that concerns me. 
Clause 1(2) gives grandparents the right to make inquiries, and 
to be given information, as to the health, education and welfare 
of the child.
<P>
<B>(1130) </B>
<P>
	If this amendment was made to the Divorce Act, the 
grandparents of children of divorced parents would have the 
right to be given information that the grandparents of children of 
non-divorced parents cannot obtain.
<P>
	Furthermore-and we think this is very serious-section 1(2) 
of the bill directly encroaches on Quebec's jurisdiction over the 
protection of medical and school information. Quebec already 
has its own Act Respecting Access to Documents Held by Public 
Bodies and the Protection of Personal Information.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10359"> 10359 </A></B>
<P>
	Following her consultations with legal experts, my Reform 
colleague admitted in this House on November 25, 1994 that 
this provision of the bill, and I quote: ``-may also contravene 
privacy acts or rights of the child-''
<P>
	She went on to say: ``Therefore while procedurally it cannot 
be removed at this time, I trust when the bill gets to committee 
this clause can be deleted''.
<P>
	I must congratulate my colleague on her honesty. She admits 
she was wrong about the impact of her bill and tries to 
compensate by hoping that the Standing Committee on Justice 
can improve it. Unfortunately, it is not Bill C-232's only 
shortcoming. I cannot support a flawed bill.
<P>
	In closing, I wish to reiterate my position on the fate of 
children whose parents are divorcing. I find it appalling to see 
some parents relentlessly prolonging the suffering of the young 
victims of such circumstances.
<P>
	The governments of common law provinces should make laws 
facilitating relations between grandchildren and their 
grandparents, as was done in Quebec, which is a pioneer in 
family rights.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sharon Hayes (Port Moody-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to address this bill today. I would first like 
to acknowledge the presence in the gallery of many 
grandparents. I welcome them here. These are people interested 
in this issue and I encourage them to listen and to work with us 
as we look to this legislation.
<P>
	I also recognize their contribution, especially as seniors or 
grandparents in our society, to the past, the present and 
hopefully the future of this country.
<P>
	Bill C-232 addresses the issue of granting access and custody 
to grandparents. This is a very real issue in our society. There are 
a growing number of grandparents and a growing complexity of 
marriage breakdowns and blended families within society.
<P>
	As chair of the family task force of our party, we have done a 
fair amount of work looking at families and the importance of 
families in society. In that process we have determined a 
definition of family that we are using as a benchmark, those 
individuals related by ties of blood, marriage or adoption, where 
marriage is the union of a man and a woman as recognised by the 
state. It very much includes relations of blood, which means that 
grandparents are an important part of family and should remain 
so.
<P>
	I will illustrate something that happened this week within my 
riding. We have a unique French community, one of the original 
French communities in British Columbia. It was established 
with the logging industry on the banks of the Fraser River at the 
turn of the century.
<P>
	It was a thriving community, a mill town, called 
Maillardville. Every year we have the festival du bois which 
recognizes the importance of that in our community. This year 
there was a rededication of the original Millside school. It has 
been renovated and changed with the changing neighbourhood.
<P>
	I talked with seniors, many of them watching with pride as 
being part of this community. In that crowd there were also 
second and third generation people, seniors who had attended 
that school in the 1920s. It was a French community of people 
who had shared in that community throughout their lives and 
watched their children and grandchildren raised there.
<P>
<B>(1135 ) </B>
<P>
	Through them and through their activity within their families, 
they have managed to maintain the language, the culture, the 
knowledge and the pride of their heritage, the sense of belonging 
in and around their community, the sense of history, the values 
they share and a sense of permanence within their families in 
this changing world.
<P>
	There was an understanding between those generations. It was 
not an externally imposed understanding but an internally 
shared understanding between the members of families.
<P>
	Is that typical in our society? Unfortunately it probably is not. 
We have had changes because of the tremendous new pressures 
in this society. Seventy-five per cent of mothers of school aged 
children now have full or part time work which keeps them out 
of the home. The average number of working hours in the 1950s 
was 48 in order to earn an average family income.
<P>
	Today an average family income requires two people on 
average working 65 to 75 hours every week. The stress on 
families is tremendous. Therefore, as we have heard today, there 
is a high incidence of divorce and separation within families. 
With that comes the stress, the uncertainty, the conflicting 
loyalties, et cetera, that we have heard.
<P>
	It is interesting that we have the same number of 
husband-wife households now as we had in the 1940s. 
Eighty-seven per cent of households are husband, wife and 
children. However, many of those households are second and 
third marriages or blended family units.
<P>
	We do have single parent families in our communities which 
are very much a reality. The term single parent family denies 
that a family had two parents at one point and four parents at 
some point related by blood. Single parents should not be 
deemed as alone and isolated in our society. There are relations 
and support within society for them.
<P>
	There are the factors of immigration and the mobility of 
families across the country. These put further stresses on ties of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10360"> 10360 </A></B>
<P>
blood but these separations are not as complicated by the 
tensions that we find in family break-up situations.
<P>
	Death, separation and divorce are three real factors of our 
society and they all lead very much to the breakdown of 
fundamental family ties. What we are asking today is what we 
can do about it.
<P>
	In this Chamber we should be asking about the government's 
role in doing something about this very real problem in our 
society. This Chamber recognizes in many ways that one of its 
primary responsibilities in society is to recognize the 
importance of heritage.
<P>
	We hear in eloquent speeches the importance of heritage for 
our native peoples. We hear the importance of heritage for our 
visible minorities and our many cultures. However, I would like 
to see what the importance of heritage is in our laws for 
Canadians generally.
<P>
	In family law there is an overlap between provincial and 
federal jurisdictions. Provincial law dictates what happens 
within relationships when a parent dies or when there is abuse 
within the family or when parents separate.
<P>
	In B.C. when those situations come into the legal process, 
grandparents may be granted access by application to the courts 
on the same basis as anyone else. Within that province, as in 
most provinces, there is no recognition or privilege of any kind 
by the state given to a blood relationship outside of parenthood. 
There is a presumption that perhaps the court will make this 
decision but in law there is no recognition of that blood tie.
<P>
	What we are looking at today is part of the Divorce Act. Forty 
per cent of grandparents who have access problems fall under 
the Divorce Act legislation. Anyone, blood or otherwise, can 
apply for access, and all non-parents must be given permission 
by the court to have that access. A parent comes into that 
situation with same status or same right of access as a bus driver 
or a neighbour. Their status in law is the same.
<P>
<B>(1140) </B>
<P>
	We have just come through the International Year of the 
Family. There are a couple of publications from that period, ``A 
Focus on Canada: Families in Canada'' and a look at the 
statistics in our society, ``The State of the Family in Canada''. 
These were extensive studies that looked at Canadian families. 
They made reference to care of the elderly, reference to relative 
care, divorces and marriage. There was no mention made of 
grandparents in Canadian families.
<P>
	This is in contrast to the fact that within those studies it was 
pointed out that the most common choice of child care in 
Canadian homes was by a relative in the relative's home or a 
relative in the child's home. Grandparents probably made up a 
large proportion of that. They are a very important part of what 
is happening in our society and yet they are not recognized as 
such.
<P>
	In aboriginal communities blood ties are recognized for many 
generations, not only one or two. It is only within the last few 
years that our immigration laws have been changed to not 
include grandparents.
<P>
	As a legislative body we have recognized the importance of 
blood connections through multigenerations in other cultures. 
What have we done in the Canadian population? We have 
recognized child care by grandparents in unspecified statistics. 
They are disguised in a general statistic.
<P>
	The recognition of rights of access in the laws both federally 
and provincially is no different than those for any non-parent or 
any person in society other than the parents.
<P>
	I have discovered that within tax laws and support in foster 
care in the provincial jurisdiction, strangers have more support 
than grandparents when the state mandates the care of a child. 
Grandparents have been marginalized in our society.
<P>
	This morning I heard about the rights of the child and the 
rights of the parent and even the rights the grandparent. What do 
we do when these things conflict? It is time the government 
recognizes the importance of family, not multiculturalism or 
state run day care or even government programs, but looking at 
what creates a strong society. Strong families create a strong 
society. Strong families create strong cultural ties. Strong 
families create a just society. Strong families create a strong 
economy. A child's best interests are society's best interests 
because that child is going to grow up in that society.
<P>
	One step is to recognize the rights of access by grandparents 
in law and the right of inquiry as to the well-being of their 
grandchildren and their right to know about their health, 
education and general welfare. Bill C-232 is the right step in the 
direction to empower families and underline their importance in 
our challenging and increasingly difficult role.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Dromisky (Thunder Bay-Atikokan, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is my pleasure to address this House regarding Bill 
C-232, an act to amend the Divorce Act proposed by the hon. 
member for Mission-Coquitlam.
<P>
	This bill attempts to address the needs of many concerned, 
frustrated and in many cases emotionally distraught 
grandparents who wish to have, according to their perceptions, a 
more sustainable and meaningful relationship with their 
grandchildren.
<P>
	This bill contains two main amendments to the Divorce Act of 
1986. The first aim is to eliminate the need for grandparents to 
obtain leave of the court when making a formal application for 
access or custody of their grandchildren. The second area of 
emphasis is within the granting of rights to grandparents to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10361"> 10361 </A></B>
<P>
make inquiries and to be given information on the health, 
education and welfare of the child or children.
<P>
<B>(1145) </B>
<P>
	Many people feel that these two amendments to the Divorce 
Act are long overdue and that many problems would be 
resolved. The problems to which I refer are those created by 
divorces, separations, the early death of one of the spouses or 
any other cause that results in grandparents being denied access 
to their grandchildren. In any one of these stressful situations 
the suffering of the child may be more devastating over a 
lengthy period of time than that endured by any given adult 
involved.
<P>
	In many cases the grandparents, provided they are loving, 
nurturing types, can provide a sense of stability, security and 
comfort for the bewildered children. This is exactly what 
happens in many cases.
<P>
	However, as the number of failed marriages increases, so do 
the number of court custody cases. My colleague from Hamilton 
Mountain has already informed us that in 1990 approximately 
34,000 children were involved in divorce cases in which the 
courts made custody decisions. Many more go through varying 
degrees of distress as custodial care is decided mutually outside 
the courts.
<P>
	In my community I have anxious grandparents who have no 
confirmed knowledge of the whereabouts of their 
grandchildren. This happens when a spouse passes away and the 
remaining nurturing parent moves to another community. It is 
also a common occurrence in separation cases in which the 
custodial parent moves away from grandparents. Such situations 
should not exist.
<P>
	In most cases the court may order the custodial person to 
notify any person granted access to the child of a change of 
address at least 30 days before the change. There may be many 
reasons for strained relationships between parent and 
grandparent that are child centred. Often a dominant 
grandparent may incessantly try to impose his or her value 
system, customs, behavioural codes, et cetera, on the 
grandchild. This results in a pattern of ongoing confrontation 
between the adults with the suffering child squeezed between 
them.
<P>
	In all such cases the child is the victim no matter how 
honourable the adult intentions may be. Although there are 
many factors causing the aforementioned disturbing situation, 
and even though we are aware of the potential harm to the 
children concerned, we must not endorse knee-jerk legislation 
that fails to address the issue in a rational and thoughtful 
manner.
<P>
	It is important to note that presently grandparents are not by 
any means prevented from obtaining court orders that give them 
access to their grandchildren. Existing legislation pertaining to 
the access of grandparents contained in the Divorce Act, 1986, 
states in subsection 16(1):
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A court of competent jurisdiction may on application by either or both spouses 
or by any other person make an order respecting the custody of or the access to 
any or all children of the marriage.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Subsection (3) states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A person other than a spouse may not make an application under section 1 or 2 
without leave of the court.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The intention of the amendments is an attempt to formally 
recognize a grandparent's legal right to access. Such a right 
without some screening process would result in a flood of 
custody and access disputes and wealthier lawyers.
<P>
	Supporters of the amendments should be aware of the 
limitations on what a court order can accomplish and what the 
law can do to enforce it. It has already been stated that a court 
order cannot order people to change their attitudes, feelings, or 
how they relate to one another. Certain personality types will 
always be in conflict with each other because of certain 
personality traits and characteristics. In reality attempts to 
enforce an access order often lead to more conflict and 
litigation.
<P>
	It is paramount to keep in mind that all legitimate and credible 
claims for access or custody have and will continue to have 
access to the courts, providing they are credible in nature. In this 
context a credible or legitimate case refers to claims wherein a 
close relationship between the kids and the grandparents existed 
for a significant period of time and a truly serious dispute exists 
between the grandparents and the spouse in custody of the 
children.
<P>
<B>(1150) </B>
<P>
	Presently every claim must undergo a screening process to 
ensure its legitimacy prior to gaining admission to the courts. 
The provision ensures that unnecessary and unwarranted 
litigation is avoided, thus saving Canadians vast amounts of 
money.
<P>
	We also need the check to ensure that grandparents who are 
overly intrusive and controlling do not interfere unduly with the 
parental responsibility of the parents in question. Opening the 
door for harassment of parents will not benefit children in any 
way, shape or form.
<P>
	Another important caveat pertains to the second major 
proposal in Bill C-232 whereby private information regarding 
the children is granted to those who have been awarded access. 
If it becomes a reality, we would have created a very unfair 
scenario, one in which grandparents from within divorced 
families would have access to confidential information while 
grandparents of intact families would not be granted the 
privilege.
<P>
	When grandparents strongly believe the child is being 
neglected or abused there are other avenues of proper and 
acceptable action available in Canada. For example, family 
service centres, the Children Aid Society or the police can be 
asked to assist in a process of protecting the child's welfare.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10362"> 10362 </A></B>
<P>
	As a grandparent I am truly blessed for my wife and I have 
unconditional access to the loving relationship of four 
wonderful grandchildren. We can only imagine the pain that 
some grandparents must endure who have been denied access 
to their grandchildren.
<P>
	In our case our oldest daughter is divorced. With open arms, 
we welcomed her and her three children to live with us. The joy 
of witnessing each unfolding stage of development is 
indescribable. The meaning of family continually evolves as 
three generations share the solving of problems, resources and 
time and do our best in respecting and honouring each other's 
needs.
<P>
	The amendments presented in Bill C-232 are directionally 
correct. I bring to the attention of colleagues the case of the 
death of a parent or parents, parental abuses, and even 
personality conflict between parents and grandparents. The 
rights of grandparents are governed by provincial laws that can 
vary widely.
<P>
	In British Columbia grandparents can apply for access under 
the family relations act. Alberta has no legal recourse for 
excluded grandparents. Quebec and only Quebec has enshrined 
the rights of grandparents in family law since 1981.
<P>
	The use of courts is a lengthy and very costly process. It is 
obvious that provincial and federal governments must 
co-operatively harmonize family laws and the Divorce Act to 
bring grandparents into a loving relationship with their 
grandchildren.
<P>
	For the sake of all those concerned, may co-operative effort 
result in positive directives as quickly as possible thus avoiding 
unnecessary costly litigation and unwarranted intrusion into the 
lives of parents, grandparents and grandchildren.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this is a piece 
of legislation that I look upon as an opportunity for the House of 
Commons to co-operate.
<P>
	I listened to members opposite say that the bill is directionally 
correct. I have also listened to the bill being called knee-jerk 
legislation. Somehow, when I heard that term, my heart fell a 
little because it did not sound to me like a bill that was likely to 
get a co-operative view from all parties.
<P>
	I would like to talk about the family in a general sense. Is the 
family in Canada under siege? We are treating families poorly.
<P>
	There are popular myths about Canada and the family today. 
Popular myths say that most people prefer looser family 
arrangements than the old-time family ones. There are popular 
myths that say divorce does not really have that big an effect on 
children and that alternative lifestyles compete very nicely with 
the traditional family.
<P>
<B>(1155 ) </B>
<P>
	Another myth is that the one parent working and one parent at 
home model of family is old fashioned, out of date and 
somewhat demeaning to the partner who is left  at home. 
Another says that day care is a really good or almost better 
substitute than care in the home.
<P>
	I would like to explore the myths in very straightforward 
terms. First, 70 per cent of Canadians feel the traditional family 
is the best way to raise children. A very recent poll says that the 
popular myth that other forms of family recognition are as good 
is just not true.
<P>
	The second myth is that divorce has minimal effect on 
children. As a counsellor I have seen the effect divorce has on 
children. Children are far more likely to blame themselves in the 
event of divorce. There is almost universally increased poverty 
after a family splits up. Interestingly enough children from 
divorced families are more commonly involved in divorce when 
they become adults.
<P>
	Are alternate lifestyles as good as the traditional family? 
Alternate lifestyles are neither happy nor healthy. They often 
recruit youth to that end. Who could possibly recruit youth to an 
unhappy, unhealthy lifestyle? I could not. The traditional family 
produces the most stable, well adjusted, law-abiding citizens 
from all socioeconomic groups.
<P>
	On the myth that day care is as good as normal family care, a 
meta-analysis of the issue was done. How does day care fare 
under the age of five? This meta-analysis compared different 
areas of childhood development: cognitive or in other words 
how smart kids were, social, emotional, behavioural and 
attachment to other individuals. This is summation of the 
results. It found that infants and young children who received 
substantial non-maternal care, that is care greater than 25 hours 
per week, were affected socially, emotionally, behaviourally 
and in terms of attachment to the mom. On all four counts the 
children were affected negatively.
<P>
	New data coming to light indicates that day care outside the 
home is not as good as care in the home. The data is not coming 
from wackos. It is coming from individuals looking at data from 
the U.S., Canada, Sweden; all over the world.
<P>
	As legislators how do we treat the family? As I sit in the 
Chamber a novice politician I try to look at how we treat the 
family. Divorce is pretty easy in Canada. We have poor 
maintenance agreements so a dad can disappear and not look 
after children he has sired.
<P>
	We make welfare very easy for single moms to access. Our 
attitude as legislators seems to be that the state can provide 
whatever might be missing if the family breaks down. However, 
if the extended family is willing, able and capable to take up the 
slack, if grandparents are available, willing and able to take up 
the slack, we say line up. Line up behind whom? Line up behind 
social workers, line up behind family counsellors, line up 
<P>

<B><A NAME="10363"> 10363 </A></B>
<P>
behind lawyers and line up behind judges. The significant bond 
that exists must line up. As a legislator I think that is wrong.
<P>
	I looked at the bill and said that it could well push a veritable 
army of bureaucrats and people who are not concerned about the 
child into the background and bring grandparents to where they 
rightfully belong in the foreground for the best wishes of the 
child.
<P>
<B>(1200 ) </B>
<P>
	This is the opportunity in my view. A non-partisan private 
member's bill is available for an open, free vote in the House of 
Commons. It is not a good enough bill, I have heard a couple of 
people say it could be improved. Let us go to committee with 
this bill. Let us improve it, let us pass it and let us bring the 
grandparents to where they belong, in line with their 
grandchildren.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Macleod will 
have three minutes if he wishes the next time the matter comes 
up for debate.
<P>
	The time provided for the consideration of Private Members' 
Business has now expired. Pursuant to Standing Order 96, the 
item is dropped to the bottom of the order of precedence on the 
Order Paper.

	The House resumed from February 27 consideration of the

weapons, be read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="SPEAKER'SRULING">SPEAKER'S RULING</A></H4>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Colleagues, on February 27 the hon. 
member for Yorkton-Melville sought to move an amendment 
to the motion for second reading of Bill C-68, an act respecting 
firearms and other weapons.
<P>
	A question was raised regarding the procedural acceptability 
of the proposed amendment. The Chair heard arguments from 
the hon. member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, who is the 
government whip, and the hon. House leader for the Reform 
Party before reserving his decision. The Chair wishes to thank 
those hon. members for their helpful comments.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The proposed amendment, is asking the House not to proceed 
with the second reading of Bill C-68 on the grounds that its 
provisions link the licensing and registration of firearms with 
the creation of offences relating to firearms. This kind of 
amendment is known as a reasoned amendment.
<P>
	The honourable Chief Government Whip argued that this 
motion was out of order as a reasoned amendment because it was 
not opposed to the principles of the Bill. However, Speaker 
Lamoureux, in a ruling on August 30, 1966, noted that 
opposition to the principles of a bill is, and I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>only one of the several possible forms of a reasoned amendment.</BLOCKQUOTE>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Speaker Lamoureux pointed out that several forms of 
reasoned amendment were listed in May's <I>Parliamentary 
Practice</I>, 17th edition, at page 527 and that May indicated only 
that a reasoned amendment ``may be declaratory of some 
principle adverse to, or differing from, the principles, policy or 
provisions of a bill''.
<P>
	Indeed, one of the other forms of reasoned amendment listed 
is that it ``may express opinions as to any circumstances 
connected with the introduction or prosecution of the bill, or 
otherwise opposed to its progress''.
<P>
	Finally, Speaker Lamoureux cited Abraham and Hawtrey's 
<I>Parliamentary Dictionary</I>, which states in very clear terms what 
a reasoned amendment is. It reads at page 162 as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This form of amendment seeks-either to give reasons why the house 
declines to give a second or third reading to the bill, or to express an opinion 
with regard to its subject matter or to the policy which the bill is intended to 
fulfil.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The Chair finds, after careful consideration, that the proposed 
amendment respects the definition offered in Abraham and 
Hawtrey and one of the forms listed in May, and further that it 
follows a long line of similar amendments presented in this 
House which have expressed an opinion regarding the policy or 
the provisions contained in a bill. Consequently, the Chair rules 
the amendment in order.

	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> When Bill C-68 was 
last before the House the hon. member for Jonquière had 17 
minutes remaining.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to continue my remarks on Bill C-68.
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	When I spoke on this bill previously, I said straight away that I 
agree with the principle of gun control and that, on the whole, I 
support the justice minister's bill.  Later, I will raise specific 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10364"> 10364 </A></B>
<P>
concerns I feel my party should address in a parliamentary 
committee.
<P>
	I was somewhat surprised with the type of debate that took 
place in this House around the gun control issue. I heard some 
speakers mention individual freedoms. Some spoke of the right 
for every Canadian citizen to own firearms. Others perceived 
the proposed measures as unjustified government interference 
in people's private lives.
<P>
	To some extent, we are having a societal debate here. Many 
representations were made and many letters were sent to my 
office by Canadian citizens who oppose this legislation. I read 
almost all of them to have a good idea of what the problem is.
<P>
	I think that this debate is about looking at society differently. 
It is a matter of individual freedom against public interest. No 
one in Canada, I think, opposes the right of the government to 
control firearms, to ensure that anyone who owns weapons, 
handguns in particular, be identified and be required to justify 
requesting permission to own such weapons. The problem right 
now is with the registration of firearms which are hunting 
weapons.
<P>
	Some say: ``I am an honest citizen and I am not going to cause 
problems for others with my firearms. Consequently, I do not 
see why the government wants to know if I own such firearms 
and determine whether I am allowed to do so''. Those who use 
that argument forget something important, namely that our 
society-we are not talking here about American society in the 
19th century, but about society in Canada and Quebec in 
1995-has changed. Customs have changed, as well as the 
concept of community life, and I believe that one of the main 
thrusts right now is that society is opposed to violence.
<P>
	Society is opposed to violence against women and children. 
Actions which were condoned 25 or 30 years ago are now being 
denounced and can trigger criminal proceedings. Society tells 
us, legislators, to control violence. If violence can sometimes 
show itself in such brutal and damaging ways, it is because some 
people are armed. It goes without saying that the vast majority, 
maybe 99 per cent, of those who own firearms will not commit 
violent crimes. This control which we want to implement over 
firearms may deter only a small number of people from 
misusing their firearms, or from using them with bad intentions.
<P>
	But I want to make it clear that, in my opinion, this bill is a 
message. It is a message which society is sending to itself. It is 
society which no longer wants to live in a climate of violence, 
which wants peace and safe streets, and which wants to make 
sure that, if a neighbour, a person across the street or those 
people whom one meets in one's daily activities are armed, they 
will have had to state that they own firearms.
<P>
<B>(1210) </B>
<P>
	Owning a gun does not necessarily mean a person is violent, 
but society tells us that it wants to know who has guns, so that 
the message is clear. To own a gun is, in a way, a right, but there 
is also a duty involved. Guns must be used carefully, so that no 
one is ever at risk.
<P>
	That being said, I think it is important to adopt the kind of bill 
before us today, even if it means curtailing certain individual 
freedoms. I think that, to a certain extent, society is ready for 
this bill.
<P>
	Some aspects of the bill are not entirely satisfactory, however. 
Before my time expires, I would like to comment on these 
aspects. There is the matter of prison sentences. The bill 
provides for a minimum prison sentence of four years for 
serious crimes committed with firearms. The bill also contains 
several provisions that would increase prison sentences for 
individuals convicted of contravening this legislation, once it is 
passed.
<P>
	I question the use of prison sentences and their effectiveness. 
The other day, I read in the paper that Canada ranks third among 
a number of western countries for the number of persons 
incarcerated per population of 100,000. Countries like 
Germany, France or the Netherlands have incarceration rates 
that are lower than Canada's. There is no indication, however, in 
the newspapers or in reports on the subject, that in these 
countries violence has greater impact or that people are not as 
safe as in other countries where incarceration is the measure of 
choice to control crime.
<P>
	Incidentally, the two countries where incarceration is used 
most often are Russia and the United States. The United States 
has opted for incarceration as a way of exercising social control, 
as a way of controlling crime. If we look at what is happening in 
the United States, we do not get the impression that American 
society is less violent or less dangerous than German or French 
society.
<P>
	I think that incarceration is not the right way to deal with the 
crime rate, and that is why I question some provisions of the bill 
that seem to reflect this emphasis on the deterrent effect of more 
severe prison sentences. There may be other ways to approach 
this problem. This is a very complex issue, and I think my party 
should raise it in committee.
<P>
	There is also the matter of sentencing. It is said that judges do 
not have enough leeway. The minimum sentence is too high to 
allow sufficiently for the circumstances involved. I think judges 
should be allowed greater flexibility in setting the minimum 
sentence. Obviously, when a crime is committed with a firearm, 
this is an aggravating circumstance. However, there are 
situations where a judge may have to penalize individuals 
because under the law, he must determine a minimum period of 
incarceration. This does not mean justice will necessarily be 
served in every case.
<P>

<P>
<B>(1215) </B>
<P>
	There is also the time frame. This is important in connection 
with the requirement to register a weapon and license it. If we 
add up all the possible time periods, and take into account the 
number of people currently owning firearms, we are talking 
about a period of almost seven years.
<P>
	Obviously, enough time must be allowed for the appropriate 
administrative measures to be taken to ensure an effective 
registration and licensing system is in place. However, I think 
seven years is a lot. This is a very long time, in view of the 
urgency of the situation and the value of the firearms control 
measure of registration. It would be preferable to shorten the 
time period so that people with firearms could take note of their 
responsibilities and register their weapons as quickly as 
possible.
<P>
	There is also the whole matter of costs. There are fairly low 
fees for registration and there are fees for licensing, which is 
renewable every five years. I think many people who opposed 
mandatory registration of firearms mentioned that significant 
amounts would be involved. Of course, if we add everything up, 
we arrive at a figure of perhaps several tens of millions of 
dollars. Not a mind boggling figure, but a reasonable amount, to 
some extent.
<P>
	Clearly, if we could lower the administrative costs of 
licensing and registration, it would be easier on people who have 
to keep an eye on their spending. But I do not think that the $50 
or $60 fee currently provided for under the proposed regulation 
is high enough to prevent people who would like to own guns 
from assuming their responsibilities and from registering them, 
a measure designed to let society know who is armed.
<P>
	There is another aspect. Some categories of guns-for 
example the infamous AK-47-will remain in the hands of their 
present owners. In my opinion, these kinds of weapons have no 
place in a democratic and free country. They have a history in 
several countries. They have served all sorts of purposes, not 
always noble. I think it would have been appropriate for the 
minister to immediately recall these weapons.
<P>
	Those are the main points I wanted to make about this bill, 
which is legitimate in a free and democratic society. In a society 
favouring non-violent values, it is important to know who owns 
firearms, because they increase carnage when violence breaks 
out. As well they are a symbol of violence.
<P>
	These days, no one can walk the streets with a gun without 
alarming citizens. This was not the case 30 years ago. In my own 
town, which was closer to a medium size town than a small 
town, I recall that, at 17 or 18 years of age, we went through 
town carrying our .22 calibre rifles to go target shooting in the 
fields. People did not make a fuss because most of them knew 
each other and knew who was who. They did not think we were 
violent. Nobody worried about it. But now, no one can walk the  
streets of my town, Jonquière, with a .22 rifle without the police 
hearing about it.
<P>
<B>(1220) </B>
<P>
	In my opinion, this indicates a shift in society's values and I 
believe that the time has come for us in Quebec and in Canada to 
know who is armed, who owns guns, and why, so that people 
become fully aware of their responsibilities as gun owners.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I listened to my hon. colleague's speech on Bill C-68 
with great interest, recognizing that the great thing about this 
Chamber is that we hold a wide divergence of opinion on 
controversial subjects such as gun control. I do respect his 
opinions.
<P>
	However, I want to raise a couple of issues brought out in his 
presentation. He said we will not solve the problems of crime 
through imprisonment and that he is therefore opposed or has 
some difficulty with the more stringent and tougher measures in 
Bill C-68 on the criminal misuse and abuse of firearms.
<P>
	He is opposed to deterrence through longer prison sentences. 
He mentioned there are better ways to deal with this than prison 
sentences. As is so typical when we debate bills, the Bloc fails to 
mention better ways. It consistently criticizes but does not bring 
forward any constructive criticism in the form of viable options.
<P>
	For years we have tried to rehabilitate some of these violent 
offenders but basically there are those in society for which 
rehabilitation simply does not work. That is proven time and 
time again by the high incidence of repeat offenders. Some of 
our most violent and horrendous crimes are committed by 
people who have already served prison sentences and have been 
let out on early parole only to recommit.
<P>
	Since the member raised the issue that there are better ways 
than longer prison sentences to combat crime and the criminal 
misuse of firearms, what are those better ways?
<P>
	We are now debating the motion put forward by my hon. 
colleague from the Reform Party to split the bill in two. It was 
unclear from the member's presentation whether he is in favour 
of splitting the bill in two.
<P>
	Reform feels there are two separate issues in the bill. One is 
more restrictions on law-abiding gun owners with the minister's 
firearms act and the second is more amendments to section 3 of 
the Criminal Code which deals with the criminal misuse of 
firearms which we feel are two separate issues.
<P>
	I wonder if the member could enlighten the Chamber as to 
what his feelings are on splitting the bill.
<P>

<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Caron:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for his 
question. With respect to the matter of imprisonment, I, of 
course, am not advocating that prisons be abolished or shut 
down. I do think, however, that the bill puts a little too much 
emphasis on imprisonment as a solution.
<P>
	We may, for example, wonder why there are 49 inmates per 
100,000 people in the Netherlands, compared to 116 in Canada 
and 519 in the U.S. I do not think that violence is commonplace 
in the Netherlands. I think that some societies do not see jail 
terms as a deterrent in the same way as we do in Canada and the 
U.S.
<P>
	The question I ask myself about this bill is whether the 
proposed solution of systematically increasing jail terms for 
crimes committed with firearms is effective.
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
	My colleague's second question deals with Reform's 
amendment to split the bill in two and make a distinction 
between hunting rifles owned by ordinary, law-abiding citizens, 
as my colleague would say, and handguns more often used in 
committing crimes.
<P>
	I think there is no reason to make such a distinction because, 
in my opinion, a firearm is a firearm. A misused firearm can 
cause definite, serious harm to people. It does not matter 
whether one gets shot with a 12 gauge shotgun, a hunting rifle or 
a pistol. I think that, in our society, it is important that all those 
who have the power to harm others with their firearms be aware 
of this responsibility and let society know that they have this 
potential power.
<P>
	Although these people will not, of course, misuse their 
firearms, that is still a possibility. There is no reason to make a 
distinction between presumably law-abiding citizens-and I 
agree that they are-and less respectable people who own 
handguns or other types of firearms. I do not think that a 
distinction should be made.
<P>
	In my opinion, some handguns should be completely banned 
or recalled, even if they are collector's items, because they are 
potentially dangerous.
<P>
	I do not see how it would be prejudicial to a citizen to register 
his hunting rifles. Many things are registered. Many of our 
possessions are registered and I do not think this violates 
anyone's rights.
<P>
	I will not vote for the amendment put forward by my Reform 
colleague because I do not think it should be adopted. In my 
opinion, all weapons are potentially dangerous and their owners 
should be aware of this. One way to make them aware of this is 
to require them to let society know that they own firearms and 
will live up to their responsibility to use them properly.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
there are laws that presently exist for people who are negligent 
in the use of firearms. There are laws on the books that should be 
enforced and in some cases are.
<P>
	After 61 years of registration of handguns, today one can get a 
handgun in the right bars across the whole country; there are 
even rent-a-guns. It is running rampant and the registration has 
failed to do anything.
<P>
	Can the member please explain to me how spending another 
million or billion dollars, whatever it takes to register shotguns 
and rifles, is going to make one iota of difference when it has not 
made any difference in the past.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Caron:</B> Let there be no misunderstanding, Madam 
Speaker. I believe that this bill is a message that society is 
sending to itself. It is citizens saying to each other that they want 
to live in a non-violent environment, in a less violent 
environment. They are saying that it is not good, that it is not 
acceptable in our society to possess firearms, to be able, as my 
colleague pointed out, to go to a bar and buy a handgun, 
something that I personally have never done, but that it seems is 
possible.
<P>
	In addition to its practical effectiveness in controlling 
firearms, the bill that we are examining is symbolic, it is a 
message that society is sending to itself. It is not insignificant 
that hundreds of thousands of people have signed petitions 
calling for better control of firearms in Canada. There is a 
problem, contrary to what my colleague is implying in his 
question.
<P>
<B>(1230 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> We will resume debate. 
We are now at 10-minute speeches only, no questions and 
comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Brent St. Denis (Algoma, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, it is a 
pleasure for me to speak at second reading of Bill C-68, the 
Firearms Act.
<P>
	My preparations for this began earlier last year but most 
seriously last fall with the tabling of the initial proposals in late 
November. Quite frankly I was really surprised at the degree and 
depth of response from my constituency. I represent the riding 
of Algoma in northern Ontario where we have a long tradition of 
hunting, target shooting, recreational uses of firearms and other 
reasons for having firearms.
<P>
	I was surprised at how deep and emotional the response was to 
the issue. I have had a chance to meet with over 1,000 legitimate 
gun owners over the last few months and have received letters 
and phone calls from over 1,000 gun owners and have met many 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10367"> 10367 </A></B>
<P>
of them in groups and in private. I must emphasize that 
legitimate owners and users of firearms are law-abiding citizens 
who respect the law, who want the same kind of country that  
people in the cities want, a country that is safe for everybody.
<P>
	I have to admit they make a good point when they say to me: 
``How do these new laws help the country become safer? How do 
these new laws not become a punishment for us?'' We owe it to 
the legitimate gun-owning community to explain to them 
clearly, to provide them with details which indicate that they are 
not the victims in the situation but are partners with all 
Canadians in trying to make our country safer.
<P>
	We have a way to go yet in providing full explanations. I am 
very hopeful that through the committee process, through this 
debate and future debates that many of these concerns will be 
addressed.
<P>
	I have told the gun-owning community over and over again 
that I believe in parliamentary process. I believe that 
appropriate measures with respect to firearms control can be 
taken that respect the needs of rural and urban Canadians.
<P>
	The balance between rural and urban Canada is difficult to 
find at the best of times but this is an instance where we must 
work together to find the balance. The primary purpose of my 
job with respect to Bill C-68 is to help my urban colleagues, 
urban members to understand better the needs of rural 
Canadians with respect to firearms legislation.
<P>
	The issue is not really a partisan issue because it seems to cut 
urban-rural in all parties. At the same time, I do not want it to 
become a split between urban and rural Canada. It is an 
opportunity through the parliamentary process for both rural 
and urban Canadians to understand better the needs of the other.
<P>
	It is incumbent on us to listen carefully to rural Canadians, 
those who legitimately use firearms, that they not become the 
target of this legislation. They must become partners. I look 
forward through this process to bringing forward ideas, 
amendments, proposals that will hopefully address these 
concerns. I will be seeking the co-operation of urban members 
in this regard.
<P>
	I believe deeply that the minister has been listening to rural 
members, as he listens today. I believe we can, with good 
judgment, find solutions to this matter that will be helpful to all, 
including myself, a member representing a rural area. That is 
not to say all of my constituents are in favour of not doing 
something about gun control. I have constituents that are in 
favour of these measures. It cuts both ways. In my efforts to 
represent my constituents, I must remember that both sides are 
represented in my communities.
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
	I have some serious concerns with Bill C-68 that I will raise 
through the committee process and at third reading. I have 
invited my constituents, to the extent that they can, to 
participate in the process with me. I have guaranteed them my 
commitment to carry forward their concerns.
<P>
	To start with, I would like to specifically talk about gun 
registration. My constituents have many concerns and worries 
when they have before them a plan to register their firearms. 
They worry that this will lead to the eventual confiscation of 
their firearms, particularly their long guns. They worry that the 
registration system will be an insecure information system to 
which criminals and others will have access, information 
concerning the firearms they possess.
<P>
	They worry about the cost, to themselves as individuals and 
the cost to the country. They worry that the system will be 
cumbersome and that they will have to jump through hoops. 
They worry about privacy. The fact that they own firearms is a 
matter private to them and their families.
<P>
	They wonder what impact registration will have on family 
violence and what impact it will have on the criminal element in 
our society.
<P>
	We owe it to the legal gun-owning community to explain their 
concerns item by item. I do not believe we have adequately done 
that. We have an opportunity in the weeks and months ahead to 
do it. As I have in the past I will call on my colleague, the 
Attorney General, to help with those explanations.
<P>
	Rather than go into the details of some of the things that I 
would like to see changed here, I will communicate with my 
constituents item by item as these matters come up. In view of 
the limitation of time, I wish to say that I have faith in the 
parliamentary process. I owe it to my constituents, not only on 
this issue but all issues to bring forward a balanced point of 
view.
<P>
	I have tried to convince my constituents, the gun-owning 
community in my riding, that we have an opportunity with Bill 
C-68. I know many of them are upset. Much misinformation is 
out there but we have an opportunity here to correct some of the 
problems with existing legislation and to develop a system that 
hopefully will mean this is the last time we have to debate gun 
control in Parliament.
<P>
	If we do a good job now as parliamentarians, if we do a good 
job listening to our constituents, and if the committee is 
prepared to listen and respond, as I am sure it will, then we can 
finally put this to rest.
<P>
	As we have seen with the leadership in our budget, by the 
leadership of the government on the east coast and in many 
others areas, including measures that the Attorney General is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10368"> 10368 </A></B>
<P>
dealing with in terms of high risk offenders, we too can respond 
to Canadians and come up with a  solution that will be 
satisfactory. It may not be to everybody but it will to most.
<P>
	In conclusion, I would like to acknowledge that at this very 
moment one of my constituents, John Rochon from Elliot Lake, 
is now in Argentina at the Pan American games. He is one of our 
shooters. He is a past medalist for our country and I wish him 
well. His wife, Donna, is at home waiting for news of progress in 
Argentina. It is people like John Rochon that are exemplary.
<P>
	Lionel Houle is an elderly gentleman in Massey, Ontario who 
came to me with concerns about passing on his guns to his 
children. It is people like that who have convinced me that the 
gun-owning community in Canada deserves our respect, 
deserves to know that we care about their point of view. They are 
prepared to partner with urban Canadians to put this issue to rest 
once and for all and to obtain a solution that is effective for the 
entire country.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, it my 
pleasure to speak on the motion my colleague for 
Yorkton-Melville has put forward.
<P>
	The motion recognizes the problems with Bill C-68 and the 
fact that the bill deals with two distinct areas: crime control, 
which everyone supports; and a repressive gun control scheme 
which will cost hundreds of millions of dollars, will not reduce 
crime and will turn thousands of Canadians into criminals for 
simply not registering their guns properly.
<P>
	It is vitally important that the House legislates clearly and 
supports only those bills which deal effectively and efficiently 
with the problems of the country. The justice minister could 
have brought forward this kind of bill, but he put the two issues 
together. He knew that Canadians were sick and tired of violent 
criminals who use firearms. Therefore, Bill C-68 has tougher 
penalties, including minimum sentences of four years for 
certain crimes.
<P>
	The bill also penalizes gun smugglers and provides a deterrent 
against smuggling crimes. Under the proposed legislation 
profits from smuggling and smugglers' vehicles can be seized. 
In addition gun smugglers can expect tough jail sentences when 
they are convicted. These are the types of measures that 
Canadians are calling for and I fully support those elements of 
the bill. In fact, I would like to see many of these penalties 
extended even further.
<P>
	Unfortunately the legitimate desire of Canadians for crime 
control are exploited by Bill C-68 in order to forward the 
personal agenda of the justice minister. He has stated very 
clearly that he believes the army and police are the only ones in 
Canada that should be able to own guns. It is on the public 
record. Obviously the minister is using Bill C-68 to promote his 
own wish list and crack down on legitimate gun owners.
<P>
	When the justice minister speaks about Bill C-68 he suggests 
there is wide support in the Canadian public for all elements of 
the bill. He cites polls and claims they support his views. What 
questions were asked? If you ask Canadians if they support 
legislation to reduce crime, of course they will say they support 
it. What are the facts?
<P>
	This weekend I listened to a presentation by Brian Evans in 
Alberta and he made it very clear how the questions that are 
asked can determine the answers. He was quite open about 
showing the fallacies of the polling system. Again I remind the 
minister that John Diefenbaker probably stated best what polls 
are for.
<P>
	What would Canadians say if we asked some of the following 
questions: First, do you believe that Canadians who do not 
register their guns should be subject to up to 10 years in prison, 
according to section 92 of the legislation? This means that a 
hunter who does not register his guns could be locked away for 
as long as multiple murderer, Denis Lortie, 10 years. How can 
this sort of extreme be justified?
<P>
	Second, do you believe it is fair that under new rules allowing 
police to search for unregistered guns, all persons who do not 
``give the police officer all reasonable assistance'' can be found 
guilty of an indictable offence and liable for a prison term of up 
to two years? This means that a farmer's wife who does not help 
the police to convict her husband by co-operating in a search for 
unregistered guns could be locked away for two years. Again 
this absolutely unbelievable.
<P>
	Third, do you believe that the government should spend at 
least $85 million to institute universal firearms registration? Of 
course the estimates go up into the hundreds of millions, 
depending on who you talk to. There is no evidence that this will 
reduce crime. When similar systems were tried in other 
countries they failed miserably.
<P>
	The devil is in the details. When Bill C-68 is viewed in the 
light of these types of questions, we see how flawed this 
legislation is. In the justice minister's attempt to crack down on 
legitimate gun owners he is doing a fundamental disservice to 
all Canadians. Parliament cannot allow this to happen.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	The motion proposed by the member for Yorkton-Melville 
gives us an invaluable opportunity to get back on the right track 
and refocus our efforts on crime control which is the real issue in 
the eyes of Canadians. If we do this, then I am certain we will 
have all-party support for those measures that increase 
penalties for criminals. On the other hand, when it comes to 
universal firearms registration, splitting the bill will allow us to 
approach this debate in a direct way. If members of the House 
support the proposed motion, then maybe we will really see 
what the level of support for the minister's universal firearms 
registration plan is.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10369"> 10369 </A></B>
<P>
	In my own riding of Red Deer, the minister has told me by 
letter that 67 per cent of constituents support his universal gun 
registration program. Unfortunately though, when I invited the 
minister to test his theory by participating in an open town hall 
meeting in Red Deer, he would not come to my riding. Why 
not? If the minister believes his own claims then he should 
receive overwhelming support. I will tell you why not. The 
minister will not come to Red Deer because he knows my 
constituents do not support his registration process. He will not 
come because he knows his claims are ridiculous.
<P>
	How do I know my constituents do not support universal 
registration? I have had over 5,461 constituents sign petitions 
against this legislation; I have had over 1,200 letters in the last 
two months; I have had hundreds of phone calls and contacts out 
on the street; all of this against universal firearms registration.
<P>
	Some might ask whether I have had any from the other side. 
Yes, I have. My office has received fewer than 20 letters and I 
have received fewer than 10 phone calls supporting this bill. 
That is over 230 constituents to one against this bill. I ask: What 
clearer indication can I have as an MP? It seems astonishing to 
me that the justice minister could make such an outlandish claim 
that the people of Red Deer support this legislation by a margin 
of 2:1.
<P>
	I travelled my entire constituency this past 10 days from early 
morning until late at night. I had six town hall meetings and 
many other meetings. I met many people. All of them are 
opposed to this legislation. Not one person has told me he is in 
favour of it.
<P>
	There is no doubt in my mind that Bill C-68 will cause many 
problems if passed in its current form. Even with major 
amendments in committee this bill will still turn thousands of 
Canadians into criminals.
<P>
	It has been made very clear that a number of justice ministers, 
including those from Alberta and Saskatchewan, will oppose 
this legislation and the enforcement of it. It will cost hundreds 
of millions of dollars if we count the enforcement costs. It will 
impose a tax on legal gun owners through registration fees and 
will threaten the private property of approximately seven 
million Canadians.
<P>
	This legislation is unacceptable. Therefore I urge the House to 
act responsibly and adopt the motion of the hon. member for 
Yorkton-Melville. Let us split the bill into two portions.
<P>
	The first part will contain those parts of the bill dealing with 
crime control. We will send out a tough and unified message that 
violent criminals and smugglers will be punished severely for 
their crimes. That is what the Canadian people are saying. I have 
heard that message in Montreal and Toronto, and I have 
certainly heard it in the west. It is the same message. They are 
against crime and are demanding crime control.
<P>
	The second part of the bill will deal with the government's 
very unfair universal firearms registration system. In the 
interests of Canadians we will strike down that proposed 
legislation. I believe that will be right across the board as well.
<P>
	We have an opportunity to clarify what the minister has mixed 
up. It is our responsibility as members of Parliament to do this. I 
request the support of all members for the proposed motion.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Roseanne Skoke (Central Nova, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to debate at second reading Bill C-68, an act 
respecting firearms and other weapons. Bill C-68 is 124 pages 
long and contains 186 legislative provisions which include 
amendments to the Criminal Code of Canada and creates a new 
separate statute, the firearms act.
<P>
<B>(1250 ) </B>
<P>
	Moreover this bill would completely reorganize the gun 
control system putting provisions of a regulatory type in the 
proposed new firearms act while leaving the Criminal Code 
penalties in part III of the Criminal Code. It would also 
reorganize the classification of firearms and other weapons and 
the means by which controls are imposed on their acquisition, 
possession, use and transportation.
<P>
	The three pillars of the existing system, controls on access, 
controls on particular kinds of firearms, and criminal penalties, 
would continue to exist but their forms would change. In 
particular much of the balance of the system would shift to 
controls focusing directly on persons rather than on kinds of 
firearms.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice in opening the debate at second 
reading stage urged this hon. House to adopt the legislation in 
principle before sending it to the Standing Committee on Justice 
and Legal Affairs for detailed consideration clause by clause. 
The justice minister outlined three principles that motivated this 
government to introduce Bill C-68.
<P>
	The first principle is that Canadians do not want to live in a 
country wherein the people feel they want or need to possess a 
firearm for protection.
<P>
	The second principle is that if we are to retain our safe and 
peaceful character as a country, those who use a firearm in the 
commission of a crime will be severely punished. For example, 
those who smuggle illegal firearms, those who traffic in illegal 
firearms and those who profit by putting guns into the hands of 
criminals must know that penalties for such conduct must be 
certain and significant.
<P>
	The third principle is that as a government we must 
acknowledge and respect the legitimate use of firearms by 
law-abiding Canadian citizens.
<P>
	It would include but would not be limited to the respect for 
our Canadian heritage and culture regarding the traditions of 
hunting not only as a favourite pastime but as a very important 
economic activity contributing  directly to the prosperity of 
many regions in Canada, and those whose livelihoods are solely 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10370"> 10370 </A></B>
<P>
dependent upon firearms. Government must acknowledge and 
respect the use of firearms for farming, ranching and hunting. 
We must not interfere with this. Also to be acknowledged are 
those who collect firearms and those who enjoy shooting sports 
and so on.
<P>
	The third principle in summary recognizes and respects the 
rights and interests of law-abiding Canadian citizens. However 
while these legitimate interests are acknowledged and 
respected, Bill C-68 requires that they be carried on in a context 
that is consistent with public safety.
<P>
	The three principles as outlined by the justice minister are 
fundamentally sound. They are consistent with the objectives of 
good government, a peaceful and safe society and an effective 
response to the criminal misuse of firearms and enhanced public 
safety.
<P>
	It must be understood that the universal registration of 
firearms is a fundamental strategy, a fundamental support 
system that the government intends to use to achieve the 
principles and objectives previously outlined. It is at this point 
that controversy and a divergence of opinion ensue in debate.
<P>
	There is popular public opinion calling for more stringent gun 
control measures principally in reaction to recent violent 
crimes. On the other hand, there is also public opinion that 
certain restrictive gun control measures are inappropriate and 
will not adequately solve the problems of violent crimes.
<P>
	Specifically my constituents of Central Nova have expressed 
to me concerns and interests regarding the effect and impact Bill 
C-68 and universal registration will have upon them as 
law-abiding gun owners. By letters, by petitions and by 800 
constituents attending two separate public forums they 
expressed their concerns, fears and apprehensions regarding the 
federal government's firearms control program which was 
announced on November 30, 1994.
<P>
	Constituents of Central Nova raised issues regarding the 
fundamental strategy of the universal firearms registration. The 
concerns raised were: first, that registration would potentially 
lead to confiscation of their guns; second, that registration 
would interfere with the property rights and charter of rights, 
specifically to the right to security of person and property; third, 
that the ownership of a gun is a right and not a privilege; fourth, 
they failed to see the positive effects of gun registration in 
deterring and reducing crime in Canada.
<P>
	I trust that to satisfy my constituents' concerns the 
constitutional validity of universal firearms registration and 
prohibition will be examined and considered in the Standing 
Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs.
<P>
<B>(1255 ) </B>
<P>
	Some Central Nova constituents also raised a concern 
regarding the cost of registration both to taxpayers and gun 
owners. There appears to be much public misinformation in this 
regard. The Minister of Justice was quite clear on debate that the 
cost to gun owners in the first year of the five-year 
implementation period is expected to be zero. If for some reason 
it is not zero, it will be a nominal amount in the range of $10. 
The estimated cost of implementing the universal registration 
system over the next five years will be $85 million. This 
estimated cost will be reviewed in detail by the standing 
committee.
<P>
	Potential non-compliance with Bill C-68 has been raised as 
an issue and how such non-compliance will be enforced. In my 
riding in discussing the issue of future non-compliance 
reference was made to past non-compliance. Reference was 
specifically made to the failure of police and crown prosecutors 
to enforce existing provisions of the Criminal Code of Canada 
regarding the usage of a weapon in the commission of an 
offence. Concern was expressed that crown prosecutors were 
irresponsible and failed to uphold public trust by plea 
bargaining and failing to enforce the existing provisions.
<P>
	It should be noted that this concern is addressed by Bill C-68. 
Bill C-68 will toughen the penalties of the criminal misuse of 
firearms. With the restructuring of the Criminal Code there will 
no longer be plea bargaining of charges relating to the use of 
firearms because the penalties will be woven directly into the 
sections which provide for the offences themselves.
<P>
	The firearms owners of Central Nova raised the concern that 
they were offended by having to consult the Criminal Code to 
determine the manner in which their private ownership of 
firearms was to be regulated. This concern has been addressed 
by Bill C-68 by the government changing the Criminal Code to 
toughen sanctions and by contemplating a separate statute, the 
firearms act, to deal with the regulatory aspects in relation to 
firearms acquisition, use and ownership.
<P>
	Further concerns were raised in my constituency from the gun 
clubs and target shooters. These are highly skilled people, very 
law abiding and conscientious in their sport. These Canadians 
want to continue in those sports.
<P>
	The justice minister has assured this honourable House that 
when Bill C-68 goes to the justice committee following second 
reading debate he will ask the committee to look at specific 
changes in the law. This is unprecedented and should be 
commended for being open to change and scrutiny of a 
government bill. The Minister of Justice stated in <I>Hansard</I>:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>First of all, to ensure that we are accommodating all of those sporting 
competitions with handguns, we have already made it clear that the .22-.32 calibre 
Walther used by Linda Thom at the 1984 Olympics will not be covered by the ban. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10371"> 10371 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We want the committee to take the advice of the International Shooting Union  to 
determine whether there are other handguns that should be exempted so that 
legitimate sporting activities will not be threatened.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Second, I will ask the committee to examine the question of whether there are 
black powder shooting events that might be affected by this legislation. It is not 
our intention in any way to limit historical re-enactments with the use of 
reproductions. We do not believe we have done that but we will ask the committee 
to look specifically at that question and to let us know whether additional 
technical amendments are required to make the meaning clear.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Third, we will ask the committee to look at the question of relics and heirlooms, 
recognizing that there are families and individuals who want to pass on to the next 
generation firearms that they have acquired and that have a specific sentimental 
or historical value to the family. That should be respected. We will ask the 
committee to fashion a way to allow it to happen consistently with the imperatives 
of public safety.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	These three items were of concern to my constituents of 
Central Nova. I am satisfied that the justice minister will see 
that they are properly addressed.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice stressed that Canadians will have the 
opportunity to make their views known when the legislation is 
reviewed by the House of Commons Standing Committee on 
Justice and Legal Affairs. I trust that the concerns of my 
constituents will be addressed. I urge all my constituents to 
partake in the legislative process by making their views known 
to the House of Commons committee.
<P>
<B>(1300) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, on 
February 14, the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of 
Canada tabled in this House his firearms bill to strengthen 
control over such weapons. It was high time. I support this bill, 
although my feeling is that it does not go far enough. I consider 
it is about time a country such as ours enacts legislation to 
protect all citizens.
<P>
	We all know that gun-related crime has increased 
dramatically. We all remember the tragedy that occurred in the 
Quebec National Assembly, ten years or so ago, and the dreadful 
massacre at l'École Polytechnique, just a few years ago. Every 
day that goes by we hear about firearms being used to assault, 
threaten, intimidate and kill. Possessing a firearm gives 
criminals a great illusion of power, authority and strength.
<P>
	In November, the president of the Canadian Association of 
Chiefs of Police commented that the issue of legal possession of 
firearms was not a game. The public, including hunters, 
competitive shooters, collectors and shooters, all people for 
whom I have great respect and law-abiding citizens, should 
consider these controls as reaffirming their rights and 
responsibilities. It is up to them to act on reaffirming their rights 
and responsibilities.
<P>
	There is no doubt that a more structured control system, 
providing among other things for the registration of all firearms, 
will help make this country a safer and more peaceful place to be 
for all of us. Indeed, weapons are dangerous and there is a need 
to legislate in this respect. The Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada is on the right track with Bill C-68. However, 
I firmly believe, as stated previously, that this bill does not go 
far enough and that the minister should use coroner Anne-Marie 
David's report, released on January 26, as a model.
<P>
	As Ms. David suggested, has the time not come to revise the 
wording of regulations concerning the safe storage, display and 
transportation of firearms so as to make it more easily 
accessible to all? While ignorance of the law is no excuse, is it 
not the justice minister's role to make it easier to understand? 
Time has come to review regulations and require businesses to 
lock up, and even render inoperative, any firearm for sale.
<P>
	Also, restricted firearms should only be stored in a vault. 
These regulations should not authorize weapons without a safety 
locking mechanism to be delivered to anyone. I would even add 
that the Minister of Justice should amend the Criminal Code to 
provide that firearms will systematically be confiscated if 
regulations are not complied with.
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	Instead of spending millions of dollars on useless bodies such 
as the one on Canadian unity, should the government not invest 
these moneys in education and information programs for the 
public at large and for specific groups such as hunters, gun 
collectors, members of shooting clubs and others?
<P>
	Several provisions in this bill need to be clarified. By 
spreading over an eight-year period the registration process for 
gun owners and firearms, did the Minister of Justice simply give 
in to the gun lobby, or did he want to please some members of his 
caucus? I am sceptical as to the deterring effect of such a reform.
<P>
	The gun lobby encourages people to buy arms to protect 
themselves. Yet, it is proven that people are safer when they are 
not armed. A firearm kept in a house is 43 times more likely to 
kill a member of that household than an intruder. Why wait eight 
years, considering that a homicide is three times more likely to 
be committed in a home where a firearm is kept, while a suicide 
is five times more likely to occur?
<P>
	Canadians, health specialists and particularly crime 
prevention experts all ask, and rightly so, for greater control 
over firearms. In Canada, 42 per cent of women killed by their 
spouse are shot, four times out of five with a gun or a rifle. 
Moreover, 78 per cent of these firearms are legally owned. 
Again, I ask the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10372"> 10372 </A></B>
<P>
question: Why spread the whole registration process over an 
eight-year period? I am convinced that, as elected 
representatives of the public, we could help save human lives 
simply by reducing as much as possible that registration period.
<P>
	Is it really reasonable to allow 13,000 military-type 
automatic weapons in the country, considering that such 
firearms are designed for rapid fire in a combat situation?
<P>
	More than 560,000 Quebecers and Canadians signed a 
petition asking that military-type weapons be banned. Yet, the 
new legislation allows gun collectors to own such firearms. 
Why? Why this fixation about firearms?
<P>
	According to a recent survey, 84 per cent of Canadians, 
including 71 per cent of gun owners, support a ban on military 
weapons. Again, I find it unacceptable to make it perfectly legal 
for the owners of these 13,000 firearms to keep such weapons.
<P>
	We need a more rigid form of gun control.
<P>
<B>(1310) </B>
<P>
	In my opinion, current legislation is inadequate, and Bill 
C-68 still does not go far enough, both in terms of its 
restrictions, as well as its deterring and punitive effects. It is our 
role to protect members of the public, often against their wishes.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Hedy Fry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, not only is it an honour for me 
to speak to the bill, I am enthusiastic and I would like to applaud 
something that is long overdue. The bill addresses the health and 
safety of Canadians. As Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister 
of Health, health and safety are extremely important to me.
<P>
	Guns threaten, guns injure, and guns kill. I understand that 
guns are an important component of life in many parts of 
Canada: for hunters who live in isolated parts of the country and 
for people who play some competitive sports. Guns are also very 
important to the tourism industry.
<P>
	The bill is not intended to harm that group of people or to stop 
any sport or tourism or person who wants to hunt in any sporting 
way. The bill is something most responsible gun owners would 
support. The firearms act seeks to bring into line those people 
who by their irresponsible use of firearms create a bad name for 
law-abiding gun owners, which is why the bill is supported by 
68 per cent of gun owners. Those who operate within the law and 
act responsibly in storing and using their guns see nothing to 
fear in the bill.
<P>
	The Canadian Centre for Justice Statistics and the Department 
of Justice have compiled a lot of startling data on the issue of 
guns. I bring them to the attention of the House today because 
they are what frightens me about the whole issue. Firearms 
cause suicide. Some 1,100 suicides a year are committed with 
guns, which means that 78 per cent of firearm deaths are 
suicides. In 1990, 300 of the suicides were committed by 15 to 
25-year-old youths. People who commit suicide with a gun 
have a 92 per cent success rate, compared with only 35 per cent 
if other means are used.
<P>
	As a physician and a mother this is totally unacceptable to me. 
It is alarming and it is sad. I know as many health and social 
workers know that suicide attempts by young people are often 
only a cry for help by very desperate and frightened youth. As a 
physician I have treated many of those desperate and frightened 
youth who would not be alive today if they had access to guns.
<P>
	Firearms not only decimate our youth but firearms create 
other household tragedies. Firearms victimize women. Over 40 
per cent of women killed by their husbands each year are shot. 
Every six days a woman is shot to death in Canada in her own 
home by a legally owned gun.
<P>
	In March 1992 the Department of Justice showed that 78.3 per 
cent of domestic homicides in Canada involving the use of 
firearms were by legally owned guns. I stress that they were 
legally owned guns. We know that domestic violence is endemic 
in society but firearms transform violence into murder. One fit 
of anger, one violent rage combined with access to a gun, can 
result in a dead woman.
<P>
	These are not the only disturbing statistics about violence 
with firearms against women. In 1993, 75 per cent of female 
victims were killed in a private residence; 85 per cent of the 
guns used to kill women were specifically rifles and shotguns; 
and 82 per cent of the rifles and shotguns were legally owned at 
the time of the shooting.
<P>
	Is this the type of society we want to maintain, where women 
and children are not safe in their own homes? Is this the freedom 
espoused by those who oppose the bill? Is there any freedom at 
the end of a gun? I would argue that there is not.
<P>
	Deaths by firearms are preventable deaths. Injuries by 
firearms cost our public health care system millions of dollars a 
year. Over 1,000 firearm related deaths and injuries are treated 
in Canadian hospitals each year. The cost of this is estimated 
between $15 million to $30 million per year. Therefore in my 
book firearms present a major health hazard; in the book of 
anyone interested in public health and safety. Even if the value 
of human life lost is not very important to the members of the 
third party, I am sure that the cost to the health care system 
might make them think twice because it is enormous. I believe 
$30 million a year is enormous. They did not factor into their 
recent budget the cost of firearms related injuries to the health 
care system.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10373"> 10373 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1315) </B>
<P>
	One of the things that alarms me about firearms is that at the 
moment we do not have any data on the number of firearms in 
this country. Anyone who knows anything about public health 
will know data gathering is extremely important in preventive 
measures in health. The epidemiology of any disease or any 
health hazard, whether it be a virus, a bacteria, a poor sewage 
system or a gun depends on the amount of data we have.
<P>
	There are very limited data right now on guns. We do not 
know exactly how many guns are in Canada. The gun lobby says 
there are 22 million. The Department of Justices says there are 
six million. It profoundly disturbs me that we have no real 
figures to answer this question. We know how many bicycles, 
how many cars and how many dogs there are but we do not know 
how many firearms there are. This is completely unacceptable.
<P>
	This act will give us the database we need to take the 
preventive health measures we need to make this a safe and 
healthy society. By mandatory registration we will take the guns 
out of the closets and put them where we can find out exactly 
how many there are.
<P>
	When police are called to an incident in a home they will 
know if they are walking into a risk or not. When police try to go 
to homes where there is domestic violence they will know 
whether they have to remove a gun because the woman in that 
house is in danger. Guns are lethal weapons and so it makes 
sense to have them registered, traceable and retrievable by our 
police forces in the case of use or abuse.
<P>
	Some of my constituents have questioned the potential costs 
of this registration. I can understand that in a time of fiscal 
control we do not want to incur costs to the government. 
However, the justice minister tells us it will cost $85 million 
over seven years to register these guns.
<P>
	To the members of the third party, I do not believe $85 million 
over seven years is too much money to spend on saving lives and 
decreasing disability, especially when balanced against the 
savings to the health care system. I hope even the members of 
the third party can figure out the mathematics of that simple 
equation.
<P>
	Another concern raised by my constituents was they would be 
restricted from using firearms in the film industry, a major 
industry in British Columbia. I am pleased to say they can rest 
assured this new bill will not prohibit that.
<P>
	Some other members of my community are concerned 
because they will not be able to export their replica firearms or 
that the investment value of their antique firearms will be 
decreased. Article 22 of this bill provides for the transfer, that is 
the sale, barter or donation of firearms, to persons who hold 
licences to acquire and possess that particular class of firearm. 
Their collections will not be devalued or frozen because they 
can continue to trade and sell their firearms with people who 
have the same type of firearms.
<P>
	More important, in a democracy we must follow the will of 
the people. The majority of Canadians, 86 per cent of all 
respondents to a recent Angus Reid poll, said they support 
strong gun control measures, 68 per cent of whom are firearm 
owners. Eighty-four per cent of respondents support a total ban 
on military weapons, 71 per cent of whom are gun owners. 
Seventy-one per cent of Canadians support a ban on handguns, 
54 per cent of whom are gun owners. It is clear Canadians 
everywhere think gun control is very important.
<P>
	People talk a lot about the right to bear firearms. Nowhere is 
this in the Canadian Constitution. The responsibility to store, 
register and use firearms reasonably and safely is incumbent 
upon anyone who feels it is their right to own a gun.
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
	Peace, order and good government are what the Canadian 
Constitution is all about and what Canada stands for. With this 
bill we will ensure that we continue to have peace, order and 
good government and that a cause of death and disability will be 
removed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
would like to thank my colleague for his amendment to this bill. 
It is too bad the other members of the House are not 
knowledgeable enough about what we are talking about to 
address the splitting of this bill. I have not heard anything in that 
direction since it was announced over an hour ago that this is 
what we were supposed to be speaking about.
<P>
	There comes a time during every government when those 
creating the legislation must face up to the reality of an issue and 
not the politics of an issue. This is one of those times.
<P>
	The justice minister has tabled what he terms a firearm 
control measure, Bill C-68. Unfortunately this bill goes far 
beyond control and borders on the unreal. Realism in any bill 
means that the goals and the attentions of the proposed 
legislation are within guidelines established by and for the 
people governed by democratic values.
<P>
	This bill allows neither governing by nor for the people. It 
certainly is not democratic in values or purpose. This bill seeks 
to be all things desired by a select group of individuals and 
special interests and removes democratic choice and ultimately 
democracy from law-abiding citizens who choose to hold 
private property deemed by the few and select to be tainted 
goods.
<P>
	Instead of attacking the problems of criminal intent, this bill 
attacks the rights of peace loving and law-abiding citizens who 
safely use and own property without concern for due process and 
democratic values.
<P>
	That is why this bill must be split. There are two paths in this 
bill. One addresses the need for safety and security of the 
person. It binds the law-abiding people of this land together, a 
path that mandates the state to protect its citizens from the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10374"> 10374 </A></B>
<P>
ravages of those who believe power is purchased with violent, 
threatening and immoral  means. No Canadian will have a 
problem travelling this roadway.
<P>
	However, this bill also has another path, one of control 
demanded by the anointed few who have hoodwinked this 
government. They have blinded it with dreams of power by 
demanding it place them above the freedom of Canadians to 
choose.
<P>
	This second path gives the power of right and wrong, good and 
evil to the few who believe those not accepting their mandate or 
their way are the criminals. To the select few, those who are 
law-abiding, hard working, family oriented, loving and caring 
but who choose to purchase and own a rifle or shotgun cannot be 
trusted, say the few, and will turn into immoral and radical 
outlaws.
<P>
	This bill offers strict, swift and sure punishment for those who 
break our laws or who threaten to intimidate our citizens. This 
bill also offers dictatorial powers to the few individuals who 
believe theirs is the only understanding and the only truth.
<P>
	This bill must be split along those thoughts so that Canadians 
can decide whether criminals must pay for their crimes and 
whether Canadians will allow the decree of the few to dictate to 
the many.
<P>
	This can be easily done. All that is required is for this 
government to stand up for the principles of democracy 
cherished by the citizens of this land and make the decision to 
put the wishes of the many ahead of the demands of the few 
elites and special interests.
<P>
	Perhaps this decision may not be as easy as stated, for all 
Canadians know this government only listens to the chosen 
social engineers and elites who continually confirm they know 
best.
<P>
	Perhaps this government was controlled and dominated for so 
long by the politically correct who live and breathe and function 
in their ivory towers and have no inkling what really exists 
below their utopian vision of never-never land that it cannot 
choose of its own free will to place the people of Canada ahead 
of its favourite few chosen friends.
<P>
<B>(1325 ) </B>
<P>
	In either case, whether the government has the political will to 
really consult Canadians or not, Canadians will know of the lack 
of vision and understanding the government possesses. The 
justice minister saw nothing wrong with the extraordinary order 
in council powers this bill would give his cronies.
<P>
	The members of this party are so blinded by false polls and 
false idols of power promised by special interests that they are 
overlooking the clauses and language in this bill that create an 
all powerful super structure of select dictatorship within their 
own government.
<P>
	The members of this government who publicly state they 
support this bill are telling their constituents in private they will 
not vote for this bill. That is another reason why this bill must be 
split.
<P>
	This bill is causing constituents to lose faith in politicians. 
Canadians want accountability from their members and this bill 
will only weaken further the faith of constituents. Constituents 
have had enough the two tailed explanations offered by Liberal 
members.
<P>
	Splitting this bill will allow those deserving the wrath of 
taxpaying Canadians-criminals who believe power does come 
from the barrel of a gun-to be quickly shown that power comes 
from the will of the people.
<P>
	At the same time it will give those members opposite the 
opportunity to fully explain the other portions of this bill which 
the members opposite have no doubt been instructed not to 
mention to voters.
<P>
	Why is it every time we on this side of the House mention 
rifles and shotguns those on that side of the House speak of 
handguns? My guess is that many voters do not know that 
Canada currently has the toughest regulations regarding 
registration, ownership and purchase of handguns of any 
country.
<P>
	The government knows many Canadians accept the 
ponderings that handguns are on the same scale as rifles and 
shotguns from their members when those same Liberals know 
that current regulations concerning handguns require police 
investigation, mental fitness exams and questioning associates 
in the community to determine whether an applicant deserves 
handgun ownership.
<P>
	These same members opposite do not state the current 
requirements in this House for fear Canadians will fully 
understand that handgun ownership is already extremely 
difficult. Instead they say handgun ownership in the same breath 
with rifles and shotguns to further dilute the truth.
<P>
	Splitting this bill will allow law enforcement agencies to 
immediately demonstrate to violent criminals that society will 
not and cannot tolerate crime. Splitting this bill will allow 
immediate passage of the crime control clauses.
<P>
	Splitting this bill will allow the removal of those sections that 
declare law-abiding, chosen private property owning Canadians 
villains. It will allow Canadians to no longer fear being 
classified as criminals because social engineering elites have 
decided that law-abiding Canadians cannot choose what is right 
and decent and honourable for them.
<P>
	We will no doubt continue to hear words such as murder, 
abuse and mayhem from the members opposite in the same 
breath as crime control. That is acceptable as long as those 
words are aimed at the proper target, those who truly are 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10375"> 10375 </A></B>
<P>
criminals, those who believe that power and control from the 
barrel of an illegally obtained handgun is the end all and be all to 
their existence.
<P>
	Members opposite will try to convince Canadians that family 
oriented, loving and caring Canadians who choose target 
shooting, hunting or competitive shooting as a sport are the 
same as hardened criminals who place Canadians in grave or 
mortal danger.
<P>
	We all know those words are further attempts at giving the 
elite the means to control our society through the portions of Bill 
C-68 never mentioned by members of this government
<P>
	We all know those members opposite are being extorted to 
hide the true facts about the order in council clauses of this bill. 
They give absolute authority to the few elite and the few among 
the Liberals who still believe that total control from the top is 
the end all and be all of their mandate and that true democracy 
by way of frank and open debate with those who have opposing 
views is and must be opposed at all costs. That might convince 
Canadians they have a choice, intelligence and an opinion.
<P>
<B>(1330) </B>
<P>
	In conclusion, there has been a wake-up call to politicians 
from all Canadians indicating to each and every one of us that 
they will have a voice from this day forward in what comes out 
of the House, and so they should. I encourage them to continue 
to be involved in this very contentious issue.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul DeVillers (Simcoe North, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
am pleased to participate in the debate on Bill C-68, an act 
respecting firearms and other weapons. As is the case in many 
rural ridings, the legislation has elicited a great deal of interest 
among my constituents.
<P>
	Everyone participating in the discussion should do so with the 
following three points in mind. First, the government promised 
to toughen firearms legislation during the last election 
campaign and was elected with a strong mandate. Second, 
opinion research indicates a very high level of support among 
Canadians for the legislative initiative. Third, firearms owners 
have legitimate concerns about the proposed law. If we do not 
work with these axioms in mind, we will not have the 
constructive and open debate this important issue merits.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice introduced a broad set of measures 
intended to increase public security in Canada. While I have 
difficulty fully appreciating all the benefits of registering rifles 
and shotguns, I nonetheless support most of the provisions in the 
bill.
<P>
	Most Canadians, even the most sceptical, would admit there is 
some good in the legislation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	However, this debate is about how we can improve this bill 
even more, to make it acceptable to a larger number of 
Canadians. As we saw with the GST, for instance, if a new bill is 
not widely accepted, it will fail to do what it is supposed to do.
<P>
	During the past few months I have received hundreds of cards 
and many telephone calls, faxes and letters representing the two 
poles of this debate. I met a number of constituents personally 
and also attended regularly the meetings of a special firearms 
owners advisory committee.
<P>
	Of the approximately 500 residents of Simcoe North who 
communicated with me on this bill, about 10 per cent supported 
the bill and 90 per cent were opposed. The majority of the latter 
group expressed their views through a mail-in campaign.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Despite the opinion research showing strong support in every 
region of Canada for the measures contained in Bill C-68, it is 
clear that large numbers of hunters, target shooters and gun 
collectors are very dissatisfied. As legislators I feel we should 
do our utmost to balance these concerns with the will of the 
majority of Canadians. If we can eliminate the dogmatic 
rhetoric emanating from those with entrenched positions on 
either side of the issue and debate the matter with a rational 
approach and an open mind, we can make important progress 
toward this balance.
<P>
	An example of a compromise that would not water down the 
bill in any way but would certainly render it fair in practice and 
in perception is the following: Bill C-68 could be significantly 
improved by removing from the Criminal Code the penalties in 
section 91 for non-registration in cases where the contravention 
is not wilful, for example where there has been an oversight. 
This type of non-registration would be more justly dealt with 
under the newly created firearms act.
<P>
	Penalties for wilful non-registration in section 92 could 
remain in the Criminal Code. This simple amendment would 
take nothing away from the strength of the bill but would ensure 
that law-abiding Canadians are not recorded as having criminal 
records due to an omission, oversight or ignorance of the law. In 
my opinion the amendment would dispel much of the concern 
felt by many firearm owners.
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	I have received a legal opinion that not only would the 
amendment be constitutional but it would actually improve the 
constitutionality of the bill. I have requested an opportunity to 
appear before the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal 
Affairs to seek its support for the amendment. Barring a chance 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10376"> 10376 </A></B>
<P>
to appear before the standing committee, I propose to move a 
motion in the House during report stage debate.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We have all witnessed the atmosphere of suspicion and 
misinformation around discussions on gun control. Quite 
frankly, much of the problem is due to a lack of information 
about the repercussions of the bill. We should not be surprised 
that gun owners get upset when their members of Parliament are 
unable to answer very basic questions like: how much will it 
cost?
<P>
	The question is a legitimate one, and I would like to be able to 
give a clear and precise. In the absence of detailed information, 
individuals and organizations that have a vested interest in 
giving Canadians the worst case scenario have been quick to 
provide their own answers to these questions, sometimes 
drawing alarmist conclusions that have been greatly 
exaggerated.
<P>
	For instance, in my riding people say it will cost between $86 
and $102 to register a firearm. However, the Minister of Justice 
figures that it will cost only $10 for up to ten firearms. If we 
cannot prove they are wrong, many people will think these 
agents of the gun lobby have absolute credibility.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The firearm debate has had a very polarizing dynamic. We 
have very determined firearm owners on one side and equally 
determined people on the other side who would rather not see 
guns in society. Both have legitimate and compelling concerns.
<P>
	It is for this reason we as parliamentarians must try to take the 
middle road. Although the middle of the road approach may not 
satisfy extremists at either end of the spectrum, it will be 
satisfactory to the majority of Canadians. Canadians pride 
themselves as a fair and just people, but we must not forget our 
heritage and that even today firearms activities such as hunting, 
targeting shooting and collecting are important components of 
the Canadian identity particularly in rural areas.
<P>
	The proposals embodied in the bill were introduced last 
November. In response to input from individual firearm owners 
and organizations that represent them, the legislation we are 
debating today contains important improvements to the original 
proposals. For example, owners of firearms in the restricted 
category will now be able to buy and sell to others in the same 
category. In addition to other provisions for divesting of 
restricted firearms, this will ensure that owners of restricted 
firearms will have a reasonable choice of options if they choose 
to retrieve their investment.
<P>
	These substantial amendments to the original proposal 
demonstrate there is still room for compromise without 
undermining the basic principles of the bill. That is why I am 
proposing an amendment to remove from the Criminal Code the 
penalties in section 91 for non-registration in cases where the 
contravention is not wilful. The amendment will make the 
legislation more just and will increase the degree of compliance 
without reducing its impact.
<P>
	In addition to universal registration, Bill C-68 contains many 
excellent provisions that will undoubtedly improve public 
safety. I cannot say that I support every aspect of the legislation 
without reservation, but if I had to give it a grade it would be a <I>b</I> 
plus, and that is a decent pass.
<P>
	I intend to vote in favour of Bill C-68, but in respect of the 
legitimate concerns expressed to me by firearms owners in 
Simcoe North and in view of my personal reservations I am 
seeking remedial action in the form of the amendment I 
described.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernard St-Laurent (Manicouagan, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, our concerns with regard to the legislation on gun 
control are shared by many of my fellow Canadians. We cannot, 
however, remain insensitive to the statistics on the number of 
shooting deaths.
<P>
<B>(1340) </B>
<P>
	Firearms are involved in over one third of the homicides in 
Canada. Most of the homicides in the past six years were 
committed with shotguns or hunting rifles. In three cases out of 
four, a murdered wife was slain with a hunting shotgun or rifle.
<P>
	Closer to home, in Quebec, between 1990 and 1992, there 
were 1,293 deaths attributable to shootings-an average of 425 
deaths annually. Three deaths by shooting out of four, in Quebec 
as well, were suicides, for a total of approximately 300 suicides 
annually. These sombre statistics are very eloquent. They 
cannot therefore be ignored. It was essential to ensure a strict 
application of the provisions of the Criminal Code on the use of 
firearms. Moreover the regulations in force under the old 
legislation governing the acquisition, storage and transportation 
of firearms were incoherent and difficult to apply.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice had to make them understandable and 
accessible to everyone. But, did he do so? Let us take the time to 
consider a few paragraphs.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois favours gun control without 
discriminating against those who use firearms reasonably and 
responsibly. I gave some statistics earlier. Here are some more. 
A descriptive study on suicides, homicides and accidental 
deaths by shooting was done on a data base available in the files 
of the coroner. For example, a number of files were examined by 
the Quebec coroner. The tally of deaths caused by firearms: 
from 1990 to 1992, 38 accidental deaths; from 1992 to 1993, 572 
suicides; from 1991 to 1993, 227 homicides.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10377"> 10377 </A></B>
<P>
	The goal of this study was to obtain information on the 
firearm used, its owner and the situation leading to the incident, 
in addition to the characteristics of the victims and the 
circumstances of the incident.
<P>
	Thus we can see that guns are the preferred means used by 
people who want to end it all. Let us look at the specific aspects 
of this kind of death. Between 1990 and 1992, a gun was used in 
26 per cent of all suicides. This percentage varies by age group. 
Thirty-seven per cent of all people under 20 years of age use a 
gun to commit suicide. In the 20 to 29 age bracket, this 
percentage drops to 27 per cent, and bottoms out at 25 per cent 
for people 30 years of age and older.
<P>
	What is the age of the victim? The rate at which people 10 
years of age or older use a gun to commit suicide is 5.2 per 
100,000. However, we find the highest rate in the 15 to 24 age 
bracket, which is 7 per 100,000. Men, in a proportion of 92.7 per 
cent, use guns to commit suicide, compared to women who, 
naturally, make up the difference of 7.3 per cent.
<P>
	I would like to continue by citing an interesting statistic 
which, unfortunately, concerns my region. The average annual 
suicide rate varies from 1.9 to 16.5 per 100,000 depending on 
the region. The rate is highest in the north of Quebec and in 
Abitibi.
<P>
	As you can see, guns are not always put to good use in my 
riding. The riding of Manicouagan has a very high 
unemployment rate, which exceeds the average in other ridings.
<P>
	Geography has somewhat isolated us from big centres, and 
this is an added stress weighing on residents and is also one of 
the contributing factors to the high suicide rate. The isolation 
factor should be considered in the analysis. However, this region 
is graced with all of nature's splendours, and, like the North 
Shore region, offers its residents so much untouched nature and 
free access to the oldest sports on earth: hunting and fishing.
<P>
	As you guessed, residents of the North Shore need their guns 
to hunt. They can put them to a full and healthy use and they 
have proved this for many years.
<P>
<B>(1345) </B>
<P>
	With or without regulations, these people are able to make 
proper use of their weapons-for recreational purposes, 
needless to say.
<P>
	Although it is important that Bill C-68 meet one of the goals 
established, namely gun control-no one in the Bloc Quebecois 
is against this-, we must be very careful not to dig too deeply 
into taxpayers' pockets under the pretext of exercising some 
control.
<P>
	We must ensure, among other things, that the registration fees 
collected by the department are not a kind of hidden tax. The 
Bloc Quebecois is very wary of this.
<P>
	Although we certainly agree with the principle that firearms 
must be better controlled and monitored, we should also be 
honest enough to admit that since a large number of firearms are 
used by suicidal people, gun control and registration will not 
solve the problem of suicide. Let us not forget that those who try 
to kill themselves with firearms may do so because they already 
have them in their possession; if not, the vast majority of them 
will simply use something else.
<P>
	In closing, yes, the Bloc Quebecois is in favour of better gun 
control. We must, however, avoid imposing extra costs on 
people like those in my riding who do not need them. These 
people are fed up with having to pay more and more all the time.
<P>
	With all its facilities designed to control the system, the 
department is certainly in a position to control travel costs, so 
that Quebec taxpayers, including those in Manicouagan, do not 
have to pay excessive costs.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joe McGuire (Egmont, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, when the 
Minister of Justice announced his firearms control program in 
November 1994 he did so after extensive consultation with 
individuals, groups, organizations and various government 
departments.
<P>
	The overwhelming support of the Canadian people for the 
program shows that the minister listened well and responded to 
the concerns expressed during that consultative period. 
Headlines, editorials and columns in newspapers across the 
country almost unanimously repeat the theme ``Gun control law 
on target''.
<P>
	When we look at our neighbours to the south we see a society 
that has enshrined in its constitution the right to bear arms. This 
emphasis on rugged individualism is characterized in part by the 
fascination with guns in the United States. Its citizens have 
embraced an all-pervasive, gun-toting culture.
<P>
	Canadians do not share the American fascination with guns. 
Our society is essentially different from theirs and in an 
overwhelming fashion this has been communicated to the 
Minister of Justice. The minister has proposed legislation which 
is a reasonable response to the desire of Canadians to maintain a 
different social and cultural attitude toward guns. Canada must 
not slip into the gun mentality of the United States. As the 
minister said: ``Canadians do not want to live in a society where 
they feel they need to own a gun for protection''.
<P>
	I do not believe it is possible to devise gun control legislation 
that will satisfy all Canadians. However, I do believe that with 
this legislation the minister has taken a colossal step in the right 
direction. He has used a two-pronged, balanced approach in 
attacking the public safety problem on the one side and the use 
of weapons in criminal activity on the other. The law will not 
resolve all our problems, but as a Montreal <I>Gazette</I> editorial 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10378"> 10378 </A></B>
<P>
stated: ``It is a superb and courageous proposal for gun control. 
It is almost everything that anti-crime advocates could ask for''.
<P>
	The legislation is also a reflection of the wishes and even the 
demands of the Canadian people, that we toughen our laws and 
our positions, that we make things tougher for criminals and that 
we improve the level of safety in the streets and homes of our 
nation.
<P>
	The government was given a mandate in the last election to 
strengthen gun control laws. The Liberal program made that 
promise. It is most appropriate that the Minister of Justice, with 
the support of Parliament, move to fulfil it.
<P>
<B>(1350 ) </B>
<P>
	Debate on this legislation will provide opponents with the 
opportunity to seek changes in the areas to which they object. 
However at the end of the day the will of the majority must 
prevail. It is most distressing to have Reform Party members 
indicate that they are not content to seek change but that they 
will flaunt the will of the majority and put themselves above the 
law.
<P>
	It is distressing to hear statements that reflect a kind of wild 
frontier mentality. ``I do not like the law, therefore I will break 
it''. At this point, it is not simply a question of guns or gun 
control but rather a question of democracy.
<P>
	The legislative proposals have been dealt with in detail by 
members who have spoken previously but I feel I should 
mention some of them again in brief. On the get tough on 
criminals side of the ledger, there will be a mandatory minimum 
sentence of four years in prison for the use of a firearm in the 
commission of any of 10 specific violent offences. This is not 
only a suitable penalty for such crimes but should also serve as a 
deterrent to the use of a firearm in the commission of crime.
<P>
	There will be increased penalties for illegal importing and 
trafficking of firearms. These will be accomplished by increased 
border controls and surveillance measures.
<P>
	On the other side of the ledger-the enhancement of public 
safety-there are two main items: a law applying to certain 
types of handguns, the restricted buying and selling of others 
and a national registration system for all firearms.
<P>
	This registration will be administered by the RCMP in 
co-operation with the provinces and territories. Virtually no one 
has a problem with the get tough on criminals part of the 
legislation. If there is a criticism, it is that the mandatory 
sentences are not severe enough.
<P>
	However when we get to the area of handguns, opposition 
grows. I believe that the treatment of handguns is eminently 
defensible. Target shooting and collecting are both legitimate 
exercises and adequate provisions are made for both of them in 
the bill. These handguns and certain other prohibited firearms 
are also able to be bought and sold among existing owners. On 
the issue of handguns, I want to include a quote from Ontario 
Judge Hugh Locke.
<P>
	When delivering a decision involving possession of a 
restricted weapon, Justice Locke said: ``Handguns are the 
scourge of the human race and their unlawful possession must be 
totally discouraged. Such weapons are useful for one purpose 
and one purpose only. They are employed to kill and maim 
human beings. Our society is plagued with those who feel 
handguns are a normal part of one's equipment. They are not''.
<P>
	On the subject of registration, nowhere in the legislation does 
it say that Canadians have to give up their guns. However it does 
say that Canadians must register all of their guns. Granted, 
registration is an inconvenience and will have a cost attached 
but the whole registration process allows for seven years before 
it is fully mandatory and the cost is minimal.
<P>
	The minister recognized that the proposed legislation may not 
yet be in its best or final form. There are concerns about cost, 
about the treatment of relics and heirlooms and the legitimacy of 
certain types of guns. The House of Commons Standing 
Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs will hold hearings so 
that concerns such as these may be addressed.
<P>
	Opposition on the basis of slogans such as ``registration 
today, confiscation tomorrow'', promoting the idea that a 
tyrannical government is disarming its citizens to make it easier 
to suppress and oppose them is nonsense. It is fanatical nonsense 
and seriously diminishes the credibility of those who espouse 
such beliefs. When we discuss legislation of this nature, I 
believe it is important that we talk to the people on the front 
lines, the ones who live it on a daily basis.
<P>
	P.E.I. is considered to be quite a peaceful society even by 
Canadian standards. I would like to put the following letter on 
the record. This letter is from Transition House and was written 
by Joanne Ings, executive director:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>As you are aware, the P.E.I. Transition House Association operates Anderson 
House, the Island's only emergency shelter for women and children seeking 
refuge from family violence. Since Anderson House opened in 1981, we have 
sheltered 1,800 women and over 2,000 children.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The impetus for gun control legislation came from the shocking murders of 
women engineering students in Montreal in 1989. The P.E.I. Transition House 
Association has been a strong supporter of the legislation since its inception. We 
believe that stricter controls will save lives, particularly lives of women and 
children who live in violent family situations where unregistered firearms are 
present.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Many of the women and children who stay at Anderson House are from rural 
P.E.I. and we have learned from these families that the threat of the use of 
firearms is a real fear. We understand that the registration of shotguns and other 
firearms will not stop family violence but statistics prove that registration is a 
deterrent and does result in fewer deaths by firearms.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<B><A NAME="10379"> 10379 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If one life will be saved by the passing and proclamation of Minister Rock's 
legislation it will be worth it. We ask that you support this bill for the safety of women 
and children in violent family situations and in memory of the women of Montreal.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1355) </B>
<P>
	I believe that the sentiments expressed in this letter are those 
of the vast majority of Canadians. I believe that the legislation 
being debated is a compromise which advances the cause of 
public safety in the community without imposing unreasonable 
constraints on anyone's personal freedom.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, 
Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure today to be speaking to 
this motion to sever Bill C-68 because I think most members 
enjoy speaking to legislation that makes sense.
<P>
	A very sensible approach would be to separate Bill C-68 so 
the House can thoroughly examine the two distinct segments. 
The section of Bill C-68 that deals with the criminal use of 
firearms is the only part of the bill that could have a significant 
effect on improving public safety.
<P>
	However, this section of the bill, part III, will likely be 
ignored in public debate. Like many pieces of Liberal 
legislation there are aspects that are a step in the right direction. 
However like most government legislation, most of part III does 
not go far enough and some sections are actually regressive. 
Because part III has the pretence of being a step in the right 
direction it will be ignored as critics and supporters of the bill 
debate the merits of universal registration. I believe it is 
extremely important that the House thoroughly review part III 
and that is why this part and the other relevant sections of the 
bill must be reviewed separately from the registration section.
<P>
	My Reform colleagues and I wholeheartedly agree with any 
legislation that would get tough with criminals who use 
firearms. Unfortunately this bill does not make the grade.
<P>
	Last June I introduced a private member's bill C-260 that 
dealt with the criminal use of firearms. In that bill I called for 
the inclusion of replica firearms in section 85 of the Criminal 
Code. I did this because crown counsels had informed me that 
one of the reasons that so few section 85 charges went forward 
was because it is so difficult to prove that the object that was 
used in a crime was actually a firearm. The way the legislation 
has been written the crown had to prove that the object that 
looked like a firearm was actually a firearm.
<P>
	Unless the firearm was fired during the commission of the 
offence or unless the criminal was arrested at the scene of a 
crime or immediately after in possession of a firearm it was 
unlikely that a conviction could be won. There was no other way 
the crown could prove that the object that looked like a firearm 
actually met the legal definitions of a firearm. Since the crown 
could not prove that it met the legal definition of a firearm a 
charge under section 85 could not be laid.
<P>
	The inclusion of a replica in section 85 would fill that void. 
My private member's bill treated a replica the same as an actual 
firearm. There would be no need for the crown to prove that the 
object was a real firearm.
<P>
	When robbery victims have what looks like a handgun shoved 
in their faces they are not in a position to determine if the gun 
was real or just a replica. The terror they felt at that moment is 
not mitigated if they learn later that it was just a replica. Does 
the inclusion of replica in Bill C-68 solve this problem? 
Unfortunately it does not. It is that ever so typical Liberal small 
step in the right direction. Someone who uses a replica firearm 
during-

express my grave concerns on President Clinton's budget 
proposals to charge a $3 per vehicle and $1.50 per pedestrian 
border crossing fee to enter the United States. The proposal has 
not been withdrawn as we were led to believe but has been 
altered to put undue pressure on U.S. border communities to 
encourage implementation.
<P>
	These proposed fees violate the spirit and intent of the 
Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement and NAFTA. These 
proposed fees would stifle economic development and 
economic integration of communities and regions on both sides

unacceptable tax.

which I have called the taxpayers bill of rights and is currently

<P>
	Greater financial accountability for existing and future 
programs, the protection of taxpayers from the onerous powers 
of collection authorities and the establishment of a taxpayers' 
ombudsman are part of this bill.
<P>
	Finally and most important, it establishes a cap on the amount 
of taxation an individual can be subjected to and it provides for 
refunds over this threshold amount. A gradual reduction of 
thresholds by 1 per cent per year over the next 15 years will give 
taxpayers the assurance that we have put limits on the tax grab

	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, turbot is the last remaining species which can be 
fished off the coast of Newfoundland in the wake of the scourge 
of overfishing on cod, ocean perch and plaice. For this reason, it 
is imperative that we protect turbot stocks. The official 
opposition, therefore, supports the government's decision to put 
an end to the overfishing of turbot, which led it to board the 
Spanish vessel <I>Estai</I>.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> My question is for the Minister of Fisheries 
and Oceans. Drawing on information gathered by inspectors 
who have boarded the Spanish vessel <I>Estai</I>, will the fisheries 
minister tell us whether officials from the Department of 
Fisheries and Oceans have found any irregularities which could 
be used to support Canada's position?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, 
Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the Leader of the 
Opposition for raising this question and for the considerable 
support that the Bloc Quebecois has given to the government 
regarding this issue.
<P>
	Concerning the catches found aboard the <I>Estai</I>, we found that 
up to 70 per cent of all of the fish caught were small and 
immature. This is an important issue for the fishermen of Nova 
Scotia, Newfoundland, New Brunswick, Quebec and Prince 
Edward Island. This is clear. Atlantic fishermen have 
unanimously called on the government to take effective action.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As the Leader of the Opposition has asked, we have 
commenced inspection aboard the vessel. Based on the 
preliminary estimates, not the completed and full inspection, 
more than 70 per cent of all stock found aboard the vessel is very 
small, sexually immature fish not capable of reproduction. 
Some 30 per cent were less than 14 inches, 21 per cent less than 
12 inches, and 22 per cent less than 9 inches. A good chunk of 
the fish are smaller than this pen.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I am going to let the hon. member conclude, but 
I beg him not to use any props even though it is only a fish pen.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Tobin:</B> Mr. Speaker, knowing the House has a good 
imagination, I can say that a healthy fishery is conducted on 
animals, living resources of the sea that are between 24 and 28 
inches. Many of the fish being caught are smaller than the palm 
of my hand. That is no prop; that is my hand. This has to stop.
<P>

Union resumes negotiations with Canada, which is the condition 
the Union would impose on us?

Canadian law. That is the action we are taking today and that is 
the action we shall continue without fail over the hours and days 
ahead.

	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B>

Foreign Affairs.
<P>
	Could the minister tell us whether or not Canada has taken 
diplomatic steps to reach a peaceful resolution of the conflict 
with the European Union that will respect the pressing goal of 
protecting and conserving current stocks of turbot threatened by 
overfishing on the part of European ships?

lead to a reduction in the benefits paid under the current system.

last year the Liberal government promised that a white paper on 
aging would be presented to the House before last month's 
budget. However, like so many of the government's policy 
initiatives, Canadians are still waiting for the white paper. The 
promise has been broken.

expect to see this long awaited paper on aging? Will it be tabled 
before the government embarks on any changes to the CPP or to 
OAS?

Resources Development is working on it. It is very much in line 
with the reform of social programs.

	We said that we have to enter into negotiations with the 
provinces. There will be discussions with members of the

the problem by the House.

	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is really no secret that the current Canada 
pension plan is in big trouble. The Minister of Finance stated 
that unless premiums are radically increased public pensions 
will not survive to the 21st century.
<P>
	It is also no secret that when the government wants to act it 
can. Look how the Liberals acted to protect their own lavish 
pensions, for example.
<P>
	My supplementary question is for the Prime Minister. What 
changes does the government have planned for CPP? Is it higher 
premiums, increasing the retirement age, or both? Canadians 
deserve an answer.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as usual Canadian people will have their answers after 
we have had public discussions with them and with members of 
the House.
<P>
	I hope members of the Reform Party will have good ideas 
about it, but I do not think they will get them from Mr. Gingrich 
in Washington.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the delays are disconcerting. We were promised 
studies but nothing is happening. Canadians do not think the 
government will be able to provide adequately for their future. 
They want the government to give them the tools to care for 
themselves.
<P>
	Before the ink was even dry on the last budget the government 
is again floating the idea of taxing RRSPs. Canadians are 
worried and confused about how they should provide for their 
retirement security.
<P>
	Simply, will the government consider replacing CPP with an 
RRSP style program that gives Canadians more control over 
their economic future?
<P>

	Now that the federal government has announced its decisions

requesting that a federal-provincial conference of ministers 
responsible for manpower be held as soon as possible to discuss

of his social program reform, as requested by Quebec?

pleased to see that the Quebec government has finally decided to

I think that it is a step towards resolving several problems with 
the social safety net. I hope that the hon. members of the Bloc

	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, at this very important 
conference of 190 countries both government officials and 
NGOs were discussing how we could come to grips with the 
questions of unemployment and poverty. One of the most 
serious issues was how to deal with the rapid rise of currency 
speculation where a trillion dollars passes boundaries every 
single day; 80 per cent of it is pure speculation.
<P>
	One of the areas discussed was how we could provide 
deterrence to that kind of large scale disruption of financial 
markets, disruption of investment and certainly disruption of 
people's lives. It is very strange when it appears the Reform 
Party is trying to defend currency speculators.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, that 
comment is really something else. The average person who goes 
to an automatic teller machine in Canada is not exactly a 
currency speculator.
<P>
	The minister of human resources has stated on a number of 
occasions that the answer to our unemployment problem lies in 
information technologies. What does he think he is doing with 
comments like this? He is discouraging people who are looking 
at new information technology when he is talking about putting 
a toll gate on the information highway.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, there is no question new 
technology provides enormous potential for growth, 
productivity and development. It is also equally important that 
as any new technology is introduced, whether it is the 
automobile, the steel plough or today's new technology, people 
are affected by it.
<P>
	The question that was being examined at the Copenhagen 
conference was whether there can be fair distribution of the 
benefits, the growth and the wealth being created to ensure all 
people have equal opportunity for jobs, equal opportunity for a 
good life and equal opportunity for their children's security.
<P>

<P>
<HR>

	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in its foreign policy statement, the government pledged 
to get closer to the objective of allocating 0.7 per cent of the 
GNP to foreign aid. Yet, the recent budget provides for cuts of 
$1.3 billion over a three-year period. The net result is that 
Canada will spend less than 0.29 per cent of its GNP on 
humanitarian assistance, thus reducing its aid to levels unseen 
since the sixties.
<P>
	How can the Minister of Foreign Affairs justify his 
government's decision to reduce food aid to the poorest nations 
of the world, to a degree well beyond the average level of 
reduction announced in the last budget, while at the same time 
forgiving debts of $800 millions incurred by less needy 
countries?
<P>
	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.): 
</B>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is quite right as regards the need 
to temporarily reduce the budget allocated to international 
development assistance.
<P>
	However, the hon. member is absolutely wrong when he 
concludes that food aid will be cut. Indeed, he is referring to a 
document which only gives a partial idea of the moneys which 
will be allocated to food aid, whether through the efforts of the 
government within multilateral organizations, or through 
bilateral assistance programs. I can assure the hon. member that 
our food aid efforts will remain very significant.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I read the budget tabled by the minister's colleague, the

as safe as any system in the world.
<P>
	Of course we intend to make it the safest system in the world. 
We did not wait for Justice Krever's report to take our

result of one of our inspections, and the Red Cross took certain

can the minister claim she is doing a good job, when 15 months

suspending the director of the Quebec City centre?

a decision of the Canadian Red Cross in Quebec City.

</B>Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question, which 
allows me to express the Canadian government's satisfaction 
with President Tudjman's decision.
<P>
	Certainly, we have always felt that, in order to keep the peace 
in that part of the former Yugoslavia, it was important to 
maintain a UN contingent to act as an intermediary between the 
Croats and the Serbs.
<P>

refugee stream and move that individual into an immigration 
inquiry with subsequent deportation.
<P>
	This side of the House not only wants to protect legitimate 
refugee claimants but also wants to rid the system of those who 
fraudulently abuse the system, making it worse for those who 
are legitimate.

	A former British commando was brought in for instruction. 
He happened to bring someone else along. Neither was paid by

	<B>The Speaker:</B> On Friday before we broke, the hon. member 
for Sherbrooke brought up a question of privilege.
<P>
	At that time the Chair said we would wait to make a decision 
until we heard from the member who had allegedly made certain 
comments.
<P>
	I have received notice in writing that the hon. member for 
Guelph-Wellington would like to speak to this question of 
privilege.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Guelph-Wellington, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to respond to a question of privilege 
raised by the hon. member for Sherbrooke on March 3, 1995.
<P>
	On March 2, I was contacted by the chief government whip. 
He informed me that a possible question of privilege could be 
raised in the House. Following the conversation, I prepared a 
written statement for the chief government whip and for all 
members of the House of Commons.
<P>
	This statement was put on the record by the government whip 
on March 3 and I thank him. The Hill <I>Times</I> column discussed at 
length by the hon. member for Sherbrooke on March 3, 1995 
contains a quote by me regarding the budget.
<P>
	In my comments to the Hill <I>Times</I> I was referring to the 
measures announced by the President of the Treasury Board on 
February 21, 1995. These measures were presented publicly 
prior to the budget and resulted from concerns as expressed by 
members of all parties, including the Liberal caucus, for the 
future downsizing of the public service.
<P>
	The number of public servant reductions was not known until 
the budget, although measures such as the early retirement 
incentive and the early departure incentive were announced 
earlier.
<P>
	While never informed of the details, we were told the budget 
would be tough but fair. I was not privy to any confidential 
information, nor am I aware of any other member's having 
knowledge of the contents of the budget before it was presented 
to all Canadians.
<P>
	We know the importance of budget secrecy. It is a tradition, 
respected and practised by the Minister of Finance. I appreciate 
the opportunity to provide my response to the question of 
privilege raised the previous sitting day.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it would be valuable for the entire House to have 
clarified in the question of privilege whether the article as 
reported in the Hill <I>Times</I> is inaccurate. The heading says: ``Is 
there too much secrecy surrounding the budget?'' The member 
did respond to that.
<P>
	The quotation talks about major cuts to programs rather than a 
downsizing of the civil service which was announced prior to the 
budget in a general way.
<P>
	There are some specifics quoted in this paper that were not 
responded to by the member. This House deserves a more clear 
response. Either this is wrong or else the member is not clear in 
her response.
<P>
<B>(1505 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I have had the opportunity to reread <I>Hansard</I> of 
Friday, March 3. I will be seeing the television recordings later 
this afternoon.
<P>
	I will reserve my decision now that the hon. member for 
Guelph-Wellington has explained what she said. I will come 
back to the House with a decision at the earliest possible time if 
necessary.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="COMMONWEALTHDAY">COMMONWEALTH DAY</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Christine Stewart (Secretary of State (Latin America 
and Africa), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, today is Commonwealth Day, 
observed every year on the second Monday in March by all its 
member countries to celebrate the Commonwealth, its value and 
principles.
<P>
	Built on common traditions, the Commonwealth successfully 
demonstrates the continuing importance of multilateral 
co-operation. Its strength is unity with diversity.
<P>
	The Commonwealth now consists of 51 countries and 1.5 
billion people of different languages, races, faiths and 
traditions. It serves as a forum for both governmental and 
non-governmental dialogue on a vast array of subjects from 
health and justice to youth, education and development.
<P>
	Last year Canada hosted the very successful Commonwealth 
Games in Victoria, celebrating sport, art, culture and friendship.
<P>
	Canada has been part of the Commonwealth since its 
inception in 1931 and takes pride in its many accomplishments. 
The first secretary general, Arnold Smith, a Canadian, helped 
strengthen the foundations on which the Commonwealth 
continues to stand.
<P>
	Last year was a momentous year for the Commonwealth with 
the return of South Africa following its first free elections. The 
Commonwealth had pushed hard for an end to apartheid and 
Canada believes it should continue to act as an instrument to 
promote democracy and human rights.
<P>
	Later this year the Commonwealth heads of government will 
meet in New Zealand, giving the leaders an opportunity to 
discuss world issues in an informal, unstructured manner. We 
value this opportunity to renew our relationship with other 
Commonwealth nations and to elaborate on Canadian foreign 
policy objectives.
<P>
	I urge all members to join me today in saluting the 
Commonwealth.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, on behalf 
of all the Bloc Quebecois members, I am pleased to note that 
today is Commonwealth Day. Last year, my colleague for 
Laurier-Ste-Marie had the opportunity to express, on this 
commemorative occasion, the importance of Canada's 
membership in the Commonwealth and to note that a sovereign 
Quebec would wish to remain a member of this organization in 
order to maintain and strengthen its relations with the 51 
member countries.
<P>
	The Secretary of State rightly noted South Africa's return to 
the Commonwealth. As you know, Mr. Speaker, Canada applied 
enormous pressure to bring about the end of apartheid.
<P>
	This is therefore the time to remind the government today 
how regrettable it is that it decided to turn its back on the 
promotion of human rights and democracy, despite what the 
Secretary of State would have us believe, by setting a course 
according to its commercial interests alone, with South Africa 
just now having had its first free elections.
<P>
	It is this same mercantilistic logic that prompted the 
government to cut more than $1.3 billion over three years in 
international aid, thus dropping its assistance to the planet's 
poorest people and countries to nearly 0.29 per cent of its GNP. 
This action confirms the government's change in course.
<P>
<B>(1510) </B>
<P>
	How can this government, which committed itself, in its 
statement of foreign policy, to moving closer to objectives of 0.7 
per cent, justify that, within the international budget, programs 
intended for the most disadvantaged that are being cut more than 
those with a mercantilistic focus?
<P>
	Are we to assume that the international aid program, which 
has earned Canada the profound respect of the international 
community, will also be based on the new Liberal policy of 
promoting business first and foremost? The government will 
definitely have some accounting to do when it participates in the 
next Commonwealth meetings in New Zealand. Canada must 
give meaning to its membership in the Commonwealth.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very 
happy today to have the opportunity to speak on Commonwealth 
Day, celebrated in 51 countries around the world.
<P>
	As the secretary of state mentioned, Canada has been a proud 
member of the Commonwealth since 1931. Over the years 
Canada has established a leadership role in the Commonwealth 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10393"> 10393 </A></B>
<P>
and provided an example for other countries to follow. It must 
therefore appear strange to our friends and partners in the 
Commonwealth that there  are still separatists in Quebec who 
want to break up this great country.
<P>
	I think everyone will see in the referendum this year, though, 
that the vast majority of Quebecers would rather stay to build a 
nation of prosperity and harmony than pursue their own narrow 
interests. With the referendum behind us a united Canada will 
continue to be a model for the Commonwealth ideal of unity 
with diversity.
<P>
	Since this is Commonwealth Day it is only fair that we 
consider the renewal of this partnership and its institutions. As 
all parliamentarians now admit, Canada must do more with less. 
Therefore it is essential that the Commonwealth review its goals 
and practices to make sure that all member countries are 
receiving the greatest possible benefits. I trust that the minister 
will carry this to the meeting in New Zealand.
<P>
	The Commonwealth has proven over the years the value of 
international co-operation through multilateral organizations. 
All member states can benefit through such a process. It is 
therefore fitting that Canada should set aside one day a year to 
remember Commonwealth Day.

	<B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
two petitions on a similar topic. In the first petition, with 200 
signatures, the undersigned draw to the attention of the House 
that at the time of Leonard Peltier's extradition from Canada to 
the U.S. the information provided to the Canadian government 
regarding Mr. Peltier's case was fabricated by U.S. authorities.
<P>
	Since that time new information has emerged that indicates 
Leonard Peltier was framed for a crime he did not commit and 
has spent the last 18 years in prison for. Clear evidence was 
suppressed, as found out under the freedom of information act. 
Perjury was rampant throughout the trial. Key witness Myrtle 
Poor Bear recanted publicly.
<P>
	Therefore, the petitioners request that Parliament lobby the 
U.S. government for Mr. Peltier's return to Canada.
<P>
	The second petition is similar. It has over 400 signatures. The 
petitioners request that Parliament hold an external review of 
the 1976 extradition hearings and that he be brought back to 
Canada for asylum.

Mr. Speaker, pursuant to Standing Order 36, I am presenting

riding and 40 other petitioners requesting that Parliament 
oppose any amendments to the Canadian Human Rights Act or 
the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms that provide for 
the inclusion of the phrase sexual orientation.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke-Lakeshore, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, pursuant to Standing Order 36, I have two petitions to 
present.
<P>
	In the first one the undersigned petitioners of Canada draw the 
attention of the House to the fact that the inclusion of sexual 
orientation in the Canadian Human Rights Act will provide 
certain groups with special status, rights and privileges. These 
special rights and privileges will be granted solely on the basis 
of sexual behaviour. Inclusion would infringe on the historic 
rights of Canadians such as freedom of religion, conscience, 
expression and association.
<P>
	Therefore they petition Parliament to oppose any amendment 
to the Canadian Human Rights Act or the Canadian Charter of 
Rights and Freedoms that would provide for the inclusion of the 
phrase sexual orientation.
<P>
	The second petition is more or less in the same tone. It calls on 
Parliament not to amend the Canadian Human Rights Act or the 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms in any way that would tend to 
indicate societal approval of same sex relationships or of 
homosexuality, including amending the Canadian Human 
Rights Act to include in the prohibited grounds of 
discrimination the undefined phrase sexual orientation.

right of law-abiding citizens to own and use recreational

	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill 
C-68, an act respecting firearms and other weapons, be read the 
second time and referred to a committee; and of the amendment.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, 
Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will continue my comments on Bill C-68 
concerning the inclusion of replica firearms in this bill and 
whether it will solve the problem. Unfortunately it does not. It is 
just a small step in the right direction.
<P>
	Someone who uses a replica firearm during the commission of 
an offence will now be subject to the minimum one-year 
consecutive sentence. In reality, this will generally be the 
maximum sentence as well. It is a good first move but 
unfortunately that is as far as this bill goes in addressing the 
situation.
<P>
	For serious violent offences where a firearm is likely to be 
used such as robbery, hostage taking or sexual assault with a 
weapon, to get the new minimum sentence of four years the 
crown will still have to prove that the object used was a firearm.
<P>
	In the case of a robbery there will be a witness who saw the 
criminal waving an object that looked like a firearm. Security 
cameras will show the criminal waving an object that looks like 
a firearm. However, unless the firearm is fired or the offender is 
immediately arrested, there will not be any convictions under 
this section. In the majority of instances the crown will still be 
faced with the impossible task of proving that the object met the 
legal definition of a firearm.
<P>
	In reality, C-68 will mean that criminals who pull off 
robberies with real firearms will likely only get an additional 
one-year sentence for possession of a replica firearm during the 
commission of an offence as the criminal will claim the object 
he used was only a replica and the crown will not be able to 
prove otherwise. This is simply not good enough.
<P>
	A second aspect of this bill that the Liberals are giving a great 
deal of acclaim to is the new minimum sentence of four years for 
any of 10 specific violent offences with a firearm.
<P>
	My private member's bill called for a minimum sentence for 
using a firearm during the commission of an offence to be raised 
to five years. This sentence was to run consecutively to the 
sentence for the actual crime. Therefore, I suppose those of us 
calling for a greater minimum sentence should be happy with the 
minimum of four years.
<P>
	In all honesty I would be satisfied if the government had 
introduced a minimum four-year sentence for using a firearm 
during the commission of an offence if this sentence had been 
consecutive to any sentence for the actual offence. However, 
this is not what the government has done. Instead it has created a 
combined minimum sentence of four years for both the crime 
and the use of a firearm.
<P>
	What difference is this going to make? Not much. What about 
repeat offenders? Unlike section 85 which calls for an increased 
minimum sentence for repeat offences, there is no such increase 
for those criminals who repeat their violent crimes with 
firearms.
<P>
	The amendments I would suggest are a joke. The minister's 
press release makes it sound like the government is getting 
tough on criminals who use firearms but in reality these changes 
will not result in increased sentences for those who use firearms. 
At best it will maintain the status quo. In some cases, the length 
of the sentence will likely decrease.
<P>
	A four-year minimum sentence for manslaughter with a 
firearm is a joke, pure and simple. The average sentence for 
manslaughter is already four years. How is this minimum going 
to have any deterrent effect? It is not.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10398"> 10398 </A></B>
<P>
	My private member's bill called for a minimum five-year 
sentence for the use of a firearm during the commission of an 
offence to be served consecutively to any sentence for the 
offence itself in a first offence and a minimum of 10 years for 
a second offence. The difference is very simple. Under Bill 
C-68 a first time armed robber will more likely serve a 
four-year sentence which is a decrease from the current going 
rate of five years. Under my bill a first time robber using a 
firearm would likely serve a four-year sentence for the robbery 
and an additional five years for using a firearm for a total of 
nine years.
<P>
<B>(1535 ) </B>
<P>
	Which one sends a greater message of condemnation of using 
firearms during the commission of an offence? Which one is 
likely to deter criminals from using firearms during the 
commission of an offence?
<P>
	The concern I have in separating these two parts under C-68 is 
that part III will be left out of the discussion. It is very important 
to Canadians that part III, the criminal use of firearms, be dealt 
with separately from the national registration.
<P>
	In dealing with C-41 there have been two words that have 
taken over the debate: sexual orientation. I would suggest that 
national registration is going to take over the debate of this gun 
control legislation and the criminal use of firearms is going to 
get lost in the discussion.
<P>
	It is very important that we separate those two and allow for 
Canadians, the committee and all parliamentarians to take a 
close look at what this government is suggesting for maximizing 
the deterrence to the criminal use of firearms.
<P>
	I feel it does not go far enough. We should have ample 
opportunity to deal with that and not just talk about the national 
registration program.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Finestone (Secretary of State 
(Multiculturalism) (Status of Women), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
our standard of living, our social and economic standing make 
us the envy of the whole world. The elevated status Canada 
enjoys is not a coincidence: it is the result of women and men of 
strong will who imprinted principles and values on our country 
as it grew.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	If one principle has guided this House since the beginning, it 
is an unwavering commitment to preserve a peaceful nature in 
our society. At times this commitment has meant taking a stand 
on some very controversial issues. It has also meant introducing 
groundbreaking legislation such as this bill on firearms control, 
Bill C-68.
<P>
	Controversy has never kept us from protecting the values and 
the ideals Canadians so rightly deserve and consider their own. 
These values include the rights to liberty and personal safety 
which are now enshrined in our charter of rights and freedoms.
<P>
	In this respect, the firearms control legislation introduced by 
my colleague the Minister of Justice will undoubtedly make 
history. Every effort has been made to ensure that Canadians 
who use guns responsibly will be able to continue to do so.
<P>
	For example, the Minister of Justice has asked the Standing 
Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs to consider whether or 
not some handguns, for example those used in target shooting 
competitions, should be exempted from the proposed ban. This 
kind of careful consideration given by the minister will help 
ensure that the legitimate use of firearms is permitted.
<P>
	However, we all know that firearms are often used 
irresponsibly. This bill addresses the use of weapons and the 
violence they inflict on our society. It not only deals with 
firearms but also with the shadow of fear they cast upon all of us. 
In fear and in violence there are no rights and no freedoms, just 
victims.
<P>
	Some disregard violence due to firearms because they claim it 
does not reflect the Canadian spirit. Indeed, Canada does not 
have a tradition of individuals carrying firearms for 
self-protection. Hopefully what one might call the gun culture 
that prevails in the United States will never cross our borders. 
Nevertheless, violence is real. Statistics can only begin to 
describe the pain and suffering firearms inflict on their victims.
<P>
	Over the last 10 years firearms were responsible for 32 per 
cent of all homicides committed in Canada. Every year on 
average, 1,400 Canadians lose their lives to them. Of those 
deaths, 1,100 are suicides. Many of those lives could have been 
saved if firearms were not so readily available to individuals in 
distress.
<P>
	Since 1970, 470 children have died in Canada as a result of 
mishandled firearms. Those figures are shocking to most 
Canadians. Those children deserved a future. Those children 
deserved the right to dream. Those children should never have 
been exposed to this kind of danger.
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	That is why firearms control and registration are so important 
to Canadians. Denial will shelter no one from a stray bullet. 
Every Canadian will benefit from this legislation.
<P>
	Statistics show that Canadian women support this legislation 
wholeheartedly. From statistics we know that in this country 
every six days a woman loses her life to a bullet, most often at 
the hands of someone she knows. Almost always it is in her own 
home.
<P>
	In the years between 1974 and 1992, 42 per cent of women 
murdered in domestic incidents were shot by their husbands. 
Eighty-five per cent of domestic murders with firearms are 
committed with either a rifle or a shotgun. Eighty-two per cent 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10399"> 10399 </A></B>
<P>
of the guns that are used to kill women are legally owned at the 
time of the shooting.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Registering them will not help.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Finestone:</B> If this sickening truth cannot impact on your 
attitudes across this floor-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The member is an experienced member 
and I would ask her to please address all of her remarks to the 
Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Finestone:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is the sickening truth that 
firearms are the weapon of choice for men who murder their 
wives. I was trying to point out that my colleagues across the 
floor need not laugh at this moment. It is a serious moment in 
this debate.
<P>
	In 1987 the English writer Martin Amis wrote: ``Bullets 
cannot be recalled. They cannot be uninvented. But they can be 
taken out of the gun''. I would add that the safest way is to take 
the guns away.
<P>
	As a government we must introduce strong legislation to 
maintain the peaceful nature of our communities. This 
responsibility begins with the implementation of tighter 
firearms control laws. I unconditionally support the legislation 
presented by my colleague the Minister of Justice.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This bill reflects the wishes of the majority of Canadians. 
According to surveys, up to 70 per cent of all Canadians want 
stricter gun controls.
<P>
	Several large national groups, such as the association of 
chiefs of police, have endorsed this initiative. Teachers' 
federations have stated that measures, like the Minister of 
Justice's bill, were needed to counter violence in our schools.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Nationally, women have spoken out on this issue for years. 
Women's organizations from across the country and from a wide 
variety of societal and cultural backgrounds have been calling 
for tougher gun control laws for a long time. They have asked for 
tighter restrictions and I am proud to say that we are now 
responding.
<P>
	Perhaps the most eloquent support for this initiative and for 
the Minister of Justice came from Suzanne Laplante Edward 
who said: ``I think this guy is going to go down in Canadian 
history. This man just wants Canada to be safer''. Mr. Justice 
Minister, we all agree with that statement. She knows what she 
is fighting for. Her daughter was killed at l'École polytechnique 
five years ago. Since then Mrs. Laplante Edward has worked 
relentlessly for firearms control.
<P>
	Indeed this legislation is an achievement. It is the kind of 
initiative that brings about positive social change and preserves 
our quality of life.
<P>
	It takes decisive action against automatic firearms. As of 
January 1, 1995, 21 types of assault guns will have been 
prohibited. Handguns with no legitimate purpose will be 
prohibited.
<P>
	The firearms control legislation recognizes the need for 
increased and more effective sanctions for the misuse of 
firearms.
<P>
	Contrary to an observation made just a few moments ago, four 
years is the beginning and not the end of the term. It introduces 
stiff minimum penalties that will serve as true deterrents. For 
the first time, mandatory minimum sentences of four years in 
prison in addition to a lifetime prohibition from possessing a 
restricted weapon are introduced for a series of violent offences 
including sexual assault with a weapon and aggravated sexual 
assault.
<P>
	Anybody charged with criminal harassment, better known as 
stalking can be temporarily prohibited from owning a firearm. 
That will save women's lives.
<P>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
	Third, the package sets tougher regulations on lawfully 
acquired firearms. It creates a national registration system for 
all firearms. Let us not forget that it is often a legally acquired 
firearm that is used in domestic violence. The shotgun over the 
mantelpiece is even more threatening to women than the illegal 
firearms across our border. Keeping track of property for the 
purpose of information and regulation is commonplace in our 
society.
<P>
	I am going to finish with a quotation from an editorial in <I>La 
Presse</I>:
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The editorial asked whether we could imagine a citizen 
owning a car without being licensed to drive, without a licence 
plate, without insurance, without driving within the speed 
limits, parking the car any which way and anywhere and leaving 
the key in the ignition? Of course not. So, why must we accept 
that a gun owner be entirely free to purchase, own, hide, store 
and use the gun of his or her choice.
<P>

<HR>
<B><A NAME="10400"> 10400 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will 
start by analyzing briefly the arguments in favour of the bill 
and then I will address the problem of violence against women 
within this debate.
<P>
	First, I wish to remind this House that this bill is supported by 
a great many social groups and professionals in the police, legal, 
health and social communities. I will name only a few, which 
come under the umbrella of the Coalition for Arms Control.
<P>
	They are the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police, the 
Federation of Canadian Municipalities, the Canadian Bar 
Association, the Canada Safety Council, many churches, the 
Quebec public health network, the Quebec hospital association, 
many universities and school boards, many unions, the AFEAS 
and other women's groups and community organizations. Such 
agreement on an issue that may seem controversial has rarely 
been seen in Canada and Quebec.
<P>
	The intense lobbying campaign now under way would suggest 
that the population is very divided on arms control, but such is 
not the case. The polls clearly show that the reality has always 
been otherwise.
<P>
	Allow me to quote a few of these polls. In December 1989, 
better arms control was supported by 72 per cent of Canadians 
and 87 per cent of Quebecers. By January 1991, this support had 
climbed to 80 per cent of Canadians and 90 per cent of 
Quebecers. Two years later, in September 1993, universal 
weapon registration was favoured by 86 per cent of Canadians 
and 91 per cent of Quebecers. Regarding the sale of firearms, 77 
per cent of Canadians and 87 per cent of Quebecers were of the 
opinion it should be governed by stricter legislation.
<P>
	As for those directly concerned, i.e. firearm owners, in 
September 1993, sixty-eight per cent of them supported the idea 
that all weapons should be registered. This goes to show that the 
public fears firearms and wants firearms to be better regulated.
<P>
	Several reasons militate in favour of stricter gun control. The 
Coalition for Gun Control listed a few. Here are some of the 
reasons stated: people are safer in a gun-free environment; 
firearms facilitate suicide; there is much more violence 
involving firearms in Canada than in most European countries. 
The current legislation is inadequate in many respects, 
including accessibility to military assault weapons, absence of a 
registry of all firearms in circulation, lack of a ceiling on the 
number of firearms that one can buy and lack of control over the 
sale of ammunition.
<P>
	All these reasons justify much closer monitoring of the 
possession and use of firearms.
<P>
	Now, moving to a more specific concern of mine: violence 
against women. There is a direct link between the violence 
women are subjected to and firearms. I will start by addressing 
spousal abuse.
<P>
	It will be recalled that Statistics Canada published the results 
of a comprehensive survey in October 1993.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	It showed that one Canadian woman in every four had been 
abused by her current spouse or a previous spouse and that 45 
per cent of abused women were abused by men they knew. A 
study conducted by two researchers from the Canadian Center 
for Justice Statistics and published in March 1994 dealt with the 
most extreme form of spousal abuse: homicide. Among their 
findings, the most striking are the following:
<P>
	For each man killed by his wife, there are on average 3.2 
women killed by their husbands. From 1974 to 1992, married 
women were nine times more likely to be killed by their own 
spouse than by a stranger. The number of women killed by their 
spouses after separating is high. During the 18-year period 
covered by the study, from 1974 to 1992, 1,435 women and 451 
men were killed by their spouses. The 1,435 women killed 
accounted for 38 per cent of all adult women who were 
murdered, while the 451 men killed by their wives represented 6 
per cent of murdered adult men.
<P>
	Let us now see the link between violence against women and 
gun control. Another study conducted by Statistics Canada and 
entitled ``Family Violence in Canada'' shows that, between 
1974 and 1992, forty-two per cent of women murdered by their 
spouses were killed by a firearm. These eloquent figures are 
supported by the findings of Mr. Maurice Cusson, director of the 
École de criminologie at the Université de Montréal, and his 
research assistant, Mrs. Raymonde Boisvert. In a study entitled 
``L'homicide conjugal à Montréal: ses raisons, ses conditions et 
son déroulement'', the authors examined the reasons behind, 
and the circumstances surrounding every spousal homicide 
committed on Montreal Island between 1954 and 1962, and also 
between 1985 and 1989.
<P>
	The authors first found, as women's support groups have been 
saying for a long time, that control by men is the dominant factor 
in spousal homicides. This is true for both periods, that is before 
and after the quiet revolution. The authors also note that 
homicides triggered by this need to control are always 
committed by men and that the victims are almost always 
women, the only exception being homosexual couples.
<P>
	Out of the five elements identified by the authors as being 
intrinsic to homicides based on a power relationship, there is the 
vulnerability of the victim, and this is where firearms come into 
play. The authors concluded that ``the victim must be deprived 
of adequate defence mechanisms to protect herself from the 
attacks of her spouse. This raises the issue of power, which 
usually rests with the man, who is physically stronger than the 
woman. More often than not, that power is increased by getting a 
firearm''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10401"> 10401 </A></B>
<P>
	The authors of the study see the acquisition of a firearm by 
the spouse as a danger signal which should not be overlooked. 
Another study, conducted by the Canadian Advisory Council 
on the Status of Women, showed that, between 1980 and 1989, 
72 per cent of women killed by their spouses were shot with 
a rifle or a gun. These figures are much higher than the 
percentage of murders committed with this type of weapon.
<P>
	The new legislation provides that these weapons will be 
subject to registration and thus to much stricter controls. We 
must now consider the following: would these women have died 
if our firearms legislation had been similar to the legislation 
before the House today?
<P>
	Let us draw an analogy here. What spousal suicide and 
spousal homicide have in common are the location-the 
home-and the means used. The Quebec suicide prevention 
centre has concluded, from experience, that the suicide rate is 
higher in homes where guns are available.
<P>
	A press release issued last October says that 92 per cent of 
suicide attempts where a gun was used are fatal, while suicide 
attempts using other means are fatal in only one-third of the 
cases. We have established a link between access to a weapon 
and spousal homicide. If we can save just one life by restricting 
access to firearms, we will have accomplished something.
<P>
	I support Bill C-68 because I want to eliminate the means 
used most frequently to kill women. The measures the bill 
contains will restrict access to guns through compulsory 
registration and licence renewal for responsible individuals 
only. Persons previously convicted of violent crimes and 
stalking will no longer have access to guns and ammunition. 
Furthermore, I think the minimum four year prison sentence will 
act as a deterrent to using guns in domestic situations. This is a 
win-win situation, for women, first of all, and for society in 
general.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Harold Culbert (Carleton-Charlotte, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to take the opportunity to comment on Bill 
C-68, the firearms act, on behalf of my constituents in 
Carleton-Charlotte.
<P>
	Carleton-Charlotte, located in New Brunswick, is over 200 
miles long. A good portion of it lies along the 49th parallel 
bordering on the state of Maine. It consists of all of Carleton 
county, all of Charlotte county, a sizeable portion of York county 
and a portion of Sunbury county. The economy of these regions 
is extremely diverse. It is based on agriculture and food 
processing, forestry and pulp and paper mills, the traditional 
fishery, aquaculture and fish packaging, manufacturing, tourism 
and the service industries.
<P>
	As you can imagine, Mr. Speaker, there are not large urban 
centres but rather rural areas built around service to the citizens. 
The towns and the villages have developed over the centuries to 
provide these services to surrounding rural areas. Hunting and 
pleasure fishing have been a way of life for the citizens of 
Carleton-Charlotte since the area was settled in the mid to late 
1700s.
<P>
	Hunting still plays a very important economic role in the 
region for outfitters, service industries and guides. Almost 
every farmer and many rural residents own firearms, not only 
for hunting or sport but also for the protection of their livestock 
from predators.
<P>
	Over the past few months I have held several meetings, some 
large and some small, regarding the firearms proposals which 
are now in Bill C-68. There has been complete support 
throughout Carleton-Charlotte for stiffer penalties for the use 
of firearms in the commission of a crime, including the 
minister's proposal for a four-year mandatory prison sentence 
for the use of a firearm in 10 specific violent crimes. Also the 
initiative for stiffer penalties for illegally importing and 
trafficking in firearms as well as stricter border controls on 
firearms is most commendable.
<P>
	The section dealing with the prohibition of various types of 
assault weapons is also fully supported. However the 105 
millimetre or 4.14 inch or under barrel length handgun ban has 
been questioned. It has been suggested that the full length of the 
handgun could have been emphasized instead of the barrel 
length only.
<P>
	My constituents appreciate the fact that the minister has 
requested the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs 
to determine which handguns in the prohibited class could be 
exempted due to their use in recognized shooting competitions.
<P>
	To say that they have major concerns with the universal 
registration system for legal hunting rifles and shotguns would 
be stating it mildly. Those who have commented to me on this 
subject rejected this section vehemently. As indicated, I have 
hosted meetings which were well attended and smaller meetings 
where I was able to speak candidly with individuals. In all cases 
the registration system is the portion of Bill C-68 which elicits 
the most serious concern and the strongest objection.
<P>
	The general consensus indicates that the proposed universal 
registration system, which will include the owner's legal 
hunting rifles and shotguns, will be hard to administer and 
extremely difficult and expensive to enforce.
<P>
	Many of my constituents believe that this system will make 
criminals out of innocent, law-abiding citizens who either do 
not register their legal rifles or shotguns or those who are 
unaware of the necessity to do so. These citizens are responsi-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10402"> 10402 </A></B>
<P>
ble, respectable people who enjoy hunting as a sport. They value 
their rifles and shotguns and take great care to secure them.
<P>
	However these responsible people could, through no fault of 
their own, be charged with a criminal act; for example, a person 
who is unaware that a rifle or shotgun is stored in an attic and 
does not know that they are required to register it. For many 
years now handguns have required registration. This is not new 
for handgun owners.
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	Currently an FAC, or a firearms acquisition certificate, must 
be obtained prior to purchasing any new firearm. It has been 
suggested that the FAC system be upgraded to include full 
registration for new firearms, instead of trying to initiate a 
universal registration system for all firearms. As I understand it, 
a thorough check is required and the name of the applicant, the 
description and the serial number of the firearm is kept on 
record at the retail outlet but not forwarded on to a central 
registration centre. I believe that it would be very useful for the 
Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs to review this 
possibility in an attempt to streamline the registration system.
<P>
	Other alternatives were also suggested, including a program 
which would include issuing an owner's certificate only to 
ensure that the holder is a qualified and legitimate owner.
<P>
	Another point was that although one person may own all of the 
legal hunting rifles and shotguns in a family, the individual's 
spouse, sons and daughters, who would use the firearms for 
hunting purposes, would have to purchase individual firearms 
licences at $60 every five years. This happens in many cases 
where the entire family enjoys hunting. I would suggest that the 
standing committee review the possibility of a family package 
for these cases.
<P>
	Finally, hunting plays a very important role in the economy of 
my constituency and throughout New Brunswick. Many 
outfitters have benefited from and created employment for 
others through this tradition. We must ensure that the system 
adopted is fair and equitable for the responsible firearm owner. 
We must protect this important aspect of our economy. These 
assurances can only be provided by the Standing Committee on 
Justice and Legal Affairs, through its review of Bill C-68, by 
bringing forwarded the appropriate changes.
<P>
	I would be pleased to assist the committee in any way possible 
to ensure that we have fair legislation which will be supported 
and will achieve the goals for which it was intended, to make our 
communities and our streets safe for my family, for your family 
and for all Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to begin today by expressing my 
appreciation for the presence of the Minister of Justice who is 
listening to the debate. I find it commendable that he would be 
here to listen to the speakers.
<P>
	I rise in the House today in support of the Reform Party's 
motion proposing amendments to Bill C-68, an act respecting 
firearms and other weapons.
<P>
	For several months now the people of Cariboo-Chilcotin 
have been campaigning non-stop against a bill they have seen as 
not only intrusive, but an invasion of their rights and their 
privileges as Canadian citizens.
<P>
	I received over 800 letters and 70 petitions since the Minister 
of Justice tabled his firearms legislation late last year. They all 
had the same message: get tough on the criminal, not on the 
legal, law-abiding gun owner. These are impassioned letters and 
the message being given is a simple message. It is a message that 
has been sent to Reformers, Liberals and Bloc members alike. It 
is a message which has not been heeded in Bill C-68 and it is a 
message to which the Reform Party is trying to respond with this 
amendment.
<P>
	Bill C-68, as it now stands, is, as my colleague from Prince 
George-Peace River noted, really two bills combined into one. 
On the one hand it gets tough on criminals that commit crimes 
using firearms and replica firearms by increasing minimum 
sentences to four years in prison. This is a measure for which the 
Reform Party has been calling. As the Reform blue book clearly 
states: ``If elected a Reform government will introduce 
legislation by which the criminal misuse of firearms will be 
severely punished''. Reform has called for minimum mandatory 
jail terms for firearms related crimes. I am encouraged that 
these concerns have been at least partially included in Bill C-68. 
This truly is getting tough on the criminal.
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	If these measures are brought into law independently, the 
government can count on the support of Reform Party MPs and 
our party membership across the country. On the other hand, Bill 
C-68 places what many Reformers and even some Liberals 
agree are excessive and unnecessary restrictions on the legal, 
law-abiding gun owner.
<P>
	I refer particularly to the proposed firearms registry, along 
with the many accompanying provisions that could make 
criminals out of gun owners. It could make criminals out of them 
simply because they do nothing. This provision, as I noted 
earlier, has raised a great deal of concern within my riding and 
many others.
<P>
	The current handgun registry has had little if any effect on 
crime. The proposed firearms registry will only follow in its 
footsteps, adding more rules but doing nothing to solve the 
problem. However, this is an issue to which I will speak at 
another time.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10403"> 10403 </A></B>
<P>
	As for the amendment, the Reform Party has given the 
Minister of Justice and the House an historic opportunity. It 
gives all members of Parliament the choice to stand together 
and to show Canadians our common commitment to fighting 
crime. Despite our political differences we share a desire to get 
tough on criminals. Together we can quickly pass strong 
anti-crime legislation.
<P>
	The amendment will also provide us all with the chance to 
focus at a later date on the one issue that divides us and threatens 
this entire package. That issue is the firearms registry. The use 
of a registry in firearm ownership is a radical departure from 
Canadian tradition and one which should be carefully examined.
<P>
	In light of the experiences of countries such as England, 
Australia and New Zealand we are very much afraid this is a lost 
cause before it even gets started. Two years ago the Auditor 
General made this statement on the topic of Canada's gun 
control policy. He said: ``Evaluation of the [gun control] 
program is essential to give the Canadian public and members of 
Parliament the assurance that its objectives are being met''.
<P>
	Clearly the gun registry has not undergone the sort of 
significant, non-partisan evaluation needed to contribute to the 
debate. Until this happens there will be ongoing divisions within 
the House over the registry, slowing up the positive aspects of 
Bill C-68 in the process. If this is the only issue that seriously 
divides us as parliamentarians, let us deal with it separately. Let 
us deal with it in the best interests of all Canadians.
<P>
	In closing, as members of Parliament we have long hoped for 
the day when we can come together in a spirit of co-operation 
and common direction in the interests of our constituents. By 
adopting the Reform amendment the House can, even on this one 
issue, work in unison for the betterment of all Canadians. Let us 
not let what divides us hold back what unites us.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réginald Bélair (Cochrane-Superior, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, when the gun control issue heated up last year after a 
string of gun-related crimes, culminating in the fatal shooting at 
the Just Desserts restaurant in Toronto, emotion ran so high that 
it was very difficult in the confusion to properly dissociate the 
weapon of the crime from the underlying and growing issue of 
violence in our society.
<P>
	Responsibility for these crimes was quickly linked to the 
availability of firearms and to every firearms owner. Under the 
proposed gun and crime control bill a very high number of my 
constituents understand the fact that responsibility for crimes 
involving firearms is being unfairly attributed to the 
law-abiding gun owner on the same basis as the criminals.
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The government is right to introduce legislation containing 
tougher sanctions against individuals convicted of murder and 
to step up efforts to deal with the smuggling of firearms. Such 
measures are necessary if we want to control crime and prevent 
an increase in the crime rate. We must ensure compliance with 
existing legislation on the wrongful use of firearms and their 
proliferation in our society. However, I have serious 
reservations about some of the points proposed in the bill.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In my riding, being a rural one, almost everyone owns a rifle 
or a shotgun, yet the incidence of violent crimes involving 
firearms is practically non-existent. They are responsible and 
law-abiding citizens including natives, trappers, sustenance and 
sports hunters, gun club members and gun collectors that have 
all proven their ability to own and use a firearm. Stricter gun 
control will not necessarily result in a decrease in the number of 
crimes involving firearms in this rural part of Canada. These 
law-abiding firearm owners should not be burdened or 
inconvenienced with additional gun control measures that will 
not reduce crime or improve public safety.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Self-respecting firearms owners will not willingly accept a 
further erosion of their right to privacy. They are afraid that 
when the data base is complete, it may provide, on request, 
information on their financial situation, marital status, mental 
health and mobility, all because of regulations that may 
profoundly intrude on their privacy, and at their own expense.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	My constituents have been asking all along that the bill be 
divided into two parts: legislation that directly affects 
law-abiding gun owners and legislation that affects the criminal 
use of firearms. They have, as I have, also requested a free vote 
on the issue. We know that this will not be the case and therein 
lies my dilemma. I am wrenched between the loyalty to my party 
and representation of the views of my constituents. It will not be 
an easy call.
<P>
	Eighty-five million dollars was forecast by the government to 
implement the national firearms registration system. The 
federal government has pegged the number of guns in 
circulation to be registered at 7.5 million. This number differs 
by a wide margin with the Ontario Federation of Anglers and 
Hunters calculations of 15 million as well as with those of the 
National Firearms Association. That is why the projection is 
unrealistic while I find the cost still prohibitive.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10404"> 10404 </A></B>
<P>
	The National Rifle Association in the United States has 
already expressed concern that American hunters who will be 
required to register at the border will not come to Canada if 
they have to register their guns.
<P>
	If we implement tough proposals do we not risk creating a 
new kind of relationship between the government and 
law-abiding gun owners, a climate of non-compliance or civil 
disobedience? We must keep in mind that the legislation is 
counting on all gun owners to voluntarily register themselves 
with police and to register all of their firearms by the year 2003.
<P>
	Anti-gun control proponents could use any illegal avenue to 
stay out of what has already been dubbed the registration 
swamp. We must avoid red tape and restrictions on law-abiding 
gun owners if we cannot yield any evidence that stricter controls 
would make our communities safer.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The adoption of pro-active prohibition orders has also raised 
objections from many firearms owners. The penalty would 
apply to all members of the household if one member is affected 
by such an order. Should we impose prohibition orders on 
law-abiding firearms owners because a close relative 
committed a crime using a firearm? Many people think this is 
very unfair.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	From another perspective on the issue, I hesitate to endorse 
new gun control legislation before the provisions of the 
Criminal Code can first be fully applied and enforced. We know 
that Bill C-17 is still in the early stages. Insufficient time has 
passed since its adoption to assess the effectiveness of its 
measures.
<P>
	Law making, to be meaningful, must go beyond the legislative 
process and must be enforced. Every gun control or enforcement 
measure requires resources for its implementation. This will be 
an extra burden on the RCMP, the QPP and the OPP. If the threat 
of massive non-compliance is carried out, our federal court 
system will become so clogged that it will take years to process 
each individual case.
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	A number of inquiries conducted in various countries have 
shown there is no connection between the percentage of crimes 
involving firearms and the degree of regulation of firearms in 
that country. In countries with a very low rate of violent crimes 
or homicide, like Japan and Switzerland, the presence or 
absence of firearms is irrelevant. However, making young 
people socially responsible, giving them a good education and 
warning them against criminal behaviour is a major factor in 
producing low crime rates.
<P>
	Countries that have tough firearms legislation have shown an 
increase in the rate of violent crimes. Countries whose citizens 
have a healthy cultural life and have very close family ties have 
the lowest rate of violent crimes committed with firearms, 
whether such arms are available or not. There is no evidence that 
more regulations have reduced the number of violent crimes.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Such findings are important. Homicide is a societal problem 
unrelated or at least marginally related to public access to 
firearms. The government should therefore concentrate its 
efforts toward identifying the real causes of crime in our society.
<P>
	Bill C-68 is not only a registration bill but also a crime 
control bill. Imposing minimum mandatory sentences of four 
years for serious crimes committed with a firearm will go a lot 
further in deterring violent crime. Judges will be given strict 
instructions to no longer be lenient with the criminal element of 
our society and not to accept plea bargaining from defence 
attorneys. Measures such as these will make potential criminals 
think twice before they commit a reprehensible act.
<P>
	The anti-tobacco and alcohol smuggling campaign of 1994 
has proven to be very successful and the same methods of 
controls should be applied. The one-year minimum sentence 
will also send a very strong message that the illegal importation 
of firearms will be severely punished.
<P>
	A huge majority of Canadians also agree that military and 
paramilitary weapons should be prohibited as their usefulness is 
totally unjustifiable in our society.
<P>
	In essence, Bill C-68 responds extensively and quite 
adequately to Canadians' wishes to strengthen the Criminal 
Code for crimes involving firearms. I totally share this feeling 
with my urban colleagues. There are legitimate concerns since 
crimes committed with firearms are in effect concentrated in 
urban areas.
<P>
	However I feel that this bill does not heed the concerns of 
rural Canada. A law-abiding citizen could end up with the same 
black mark on his or her record as a criminal found guilty of a 
real crime involving a firearm.
<P>
	In addition, one must really question the constitutionality of 
the information that will be stored on the magnetic strip of the 
credit card style of permit. Canada is a country that prides itself 
in respecting the privacy of its citizens. Is the federal 
government not probing too deeply into people's lives? 
Furthermore, if this bill is adopted as is, it will be most 
interesting to see how the Supreme Court of Canada will react to 
this point as this law no doubt will be challenged.
<P>
	I am reserving final judgment on this bill until I am given an 
opportunity to study the forthcoming amendments. I owe it to 
the 6,000 constituents who have taken the time to write, to sign 
petitions, or to verbally express their views on this controversial 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10405"> 10405 </A></B>
<P>
issue. Hopefully  the speeches heard in this House will serve to 
enlighten the members on their final vote.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval-Centre, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, today we are debating on second reading Bill C-68, 
an act respecting firearms and other weapons. The current 
Liberal government is making it a key piece of its legislation.
<P>
	The famous red book to which our colleagues across the floor 
so often refer promised tough legislation in the area of gun 
control. The Bloc Quebecois, like most Quebecers, has always 
been in favour of tighter gun control.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	A number of recent tragic events have made all of Quebec 
aware of the inescapable reality that firearms are dangerous and 
kill readily.
<P>
	Murderous rampages are a fact in our society: 1984, 
Assemblée nationale, three killed; 1989, Ecole Polytechnique, 
thirteen women killed; 1992, Concordia University, three 
professors killed. These events are etched in our collective 
memory.
<P>
	Bill C-68 is therefore a step in the right direction. It proposes 
measures to ensure better control over the purchase, possession 
and storage of firearms.
<P>
	It provides for more severe punishment for the possession of a 
prohibited or restricted weapon. It also introduces new offences 
and denunciatory sentences for the illegal importing and the 
trafficking of arms. It will now be prohibited to import or sell 
.25 or .32 calibre handguns and handguns with a barrel length of 
105 millimetres or less.
<P>
	Finally, the bill establishes a national registration system for 
all firearms, to be administered by the Royal Canadian Mounted 
Police in co-operation with provincial and municipal forces.
<P>
	This system will help police forces to combat the criminal use 
of guns: first, orders of prohibition for certain weapons will be 
enforced; second, the fight against smuggling will be stepped up 
by controlling the kind and the quantity of firearms entering the 
country; third, compliance with the rules for the safe storage of 
firearms will be ensured; fourth, it will be easier for police 
forces to track stolen weapons or those used to commit crimes.
<P>
	Setting up the gun registry is a positive move. We 
nevertheless deplore that this system will not pay for itself, as 
was initially promised by the government and demanded by the 
official opposition. In fact, the Liberal government estimates 
that, over a period of seven years, it will cost $85 million to 
implement the system.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois has no problem recognizing that this 
system will help fight against the illegal sale, possession or use 
of firearms. However, the official opposition believes that the 
period for registering firearms must be shortened. In spreading 
the deadline over an eight-year period, the government has 
chosen to compromise the attainment of the goals of police 
forces.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois has no doubt that the Minister of Justice 
and his government caved in to the repeated attacks of several 
pro-gun lobby groups. Does the power of money compare to the 
power of AK-47s?
<P>
	How else could we explain that over 13,000 military type 
automatic weapons, including over 4,000 AK-47 machine guns, 
will remain uncontrolled?
<P>
	What kind of moral of logical justification could there be for 
owning such a firearm? Partridge hunting? We could lose a lot of 
feathers if that were the case. Personal protection then? In that 
case, we have powerful enemies. The desire to own collector's 
weapons? Is an AK-47 a work of art? Unless, of course, we want 
to turn it into a symbol of our civilization.
<P>
	The government did not have the courage to do its homework. 
It evaded its responsibilities by asking the Standing Committee 
on Justice to find solutions to problems the government itself 
created.
<P>
	For example, the government has asked this committee to find 
an acceptable solution in the case of firearms that have special 
significance for some people as family heirlooms, so that 
owners can bequeath their firearms to their children as part of 
their inheritance. That may be a legacy of love.
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	Given the situation, the Bloc Quebecois can only support 
wholeheartedly the recommendations made by coroner 
Anne-Marie David. The Liberal government should do the 
same.
<P>
	Coroner David suggests that the Minister of Justice should 
amend the wording of the regulations on the safe storage, 
display and transportation of firearms to make it more 
consistent and easier to understand for the whole population. 
She feels that the current regulations are confusing and that not 
distinguishing between unrestricted and restricted weapons 
contributes to the confusion.
<P>
	What Boileau said in the 17th century is more valid than ever: 
``A well-formed thought can be conveyed clearly, and the words 
to express it come easily''.
<P>
	Coroner David also notes that the current regulations allow 
weapons to be displayed. Is it unreasonable to believe that such a 
display can be an incentive to steal weapons or arouse the 
curiosity of some people who may be tempted to handle them?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10406"> 10406 </A></B>
<P>
	The regulations contain another flaw: How can we approve 
regulations that authorize the transportation of unloaded 
unrestricted weapons on the back seat of a vehicle, as long as 
they are under the supervision of an adult?
<P>
	According to Anne-Marie David, such leniency is an 
incentive to steal and contravenes in some cases the provisions 
of the Act Respecting the Conservation and Development of 
Wildlife.
<P>
	The government must therefore launch an extensive 
information campaign to clearly explain the amendments to the 
regulations. It is aimed at the public at large, but should target 
certain groups in particular, such as hunters, collectors and 
sharpshooters.
<P>
	According to coroner David, it is imperative that this 
publicity campaign be conducted under the aegis of a provincial 
committee and, sadly, that the federal government contribute 
the financial resources necessary to the success of such 
endeavour.
<P>
	As we can see, this bill has no teeth, but its flaws have to be 
remedied, if the federal government really wants this legislation 
to have not just teeth, but good sharp ones.
<P>
	The official opposition remains committed to producing 
legislation that will ensure tighter gun control. Support 
expressed by individuals, organizations and community social 
action groups fighting against violence, is extensive.
<P>
	A large coalition originating from Quebec has taken a stand 
for closer monitoring of the sale, possession and use of firearms. 
Both public and parapublic organizations have come forward; 
the vast majority of police forces and police associations are in 
favour of increased gun control.
<P>
	As the member for Laval Centre, I am particularly proud of 
the level of awareness displayed by the residents of my riding 
and my city, as evidenced by the resolution passed by the Laval 
town council on November 9, 1994, in support-unequivocal 
support-of stricter gun control measures.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
delighted to stand and make my contribution to the debate on the 
question of the adoption of the new legislation on gun control in 
this country. I say to anyone in this House who is in question as 
to where I stand on this issue, I stand most strongly and most 
passionately in favour of the adoption of this bill. I do so for a 
whole variety of reasons. Many of them are emotional because it 
is an emotional debate.
<P>
	I think that all of us, wherever we stand on the gun control 
debate, were horrified just before Christmas when a young girl 
in the United States went for a sleepover with her friends 
because her parents were going to be away overnight. At some 
point in the evening  she found out that her parents were going to 
be able to come home. She and her friend went back to the house. 
When she heard her parents coming in she hid in the closet. 
When her father came in the front door she jumped out of the 
closet and yelled ``boo'' and her father shot her to death. What a 
terrible tragedy. It would not have taken place if there had not 
been a gun in that house.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	I think many of us remember the case in Michigan several 
years ago of a 9-year old paperboy who went to collect paper 
money, something he did every week. Most of us pay our 
paperboys or girls every week. The owner of the house, not 
realizing who it was, thinking it was an intruder, shot him to 
death.
<P>
	We remember the Japanese exchange student in the United 
States who was out with some friends on Halloween, 
experiencing a long and treasured tradition in the culture of the 
United States and Canada, going door to door, trick or treating. 
He too was shot and killed by a homeowner who thought he was 
an intruder.
<P>
	All of these examples take place tragically in the United 
States. I believe most passionately they take place there because 
there is a gun culture in that country that does not exist in this 
one. I intend to fight most passionately to see that kind of culture 
never takes hold in this country. That is not the culture that 
belongs to bona fide hunters, farmers or sport shooters.
<P>
	I am going to quote someone I saw on CTV not too long ago. 
The man's name is Dan Matheson. Any who watch Canada AM 
will have seen him. He does sports, the weather and shares the 
anchor desk. One day not too long ago he said he had taken his 
little boy fishing. I cannot remember if I have the exact cost, but 
it somewhere between $30 and $50 to get a fishing licence to go 
fishing with his son. He said: ``I just do not get it. I pay this to go 
fishing with my son. What is the complaint to register a gun? 
That is a whole lot more dangerous than a fishing rod''.
<P>
	The whole question of gun mentality in this country is 
misunderstood. There are members in this House who have 
misused the statement that there is a right to bear arms. There is 
not now any right in any Canadian constitution to bear arms. Not 
in this country. Not now and please, God, not ever. We have 
already seen the results of violence.
<P>
	The hon. member opposite spoke most eloquently of some of 
the examples in Montreal; the example that haunts all Canadians 
over the age of reason on that December night, the École 
Polytechnique.
<P>
	Violent actions are not only occurring in the streets at the 
hands of criminals, they are occurring in the homes of our 
neighbours. Death and injury by guns in the home are now a 
greater problem than the criminal misuse of firearms on the 
street. This relates directly to the questions of violence against 
women.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10407"> 10407 </A></B>
<P>
	The greatest threat of homicide is not at the hands of a 
stranger. The majority of gun homicides, 86 per cent, are caused 
by family members, friends or acquaintances. One woman in 
Canada is killed with by gun every six days, most often in the 
home by someone she knows. We have evidence that a 
significant number of offenders act impulsively, suggesting that 
the simple availability of a gun can determine whether a 
homicide will occur.
<P>
<B>(1635 ) </B>
<P>
	I have tremendous respect and affection for the Minister of 
Justice but he does not go as far as I would. It is probably 
because I am an urban member. It is probably because I am a 
woman. It is probably because I do not have a cool head when it 
comes to the question of guns and gun control.
<P>
	Last session I saw a bill brought forward that had many good 
points. I sat on the legislative committee that dealt with that bill. 
I saw it watered down until it effectively meant very little. That 
is why I am so proud to stand on this side of the House with this 
minister, with this government, to support this bill. It is tough 
and it is also fair.
<P>
	I have been to gun clubs where I have walked in and said: 
``Gentlemen, I am your worst nightmare''. No one in the House 
is more strongly opposed to guns than I am. There are many who 
are equally strongly opposed, but none more strongly opposed.
<P>
	I have left those gun clubs with those people perhaps not 
agreeing with me but understanding my point of view and 
understanding the point of view that is the most important, that 
70 per cent of the people of this country agree with the Minister 
of Justice. They agree with the Prime Minister. They agree with 
members on this side of the House because they apply a little 
intelligence to the equation and they understand the situation.
<P>
	If we want to talk about legitimate polls, as the member from 
Calgary appears to be, he could speak to his own minister of 
justice in Alberta who commissioned a poll. Those of us who 
know a fair bit about polling know that we can commission polls 
so that questions will turn up the response we want. That 
minister was not a particular proponent of this government's law 
and yet even that poll showed that 62 per cent of the people in 
Alberta favoured gun control.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Out of 300.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> To hon. members opposite, if they want to get 
their poll done right maybe they should re-educate their 
attorney general. In Alberta 62 per cent said yes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> He is not here to defend himself.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> I can only pick on people who are not here. It is 
too easy to pick on those opposite. If hon. member's opposite 
would like to calm down and listen, I would be happy to 
conclude.
<P>
	This is a very serious issue. This is a very important issue to 
the women of this country and to the children of this country. It 
is very interesting that we talk about guns and their different 
categories. We talk about automatic weapons, semi-automatic 
weapons and some of the particularly horrible instruments of 
mayhem I saw when I travelled with the Toronto police force 
some months ago.
<P>
	The hon. member opposite says they defended this country in 
the second world war. Our guns were turned on an enemy in the 
second world war that was trying to subjugate an entire culture 
and an entire belief in democracy. I do not think we should be 
turning those same weapons on our fellow citizens, which we 
have been.
<P>
	Let me get back to my original point, guns, automatic 
weapons, semi-automatic weapons, those awful instruments of 
mayhem. Many are going to be banned. Let no one 
misunderstand that for women in this country an ordinary 
shotgun in a gun case or hanging over the mantelpiece is an 
object to be feared. It is an object to worry about for oneself or 
for one's children, given the circumstances in far too many 
families.
<P>
<B>(1640 ) </B>
<P>
	Again, I am very proud to stand with this government and this 
minister on the whole issue of gun control. I stand here knowing 
this is a promise made to the people of Canada, important to the 
people of Canada. First and foremost, this is a promise that will 
be kept to the people of Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the issue 
of gun control has become one of the more emotionally charged 
debates to be addressed in this House.
<P>
	As the member for Calgary Centre, I cannot believe how 
quickly such an important subject has digressed into the realm 
of us against them, between interest groups, spin doctors, media 
pundits, urban and rural ridings, men and women. We have lost 
sight of who we are trying to protect.
<P>
	Not one person in the House enjoys picking up a newspaper 
and reading about a man, woman or child being shot by another 
person. No one enjoys walking the streets at night with a feeling 
of fear in their stomach. Emotionally we are all on the same 
wave length and so it is time to start thinking and acting 
rationally, not just emotionally and politically, as the justice 
minister said today in question period.
<P>
	The purpose of the motion we are debating today is to split 
Bill C-68 in two. One bill would cover the Criminal Code 
amendments dealing with the use of firearms during the 
commission of a crime while the second bill would deal with the 
issue of a national firearms registration system. The rationale is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10408"> 10408 </A></B>
<P>
simple. The Minister of Justice has lumped these two separate 
issues together under the banner of crime control.
<P>
	I do not believe criminals will register their guns and I believe 
the current firearms acquisition certificate system is adequate in 
the control of legitimate firearms owners. Therefore we should 
separate this bill. Even some members of the Liberal caucus 
support our motion.
<P>
	At a town hall meeting on March 5 the hon. member for 
Lanark-Carleton stated he would like to see Bill C-68 split 
wherein the anti-crime and anti-smuggling components of the 
legislation would be dealt with separately from the issue of gun 
registration. They are two separate issues. I fully expect the 
Liberal member will vote in favour of our amendment.
<P>
	I am prepared to support measures that genuinely reduce 
crime, but the burden of proof is on the Minister of Justice to 
prove gun registration will work. Therefore, before debate on 
this bill concludes I would simply ask some Liberal members to 
answer a few questions.
<P>
	How will a firearms registration system truly protect society 
in light of the fact that other systems around the world have 
shown that it does not really make a difference? How will the 
government gauge the success of the program? How will the 
high costs be reconciled with making criminals out of innocent 
people?
<P>
	I have some serious, common sense questions regarding who 
benefits from this program. The Minister of Justice has said 
registration will reduce crime and better equip the police to deal 
with crime in Canadian society by providing them with more 
information they often need to do their jobs.
<P>
	Criminals will not register their weapons. I find it rather 
unlikely that policemen on the streets will approach a suspect's 
house any differently if the computer says the suspect does not 
own a gun. Caution will still be the rule.
<P>
	I would like to take a moment to read part of a letter from two 
Calgary policemen:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>On Saturday, November 26, 1994 my partner and I were dispatched to a noisy 
stereo complaint in northwest Calgary. After knocking on the door for an 
extended period of time, my partner and I were confronted by a man at the door 
with a loaded, sawed-off shotgun which he pointed at my partner's chest. The 
man was subdued, arrested and charged with four weapons related offences.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>During our investigation we determined that the man was prohibited from 
owning or possessing any firearms until 1998 because of a weapons offence in 
1992. The weapon he had in his possession was also a prohibited weapon.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Of all the four offences the man was charged with, only one, assault with a 
weapon, is an offence where police can take the criminal to jail. Pointing a 
weapon, possession of a prohibited weapon and pointing a prohibited weapon 
are minor offences in the Criminal Code, the criminal version of a speeding 
ticket.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>How will registration possibly change what happened to us?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The man was legally prohibited from having a gun but he had 
one. Does a police officer have to get shot to make us realize that 
we have to get tough on these sorts of offenders?
<P>
	According to the Department of Justice, in over half the cases 
in which possession charges are laid by police they are dropped 
once they get to court. That is the reality outside of planet 
Ottawa.
<P>
	Addressing the inherent weaknesses of the Criminal Code and 
the charter of rights and freedoms should be our number one 
priority.
<P>
<B>(1645 ) </B>
<P>
	Handguns have been registered in Canada for 60 years. In 
spite of this, using the minister's own statistics, handgun crimes 
have been on the increase. There is no evidence to indicate that 
universal registration of shotguns and rifles will be any more 
effective.
<P>
	Are we really worried about hunters, target shooters and 
collectors? Maybe the Liberals are but I cannot accept that these 
people are responsible for the violence on our streets. It is the 
criminals using illegally obtained weapons who are responsible 
for gun related crimes. They should be the target.
<P>
	The Liberals like to use the logic that if you have to register 
your car you should register your gun. If you register your gun 
you will become more responsible, less inclined to have an 
accident and less likely to have your weapon fall into the hands 
of criminals.
<P>
	When we look at vehicle registration, what effect does it have 
on preventing theft, promoting responsible use and reducing 
accidents? Does vehicle registration prevent drunk driving?
<P>
	In Calgary a teenager was recently sentenced to six years for 
running down and killing a police officer with a registered 
stolen car. Is the owner of the stolen car responsible for the death 
of Constable Sonnenberg? Should car owners have to take more 
responsibility ensuring that their vehicles are stored safely? 
Should we apply the same legal impediments to car ownership 
that the minister wants to apply to gun ownership? Would this 
have saved Constable Sonnenberg? Of course not.
<P>
	No matter what steps we take to prevent our property from 
being stolen, criminals find a way to get at it. No matter how 
much registration we have the simple truth is that people will 
continue to break the law. Let us start focusing our legislation on 
discouraging those who might and punishing those do.
<P>
	Let us send a collective message to potential criminals that 
this country does not tolerate violence and violent offenders. 
From now on the punishment will match the crime.
<P>
	Becoming a legal firearms owner in Canada today is by no 
means a cakewalk. Applicants must obtain a firearms 
acquisition certificate which is an extremely probing form 
containing questions about personal matters such as drug and 
alcohol abuse, job loss and divorce, to name a few.  Applicants 
must then furnish the names of two people from the prescribed 
list of occupations and relationships who can verify the 
information in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10409"> 10409 </A></B>
<P>
the application. This is followed by a 28-day mandatory waiting 
period during which a firearms officer can conduct an 
investigation on applicants. Upon completion the applicants 
must then pass a course or test on the safe handling and use of 
firearms and the laws relating to them. The applicant is then 
photographed and his or her certificate is processed centrally by 
the chief provincial or territorial firearms officer. What more 
can you do?
<P>
	In the time it takes one legal gun owner to go through this 
process, thousands of stolen or smuggled guns will change 
hands in the streets. That is the problem. If this government 
would take more time to identify the right problem, it would find 
60 per cent of the solution.
<P>
	The national debt is the problem. The deficit is a contributing 
factor. That is why we have to get to a zero deficit, not just 3 per 
cent of GDP. The lack of deterrence for the criminal misuse of 
firearms is the problem. Registration is not even a contributing 
factor.
<P>
	The Liberals are identifying the wrong problem. The Minister 
of Justice stated in the House that last year an estimated 375,000 
weapons were smuggled into Canada. In the same breath he went 
on to say last year approximately 3,800 firearms were lost or 
stolen by those who lawfully own them in Canada. In the years 
since 1974 a cumulative total of 65,000 firearms have been 
stolen or lost, not recovered.
<P>
	There were 3,800 stolen or lost weapons as opposed to 
375,000 smuggled guns, yet the main emphasis of our new gun 
control laws will be registration for legal gun owners. I believe 
that instead of throwing millions of dollars toward registration 
we should look at all possible ways to beef up our security at 
borders.
<P>
	Let us do everything in our power to stop the 375,000 guns 
from finding their way into hands of criminals. Let us send a 
clear message to the people who bring them across the border 
that if they get caught, they will not just get a slap on the wrist or 
a fine, but a guarantee of time behind bars.
<P>
	Currently we have mandatory sentences for firearms offences 
that are not enforced because they are plea bargained away. 
Therefore a mandatory sentence is utterly meaningless and 
useless. I can see the need for a crown prosecutor to have some 
latitude in handling a case. The flexibility that plea bargaining 
offers is intended to lead to a conviction. I realize it is necessary, 
but not the outright elimination of a mandatory sentence. It 
should be a reduced sentence.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	A national firearms registry flies directly in the face of 
today's reality which is that the vast majority of people want less 
government regulation and intrusion in their lives, not more. A 
10-year jail term for failure to register and the right to register a 
firearm and the right to search and seizure without a warrant are 
incomprehensible.
<P>
	Are we headed for a police state if this bill passes in its 
present form? Is the minister not willing to separate the bill and 
debate the two separate issues? He knows full well that they are 
two separate issues. He knows that this party would support the 
amendments to the Criminal Code to make it tougher on crime. 
He knows he would get our support.
<P>
	Why bother with this national registration issue with the same 
bill? Separate the two. Have the courage and conviction to have 
a true and honest debate. People are sick and tired of hearing 
about the rights of criminals. They want them caught. They want 
them off the streets. They want them punished and, above all, 
they want laws that will make people think twice about 
becoming criminals in the first place.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Don Valley North, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, 128 years ago our founding fathers came together, gave 
this House power to enact laws, to ensure peace, order and good 
government in Canada.
<P>
	Even President Clinton on his visit to this country on February 
23 said Canada has shown to the world how to balance freedom 
with compassion and tradition with innovation. Canada set the 
example for the rest of the world on many occasions. This 
certainly is one of those occasions when we can say to the world 
that we set the standards and we make the examples for the rest 
to follow.
<P>
	On October 25, 1993 the people of Canada voted for the 
Liberal Party. In the red book we made a promise to make our 
streets safe and offload the guns. Bill C-68 goes in that 
direction.
<P>
	Public support for this bill has been enormous, 80 per cent to 
85 per cent. Even in Alberta we are told 62 per cent of the 
population supports the bill. In my riding of Don Valley North, 
which I am proud to represent, 90 per cent of the population 
supports this bill.
<P>
	In my riding I received only seven or eight representations 
opposing the bill. Out of those, one of them was a U.S. citizen 
complaining about the bill. When I asked him why he does not 
complain to U.S. senators, he said he lives here and has to 
complain to me.
<P>
	Many of us receive many letters from various organizations 
and individuals regarding Bill C-68. I received maybe 200 
letters from various parts of the country. One said in part: ``It 
has come to my attention that someone has sent a number of 
misleading letters to various members of Parliament and some 
Reformers, including yourself''.
<P>
	These letters are on the subject of government policy 
proposals and gun controls. One says in part: ``Many of these 
letters bear my name and address and are signed but were not 
written, signed or sent by me. My signature is false. I believe 
you have 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10410"> 10410 </A></B>
<P>
received one of these letters as I have received correspondence 
from you on this topic. I hereby request that you remove me 
from your mailing list''.
<P>
	I am not saying that all the letters are forged but I am sure that 
15 members received letters that are the same. They have not 
sent a letter to anybody but somehow someone took the liberty 
to send letters to members of Parliament so they can say they 
received 200, 300, 1,000 letters, and that is how they can make 
public opinion saying people oppose it. The fact is that people 
support this bill.
<P>
	I want to raise the issue of rural and urban communities. In the 
last byelection in a riding in Quebec 62 per cent of the riding was 
rural and 38 per cent was urban. In that byelection nobody ever 
raised the issue of gun control. It is obvious that rural Canadians 
support the bill. They are happy with it and they want to go 
forward with it so we can build a new Canada, safe and sound for 
everybody.
<P>
<B>(1655 ) </B>
<P>
	On September 17, I invited members of Parliament in metro 
Toronto to attend meetings with the constable in charge of the 
gun depot in metro Toronto. He showed us 13,000 handguns, 
machine guns, AK-47s or M-16s, whatever the case may be. 
Some of them were legally owned, stolen from their owners so 
they could be used in crimes. They showed me replicas so 
similar it was hard to say which one was which.
<P>
	Don Valley North is one of the few ridings in the country that 
has no gun shop. We would like to keep it that way.
<P>
	Most people complain about the registration section of this 
bill. When this bill was presented last year I phoned the city of 
North York and asked how many dogs are registered there. The 
answer is 18,710. We asked the minister and members of this 
Parliament how many guns we have in the country. They tell us 
anywhere from 4 million to 15 million.
<P>
	Four million to 15 million guns can do more harm to the 
country and its citizens than 18,000 dogs in North York. If we 
can register the dogs, the cats, the cars, why not the guns? I 
cannot understand. No one has been able to explain it to me. I am 
a reasonable person, more than the hon. member on the other 
side who shouts meaningless sentences. He should answer to 
Canadians why he opposes legislation when 80 per cent to 85 per 
cent of Canadians support it and want to go ahead with this bill.
<P>
	Many guns used in a crime these days are stolen from rightful 
owners; as I said before, 3,800 guns. If legislation goes through 
the way it is, we will know exactly where the guns come from so 
we can follow up, trace them and hold the owner of a gun 
responsible.
<P>
	It is my pleasure to support this bill to the best of my ability. I 
can assure the House, even my colleagues in the Reform Party, 
that the Don Valley North population supports this bill 100 per 
cent. We will make sure that by passing this bill Canada will be a 
safe place.
<P>
	In the last two years Canada was rated the best country by the 
United Nations and we will make sure it continues to be one of 
the best and safest countries in the world.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It is my duty, pursuant to Standing 
Order 38, to inform the House that the questions to be raised 
tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows: the hon. 
member for Bourassa-The budget; the hon. member for The 
Battlefords-Meadow Lake-Low level flights; the hon. 
member for Kamloops-Royal Bank of Canada.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this debate has 
taken on quite a bit of emotion. I would like to approach it from 
the standpoint of the gun control advocates who I believe are 
intelligent, compassionate people, who truly believe that 
stricter control of firearms will make our streets safer. I believe 
also that the justice minister truly has those thoughts in mind. I 
do not think he has any nefarious reasons to be doing what he is 
doing.
<P>
	We desire to split the bill into two components. One 
component Reformers would very quickly support. The other I 
do not think we would.
<P>
	On the issue of registration I have looked beyond the borders 
of Canada to find out what registration did in countries where it 
was tried. This is the only mechanism I have to compare Canada 
with other countries. By the justice minister's own recollection 
there is no statistical basis for doing what we are doing. I looked 
beyond our shores. I am really addressing this to those who 
honestly believe registration will work.
<P>
	New Zealand registered all firearms. Over quite a complex 
process it registered its firearms.
<P>
<B>(1700 ) </B>
<P>
	I went through the history of it. Back in World War I it had 
reason to be concerned about firearms coming into the country 
and it registered them. After registering firearms for many years 
it looked at registration and asked whether it achieved the 
purpose for which it was undertaken. I have heard the justice 
minister say that the reason its registration system failed was 
that it had a poor computer system.
<P>
	That may be the reason but New Zealand said the registration 
was of limited value because compliance was poor. Moving 
from spot to spot was not reported so that even if a person had 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10411"> 10411 </A></B>
<P>
registered the registration went astray. It was also found that it 
was only useful if the serial number were registered. Many 
weapons were not registered by serial number but by model 
number. Even  if the law-abiding citizen took the time to do that 
it was a failure. It was found that many people never registered, 
did not comply. As well it was found that the cost was 
unjustified. It was much more expensive than expected. That is a 
very important issue in these days of financial restraint.
<P>
	New Zealand abandoned its registration system and went to a 
system of licensing much like a pilot's licence. An individual 
who wanted a weapon had to be registered. It depended on the 
level of use whether or not the individual went for the high or 
lower level. There is a lesson to be learned by Canada from the 
experiences in New Zealand.
<P>
	Second is the overall registration of firearms. I made a 
comment on national radio that Australia had tried registration 
of firearms. I got a blast from the consul's office saying that I 
said the wrong thing. It was wrong. It was not tried overall in 
Australia. It was only tried in various Australian states.
<P>
	The state that closely resembles Canada is the state of 
Victoria. In 1984 Victoria decided that all firearms had to be 
registered. There were some massacres, some murders in 
Australia. Public opinion was inflamed just like it is in Canada 
today. Registration was to be the answer, according to 
Australian politicians.
<P>
	In 1984 registration was to be phased in over a three-year 
period. The Australian police resolved that the spread of 
firearms should be contained. They actually had a very specific 
way to contain firearms. The initial statement made by the 
Australian police was that no home should have more than three 
firearms. Computerized registration would be the mechanism to 
justify that. If a home had just cause it could contain more than 
three firearms.
<P>
	The resulting legislation did not include the three-firearm 
position. It was only registration of firearms. They moved off 
the three-firearm position into registration. The police still said 
they thought it would help.
<P>
	Registration took place. Interestingly enough they found that 
it was very much more expensive than they had thought. Now we 
are getting into the more modern computer age which is very 
expensive. They found in terms of compliance that 58.9 per cent 
of the population complied but 41.1 per cent did not comply. 
Worse and most condemnatory of the process was that there was 
no effect whatever on criminal misuse of firearms. They had 
good statistics to follow it through. For the same three reasons 
New Zealand abandoned its firearm registration. Australia did 
the same.
<P>
	I obtained the conclusions of the firearm registration officer 
through access to information. Generally they are not publicly 
available. The officer charged with the responsibility was asked 
whether he had done a good job. In summary he said: ``I do not 
believe registration is the answer to the problem. I would 
therefore recommend that firearms registration be forthwith 
abolished and together with the firearms consultation 
committee a far-reaching, effective and proper system of 
education be introduced as a prerequisite to obtaining a 
shooter's licence''. He went on to describe a system very much 
like that of New Zealand.
<P>
<B>(1705) </B>
<P>
	That country is not strange and foreign to Canada. It is a 
country that is parallel to Canada. It tried it and it flopped. What 
happened to the firearms officer when he presented the report? 
He was fired. The report was buried and the political masters 
carried on with registration and registration persists today.
<P>
	I have a political message for members across the way. In 
New South Wales, Australia, a Labour government tried to put 
through very similar, draconian firearms legislation as we have 
in Canada today. This is the part that should change their minds. 
National opinion polls are 70 per cent for the government. They 
fought an election on the basis of the issue and the Labour 
government was ousted from New South Wales. Prime Minister 
Unsworth announced that he would not be standing for 
leadership of the parliamentary Labour party. ``Guns cost me'', 
he said. ``Clearly as leader I must accept the major proportion of 
the blame for this defeat, particularly in terms of my decision on 
the gun issue''.
<P>
	What happens if a Canadian's lifestyle is taken away and 
turned into political activism? Members of the Liberal Party 
have no idea what it is doing when it does this to the lifestyle of 
Canadians. They may get individuals in urban areas to give them 
all kinds of support. However, when they find out that 
registration will be expensive, will affect only law-abiding 
individuals and will have no impact on criminal misuse, they 
will do what they did in New South Wales.
<P>
	It is not necessary. It is absolutely incredibly stupid. I would 
simply say that we should split the bill. Let us have crime 
control but let us not have registration, or it is gonzo to the 
Liberals.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Warren Allmand (Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise on behalf of my constituents to give 
my full support to Bill C-68. It is a bill to restrict the availability 
of guns and thereby reduce the number of crimes with guns.
<P>
	It is an undeniable fact that where guns and ammunition are 
less available there are less crimes with guns. Where guns and 
ammunition are more difficult to obtain, there are less crimes 
with guns. It is not no crimes with guns but less crime with guns.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10412"> 10412 </A></B>
<P>
	Nobody on this side has made the suggestion that strict gun 
control will eliminate all crime with guns. It is true that 
professional criminals and gangsters will always get their guns, 
but the overwhelming majority of crime with guns is not 
committed by professional gangsters. It is committed by 
ordinary people who under stress or with some other problem 
strike out at another person. If a gun is available they use it.
<P>
	Mark Lepine, before he killed 13 young women at École 
polytechnique had no criminal record. He was not a criminal. 
However, because the gun laws were loose he was able to get a 
semi-automatic military assault rifle and kill 13 women. He was 
not a criminal.
<P>
	Valery Fabrikant, who killed four professors at Concordia 
University in Montreal, had no criminal record before he 
committed that crime. However, because he was able through 
looseness in the gun laws to get a gun he killed four other people.
<P>
	In the context of family violence, quarrels, tensions, abuse of 
liquor and drugs, some mentally unbalanced people who lose 
control will strike out and, if guns are easily available, they will 
use them. In the legislation we are trying to make sure they are 
not easily available and to make it much more strict in being 
sold to the public.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Allmand:</B> The level of debate from the Reform Party is 
the kind of thing we are listening to now. I listened to the hon. 
member make his speech. I would appreciate the opportunity of 
having the same chance.
<P>
	When we make it more difficult to obtain guns crimes by these 
people are reduced because of strict gun laws. They do not have 
strict gun laws in most states in the U.S. They have a much 
higher rate of crime with guns. Some cases are completely 
ridiculous to read about.
<P>
	I remember reading recently about a case in a certain 
American city where two automobiles collided at an 
intersection. The drivers involved in the collision lost their cool 
and became angry. Both of them pulled guns from their glove 
compartments, got out of their cars and shot each other.
<P>
	In Canada we would be just as angry and lose our cool just as 
quickly, but because we would not have guns in our glove 
compartments we would probably get out and punch each other 
out or hit each other in the nose. The same excessive damage 
would not be done because guns would not be as easily available 
to people in that state of mind.
<P>
	Contrary to what many have said in opposition to the bill, it 
will not stop legitimate hunting by responsible hunters. Nor will 
it stop competitive shooting by responsible sportsmen. These 
allegations are scare tactics. Whenever we have a bill to 
strengthen our gun laws we hear the same old rhetoric by the gun 
lobby and those who blindly follow the gun lobby.
<P>
	I have been through four gun bills in the House during my 
period in Parliament. Each time we have set about to make the 
gun laws more restrictive to protect the public by preventing 
crimes with guns, we have heard the same old myths put forward 
by the gun lobby.
<P>
	It can be demonstrated that despite the rhetoric after each gun 
law has passed there has been an increase in hunting licences 
available to responsible hunters. This gun law will not stop 
responsible sportsmen, hunters and shooters who belong to gun 
clubs and are competitive shooters from practising their sports.
<P>
	I ask my colleagues in the House not to be freaked out by 
members of the gun lobby. They are not as important as they 
believes they are. They are not as numerous as they believe they 
are. They do not have the power they think they have.
<P>
	They have threatened many members in the House before 
against voting for the strengthening of gun laws. They have 
threatened them during election time and have failed. I have 
been threatened, as I say, four times by members of that lobby. 
They have had no effect on me whatsoever. They have also 
threatened colleagues of mine from rural areas and have no 
effect on them whatsoever. They should be disregarded. They 
talk nonsense for the most part.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Tell that to the 
Tories.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Allmand:</B> The Tories were defeated for many other 
reasons and not for their gun laws, let's face it. If you think they 
were defeated for their gun laws you are really dreaming in 
Technicolor.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I ask the member to address his 
remarks through the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Allmand:</B> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Among the myths of 
the gun lobby is that when we attempt to ban or restrict guns only 
criminals will have guns. There is no class of persons born 
criminal and there is no class of persons born non-criminal. 
People do not have an identifying mark as criminal or 
non-criminal.
<P>
	As I just said a few minutes ago, ordinary individuals in 
situations of stress, alcohol, drugs or whatever often strike out at 
other people and if guns are available they use them. It is not 
because they are professional criminals. As I say, the 
overwhelming number of murders in Canada committed with 
guns are not committed by professional criminals and gangsters 
but by ordinary people like Fabrikant and Lepine who did not 
commit any crime before in their past lives.
<P>
	Another myth we hear over and over is that guns do not kill 
but people kill. Of course a gun is the most lethal type of means 
by which to kill another person. Yes, it is possible to kill 
someone with a baseball bat, but frankly I do not know anybody 
in this House who would rather have somebody chasing them 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10413"> 10413 </A></B>
<P>
with a lethal weapon instead of a baseball bat. Of course it is 
possible to kill people with poison, a knife or a baseball bat, but 
a gun is  manufactured to kill, to kill animals or to kill people. 
Guns should be controlled and this bill will give better control.
<P>
<B>(1715) </B>
<P>
	With respect to registration, previous speakers, especially 
those from the Reform Party, asked how it will protect society 
and why we are doing it. We have had registration in this country 
for many years. Restricted weapons, especially handguns, have 
been registered for a long period of time and it has been 
successful. The rate of crime with handguns in Canada has, for 
the most part, been much lower than the rate of crime with long 
guns because handguns have been much more strictly 
controlled.
<P>
	With the registration of all weapons, including handguns and 
long guns, it will be easier to conduct criminal investigations. 
The police will know who have guns and who do not. It will be 
easier to trace weapons used in crime and the criminals who had 
access to those guns. It will be easier to take preventive 
measures against violence with guns. For example, in a family 
that has a history of family violence, the police will know 
whether the husband or another family member has a gun 
registered in their name and that gun could be taken away.
<P>
	It is true as some who oppose this bill will say that not 
everyone will register their gun. However, a large number will. 
Such a measure will help the police to remove guns from 
dangerous situations, especially situations where there has been 
a record of family violence.
<P>
	With respect to the ban on most handguns, that is, handguns 
that are not used for competitive shooting, handguns such as the 
Saturday night specials, the very small and very easy to conceal 
handguns, these have no purpose except for use in crime. If 
someone is actually taking part in competitive shooting, then the 
gun is registered; the person belongs to a gun club and that is 
permissible. The other types of handguns which are very small 
and are not used in competitive shooting will be banned under 
the legislation and they should be banned.
<P>
	The bill provides for an increase in the penalties for the 
misuse of guns, for the smuggling of guns and for the illegal sale 
of guns and ammunition. I support that but I do not believe that 
increased penalties are the answer. Increased penalties deal with 
the situation after it has taken place. The crime has been 
committed. Someone is dead. They have found the criminal and 
they will give them a stiffer penalty.
<P>
	What we are trying to do with this legislation is to prevent the 
crime from taking place in the first place. We are trying to make 
guns more difficult to obtain and to screen the applicants who 
want to own guns. Doing that will prevent the crimes from 
taking place. It is a preventive measure.
<P>
	To rely simply on long, tough, hard penalties as is done in 
most of the United States does not work. They have absolutely 
no effect whatsoever. The crime rates with guns are much higher 
there than they are in Canada, especially in Louisiana, Texas, 
Florida, Alabama and Mississippi.
<P>
	In conclusion, I assure the House that as chair of the standing 
committee on justice, despite my strong views in favour of this 
bill, I intend to be absolutely fair with all sides who take part in 
the discussion before the committee. I want to assure those who 
oppose the bill that they will be fairly treated. Those who wish to 
amend the bill will be fairly treated. Those who support the bill 
will be fairly treated.
<P>
	When I act as chair of the committee the most important 
aspect is the tradition of Parliament of the rights of minorities to 
have their say. I want to assure all members of this House and the 
general public that as chair of the justice committee everyone 
will be given their full right to be heard.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Daphne Jennings (Mission-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to take part in the debate on Bill C-68. I 
hope the Minister of Justice is listening to the constructive 
suggestions which have been advanced in this debate. My 
colleagues on this side of the House have put forward ideas and 
suggestions which would make parts of this bill much better. 
However, we strongly oppose one part of the bill.
<P>
<B>(1720 ) </B>
<P>
	Today I want to address mainly the part on a national firearms 
registration system. I hope when we get into final debate on it 
that those on the government side who oppose the clauses that 
establish the regime of gun registration will stand with us to 
defeat those sections. If this were to happen it would be a great 
day for freedom in this Parliament and a great day for individual 
freedom in all parts of Canada.
<P>
	I have spent most of my adult life in the teaching profession. 
One thing about teaching is that in order to explain something to 
others, it is essential to understand it yourself. For me, that 
means getting back to basics.
<P>
	Therefore when I analyse legislation I ask myself: What is the 
problem the legislation is attempting to address or to cure? Once 
I am able to discern what the problem is, then I can go through 
the legislation clause by clause to see if the problem is being 
addressed correctly. This methodology seems to work most of 
the time. When it does not work, it usually is because I see the 
problem as advanced by the government in different terms than 
the government does and then can address it quite differently.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10414"> 10414 </A></B>
<P>
	In splitting the bill, crime control I agree is what we need. 
When I look at Bill C-68 I am puzzled as to what exactly it 
is that the minister is trying to get at. What harm is he trying 
to cure? If we take the legislation as a whole there are stiffer 
penalties for those who commit crimes, anti-gun smuggling 
deterrents and then a gun registration system for rifles and 
shotguns. This for me is the meat of the bill.
<P>
	If the harm or the problem is too many offences being 
committed with guns, then the first two parts of the legislation, 
stiffer penalties and anti-smuggling, make sense. I can see some 
room to make them better but I basically agree. But what about 
the registration system which this legislation imposes? What is 
that aimed at? Here again I must support splitting the bill.
<P>
	Every time I review the remarks of the justice minister when 
he is trying to justify the system I wonder how he can relate one 
to the other. He tells us there are pretty scary statistics out there 
dealing with the use of guns. Every six days a woman is 
murdered by someone using a gun. Over 1,000 suicides per year 
are the result of gun usage.
<P>
	After reciting these statistics we are always told these are the 
reasons we need gun control. but we are never told two things. 
First, how will the registration of rifles and shotguns reduce 
these numbers? Second, what percentage of these acts take place 
with guns that through this legislation would be required to be 
registered? Again, I must stress crime control and a national gun 
registration do not relate.
<P>
	The justice minister knows very well that the registration 
system will not reduce the number of murders or suicides by 
firearms one bit. What he should know is that Canada is a large 
and diverse country, a country which in many ways starts at the 
borders of metropolitan Toronto. This country is not 
metropolitan Toronto.
<P>
	The justice minister should read the legislation that is 
presently in place in relation to gun control. He will find that 
present laws in Canada are among the toughest in the world with 
respect to firearms. Here is what you have to do if you want to 
own a firearm in Canada:
<P>
	Take an optional federal course and mandatory test to qualify 
for a firearms acquisition certificate. Submit to a thorough 
police examination of your social history, employment and 
psychological history when you apply for your FAC. Go through 
an interview process with police and provide solid references. 
Wait a mandatory 28 days before your FAC is approved and 
issued with a photograph.
<P>
	If you want to hunt you must take a separate mandatory 
hunting course which also covers firearms handling and safety. 
Submit to another provincial written and practical test on 
firearms handling. Abide by strict federal laws that govern 
dozens of firearms handling and safety situations. They include: 
storing firearms and ammunition separately and under lock and 
key; rigid  transportation standards; and tough guidelines for 
using firearms.
<P>
	These rules are important but their effect has not yet ever been 
analysed. This was pointed out in the Auditor General's report 
of 1993. I believe the minister should wait to see how effective 
the controls put in place as recently as 1991 have been before he 
embarks on increased controls.
<P>
	This registration system has many drawbacks and it is 
important that they be set out and discussed. It is expensive. The 
lowest estimate for its development and implementation is in 
the range of $80 million to $90 million. Oh yes, we are told that 
this money will be recovered from the gun owners who are 
required to register and we are also told the cost of registration 
will be quite reasonable to encourage those with guns to register. 
Which is it, Mr. Minister?
<P>
	We are told one of the great pluses for this legislation is that it 
helps police. When they are answering a call at a dwelling place 
they will know whether there are firearms on site. We are told 
this will aid police and make it safer. Are we to conclude from 
this that the police will now enter homes where guns have been 
registered with their own guns drawn anticipating a gun battle? 
This will make our lives safer or the homes of our law-abiding 
citizens safer? I do not think so.
<P>
<B>(1725) </B>
<P>
	However, all these criticisms of the registration system pale 
into insignificance when one considers the potential for 
computer crime as it relates to the registry. This area is so 
serious, of proportions of such magnitude that we must look at 
it.
<P>
	Weekly we are informed of some computer whiz-kid who has 
broken the code to allow access to highly classified material, 
government controlled or otherwise. Just a few weeks ago the 
police in Toronto uncovered a fake credit card ring. One reason 
given for the success of the criminal venture until it was closed 
down was the access to corporate computers which the alleged 
criminals had acquired.
<P>
	We were told in the summer that authorities in the western 
world could not stop or prevent computers from being accessed 
by the criminal element. We are told that the police around the 
world sometimes do not even have the information as fast as the 
criminals do. We are very foolish if we think they will not access 
this information. Now we are going to establish a computer 
based program which will show the location of every firearm 
registered in Canada. What a gold mine for criminals and 
organized crime.
<P>
	Break the code for this registration system and this will be the 
home shopping channel for criminals. Imagine establishing a 
system whereby the location of virtually every gun in Canada is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10415"> 10415 </A></B>
<P>
shown. Is there anything else we can do to make it easier for 
those who wish to steal guns?
<P>
	What of the innocent people who register their guns? Are they 
sitting ducks-no pun intended-for criminals who break the 
code and enter the gun registration system? Why would we 
create such a monster if it is not going to do any good, if it is not 
going to reduce the number of crimes of violence, murders, 
attempted murders or suicides?
<P>
	Create the shop at home channel for guns, rifles and shotguns. 
I do not think so. However, I am certain there is a part of our 
population that would not object if Rogers Cablevision carried 
this channel.
<P>
	There are good parts in this bill which should be studied in 
committee and perhaps even made stronger. This is a very good 
reason to split Bill C-68.
<P>
	First, I agree there should be a separate criminal offence for 
committing or attempting to commit a crime with a gun. The 
problem with it is as proposed is that it may very well be 
bargained away as part of a plea bargain for a guilty plea for 
some other charge.
<P>
	Members of the justice committee should take a hard look at 
this. They should try to determine whether they can legislate 
that the offence not be subject to a plea bargain or find some 
other solution. A clear message must be sent to the criminal 
community in Canada that if criminals carry guns and commit 
crimes, they will be punished for the crime and for carrying the 
weapon.
<P>
	I am also supportive of those parts of the bill which would 
attack the problem of gun smuggling in Canada. We live next to, 
arguably, one of the most violent nations on the face of the earth. 
It is vitally important that those who patrol our borders be given 
real powers to deal with those who would import guns illegally 
into Canada.
<P>
	Again, this is something the justice committee should look at 
in detail. Should the people who patrol our borders be given 
powers to be more than revenue collectors? Should the 
provincial police or RCMP in particular provinces be required to 
maintain a presence at the borders? A true police presence at our 
borders would, to my way of thinking, reduce smuggling. I am 
not saying we should arm our customs agents, but they should be 
backed up by trained police.
<P>
	There are other matters which must be looked at in this 
legislation, for example the position of those who wish to will 
their gun collections as part of their estate. I believe we should 
facilitate this. The requirement for those entering Canada to 
take part in marksmanship contests to obtain a temporary 
certificate should be looked at to see if it is realistic and 
workable.
<P>
	Most of all, I urge members opposite, members from outside 
metropolitan Toronto as well as inside, to look at Canada and see 
it for what it is, a vast country where hunting and other outdoor 
activities are both a way of life to some and a recreation to 
others.
<P>
	The registration system proposed in this bill as it sits will not 
accomplish the goal set for it. Therefore, when it comes time to 
vote for this bill, or that part on gun registration during clause by 
clause analysis, vote down those clauses that pertain to the 
registration system.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to take part in the debate on Bill C-68, an act respecting 
firearms and other weapons.
<P>
<B>(1730 ) </B>
<P>
	The riding of Durham has both a rural and an urban 
component. Being neither a gun owner or user myself, I have 
gone to the shooting clubs and have listened to the concerns of 
legal gun owners. I have taken both gun owners and those abused 
by guns to meet with the Minister of Justice.
<P>
	I have studied the crime statistics of both the justice 
department and the gun lobby. I have spoken with our police 
chief, the local firearms registration officer, judges, police in 
the field, homicide detectives and finally, I visited Millhaven 
penitentiary and spoke with murderers in their cells who 
actually used guns in the commission of crime.
<P>
	Tougher penalties for the use of firearms in the commission of 
a crime, tougher controls of cross-border smuggling and 
trafficking of firearms are all supported by the people of 
Durham, including legal gun owners.
<P>
	Rather than looking at the strengths of the legislation I would 
like to focus on what I see as some weaknesses. Hopefully these 
matters will be addressed at the committee stage of the bill. I 
would like to address the matter of the registration of all 
firearms. As you know, Mr. Speaker, handguns in Canada have 
had to be registered since the 1940s. I note this has contributed 
little to the reduction of the use of handguns in the commission 
of crime.
<P>
	Primarily the issue for me is one of cost benefit analysis. 
What are the costs? Who is going to pay? What are the benefits 
of the system? This revisits the very foundations of our 
democracy which is that government has entered into a contract 
with the people. This is Locke's <I>Two Treaties on Government</I>. In 
the 15th century Locke determined that a fundamental 
democracy was one where people consented to be governed 
based on an unwritten contract with their government, a contract 
that implied a basic consent of the people not only to be 
governed but also, most importantly, to be taxed.
<P>
	People want to revisit their contract with government. They 
want to know how taxes are consensual. They want to be part of 
the process. They want to be included with regard to the taxes 
they pay and the programs they finance. Across the nation 
people are demanding more accountability from governments. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10416"> 10416 </A></B>
<P>
Taxpayers want to know how much programs are costing and 
specifically who is paying for them.
<P>
	As you may know, Mr. Speaker, I intend to introduce a private 
member's bill early this spring, the subject of which will be a 
taxpayers' bill of rights. I note that if this legislation was in 
place, the current bill would have some additional and much 
needed information attached to it. Specifically the program 
would be costed fully during its implementation stage. It would 
detail the specific costs and would allocate them to the years 
during implementation. It would also show the anticipated 
revenues from registration charges to gun owners. Finally, the 
Auditor General would have certified the costing methods used 
as being reasonable.
<P>
	The taxpayer is tired of discovering years after the 
implementation period of the waste of their money. I would like 
to quote from the Auditor General's report of 1993 concerning 
the previous gun registration system that is only a couple of 
years old: ``We found several weaknesses in the methodology, 
which significantly reduce the extent to which the government, 
members of Parliament and the Canadian public can rely on the 
evaluation to be assured that the gun control program is 
effective''.
<P>
	I am afraid we are about to repeat the errors of the past. I note 
it has been stated that the proposed new registration system may 
cost $85 million. However, there is great confusion. The current 
registration system for handguns costs $60 million per year and 
includes only 560,000 handguns. There are a minimum of five to 
six million long guns in Canada.
<P>
	I have a study here by Professor Gary Mauser at Simon Fraser 
University that states it could cost $82 per firearm, $496 
million, or half a billion dollars. It has been suggested the first 
year be free to encourage registration. However the taxpayer 
knows that nothing is free. In studying budget projections, I can 
see no allocation of funding in the Department of Justice's 
budget for this program. We need a better fix on how much this 
program is going to cost.
<P>
<B>(1735 ) </B>
<P>
	The taxpayer has the right to know this now. Clearly we can no 
longer afford the luxury of introducing programs for which we 
do not know the cost. The taxpayer wants to see better fiscal 
responsibility and in some ways we have done that in the recent 
budget.
<P>
	This leads me to the second part of my analysis, which is the 
study of the benefits of the system. Benefits would have to be 
clear and obvious. They would have to promote the common 
good. They would have to demonstrate that there was clear 
correlation between registration and the intended results.
<P>
	At this point I found gun owners generally reasoned people. 
They have tried to understand why the registration system is 
thought to be needed and so important today. I would further like 
to point out that a democratic society is judged not on how it 
treats its majorities but rather how it treats its minorities.
<P>
	It is clear to me that the opinions of the majority who do not 
know the facts are of questionable validity. Most surveys would 
indicate that the average person is more concerned about crime 
control than gun registration.
<P>
	I further note that both gun owners and taxpayers generally 
are a minority in this debate. It is clear to me that without 
convincing a sizeable portion of their numbers of the 
effectiveness and affordability, the registration system will fail.
<P>
	Here are the stated goals as I understand them of the 
registration system: that it will allow firearms removal from 
domestic violence situations; that it will afford law enforcement 
agents better information when approaching a household for 
investigation purposes; that it will lead to safer storage 
practices.
<P>
	My time today will not let me deal with these issues at length, 
however the result is that it is totally unclear whether some of 
these objectives are not already available in the current law and 
are not being enforced or whether the objectives can be met at all 
with the registration system for long guns.
<P>
	I can find no clear documentary evidence from the justice 
department that makes this case. If I cannot make this leap of 
faith, neither can long gun owners. This is the real danger of the 
legislation, that we are placing a sizeable group of people in the 
category of believing that the system is unwarranted. They see 
the imposition of fees as an unwarranted tax, the proceeds of 
which will be wasted on further bureaucracy with no tangible 
results.
<P>
	I spoke earlier about the concerns of taxpayers. Needless to 
say gun owners are taxpayers. I said that they wanted to revisit 
their contract with government. Do we have examples of where 
people believe taxing systems exist without consent and how 
they have reacted? We have only to look at the dreaded goods 
and services tax, clearly a tax that lacked common consent.
<P>
	A recent study by the accounting firm Peat Marwick 
concluded that over 50 per cent of taxpayers would avoid paying 
this tax if given the opportunity. Police officers in my riding 
have avoided giving minor speeding tickets because they 
believe that the three-price increase in one year is just an 
unwarranted form of taxation on the working class.
<P>
	The conclusion is that we are developing a system of justice in 
Canada where people pick and choose the laws they are 
governed by. This is mainly because they do not feel that they 
consented to them in the first place.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10417"> 10417 </A></B>
<P>
	I do not think this system of justice is sustainable. I believe 
that it will lead to chaos. Clearly our democracy must be one 
of inclusion rather than exclusion. Our society is becoming 
more complex and technical.
<P>
	I would like to end my comments by quoting from one of our 
own political philosophers, Mr. George Grant. In his book 
<I>Twilight of Justice</I> he observed that one of the changes to a more 
technical society in Canada, that the need for control of humans 
in a technological society increases with the complexity of 
society. Technique causes the state to become totalitarian, to 
absorb the citizen's life completely.
<P>
<B>(1740 ) </B>
<P>
	Finally, the definition of liberal, which I am, is favouring 
individual liberty. I hope the committee will take the time to 
discuss some of these matters.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have owned firearms 
off and on for more than half a century. I have been a reasonably 
good citizen but now in the eyes of the Minister of Justice and 
certainly in the eyes of the popular press, I have become a threat 
to society, a menace to peace, order and good government.
<P>
	I am going to be subjected, if these laws that are now before us 
in Bill C-68 are all lumped together as one-the administrative 
bureaucracy and the criminal sanctions-of running the risk of 
being a common criminal. That, to my way of thinking, is 
neither just nor sane.
<P>
	If I or anyone else chooses to inconvenience the bureaucracy 
by failing to comply with the purely administrative requirement, 
the result will be a criminal record and the penalty could far 
exceed that which some drunken hoodlums recently received for 
murdering a harmless old man in the province of Saskatchewan. 
This is absurd.
<P>
	The justice minister says that he has actually separated the 
administrative from the criminal because we have these two 
sections in the one bill. That is smoke and mirrors if we are still 
talking about draconian criminal penalties for failure to observe 
an administrative law. That, in my humble opinion, does not 
give separation.
<P>
	I own a few firearms even today but I hardly ever hunt. I do 
not belong to any shooting club. I do not belong to the NFA. If I 
lost my guns tomorrow it would not make a big difference to my 
lifestyle. However, I would be losing something a lot more 
important than hardware. I would be losing a big piece of my 
civil liberty.
<P>
	The justice minister says that the right to own a particular type 
of property, firearms, is really just a privilege. I submit that 
Canada's top lawyer has an unbelievably feeble grasp of history 
and of the common law. Omission from the British North 
America Act or the charter of rights and freedoms does not mean 
that a right does not exist. Our legal system is based on British 
common law and on the sanctity of customary rights.
<P>
	When Sir William Blackstone codified the common law he 
noted that every individual has certain absolute rights, including 
the right to personal security, personal liberty and the right to 
own and use property. Does that sound familiar? American 
revolutionaries did not invent those concepts. They merely 
enshrined in their constitution the rights which as Englishmen 
they already had.
<P>
	Blackstone went on to list five auxiliary rights without which 
the absolute rights could not be protected and maintained. One 
of them was the right to own personal arms. When Americans 
passed their famous second amendment to the constitution, their 
right to bear arms, it was only a modest extension of a right 
which they had before the revolution.
<P>
	In Great Britain there has been a steady chipping away at this 
right, starting in 1870 and accelerating after the first world war. 
It was supposedly because of the threat from Bolshevik or 
anarchist terrorists. However, just as in Canada today, public 
hysteria was fanned by the government and, just as in Canada, 
laws have become progressively more intrusive, complex and 
downright repressive. Today they have almost achieved the 
justice minister's ideal where only police, soldiers and the 
trusted elite of society have legal firearms. However, there is no 
shortage of firepower in the U.K.
<P>
<B>(1745 ) </B>
<P>
	A few months ago I talked with a Scottish gun dealer and he 
told me that Great Britain is awash with guns. You can buy one 
faster and more easily in a pub than from him, and cheaper 
because there is no tax.
<P>
	What is accomplished as gun laws are made tougher and 
tougher? What affect does the hassle and the expensive 
bureaucracy have on crime? Very little.
<P>
	I have reviewed firearms legislation and crime statistics from 
various states south of the border and from several other 
countries. Now I am going to bore the House with some of the 
dull facts that the justice department's social engineers 
cheerfully ignore.
<P>
	Consider the prairie provinces. Since gun controls began in 
1978, the annual homicide rate has averaged about 3.2 per 
100,000 people, of which about one-third are committed with 
guns.
<P>
	In the four border states of Minnesota, North Dakota, 
Montana and Idaho the rate was 2.7 per 100,000. That is 16 per 
cent less. Those are all wide open. The justice minister would 
probably say those are lawless states where you can own and 
carry almost anything short of a bazooka.
<P>
	The District of Columbia, with the most stringent controls of 
any North American jurisdiction except Mexico has the 
unbelievably high murder rate of 80 per 100,000 per year, the 
highest 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10418"> 10418 </A></B>
<P>
in the western world. How can there possibly be such problems 
where guns are strictly controlled?
<P>
	Maybe it has something to do with cultural and economic 
forces. Maybe it has something to do with organized crime, drug 
dealing, racial tension, grinding miserable poverty and a 
collapsed public education system.
<P>
	Gun control is an artificially induced smoke screen. It is a 
cynical ploy to distract the public from the real issues, not the 
least of which is the breakdown of our criminal justice system. 
The government helped create this highly emotional issue and 
now it is playing it for all it is worth. This issue has absolutely 
no relation to crime control and it is absurd that the justice 
minister has made the mixture. It is a lot easier to make 
scapegoats of decent citizens than it is to admit that our justice 
system is misdirected.
<P>
	To give the devil his due, this bill does contain some good 
features actually aimed at criminals instead of ordinary citizens; 
the four-year minimum sentence for violent offences 
committed with a firearm, for example, although those 
receiving this penalty will still be eligible for parole.
<P>
	In 1978, I told anyone who would listen that we had started 
down a long slow road to public disarmament, that future violent 
crimes would serve as excuses for more bureaucracy, that 
registration by serial number would follow and that the last step 
would be piecemeal confiscation of weapons, picking off gun 
owners one at a time. It is all coming true.
<P>
	Half a million handguns are going to be effectively 
confiscated, no matter how the minister tries to sugar coat his 
proposal. Confiscation of registered long guns will begin, as it is 
already begun with handguns, through a process of natural 
evolution and will probably be spurred by some horrendous 
crime such as the Montreal massacre.
<P>
	Public hysteria is a wonderful tool for government. Early in 
1941, before Pearl Harbour, the Government of Canada 
confiscated the arms of Canadians of Japanese origin living on 
the west coast. Remember, we were not at war and these were 
Canadians, but their guns were taken away.
<P>
	The political establishment was delighted and the tame 
establishment press bayed its approval, just as it is baying its 
approval for the proposals on the table in the House today.
<P>
<B>(1750 ) </B>
<P>
	This bill is a classic example of the theory of government 
which states that everything not compulsory shall be forbidden. 
It is a bit of statism, and a bit of statism, like a bit of cancer, is 
not good for you.
<P>
	James Madison said it best: ``There are more instances of the 
abridgement of freedom of people by gradual and silent 
encroachments of those in power than by violent and sudden 
usurpations''.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Middlesex, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I welcome this opportunity to take part in today's 
debate on second reading of Bill C-68, an act respecting 
firearms and other weapons.
<P>
	Canada has had a long history in the monitoring and 
controlling of firearms. Canada has had laws restricting the 
possession and the use of firearms since 1877. These were a 
nationwide permit system for the carrying of small arms in 
effect in 1892. All handguns have had to be registered since 
1934. In 1951 a centralized registry for restricted firearms was 
established under the control of the commissioner of the RCMP.
<P>
	The classification system of prohibitive weapons and 
restricted weapons including all handguns and non-restricted 
long guns was introduced in 1968. This scheme was 
significantly enhanced by a number of amendments in 1977. The 
major addition was the creation of the firearms acquisition 
certificate, FAC, a screening system for those wishing to acquire 
any firearm including non-restricted hunting rifles and 
shotguns.
<P>
	A new administrative regime involving local firearms 
officers and chief provincial firearms officers appointed by the 
provinces was also established. Currently the provinces 
administer the FAC system and most overall gun control. This 
regime was relatively untouched for over 11 years until the 
passage of Bill C-17 which received royal assent on December 
5, 1991.
<P>
	To my knowledge the last set of regulations pertaining to Bill 
C-17 came into force on January 1, 1994 and prescribed the 
criteria for competence in the safe handling and use of firearms. 
Barely a year after the implementation of Bill C-17's last set of 
regulations members are being asked to consider yet another 
firearms bill.
<P>
	I propose to offer my comments on what I consider the 
positive aspects of Bill C-68. I will also offer my opinions on 
the parts of this bill which require more consideration by the 
justice committee and I will give my reasons as to why certain 
sections of this bill should be deleted in their entirety.
<P>
	The most positive feature of this bill is its no nonsense 
approach to the criminal use of firearms. To that extent I applaud 
the proposals to create new offences for the criminal use of 
firearms, including the minimum four-year sentence for using a 
firearm in the commission of violent offences and the minimum 
mandatory sentence of one year for the use of a replica firearm, 
mandatory jail sentences for the possession of stolen firearms 
and stiff penalties for illegally importing and trafficking in 
firearms.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10419"> 10419 </A></B>
<P>
	For years Canadians from all walks of life have been 
demanding stiffer mandatory sentencing provisions for the use 
of a firearm in the commission of violent offences. Bill C-68 
addresses this concern. Mandatory sentencing provisions for 
the use of a firearm while committing one of the 10 key violent 
offences of attempted murder, manslaughter, negligence 
causing death, robbery, kidnapping, hostage taking, sexual 
assault, aggravated sexual assault, extortion and discharging a 
firearm within intent to cause harm will be increased from one 
to four years. Offenders convicted of these offences will also 
be prohibited from possessing a restricted weapon for life.
<P>
	I am concerned that section 85 charges might continue to be 
plea bargained away notwithstanding an increase in minimum 
sentencing provisions. The justice department's own research 
shows that two-thirds of section 85 charges laid are either 
dismissed, stayed or withdrawn because of problems of 
evidence or plea bargaining.
<P>
	Bill C-68 also creates a new prohibitive category consisting 
of certain calibre handguns with a barrel length of 105 
millimetres or less. In effect this will result in the prohibition of 
58 per cent of the handguns currently in existence in Canada. 
Like all other owners of prohibited firearms, individuals who 
possessed these handguns on or before February 14, 1995 will be 
able to buy and sell only among themselves. Owners of these 
handguns will be able to use the handguns for the purpose for 
which they were originally obtained, whether target shooting or 
collecting. They will be required to demonstrate every five 
years that their handguns continue to be so used.
<P>
<B>(1755) </B>
<P>
	These measures are a definite improvement over the action 
plan of November 30, 1994 which had contemplated a complete 
prohibition against any use or trade in these prohibited firearms. 
To his credit, the Minister of Justice has announced his 
willingness to have the justice committee consider whether 
handguns in the prohibited class that are used in recognized 
target shooting competitions should be exempted from the ban.
<P>
	I am also grateful that the minister has asked the committee to 
examine the whole question of whether there might be a separate 
exemption provision for firearms that may have special 
significance to families as relics or heirlooms.
<P>
	The minister has also suggested that the committee study the 
issue of whether technical amendments are necessary for 
historical re-enactments or heritage events using black powder 
reproduction firearms.
<P>
	In each of these cases the Minister of Justice is to be 
commended for his flexibility. I am deeply disappointed, 
however, that the minister has remained steadfast in his 
insistence upon the establishment of a national registration 
system for all firearms, including non-restricted hunting rifles 
and shotguns.
<P>
	Bill C-68 includes provisions for the initiation of universal 
firearms owner registration where the current FAC will be 
replaced with a graduated firearms possession certificate, FPC, 
starting in 1996. Although initially voluntary, by the year 2001 
possession of any firearm without an FPC will result in a 
Criminal Code offence that would carry a sentence of up to five 
years, one year in excess of the mandatory term proposed for the 
offence of using a firearm while attempting to murder.
<P>
	As the second half of the proposed universal registration 
system, the bill would require every Canadian to register his or 
her firearm individually. Each firearm is to be identified by 
make, model, manufacturer's serial number and other 
identifiers, and a special firearms registration card, FRC, is to 
be issued for each firearm registered.
<P>
	We should not be surprised that law-abiding firearms owners 
are deeply resentful over this registration proposal, which can 
only be described as intrusive and cumbersome. As more and 
more makes and models of various types of firearms are either 
reclassified for regulation or banned outright, we cannot blame 
some firearms owners for suspecting that the real reason behind 
registration is a gradual confiscation of most firearms in 
Canada. Over half of the current legally owned handguns in 
Canada will be banned as a result of Bill C-68.
<P>
	It should be obvious by now that criminals do not register 
their firearms. A universal firearms registry, even if it were fully 
subscribed to by all legal firearms owners, will not reduce 
criminal activity involving firearms, nor will it improve public 
safety. Neither law-abiding firearms owners nor other taxpayers 
deserve to be burdened with any expense or inconvenience that 
has no demonstrable effect on reducing crime or improving 
community safety.
<P>
	Canadians want tougher measures to be taken to reduce crime. 
This bill addresses that through mandatory sentencing for the 
use of firearms in the commission of violent crime.
<P>
	During the third week of November 1994, when Decima 
Research asked on behalf of <I>Maclean's</I> and CTV what the main 
reason for the increase in violent crimes is, the greatest number 
of responses, 40 per cent, said the justice system is too lenient. 
Only 5 per cent of the over 1,600 respondents said that a lack of 
tough gun controls was the cause.
<P>
	Non-firearm owning Canadians are beginning to understand 
that additional gun controls will only serve to penalize 
responsible firearms owners unnecessarily and will not reduce 
crime. The minister insists that a new registration system is the 
support structure for the government's firearms control 
package.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10420"> 10420 </A></B>
<P>
	I quote from a February 14 news release from the Department 
of Justice: ``A universal registration system will help combat 
smuggling by monitoring the types and quantities of firearms 
coming into Canada''. How can that be so when by definition 
smuggling involves evading the very authorities that would be 
doing the monitoring at Canadian borders?
<P>
	If we are prepared to spend more money on gun control, let us 
spend it wisely. It has been suggested by the solicitor general of 
Ontario that a national task force on firearms smuggling be set 
up at key border points. I strongly support this proposal. A well 
co-ordinated task force involving all levels of police forces, 
additional customs officers and the support of all three levels of 
government would yield real results in the reduction of 
smuggled firearms into this country. That is where the real 
problem exists. It is not in the continued harassment of 
law-abiding firearms owners.
<P>
<B>(1800) </B>
<P>
	I sincerely hope the justice committee will insist upon an 
objective, dispassionate examination of the utility of a national 
registration system as set out in the bill. I hope that at the end of 
its study it would conclude that the current system requiring a 
firearms acquisition certificate is more than adequate and that if 
anything has to be done to curb the criminal use of firearms, the 
work has to be done at Canada's borders and in our court rooms.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
very pleased today to stand in the House to speak on the Reform 
motion to split Bill C-68. It reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That all the words after the word ``that'' be deleted and the following 
substituted therefor:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This House decline to give second reading to Bill C-68, an act respecting 
firearms and other weapons, because the principle of establishing a system for 
licensing and registration of all firearms and the principle of creating a variety 
of offences are two unrelated issues that should be addressed separately.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I concur with the motion and I encourage members opposite to 
support Reform in the motion to split the bill.
<P>
	I will read an excerpt from a letter from a constituent, Mr. Ole 
Raasok of Irma, Alberta. He specifically asked me to mention 
his name and to read his letter if I had the opportunity. He wrote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I was living in Norway when the Germans invaded our country in April 1940 
and took control of government in June 1940 after Norway's capitulation.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In the fall of 1940 all gun owners were ordered to register their shotguns and 
rifles if they wished to hunt. As law-abiding citizens wanting to hunt, we were 
dumb enough to register our guns.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I am reading from a letter sent to me by a constituent who was 
raised in Norway and who experienced registration. I encourage 
all members opposite to listen carefully to what this gentleman 
has to say. I believe we should not make light of individuals who 
have had similar experiences. He continued:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The following year we received an order to deliver all of our guns to the police. 
There was no use in trying to hide them because the guns were already registered 
and the government had the numbers. The guns were never returned and no 
compensation was made for them. I believe this is the hon. justice minister's plan.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I became a lieutenant in the reserve army before I immigrated to Canada in 
1951. In that capacity I had full command over 160 men who all had their own 
weapons in their homes. There was never any talk of registration or permits to 
transport or use guns. Statistics show that Norway has one of the lowest criminal 
use of firearms in the world.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I have read only part of the letter from my constituent. I have 
heard many members opposite say that any idea or any 
suggestion by Canadians that registration and tougher gun 
control would lead to confiscation is ridiculous.
<P>
	Whether it is the intention of the government to move to 
confiscation after registration, I have no idea. I would tend to 
think not. However I believe it is healthy for people in a 
democracy to have a certain level of distrust for government.
<P>
	My constituent has seen the effect of not having a healthy 
level of distrust. I ask hon. members opposite to understand that 
many Canadians have this concern. Some do not trust this 
government and others will not trust future governments. It is 
important to listen to these concerns and it is important in a 
democracy to have a certain level of distrust.
<P>
<B>(1805) </B>
<P>
	History has shown that Norway is a prime example that 
registration leads to confiscation. Is this what the minister has in 
mind for Canadians? This question is often asked of me in my 
constituency. It was not just every now and again but every day 
over the past 10 days. Every single day I had constituents ask me 
whether the minister had in mind confiscation after registration.
<P>
	Earlier statements made by the minister suggested that he 
would prefer to have guns only in the hands of the police and the 
armed forces. The statement was made shortly after the House 
started sitting about a year ago.
<P>
	I fully support the motion put forward by the hon. member for 
Yorkton-Melville because it will separate the so-called crime 
bill into two different parts. It is logical to split the bill because 
we are dealing with two different issues. On the one hand is the 
aspect of targeting crime and on the other hand is the anti-gun 
sentiment of the legislation which I do not support. The motion 
is necessary because it focuses on the real problem of crime.
<P>
	We as members of the Reform Party support a crime bill. We 
support measures that would get tougher in dealing with the 
criminal use of firearms, including penalties for smuggling. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10421"> 10421 </A></B>
<P>
However we do not support targeting law-abiding Canadians 
simply because they own guns.
<P>
	From day one Reformers stated that legitimate law-abiding 
gun owners were not the problem but rather that the problem 
stemmed from the criminal use of guns in the commission of 
crime. We need to ask why the minister has chosen to put these 
two parts of the issue together in the same bill. While I cannot 
answer the question for certain I believe it is a legitimate 
question. When we consider that Canada already has some of the 
toughest gun control laws in the world it is particularly an 
appropriate question.
<P>
	To link tougher gun control to crime fighting might sound 
politically appealing, but there is no statistical evidence to 
support the legitimacy of the idea. If the minister could provide 
us with some evidence we would not oppose the original 
legislation. The reality is that he cannot provide the information 
because it does not exist.
<P>
	Several constituents have come to me saying that they had 
written a letter to the Minister of Justice asking specifically for 
any evidence he might have to show that more gun control would 
do anything to help prevent crimes committed with guns and to 
show that a registration system would prevent even one death. 
So far none of the constituents have had an answer to their 
letters. That is a shame. It is a serious question and they are not 
getting the answer.
<P>
	Another concern has been raised often in my constituency 
concerning the computer system that will be set up to 
accommodate the central registry. The concern of my 
constituents in this regard is about the central registry and a 
hacker accessing the system.
<P>
	We know hackers are very capable. They have accessed 
military secrets in the United States. They can get the names and 
use them in two ways. First, they can be used to find the 
locations of large collections of guns so that they can be more 
easily stolen. Second, criminals could determine from the lists 
where easy targets for break and enter may exist, where they feel 
the guns are not there and therefore they are easy targets.
<P>
	My constituents have many other questions over past weeks 
and indeed over the past year. However I will close by saying 
that I would like answers from the minister to the two areas of 
concern expressed by my constituents. I do not believe he can 
give an answer in terms of the motive behind the registry, not 
necessarily the minister's motive but the motive of future 
governments. Also there is the possibility of the computer 
system being broken into and guns being stolen or a break and 
enter taking place.
<P>
<B>(1810) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am sorry but the member's time has 
expired.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Steckle (Huron-Bruce, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in the House this evening to address a matter that has attracted a 
great deal of concern in my constituency of Huron-Bruce.
<P>
	On November 30, 1994 the Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada announced the government's action plan on 
firearms control. This was a series of proposals designed to 
generate comments and constructive criticism from Canadians 
so they might have an equal partnership in forming the bill 
before the House today.
<P>
	The people of Huron-Bruce seized the opportunity to 
comment on the issue, causing my Parliament Hill and 
constituency offices to be flooded with thousands of calls, 
letters and visits.
<P>
	Among the proposals was a mandatory minimum sentence of 
four years in prison in addition to a lifetime prohibition against 
possession of a restricted weapon when convicted of committing 
any one of or a combination of ten specific offences with a 
firearm. Among those offences, attempted murder, armed 
robbery and sexual assault with a weapon were included. Also 
included in the proposals were new Criminal Code offences with 
strict new penalties for illegal importing and trafficking 
firearms, enhanced border controls with improved inspections, 
and permit requirements for import, export and in transit 
shipments of firearms within Canada.
<P>
	I take this opportunity to commend the minister for putting 
forth the aforementioned crime control measures. I would 
however like to draw attention to Bill C-68, an act respecting 
firearms and other weapons that is currently being debated in the 
House.
<P>
	The act encompasses most of the original proposals released 
by the justice department, including a new mandatory 
registration system and a ban on a variety of specific handguns 
and replica weapons. As I have mentioned before, the proposals 
prompted a massive outcry in my constituency. In response I 
have spoken and met with many groups and individuals in an 
attempt to acquire an understanding of their views.
<P>
	The process has allowed me to speak directly with my 
constituents, thus giving me a good understanding of their 
thoughts and views. As an avid hunter and sportsman I am 
pleased to recognize the government taking the initiative to 
punish individuals for the illegal use of firearms. However I am 
not able to support further restrictions being placed on the 
legitimate and safe gun owner.
<P>
	Bill C-68 is a bill that resulted from many tragic events in 
recent Canadian history such as the massacre at Montreal's 
École polytechnique in 1989 and a recent drive-by shooting in 
Ottawa. The events have fuelled the fires of public demands for 
changes to the Criminal Code with respect to the illegal use of 
firearms.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10422"> 10422 </A></B>
<P>
	The most recent package of gun control measures is known 
collectively as Bill C-17. The process of putting the legal 
aspects of the bill into place has only now just begun. Unless 
the new law is successfully implemented the changes contained 
in the legislation run the risk of becoming little more than 
symbolic gestures by the government to satisfy public opinion.
<P>
	Good policy development and the delivery of adequate laws 
also include effective implementation and enforcement. There 
has not been enough time for the regulations contained in Bill 
C-17 to be fully realized. Thus the effectiveness of the 
regulations is also not fully understood. One can therefore 
reason that if this is true it is also too early to impose or evaluate 
the effectiveness of further controls such as a national 
registration system that would require more time and would 
place further stress on the already sparse financial resources of 
the nation's taxpayer.
<P>
	There are clear constraints in public funding when it comes to 
our police forces that are already responsible for protecting our 
citizens under other provisions of the Criminal Code. It has been 
estimated by the justice department that implementation of a 
registration system could cost up to $85 million with an annual 
maintenance cost of $10 million, not considering annual 
increases.
<P>
	Public safety will only be endangered if we dilute our 
resources. As a result we as members of Parliament must take 
care in allocating the limited funds we have in this area to ensure 
they are spent in the most effective and practical way possible.
<P>
	It must be reiterated that gun control only plays a small role in 
our overall criminal justice system. Other aspects of the 
Criminal Code need to be fortified to effectively combat violent 
criminal activities.
<P>
	As a legitimate gun owner I am already subjected to a large 
number of controls. By law, to purchase a firearm I must 
complete a firearm acquisition certificate course, pass a formal 
examination and submit to a thorough police examination of my 
social, employment and psychological history. I must also 
provide the police with character references that they can 
investigate to ensure I will use my firearms in a responsible 
manner. In addition, there is a mandatory 28-day waiting period 
before I receive my FAC with picture identification.
<P>
<B>(1815) </B>
<P>
	If I wish to hunt, I must first pass a mandatory hunting course 
which covers firearm handling and safety. I must then also 
submit to a provincially regulated test which further reiterates 
these points.
<P>
	In addition to these regulations, the province of Ontario has 
strict ammunition purchasing regulations in effect. Once I have 
the gun and the legal ability to hunt, I must then adhere to 
stringent laws regarding separate storage of the firearm and the 
ammunition under lock and key, rigid transportation standards 
and tough guidelines for using firearms.
<P>
	This clearly demonstrates how heavily the legitimate gun 
owners are already regulated. These regulations, like all gun 
control regulations, are very difficult to enforce. The police 
simply cannot search each household to see if these rules are 
being observed.
<P>
	The UN estimates that firearm owners represent 
approximately 27 per cent of the Canadian population or seven 
million people owning up to 27 million firearms which is 
considerably more than what people are telling us in most of this 
debate.
<P>
	Perhaps the government should concentrate its efforts on 
implementing innovative and cost effective methods of 
enforcing the laws currently in place. One such example could 
be a community based group of gun owners checking the homes 
of other gun owners in their area. This would alleviate the 
suspicions that many Canadians have of government intrusion in 
their daily lives and would assist in the enforcement of the safe 
storage aspects of Bill C-17.
<P>
	Third, I would argue that crime control would be a more 
effective method of obtaining further public security. We must 
punish the criminal element and leave the law-abiding citizens 
alone. Firearms owners possess and use their firearms in a safe 
and responsible manner and do not contribute to crime or violent 
death and injury statistics.
<P>
	In addition, the Canadian Centre for Justice Statistics reports 
that in 1991 two-thirds of all accused murderers were known to 
have criminal records, the majority for previous violent 
offences, and were already prohibited from legally owning or 
acquiring a firearm.
<P>
	To further illustrate my point of the small number of firearms 
involved in deaths in this country, I would offer the fact that in 
1991 only one person out of every 400,000 Canadians died as a 
result of a fatal gun accident compared to one person out of 
every 14,000 who died as a result of a fall. I am suggesting that 
we have adequate controls in place but we are simply not 
enforcing them.
<P>
	Under Bill C-17 all firearms are required to be trigger locked 
in a locked cabinet separate from the ammunition. An analysis 
of fatal gun accidents in the United States could not locate even 
one instance where a child victim or shooter discovered a locked 
gun, unlocked it and shot themselves or someone else. Studies 
also indicate that at least one-half of all accidental shootings 
involved the consumption of alcohol just prior to the incident. 
How will the registration system prevent this from occurring?
<P>
	Canadians must bear the responsibility of using their firearms 
in a responsible manner. The Government of Canada should not 
be asked to shoulder this burden. We must congratulate firearms 
owners in this nation for their initiatives into the area of the safe 
handling of firearms, not condemn them for their efforts. In 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10423"> 10423 </A></B>
<P>
Canada, while firearm ownership has increased, the accidental 
death rate has reduced by 80 per cent between 1986 and 1991.
<P>
	In conclusion, people are demanding that we take action to 
further protect them from violent crime and other illegal 
activities present in certain areas of our society. The problem 
that the minister and indeed the entire government faces is the 
question of what response is most appropriate.
<P>
	In his recent report, the Auditor General expressed concerns 
over the lack of evidence to justify the fact that the Canadian 
government passed more gun control legislation between 1977 
and 1995 than in the entire preceding 50 years. The Auditor 
General also questioned the enforceability of the laws contained 
in Bill C-17. He also expressed anxiety over the lack of 
uniformity across the country regarding the FAC screening 
system.
<P>
	These concerns are only a few expressed by the Auditor 
General and others concerned with this issue. I call upon the 
minister to consider the Auditor General's comments and the 
comments of all Canadians. Hunters and collectors compose a 
large part of our population and generate revenue for our 
economy each year through licensing fees, conservation efforts 
and the recreational hunting industry.
<P>
	Canada's first explorers were from Europe, coureurs des bois 
who served the vital function of opening the new world to 
settlers. Hunting and responsible gun ownership is an intricate 
part of our rich heritage.
<P>
	I suggest to the minister and to the House that firearms can 
co-exist with all Canadians in an allegorical guns and roses 
relationship respecting individual rights and privileges without 
further imposing unnecessary, cumbersome and expensive 
regulations on legitimate firearms owners and our nation's 
finances. The process must begin here with us.
<P>
<B>(1820 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, of course I 
would like to see support for the amendment to split this bill. 
That is the way we should proceed.
<P>
	I received some information with regard to the registration 
system recommended by the minister. The minister has said 
both inside and outside this House that it is going to be a 
simplified system, that it is going to place a tool in the hands of 
the law enforcement agencies to help them do their job and 
maintain a safer society. All the law-abiding gun owner will 
have to do is pick up a card at the post office or one of the stores 
in his or her community, fill in the make, model and serial 
number of their firearm and mail the card in.
<P>
	Last week I visited three of the RCMP forensic laboratories 
and spoke with their technical experts on this matter. Either the 
information they have is not getting through to the minister or he 
is ignoring it. When I asked them about this concept of having 
the gun owner fill in a card and send it in, they laughed.
<P>
	I also found out that these labs have what they call a standard 
collection of firearms, meaning they are one of a kind. No two 
firearms are the same in the collection. These standard 
collections are in every one of their labs across the country.
<P>
	In this one lab the technicians had examined the long guns of 
which there were just under a thousand. They found that 20 per 
cent of those firearms did not have serial numbers and 1.7 per 
cent could not be identified.
<P>
	I do not know how the justice minister is going to create a 
registration system when 20 per cent of a standard collection 
that is fairly representative of the firearms in this country do not 
have serial numbers. How are we going to register a firearm that 
does not have a serial number?
<P>
	When I asked these questions the technicians' response was 
that they would have to be brought in. Brought in where? To the 
labs that do not as yet have but would have the technology to 
handle the thousands of firearms that would have to be brought 
in.
<P>
	Already they are examining the feasibility of what form and 
what type of system ought to be used to place a serial number on 
a firearm. Certainly it is going to cost more than $10 a firearm. 
Certainly it is not going to impose a simple constraint on a gun 
owner to fill out a form. I ask the minister, how in the world can 
a serial number be written on a card if there is no serial number 
on the gun?
<P>
	I was also told that many firearms in this country are over 100 
years old. A firearm does not wear out. A firearm is usually 
maintained fairly well by the owner. Many of those firearms do 
not have the manufacturer's name, the calibre, or any 
identifying marks other than perhaps a model number or a serial 
number.
<P>
	I was shown a firearm that had been imported from Russia. 
There are thousands of them in Canada, according to the 
information given to me. All it has on it is a serial number 
consisting of two Russian letters and three numbers. There is not 
the calibre, the make or any other identifying features on that 
firearm.
<P>
<B>(1825) </B>
<P>
	If we are going to develop a registration system which is truly 
going to be a workable and a valuable tool in the hands of our 
law enforcement agencies, we had better take a careful look at 
what we are going to do.
<P>
	It is important, proper and wise that we consider the 
amendment before the House now. If the minister will consider 
splitting this bill, let us put our efforts together to devise a bill 
directed at the criminal use of firearms. If there are people who 
honestly and sincerely believe that universal registration will 
help, let us examine it before we go forward. Let us not hurry 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10424"> 10424 </A></B>
<P>
into something that our technicians are telling us will not work 
and will certainly cost a lot more than $85 million to establish.
<P>
	I ask the minister if he would consider these proposals. This 
kind of information is going to be laid, lock, stock and barrel, 
before the standing committee, through witness after witness we 
will bring forward, from either the RCMP or the city police 
forces from across this country which have to deal with the 
problem. They are now faced with a situation in which they have 
to give a legal opinion in court instead of a technical opinion. I 
will give the House an example.
<P>
	If the minister goes forward and creates an offence for a 
person in possession of a handgun based upon its calibre, such as 
the .32 and the .25, that will create a serious problem. The 
reason for that is simple. Although the offence, the charge, the 
information in court will indicate that the individual is in 
violation of a section by virtue of the fact that they are in 
possession of a .32 calibre, all the defence counsel has to do is 
ask the technical witness about the calibre of the handgun?
<P>
	Although marked on its side that it is a .32 calibre, the 
definition of calibre, according to these technicians, is not what 
is marked on the side, but by the size of the projectile it fires. 
The .32 calibre, according to them, fires a .30 calibre projectile.
<P>
	I asked them what they would say on the witness stand when 
asked about the calibre. They said they would simply tell the 
court that it is designed as a .32, its markings are that of a .32, 
but it fires a .30 calibre projectile and they would let the judge 
decide. If they had respond yes or no to whether the firearm is 
.32 calibre, they said they would not respond. I asked them if 
they have ever considered a career in politics.
<P>
	My point is that there are a host of technical difficulties. 
When it comes to placing the identifying features from a firearm 
on to a registration card that the police will be able to identify 
without question, if they come across an individual with a 
firearm in the back seat of a car or in the trunk of a car for 
example, they are not going to be able to positively identify that 
firearm.
<P>
	All we have to do is look at the Terence Wade report in which 
he outlined the problems within the present handgun 
registration system. Approximately 30 per cent of the 
information contained in that system is simply useless.
<P>
	I understand from some of the legal opinions I am hearing that 
soon the challenges in court will render the handgun registration 
system invalid within a court of law because it cannot be relied 
upon.
<P>
<B>(1830 ) </B>
<P>
	There are so many different types of firearms that we are 
going to have an extreme degree of difficulty registering them to 
the point at which the registration card issued can identify one 
specific firearm out of the 7 million to 20 million that exist in 
Canada today.
<P>
	I point out difficulties that the registration system will have. 
It flies in the face of what the justice minister has said in terms 
of simplicity.
<P>
	If it is going to be as simple as the justice minister has 
indicated, then it is not going to be worth the powder to blow it 
in the hands of the police officers as an enforcement tool.
<P>
	Let us take a look at this. Let us go forward with the portion 
directed at the criminal use of firearms. Let us take a second 
look at the other part.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> According to the rules there is a 
six-minute extension of the debate because of the statement 
made earlier.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernie Collins (Souris-Moose Mountain, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, having served on the committee and being a member of 
the wildlife federation and coming from a rural riding of 
Saskatchewan, I am very concerned with the bill in its present 
form.
<P>
	I support the minister with regard to the criminal element, the 
four-year mandatory sentence for the commission of a crime 
with a firearm. The use of a fake firearm in the commission of a 
crime and a one-year mandatory sentence I support 
wholeheartedly. Those actions that would take into 
consideration smuggling and other offences involving guns and 
other illegal activities I support wholeheartedly.
<P>
	However, I have some strong reservations with regard to 
registration. If I am going to ask the citizens of Souris-Moose 
Mountain or any other area to spend $85 million, we have to 
consider what we are going to do for that cost.
<P>
	I am prepared to register. I have owned guns all my life. I am a 
wildlife member and a firearms safety instructor. I was never 
impressed with the FAC formed some years ago. Now we have a 
four-page document. The government might as well have made 
it 30 pages and we could have had a light history of each of us as 
we own handguns.
<P>
	In Saskatchewan most of the people who own handguns 
handle them safely, especially those who are members of 
handgun clubs. They have to adhere to all the rules and 
regulations.
<P>
	As wildlife members we have to make sure that under Bill 
C-17 we store our guns and ammunition properly. We do have a 
responsibility to one another. As a hunter, in order for me to go 
on any other person's land I have to respect it. That is a 
privilege, not a right.
<P>
	Many of us think it is a right and not very many farmers post 
their land because they expect that each of us going on that land 
does respect each other's property.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="10425"> 10425 </A></B>
<P>
	However, within the framework of the legislation as it comes 
forward, the reservations I have are that if we impose the 
opportunity for someone to enter into my home and check to 
see whether I have certain compliances, I would rather they do 
that with a search warrant.
<P>
	Make no mistake. Legislation is not easy but it is all 
encompassing. Friends of mine have smaller barrelled guns that 
are virtually at the end of their time. They have spent great 
amounts of money on them and treasure them as relics. Those 
will now go to the criminal element because they will not 
register them or they will have to get rid of them.
<P>
<B>(1835) </B>
<P>
	If we are going to confiscate, compensate. People would 
accept that. When I was on the committee I did not say anything 
about handguns. I think we have to very careful of the direction 
we take in this regard.
<P>
	I am very concerned. Rather than speaking to the media, this 
is the place where we should exercise our opportunity as 
members of this House on both sides to speak very clearly about 
how we feel.
<P>
	I do not believe I would gain any points by going before the 
news media, trying to unravel where we are going. I credit the 
minister and the justice committee will review both the 
directions of my friends opposite and members on our side.
<P>
	I will have the opportunity to vote against this bill. I cannot 
support it in its present form. However, that does not mean to say 
that I will not take a look at the changes that will come forward 
and address them to see if they meet the needs of the Canadians I 
represent.
<P>
	I appreciate the opportunity to be frank and honest about a bill 
that I know the minister has great concern for, and great concern 
for all Canadians. Let us take a look at the changes and let us 
register our concern and our final judgment on it.

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">ADJOURNMENT PROCEEDINGS</H2>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 
deemed to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="THEBUDGET">THE BUDGET</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, on March 
1, in a question to the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, I 
objected to the $975 fee announced in the budget that will be 
charged to anyone who wishes to immigrate to Canada, in 
addition to the $500 they have to pay to have their file processed 
by immigration officers.
<P>
	Canada is now one of the most expensive immigration 
countries. This unfair and unacceptable decision adds to the 
incredible increase in all fees connected with immigration and 
citizenship. By the same token, I want to condemn office 
closures and personnel cuts at the Department of Citizenship 
and Immigration and the drastic reduction in the number of IRB 
commissioners.
<P>
	These exorbitant fees are the equivalent of several months or 
even a year's wages for immigrants from poor countries. 
Refugees could not even afford to pay $500, so how could they 
pay an additional $975? Most of them arrive in Canada without 
any money. Sometimes they lost everything they had in their 
country of origin. When they arrive here, they have to get winter 
clothes, food and accommodation for their families. This tax is 
cruel and inhumane.
<P>
	With this measure, how can Canada claim to honour this 
country's humanitarian tradition with respect to displaced or 
persecuted persons, as specified in the Immigration Act? 
Furthermore, the vast majority of refugees throughout the world 
are women and children. This measure will make sponsorship 
and family reunification even more difficult.
<P>
	I want to take this opportunity to condemn the treatment of 
refugees scheduled for deportation at the Malton detention 
centre near the airport in Toronto. Last Wednesday, a citizen of 
Uruguay who was to be deported had to be taken to hospital after 
he tried to commit suicide. I mentioned the case of twelve 
people of Hispanic origin who were ill treated.
<P>
<B>(1840) </B>
<P>
	I again want to ask the minister to investigate these 
allegations and to deal with those who are responsible for this 
very serious and unacceptable situation.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, newcomers 
to Canada have access to the universal social programs that are 
paid for by all Canadians.
<P>
	Immigrants and refugees also have access to our extensive 
integration and settlement services, the best in the world. The 
cost of these programs is $271 million a year, a great part of 
which goes to the province of Quebec. We are talking about 
language training, assistance in job searches and help for 
families enrolling their children in schools. The list goes on.
<P>
	Canadians have told us through consultations that they want 
those who derive benefits from Canada's wide range of 
programs and services to help pay for them. Refugees and 
immigrants have said they want to help as well.
<P>
	We recognize that not everyone will be able to afford the fee. 
For that reason we have created a new loan option that will 
enable refugees to get the financial assistance they need. Like 
<P>

<B><A NAME="10426"> 10426 </A></B>
<P>
the loan option for travel, we  expect that they will repay those 
loans at the 95 per cent rate at which they repay the others.
<P>
	Newcomers to Canada make an investment in their future, a 
Canadian future, and this is a small price to pay for living in the 
best country in the world.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="LOWLEVELFLIGHTS">LOW LEVEL FLIGHTS</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, on March 3 in question period I brought to the 
attention of the House the report of the federal environmental 
assessment panel which reviewed low level military training 
flights in Labrador and Quebec. Approximately 6,000 to 7,000 
low level training flights a year are currently being conducted 
out of Canadian forces base Goose Bay.
<P>
	These flights are allowed under a 10-year multilateral 
memorandum of understanding agreement signed by Canada 
and the NATO allies which expires in 1996. The assessment 
panel report recommends that the government accept the 
Department of National Defence proposal to negotiate a new 
agreement that would more than double the number of flights, 
establish a new practice bombing range and expand the flight 
training area.
<P>
	This would effectively concentrate the flights over traditional 
lands that have been used and occupied by the Innu nation for 
more than 9,000 years. After 10 years of experience observing 
the effects of these flights, the Innu contend that the noise 
adversely affects the wildlife, especially caribou, which they 
rely on for food.
<P>
	The noise also causes the Innu mental and physical stress and 
disrupts their culture and traditional way of life. Many Innu 
boycotted the hearings because they felt these concerns as well 
as issues relating to aboriginal rights and land claims 
negotiations were not being adequately dealt with by the panel.
<P>
	Although the panel did not adequately address the issues 
raised by aboriginal people, it did acknowledge that research 
concerning environmental effects on the flights was lacking. On 
this point the report is very clear: ``So little is known about 
much of the wildlife in the training areas and the effects of 
overflights on them over the longer term that much uncertainty 
and hence concern remains. As a result the panel could not draw 
conclusions on the longer term effect of low level flying on the 
natural systems''.
<P>
	The panel therefore recommended that the project proceed 
only if key conditions are met and certain issues are dealt with. 
The first condition is that before a new low level flying 
agreement is signed and the flights are allowed to continue, the 
government must establish an independent institute to study and 
monitor the effects of the flights.
<P>
	The panel also recommended that as soon as possible the 
government establish a joint management board for the George 
River caribou herd and settle aboriginal land claims in the 
affected area.
<P>
	In question period the Minister of National Defence gave no 
indication of whether he agrees or disagrees with the report, if 
he would recommend that cabinet accept the report or what 
measures the government will take to ensure that the panel's 
conditions are met.
<P>
	The government's own assessment panel admits the impacts 
on the environment and aboriginal rights are unknown and 
DND's avoidance procedures probably will not work. Does the 
government think that these flights should be allowed to 
continue when their effects are unknown? When one does not 
know the impact of something, it may not be wise to proceed.
<P>
	It is important for the Innu people whose lives will continue to 
be affected by this program to know now if the government will 
accept the panel's report and, if the government does accept the 
recommendations in the report, what steps will be taken to 
address the issues identified by the panel and ensure that its 
major conditions including land claims negotiations will be met. 
This is an important point, especially since it appears clear that 
the provincial government of Newfoundland, because of the 
land claims dispute, will not enter into land claims negotiations 
with the Innu people. It is very important to know how the 
Government of Canada will respond to this very important 
matter.
<P>
<B>(1845) </B>
<P>
	The government must ensure that it does not address the 
economic interests of one group while ignoring the economic 
interests of another.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
President of the Treasury Board, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, you will 
perhaps recall that the Department of National Defence had 
requested an environmental assessment be initiated to study the 
impact of an increase in the activity of low level flights at CFB 
Goose Bay.
<P>
	The panel known as the FEARO panel has submitted its report 
to two of my colleagues, the Minister of the Environment and 
the Minister of National Defence. The panel has made every 
effort to hear from groups and individuals interested in putting 
their views forward. It has made recommendations to the 
government after considering their views.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The panel concluded that stopping the military flights would 
be very damaging to the region's economy. It recommended that 
this activity be allowed to continue, under certain conditions set 
out in the report. According to the seven members of the panel, 
there was little concrete evidence, at that stage, that the flights 
had a substantial negative impact on the environment, human 
health or the community.

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="ROYALBANKOFCANADA">ROYAL BANK OF CANADA</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to have a chance this afternoon to speak about the tax 
system and in particular how it affects banks in Canada. I want 
to lead off first of all with a comment from the ``Budget in 
Brief'' or the budget itself.
<P>
	I remember the Minister of Finance in his speech talked about 
the fact that the government was going to get tough. It was going 
to close off some loopholes. For example, the large corporation 
tax rate was going to increase by 12.5 per cent. I remember my 
friends on the Liberal benches were cheering at that point. There 
was a a lot of applauding and actually a couple of half-effort 
standing ovations.
<P>
	This was a 12 per cent increase of the large corporation tax 
rate. The tax rate of large corporations will rise from 0.2 per cent 
to 0.22 per cent. Granted that is 12 per cent but it is a tax going 
from 0.2 per cent to 0.22 per cent. Anyone who knows anything 
about mathematics would say this is infinitesimal and yet 
technically it is an increase. My gosh, we are hardly getting 
tough when the tax rate goes from 0.2 to 0.22. Yet that is the kind 
of impression the government left, that it had gone to all kinds of 
trouble to close loopholes.
<P>
	I am prepared to say this afternoon that the government did 
not close any loopholes. Even the old family trust, the one that is 
favoured and is considered the mother of all tax loopholes, is 
still there. Basically it was just tinkered with and that privilege 
will continue.
<P>
	Let us talk about the Royal Bank. If there is one corporate 
sector that is held up it is the banking sector. I want to challenge 
people opposite and perhaps anyone watching to take a look at 
the annual report of the Royal Bank of Canada for 1993. When 
looking through this report, and granted I am not an accountant 
or a tax lawyer, but I have read a lot of annual reports and 
financial statements, to me it says the bank does not pay income 
tax. Page after page says basically that.
<P>
	When I spoke with the bank I was told that is not technically 
correct. It actually pays tax. I have got to say today that the 
Royal Bank does pay some tax. The Royal Bank pays all the 
usual taxes that corporations pay but we have to realize that the 
Royal Bank is included in a number of subsidiaries. When we 
add up all of the subsidiaries which include things like Royal 
Bank Mortgage Corporation, RBC Dominion Securities 
Limited, Royal Trust, the Royal Bank Canada (Barbados) 
Limited, the Voyageur Insurance Company and many more-the 
consolidated umbrella of all of the aspects of the Royal Bank-it 
does pay income tax. As a matter of fact, it paid about $509 
million in 1992.
<P>
	However, what we would call a bank that we go into with 
tellers where we get a mortgage, a car loan or whatever, actually 
lost money. Therefore, in spite of all of its fees and so on, it did 
not pay income tax. It did pay a minimum corporate tax and did 
pay the corporation tax of 0.2 per cent which the government has 
now raised to 0.22 per cent. While the bank, including all of its 
subsidiary operations did pay income tax, for clarification the 
Royal Bank per se, unconsolidated, did not pay income tax. 
Therein lies the difference.
<P>
	Did the budget change any of that? No, it did not. As a matter 
of fact, the budget changed very little of our tax system. I would 
be remiss this afternoon not to say that the large share of our 
accumulated debt-more than 45 per cent-comes from all of 
the tax loopholes we have in the system. That is what has caused 
a lot of our debt. Yet the government did not take any steps in 
any substantive way to close these loopholes.
<P>
	I would be interested to hear what my hon. friend has to say in 
terms of whether the Royal Bank has paid income tax or not. 
Remember-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. Parliamentary Secretary to 
the Minister of Finance.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Walker (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, several banks reported record 
profits in 1994. This has led observers to wonder whether the 
banks are paying their fair share of taxes.
<P>
	Banks pay a considerable amount of taxes. They pay income 
tax and are subject to two federal capital taxes, including the 
large corporation tax which applies to all corporations with 
more than $10 million in capital, and the capital tax for large 
financial institutions which acts as a minimum tax.
<P>
	During the period 1991-93, the six largest banks and their 
mortgage loan affiliates paid nearly $1 billion annually in 
federal income tax and capital tax. The banks also pay income 
tax, capital tax, property tax and other types of taxes to 
provinces and municipalities.
<P>
	Members are probably aware of measures that were 
introduced in the last two budgets to ensure that banks, and 
financial institutions generally, continue to pay their fair share 
of taxes. This year's budget introduced a special tax on the 
capital of large deposit institutions, including banks.
