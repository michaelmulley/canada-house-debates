Mr. Speaker, I rise under Standing Order 36 to present two 
petitions signed by 60 residents of Kaleden and Oliver in my 
riding of Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt. I would like to 
point out that to date 413 people from my riding have signed 
petitions regarding the same subject, gun control.
<P>
	The petitioners oppose further gun legislation. They call on 
the government to provide strict enforcement of existing 
statutes governing the use of firearms in the commission of a 
criminal offence, with particular emphasis on the rigorous use 
of section 85 of the Criminal Code. Further restrictions on 
law-abiding citizens will not solve the problem of crime in 
Canada. Government must deal with the real problem and not 
punish law-abiding citizens.

on Industry entitled ``Taking Care of Small Business'' or, in 
French, <I>Pour financer le succès de la PME.</I>
<P>
	This report contains 24 recommendations aimed at creating a 
financial climate more favourable to the development of small 
business in Canada.
<P>

	The report could not have been done without the tremendous 
hard work and non-partisan co-operation of all members from 
all parties of the industry committee. I wish to thank everyone 
who participated in the report.

	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, B.Q.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
the tabling of this report I would like to join the chairman in 
saluting the 58 witnesses who participated in the committee 
proceedings and thanking the people who sent us 62 briefs.
<P>
	I also want to stress the highly positive atmosphere in which 
the proceedings took place. I must say however that, in spite of 
this positive attitude, we had to dissent on two major points 
which we believed not to be in the best interests of Quebecers. 
The first point concerns the fiscal relationship between the 
Fonds de solidarité des travailleurs du Québec and the federal 
government; we will comment on this further during the 
forthcoming press conference; the second point regards the 
Small Businesses Loans Act; instead of restricting its scope, we 
would like to see it broadened to include all small businesses, 
not only those involved in exports, so that in the new economy, 
small and medium sized businesses can rely on this act for their 
working capital. That is all for now, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Before I see the member 
rising, according to our standing orders concerning the tabling 
of reports from committees, if and when there should be a 
dissenting voice, members from Her Majesty's Loyal 
Opposition have an equal amount of time to that of the presenter 
of the committee report.
<P>
	I submit with the greatest of respect to all my colleagues that 
the Chair cannot extend the floor to another member to speak on 
the same report.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. With 
unanimous consent, could we be afforded that privilege just for 
a very brief comment?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Of course the Chair is the 
servant of all members of the House. Is it the wish of the House 
to extend the privilege to the hon. member? Is there unanimous 
consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Okanagan Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to be here this morning and to be able to 
support and to be part of a process in which democracy is 
operating in its truest form.
<P>
	The committee developed recommendations that will support 
small business. These were developed based on the people's 
commentary. The committee has come up with 
recommendations that in my opinion will definitely help to 
develop small business in Canada.
<P>
	Some of the key recommendations are the increase of 
competition among financial institutions by increasing the 
number and kind of institutions that provide financing; setting 
interest rates under the Small Businesses Loans Act that are 
commensurate with risk; developing a code of conduct for 
banks; and the establishment of a bank ombudsman with the 
power to investigate and order compensation on matters of 
breach of duty or maladministration in order to ensure a level 
playing field between businesses and banks.
<P>
<B>(1010 ) </B>
<P>
	We know that small businesses play a major role in the 
economic development of Canada. We need to shore up this part 
of our sector. Our economic future is dependent upon them and 
this report. If the government sees fit to implement the 
recommendations, we will have a better climate as a result of 
this development.

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CRIMINALCODE">CRIMINAL CODE</A></H3>
	The House resumed from September 22 consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-41, an act to amend the Criminal Code 
(sentencing) and other acts in consequence thereof, be read the 
second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I will recognize the hon. 
member for Scarborough-Rouge River. I want to apprise the 
House we are at the stage of debate where members have a 
10-minute allocation without questions or comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough-Rouge River, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Bill C-41 addresses an area of the criminal justice 
system which we call sentencing. There is for me a certain sense 
of déjà vu. A bill not identical to this was introduced in the last 
Parliament.
<P>
	Colleagues on the justice committee at that time viewed the 
bill as flawed and made a collective decision not to proceed. As 
a result the sentencing legislation, which has been in the works 
for some 10 years or more, languished for another period of 
time. That legislation was flawed from the point of view of 
properly defining what sentencing should be or could be and it 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6817"> 6817 </A></B>
<P>
also failed to take adequate account of the role of the victim in a 
criminal law sentencing decision.
<P>
	At least members on this side of the House and to some extent 
all members are the authors of the bill currently before the 
House. I am proud to stand with the Minister of Justice in 
presenting this bill for its consideration.
<P>
	Certain refinements have been made to the bill. There have 
been a lot of contributors. It is only fair to acknowledge these 
contributors over all of the years. This is not something that 
came off the assembly line and was cobbled together quickly.
<P>
	Over the years contributions have been made in the area of 
criminal law sentencing, at least in laying the new groundwork, 
by the Law Reform Commission of Canada, the Canadian 
Sentencing Commission, and former members of the House of 
Commons. I recall members of the other place also contributed 
to the debate. There have been some special individuals inside 
the House.
<P>
	We should give credit to those in the Department of Justice 
who have shepherded the bill through to the present time. Last 
but not least is the Minister of Justice. He has come forward with 
what we believe is a landmark in the sense that not previously in 
our history have we attempted to codify the sentencing regime in 
the Criminal Code. We have not had a statute that specifically 
targeted the issue of sentencing.
<P>
	Sentencing was referred to in the government's election 
platform. Some credit is due to a lot of members in the last 
Parliament, not just on the government side, but some credit is 
also due to the flexibility and foresight of the current Prime 
Minister who accommodated this in the party's platform. Now it 
is our job in the House to review it, refine it should the need be 
there and put it into law.
<P>
<B>(1015) </B>
<P>
	What is worth noting for the record is this bill is not 
corrections legislation. It does not deal with penitentiaries. It 
does not deal with parole. It does not deal with sentencing terms 
per se. The sentence that could be given by a judge is set out in 
the Criminal Code, minimums, maximums or whatever. This 
bill does not set out the penalty or potential penalty for a 
particular crime. This bill does not deal with gun control per se. 
It does not deal with the way we deal with gradual release of our 
inmates. It is not any of those things. Notwithstanding, it is a 
landmark piece of legislation.
<P>
	This bill consolidates and updates in a codified form our 
Canadian developed law of sentencing. Much of this law has 
been developed in the courtroom by judges. It was created 
judicially with reference to the Criminal Code, our criminal law 
traditions, our Charter of Rights and Freedoms and other 
common law elements that judges have taken into account over 
the years.
<P>
	This is perhaps an opportunity for the legislators to play their 
role in giving the appropriate definition, guidance and 
framework to the judges who have for the last 100 or more years 
carried the burden of sentencing in the discretion that has been 
given to them under the Criminal Code. Here is our chance as 
legislators to provide a framework for them.
<P>
	One of the major functions of this bill is to define the purpose 
and principles of sentencing. This was an issue in the previous 
legislation. It still may be an issue. It may be an area in which 
some refinement may be useful at committee stage recalling that 
as we debate the bill now we are debating the bill in principle. I 
am certainly going to support the bill in principle.
<P>
	In terms of these actual definitions, it might be useful for the 
committee which will study this bill to look with a magnifying 
glass at the actual wording of the purpose and principles of 
sentencing as set out in the bill. There is some alleged fuzzing 
thinking. It is just alleged. I am not saying it is fuzzy, I am 
saying that from my point of view the wording in section 718 
could be slightly more simplified and perhaps more orthodox 
than it is written at the moment.
<P>
	In that regard, and I will put it on the record, I have a sense 
that in trying to define the fundamental purpose of sentencing 
Department of Justice officials have used the definition of 
purpose of criminal law. There is a difference between the 
purpose of criminal law, that being generally or usually defined 
to be the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society, and 
the purpose of sentencing which is just an element of the 
criminal law. The purpose of sentencing, in my view, is to 
promote respect for the law and respect for the criminal law 
system which does all of these other things for us. However, that 
is a rather narrow perspective at the moment as we debate the 
bill in principle and that can be taken up later.
<P>
	I want to address the sections of this bill dealing with 
potential for change from the aboriginal perspective. It would be 
wrong to say there is now in existence an aboriginal system of 
criminal justice. There are some pilot projects through the 
goodwill of aboriginal Canadians, the people on their reserves, 
people in the criminal justice community, the police and the 
judges.
<P>
<B>(1020 ) </B>
<P>
	There has been some leadership there in an attempt to develop 
a system in the aboriginal community that works. I do not think 
there is a member in this House who would walk into a reserve in 
northern Canada and say they believe affairs on the reserve 
ought to be run the same way they are in downtown Montreal or 
Vancouver or at King and Bay Streets in Toronto. These are two 
different worlds.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6818"> 6818 </A></B>
<P>
	Our aboriginal Canadians never did apply for Canadian 
citizenship. We bestowed it on them. There is plenty of good 
reason to look for ways to make the criminal justice system 
work on these reserves that are very much removed from the 
urban way of Canadian life.
<P>
	I look forward to working on that aspect of the bill. I will 
make note of my interest in section 745 of the Criminal Code 
which is related to sentencing provisions. This bill does not 
address that specifically. It might be constructive and useful to 
take a closer look at section 745 of the Criminal Code, the 
section that permits a decreased or reduced parole eligibility 
date for those serving life sentences, and at the wording of 
section 718(2) which deals with aggravating and mitigating 
circumstances that a judge may take into account at the time of 
sentencing.
<P>
	There is an initiative put forward in the bill which may be 
useful. It would certainly bear discussion at the committee stage 
when we look at the entire package.
<P>
	I will indicate my wholehearted support for the bill in 
principle. I look forward to further deliberations at the 
committee stage.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sharon Hayes (Port Moody-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to address Bill C-41. The purpose of this 
bill is to introduce changes to the sentencing system of the 
Criminal Code. A number of aspects of this bill do improve the 
sentencing process.
<P>
	Canadians are demanding improvements to the criminal 
justice system. Perhaps Bill C-41 will address a few of their 
concerns. However, some aspects only appear to be positive. 
Half measures or blatantly misleading proposals are not what 
they want.
<P>
	Despite the introduction of the statement of purpose and 
principle of sentencing, judges will still have the same latitude 
under this legislation as they do today in imposing various and 
inconsistent penalties.
<P>
	This month I have received over 4,000 letters and faxes as 
well as petitions containing the signatures of over 12,000 
residents of the lower mainland demanding real deterrents as a 
fundamental part of the justice system. I believe that 
inescapable, real consequences are part of such a deterrent.
<P>
	Respect for the criminal justice system stems from equality 
before the law. Where is the principle of building confidence in 
Canadians that their safety and security is a primary goal of an 
accountable justice system that must include the principle of 
equality?
<P>
	As I address the issue of equality before and under the law, I 
would like to address the so-called hate crime section of this 
bill. It reads as follows: ``Evidence that the offence was 
motivated by bias, prejudice or hate based on race, nationality, 
colour, religion, sex, age, mental or physical disability or sexual 
orientation of the victim shall be deemed to be aggravating 
circumstances''.
<P>
	There is no question that it is totally reprehensible that a 
person should be attacked viciously or otherwise because of 
their personal characteristics. The attacker should be punished 
fully for the offence. However, this section of the legislation 
poses several dilemmas which need to be addressed.
<P>
	How will the courts determine that a crime was motivated by 
hate, prejudice or bias? Will prosecutors launch investigations 
into the backgrounds and motives of every person convicted of 
assault in order to determine whether that assault was based on a 
personal bias against the victim?
<P>
	How will this affect current backlogs in the courts? Will only 
the most obvious crimes be subject to this section? Will the 
courts later overturn a verdict delivered by a lower court 
because it later seemed that the assault was or was not motivated 
by hate, prejudice or bias, even though the assault on the 
individual took place?
<P>
<B>(1025 ) </B>
<P>
	Why should one form of assault be judged as more hideous or 
unacceptable than another? What happened to the fact that any 
assault on a man or a woman is completely unacceptable and 
should not be tolerated regardless of motivating factors? It is the 
viciousness of the attack that needs to be judged, not whether the 
accused harboured personal prejudice toward the victim. There 
is a problem with the enumeration of categories upon which 
bias, prejudice or hate will be decided. Is hate only an 
aggravated crime if it falls within these categories?
<P>
	What about a person who is attacked because someone does 
not like their chosen profession? Consider for a moment the 
popularity of lawyers and politicians. Occupational bias is not 
on this list. What if they hate someone because they are rich or 
because they are poor? Class distinction is not on this list. The 
person who is mugged and beaten half to death for their wallet 
and keys to their expensive car by someone who resents their 
status or achievement will see their accused face a lesser 
sentence than if the same accused had attacked them for their 
religious beliefs. There is great inequity in this type of 
legislation.
<P>
	I would like to bring to the attention of this House a couple of 
incidents from my own province of British Columbia which will 
help illustrate the problem with this particular clause.
<P>
	The first occurred in B.C. to a young man by the name of 
Andre Castet. Let me read from the coverage of this case 
provided by the Vancouver <I>Sun</I>: ``But no less than a month after 
the Sidney teenager died from a beating, its his former 
classmates and the community who must regain voices and steps 
broken by the tragedy. `People are still grappling for an 
explanation for this-something they can latch on to', says 
Derek Peach, a grade 12 English teacher at Parkland secondary, 
the 800 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6819"> 6819 </A></B>
<P>
student Sidney school where both Andre, 17, and his two 
accused killers attended classes last year''.
<P>
	Would the parents and friends of the victims feel any better 
about this tragic death if they knew that the accused would be 
facing a stiffer penalty because the crown prosecutor could 
prove that the attack was motivated by hate, prejudice or bias? 
Since there does not seem to be any such evidence should there 
not be an outcry of injustice from those same parents and friends 
because the accused will not suffer as harsh a penalty as they 
might if it could be proven that they hated him?
<P>
	What about the case in my own riding of Coquitlam, the tragic 
and senseless death of Graham Niven? His death sparked an 
outcry from the public which resulted in a rally attended by over 
5,000 people demanding stiffer penalties for those youth 
convicted of crimes of violence.
<P>
	Again, I quote from an article in the Vancouver <I>Sun</I>: ``A man 
who was kicked to death last weekend was helping a teenager in 
trouble, the victim's roommate said Tuesday. Graham Niven, 
31, had just called a taxi for a stranded Burnaby youth before a 
confrontation with a group of youths outside a Mac's 
convenience store in Coquitlam early Saturday morning. `He 
was being a good Samaritan' said roommate Steve Hoskins 
Tuesday. `He gave his last $7 to a kid from Burnaby who had 
missed the last bus home.''
<P>
	The people in my riding do not want the accused getting off 
lightly because they are young offenders but they also do not 
want them getting off lightly because they cannot be found 
guilty of hate, prejudice or bias. They destroyed a man, along 
with his dreams and goals, and left his family and friends with 
nothing but their memories and their pain. No matter what the 
motivation for the crime the sentence must reflect the tragedy 
and hideousness of the crime. An assault is an assault and must 
be treated with the full extent of the law.
<P>
	I would also like to address the inclusion of sexual orientation 
in this legislation. I am personally opposed to the inclusion of 
this term and would like to outline the reasons for my stand.
<P>
	My party affirms the equality of every individual before and 
under the law and the right of every individual to live freely 
within the limits of the law. I assert that homosexuals already 
have the same rights and privileges as all other Canadians as 
guaranteed by the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Sexual 
orientation in itself is not a legitimate basis for special 
enumerated protection. I will give several reasons.
<P>
	First and foremost sexual orientation does not possess the 
characteristics essential for inclusion in the list. Human rights 
are protected on the basis of immutable characteristics such as 
age, gender and race, or the universally accepted positive 
characteristic of religion. These criteria have not yet been 
established for the category of sexual orientation and in 
particular the undefined term as presented in this legislation.
<P>
	As well my conclusion is based on the position of my 
constituents. Recently in a questionnaire sent out from my 
office I asked whether my constituents agreed that sexual 
orientation should be included in the charter as a protected 
category along with race, colour, religion or gender. A decisive 
65 per cent of respondents rejected that notion.
<P>
<B>(1030) </B>
<P>
	It is my duty to represent the concerns of my constituents. It is 
also my duty as an elected representative to consider all 
consequences and implications. As illustrated in the debate in 
this House, the inclusion of such a term as sexual orientation 
would result in a profound infringement on the longstanding 
rights and freedoms of Canadians.
<P>
	Would the label of crime of hate be applied to even the 
expression of one's deeply held religious or personal 
convictions if those personal convictions were that 
homosexuality was immoral? That has been proposed.
<P>
	Would it be a crime of hate to express personal freedom of 
association by the exclusion of homosexuals in churches or 
private associations or even as roommates? These and other 
questions will be raised in broader ways as we discuss the 
government's proposed changes to the Human Rights Act.
<P>
	May I say that a government that denies the moral will of the 
majority of Canadians by forcing a vote on party lines is denying 
the very basics of democracy.
<P>
	In conclusion, society demands that a criminal justice system 
enforce deterrence of the offender with just and predictable 
consequence. It demands the principle of equality under the law 
to be applied to all Canadians. Assault or any other crime for 
whatever reason should receive the full force of law regardless 
of the range of emotion behind the motives for the crime. 
Canadians want justice applied without the intrusion of mind 
police or political correctness. Canadians want laws and 
systems better defined to protect society as a whole.
<P>
	Bill C-41 introduces more potential for inequities and 
unpredictability in an already flawed system.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jane Stewart (Brant, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I can think of 
nothing more frustrating for Canadian people than laws which 
are in theory intended to protect and reflect our sense of what is 
right and what is wrong but which in practice continuously 
prove to be ineffective or variable in their application and result.
<P>
	Our legal system forms the network that binds us as 
Canadians. It is the framework under which we all agree to live 
and be judged. With variability or uncertainty of application and 
use, the strength, control and credibility of this vital tool of 
human management is undermined and society as a whole is 
weakened.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6820"> 6820 </A></B>
<P>
	In response to a growing sense of frustration on the part of 
Canadians, the Minister of Justice has tabled Bill C-41, an act 
on sentencing reform. In an effort to refocus the application and 
use of our laws Bill C-41 provides clear direction and 
guidelines to the courts on the purpose and the methods of 
sentencing. Prior to Bill C-41 the role of Parliament was simply 
to set maximum penalties for offences under the Criminal Code. 
With this legislation Parliament is looking at the fundamentals, 
the policy objectives of the sentencing process.
<P>
	This legislation sets out that the fundamental purpose of 
sentencing is to contribute to respect for the law and the 
maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society. The framework 
provided is of enormous significance. Sentencing is not simply 
about giving sentences. Rather, sentencing must serve the 
fundamental purpose of creating a just and safe society.
<P>
	Bill C-41 provides as well a holistic vision of sentencing. 
Sentencing should not be solely about jails and prisons. 
Effective sentencing, sentencing that deters repeat offenders, 
also involves alternative measures such as restitution and 
conditional sentences.
<P>
	Research has clearly shown that these forms of sentencing are 
more effective in combating crime than a strictly law and order 
approach. One only needs to look south of the border for 
evidence of this. In the United States the rate of imprisonment is 
400 per cent that of Canada's yet 200 Americans are victims of 
violence every hour despite annual expenditures on police, 
courts and corrections that exceed $70 billion. One cannot 
seriously argue that the United States is a safer country due to its 
bigger jails, tougher sentences and capital punishment. In fact, 
the opposite seems true.
<P>
	Bill C-41 outlines another sentencing principle that I would 
like to briefly address. Under this legislation the courts should 
take into consideration the principle that a sentence should be 
increased if there is evidence that the crime was motivated by 
bias, prejudice or hate based on the race, nationality, colour, 
religion, sex, age, mental or physical disability, or sexual 
orientation of the victim. Some say that this provides special 
status for these Canadians, particularly homosexual Canadians. 
If these people have any special status, it is the special status of 
often suffering abuse simply because of their minority 
characteristics.
<P>
<B>(1035) </B>
<P>
	Bill C-41 ensures that the courts consider these 
circumstances when deciding upon sentences. This is not about 
granting special status. Rather it is about affirming equality for 
all Canadians. Homosexual Canadians should be able to walk on 
our streets without the fear of being attacked just because of 
their sexual orientation. Just as heterosexuals do not have to live 
with this fear neither should other Canadians who have a 
different sexual preference.
<P>
	This is about promoting equality, not granting special status. 
It is also saying that Canadians will not stand for crimes based 
on hate.
<P>
	Many of my constituents have expressed to me their concern 
that the criminal justice system does not do enough for the 
victim. I strongly support Bill C-41 because it does address this 
concern in several ways. One obvious way is that it provides for 
victim impact statements at section 745 hearings. Victims will 
no longer go voiceless at the early parole hearings.
<P>
	A second provision for victims that I would like to discuss in 
more detail is restitution. Bill C-41 would allow the courts to 
consider ordering restitution to individual victims or to the 
community to cover property damage or personal injury. This 
provision responds to the demands of victims to have their needs 
considered by the justice system.
<P>
	Crimes can have a tremendous financial impact upon victims. 
Is it more effective to have these offenders only put behind bars? 
Where does that leave the victim? Or should the perpetrators be 
hit where it hurts, in the pocketbook, which will promote 
responsibility for their actions?
<P>
	Previously victims had to apply to receive compensation for 
their losses. Bill C-41 provides a process for restitution to be 
considered as part of the normal process of sentencing.
<P>
	In cases in which the court orders an offender to pay 
restitution and a fine but where it is clear that the offender does 
not have the means to pay both, Bill C-41 states that restitution 
must take precedence. This demonstrates that this legislation is 
committed to helping the victims of crime.
<P>
	I strongly support this move toward restitution. Why should 
victims of crime go uncompensated while the offenders simply 
spend time in custody? I would think for non-serious crimes 
rehabilitation of the offender can be more effectively achieved 
through directly seeing what damage has been caused to the 
victim.
<P>
	I believe and would request that the framework for restitution 
as set out in Bill C-41 be extended to cover the special 
circumstances of certain specific crimes. I am particularly 
thinking about the issue of domestic violence. In most cases a 
severe economic inequality results from these situations.
<P>
	If a woman makes a horribly difficult decision to press 
charges and leave the scene of abuse she in most cases retains 
responsibility for the children. She is forced to seek temporary 
shelter, needs to find child care or care for her children, often 
with very limited economic means.
<P>
	I believe that restitution would be particularly important in 
cases involving domestic violence because of the economic 
inequality that results. Women and their children are too often 
left at a severe disadvantage. Too often the abuser spends some 
weekend in jail or pays  some fines but the victim is left with 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6821"> 6821 </A></B>
<P>
financial stresses in addition to the obvious physical and 
emotional trauma.
<P>
	Under Bill C-41 restitution orders for bodily harm only cover 
pecuniary damages specifically including loss of income or 
support. It is unclear how broadly the courts might interpret 
pecuniary damages in ordering restitution in the cases of 
domestic violence.
<P>
	I am suggesting that we should not leave this judgment to 
chance. We should define pecuniary damages in cases involving 
domestic violence to specifically include loss of income as well 
as costs related to temporary shelter, child care and 
transportation. These are costs that are directly incurred as a 
result of the abuse. The courts should consider these when 
ordering restitution.
<P>
	Abused women are often forced to spend time in battered 
women's shelters since they are the only places they can afford 
and which offer protection. Perhaps a portion of the restitution 
order dealing with temporary housing could go directly to 
support these shelters as well.
<P>
	I acknowledge this is not a solution to the problem of 
domestic violence. Solutions have to be found in addressing 
problems before the abuse occurs in looking at the inequality 
between men and women and looking at the problems of poverty 
and alcoholism. However, I think that restitution offers an 
excellent opportunity to address the economic inequality that 
can result from domestic violence.
<P>
<B>(1040) </B>
<P>
	Another significant problem is that women often do not report 
abusive situations. Restitution would only be ordered after a 
conviction is obtained. I realize that this is only a small 
consideration to the emotional and physical challenges, but if 
women knew that compensation would be there in the end they 
might be more encouraged to report the abuse.
<P>
	Requiring the courts to consider the specific circumstances of 
domestic violence cases in ordering restitution would help the 
victims of domestic violence. Requiring convicted abusers to 
financially compensate their victims would provide another 
good indication to offenders that they are responsible for their 
actions.
<P>
	In closing, I strongly support the measures that are included in 
Bill C-41. The maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society 
depends on good and fair sentencing. This legislation provides a 
framework for our courts so that they in turn can give our 
community, Canadians, just that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Waterloo, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak on Bill C-41. I do so on experience gained as a 
community worker in the criminal justice system from 1975 to 
1993. I have 18 years experience working with offenders, 
victims, police, prosecutors, judges, correctional workers and 
the public. I have also worked with many volunteers involved in 
the justice system.
<P>
	My work was in the Waterloo region where we pioneered 
many programs in the field of community justice and 
corrections. Victim reconciliation, community mediation, 
Kitchener House where offenders serve provincial time in a 
halfway house, the first bail program in Ontario, law day and 
justice weeks were all pioneered in the Waterloo region. In the 
Waterloo region crime and justice are a community 
responsibility.
<P>
	Bill C-41 is an omnibus bill that updates sentencing 
practices. I applaud in particular the section dealing with the 
imposition of fines. Under the current law close to one-third of 
admissions to Ontario jails are for the nonpayment of fines. We 
have a ridiculous situation where in lieu of collecting a $200 
fine we end up spending thousands of dollars to jail the offender.
<P>
	For too long we have been incarcerating people for no other 
reason than their being poor. It is reminiscent of debtors prisons. 
Too many of our aboriginal people and too many of our 
economically disadvantaged people occupy our jails. This bill 
will address this injustice and will use community service work 
to replace costly incarceration.
<P>
	It is important when we talk of crime and justice issues to 
recognize that offenders and victims are people who come from 
communities and are not aliens from another planet. Solutions 
to issues of crime are complex and involve all segments of our 
society.
<P>
	Having reviewed the debates on Bill C-41, I am troubled by 
the simplistic solutions put forth by the Reform Party. It would 
have us believe that capital and corporal punishment along with 
longer prison sentences would produce a safer society in 
Canada. If the simplistic solutions dictated by the Reform Party 
had any basis in fact then I submit that the United States would 
be the safest society in the western world.
<P>
	We know and I am sure the Reform Party knows this is not the 
case. The United States has the highest crime rate and the most 
violent crimes in the western world. It executes and jails more 
people than any other in western society. Surely the Reform 
Party would not want to trade the safety of our streets in Canada 
for that of the United States.
<P>
	One of the biggest problems we have with the issue of crime is 
the perception created by the American and our own news 
media. They create a perception that in Canada we are living in a 
society where crime and violence are much more prevalent than 
the statistics indicate. Canada is not the United States.
<P>
<B>(1045 ) </B>
<P>
	Our society is much less crime infested than the United 
States. We do a disservice when we pander and reinforce 
misconceptions. I would suggest that the Reform Party is 
pandering to misconceptions. I would further suggest the debate 
on firearms we are engaged in today is driven by the images of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6822"> 6822 </A></B>
<P>
gun laws in the U.S., along with its horrendous crime statistics, 
rather than by the reality in Canada.
<P>
	There is no question that our justice system needs 
improvement, but in reality we have one of the best justice 
systems in the world. To continually attack the integrity of our 
justice system as the Reform Party does is to undermine it. If 
Canadians were to believe that our justice system does not work 
they would not report crimes and would not sit on juries. If the 
public is not supported the justice system breaks down.
<P>
	There is no question that one victim is one victim too many. 
The issue becomes how to keep our communities safe. There is 
no question that to deal with crime we have to make crime 
prevention and community safety everyone's concern.
<P>
	In the Waterloo region we have one of the safest communities 
in Canada and we do not rest on our laurels. We have established 
a regional committee on crime prevention and community 
safety that has two main mandates. The first is to mobilize the 
community to fight crime, for crime prevention is everyone's 
responsibility. The second is to deal with prevention through 
programs. We all know that a child who goes to school hungry or 
a child who is victimized is tomorrow's offender.
<P>
	The community in the Waterloo region, in co-operation with 
the provincial and federal governments, has to deal with this 
social reality. It is of interest that the strongest proponent of 
dealing with the root cause of crime on the Waterloo crime 
prevention and community safety committee representing a 
broad sector of our community is the police.
<P>
	There are no simple solutions to the problem of crime. To deal 
with crime we have to attack the root causes of crime and not 
just deal with symptoms. The answers to crime prevention lie at 
the level of individual communities where we work to enhance 
our own, our neighbour's and our community's safety. Crime 
and justice is a collective responsibility that we all share.
<P>
	Much of the debate on Bill C-41 centred on the clause of the 
bill dealing with an offence being motivated by bias, prejudice 
or hate based on the race, nationality, colour, religion, sex, age, 
mental or physical disability or sexual orientation of the victim. 
If the crime was based on any one of these points it shall be 
deemed to be aggravating circumstances in the case of 
sentencing.
<P>
	We have heard arguments that all crime should be treated the 
same. I cannot disagree in stronger terms. I am defending this 
clause because I believe if at any time somebody is attacked for 
no other reason than being part of a minority group, surely the 
law has to take a much stronger measure in preventing others 
from doing the same.
<P>
	It is imperative to remember that in the case of the Holocaust 
we had persecution on the basis of religion. It took six million 
deaths to raise consciousness with regard to this problem. I 
cannot understand how anybody could extend the clause of the 
bill which specifically talks about sentencing to talking about 
spousal support for homosexuals. It talks about someone being 
attacked for no other basis than sexual orientation, religion or 
nationality, and about the offender being more harshly dealt 
with.
<P>
	That is one of the more important clauses in the bill. I 
thoroughly support it. I regret some members of the House 
would have the public misinterpret what that clause says.
<P>
<B>(1050 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ron MacDonald (Dartmouth, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
very pleased I arrived on time from my riding to speak in this 
debate. It is a very important one that raises some fundamental 
questions about who we are as a nation, the values we hold dear, 
whether or not we are compassionate or just seek vengeance 
when we are wronged. It also says a great deal about the type of 
society we are trying to build for our children who, after all, are 
the people for whom we are holding the country in trust.
<P>
	Everybody has spoken about Bill C-41. They talked about all 
the major provisions of the bill. I am not going to attempt to go 
through them again. However there are a couple of provisions in 
the bill which I think the public in the riding of Dartmouth will 
be very pleased to hear about.
<P>
	During the election campaign law and order, whatever that 
means or whatever was the definition of the day, seemed to be 
the thing most people were concerned about. I knocked on doors 
and received calls from people concerned that the criminal 
justice system simply was not working. These people were not 
rednecks, right wingers or crazy people; they were concerned 
about the safety of their communities.
<P>
	Somewhere in the mix over the last number of years there has 
been a problem. The fundamental problem has come from the 
fact that when we came in with the Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms, which was a very bold initiative of the government of 
the day that was applauded by nearly all Canadians, it switched 
the pendulum over to individual rights and away from 
community rights. Indeed at times there are community rights 
which must be taken into consideration.
<P>
	How often have we heard individuals ask why it is always the 
rights of the individual who has broken the law, who has 
wronged the community, who has sought to injure an individual, 
steal their property or whatever, that are paramount and more 
heavily weighed than those of the victim?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6823"> 6823 </A></B>
<P>
	The bill deals with sentencing. It starts to address some of 
the real concerns expressed by Canadians. I am not going to 
indicate that I have done a study and that I understand or I know 
that the concern of Canadians about rising crime is founded in 
fact or not, because that simply does not matter. Everyone can 
quote statistics. The most recently quoted ones are that we are 
not becoming a more violent society and that crime rates are 
actually down. As a legislator I am concerned about the 
perception in my community that people are less safe today 
than they were 3, 5, 10 or 15 years ago.
<P>
	From time to time it is up to us as legislators to come forward 
to debate and try to figure out if the laws and the principles they 
were founded on, like the Young Offenders Act and some of the 
sentencing provisions in legislation, are actually attaining their 
goals and if they are not to try to change them. It does not mean 
we always have to respond to public opinion or that legislation 
should be a knee-jerk reaction. It should not be that at all. If 
members have their ears to the ground in their constituencies 
and if they strip away their partisan approach to public policy 
making, they can get a fairly good idea about what is in the 
public interest. Clearly some of the reforms in the bill are in the 
public interest.
<P>
	The optics of the bill have to be seen to be fair as well. One 
thing that disturbs me a great deal is the focus of the public eye, 
through the media and through members of this place and others 
in public, on a very specific provision of the bill. I am saddened 
that the level of debate on sentencing has fallen to whether or not 
individuals should be subject to harsher sentencing, or if the 
crimes they have perpetrated were against persons and based on 
hate then the judge should look at that provision. The debate 
being about whether or not any group in society is being 
conferred special rights does a great disservice to the level of 
debate that has taken place in the Chamber since Confederation.
<P>
	We are not here to respond to those who will slap us on the 
back when we make remarks either overtly or thinly veiled 
against minorities. The previous member who just spoke put it 
quite nicely. He referred to a tragic piece of history; he referred 
to the Holocaust and how in the minds of the people who 
supported the Nazi regime in Germany it was fine to 
discriminate based on a person's religion. It is not fine and if 
anybody thought it was, society has changed. It is not fine to 
discriminate against persons because of the colour of their skin.
<P>
<B>(1055) </B>
<P>
	I have the largest, oldest, indigenous black community in 
Canada. When I have an unemployment rate of 10 per cent in my 
riding, three miles away their unemployment rate is 48 per cent. 
I may not be able to prove it because there is systemic racism. I 
am sure if every employer were blind we would probably have a 
more even distribution of the unemployment load in my area.
<P>
	Any type of act predicated by hatred for a group based on 
whatever factor-if they have two green eyes, if they have an 
arm or two arms or one is shorter than the other, or if it is sexual 
orientation-has to be recognized as something that is not 
supported by the legislators and is not supported by the people 
of Canada.
<P>
	It has done a great disservice to the bill and to individuals who 
have been harmed far too often in the past by our refusal to 
discuss these issues as well as the issue of hate crimes in a full 
and unbiased atmosphere.
<P>
	A couple of things are not in the bill. We are talking about Bill 
C-41 and its impact on sentencing. We have heard of all the 
great things in the bill. There are a few things I think should be 
in there, and if they are not they should find their way into 
legislation.
<P>
	Unfortunately I live in an area that is now the pimping capital 
of Canada. In the riding of Dartmouth we lay claim-and we are 
not pleased with or proud of it-to probably the largest illegal 
pimping ring in Canada. It extends into the United States as 
well. That pimping ring has been going out and luring 
girls-and this is a victim crime-as young as 11 years of age 
into juvenile prostitution. They are luring them into illegal drug 
use and then into prostitution on the streets of New York, 
Niagara Falls, Toronto, Montreal, Ottawa, Vancouver, Halifax, 
Truro, and small towns near any of us.
<P>
	All too often very few of these girls are ever rescued. They are 
children. They are not adults who choose to get into this way of 
life. They are children who are literally stolen from our schools 
and off the streets. If they ever get out of the cycle of 
prostitution they are like walking zombies. They have no 
self-worth left. They are usually addicted to drugs and alcohol. 
They have no life ahead of them. Their lives are destroyed; their 
families' lives are destroyed.
<P>
	However, when we deal with sentencing in the law most of 
these guys get off with three to six months in jail. In Nova Scotia 
that means they go to a minimum security institution and three 
months later they walk out. They have not lost even one penny 
because one of their friends will have taken over their stable of 
young juvenile girls on the streets and they will still maintain 
the financial incentive to break the law.
<P>
	This has to stop. This is murder of the worst kind because the 
soul and the spirit of the child, of the woman, or the young girl 
are being killed, but she is not being killed physically. They are 
hollow empty vessels after these low life scum are finished with 
them. In our laws we most often treat that type of crime less 
seriously than if somebody absconds with $100,000 or $10,000 
from the Bank of Nova Scotia.
<P>
	Crimes against children when the sentencing comes down 
from the judge in a court of law in many cases are dealt with less 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6824"> 6824 </A></B>
<P>
harshly than crimes against property. That is simply wrong. For 
anyone who does not understand the full implication, there have 
been a number of articles written in <I>Chatelaine</I> and <I>Reader's 
Digest</I> in the last  number of months. This is one of the worst 
crimes that happens in Canada because it happens to defenceless 
children.
<P>
	I have spoken to the Minister of Justice a number of times and 
we could probably get support for one of the things I would have 
liked to have seen in the bill. If the government is not prepared at 
some point to deal with the issue then I am prepared to deal with 
the issue as a private member by putting a motion in the House.
<P>
	I am not one of those right wingers who believes we should 
lock everybody up; I am the exact opposite. This is one of the 
few crimes, I am told, where the length of sentence will be a 
deterrent. For crimes against our children like sexual crimes 
against our children the legislation should indicate the revulsion 
of Canadians and of legislators. There has to be tough minimum 
sentences. In my view not one of those pimps who destroy the 
lives of young girls should get out of jail before a five-year 
minimum sentence is carried out. If I had my druthers it would 
be a 10-year minimum sentence, but they are out in three 
months.
<P>
<B>(1100) </B>
<P>
	For everybody who is out there watching and listening to 
these debates, if they have a young daughter or granddaughter, if 
their neighbour has a 10, 11, 12 or 13 year old and they think 
they are safe when they are going to school, they are not. There 
are predators out there, predators our sentencing law does not 
protect our children against.
<P>
	Although I support this bill, I encourage members as I 
encourage the Minister of Justice, to be a little more bold. I ask 
the minister to bring legislation into the House as soon as he 
possibly can to deal with this most abhorrent crime of pimping 
juvenile women, juvenile girls, our children.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen (Windsor-St. Clair, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am very pleased to have the opportunity to speak on 
Bill C-41, a bill that fulfils yet another Liberal red book 
promise, sentencing reform within the criminal justice system.
<P>
	During the past election campaign there was great debate over 
public security. That debate raged in some quarters as a debate 
of extremes. Some of these extremes have found their way 
through the electoral process into the House, which is as it 
should be.
<P>
	The House, by its very nature and by its very culture, is a place 
of polar views and the residence of extremes, which are used 
sometimes as a vehicle for expressing opinion and as a vehicle 
for driving a point home. Other extreme views are strongly and I 
would suggest in some quarters unreasonably held.
<P>
	That is the great risk and quite frankly the great beauty of the 
democratic system. The views will be heard. The views will be 
challenged. The views will be studied. They will be agreed with 
or they will be discarded. As in the case of the 1993 election, 
there will be a predominant view in the House which will 
succeed. That was reflected in the election by our forming the 
government. There was a predominant view in the land and 
Canadians overwhelmingly elected the Liberal Party of Canada 
to govern. From this overwhelming support, we have as we must 
taken our mandate. It is a mandate for job creation, for tolerance 
among disparate groups. It is a mandate for economic growth 
and a mandate for safer streets through tough but humane 
measures that recognize the supremacy of the rule of law.
<P>
	It seems the charter has become inconvenient for some 
members of the House. The charter has become the subject of 
derision. The charter has become something for which some 
members have no respect.
<P>
	Since 1979 I have practised law in the criminal courts of 
Ontario. Since 1982 I have acted as a prosecutor for the crown 
attorney's office in Windsor and Essex county. Between 1986 
and 1988 I also served as a federal prosecutor. I know more than 
just a little about the subject matter in this debate.
<P>
	I have defended and I have prosecuted the criminal. I have 
done both successfully within the bounds of the rule of law and 
since 1982, when it was enacted, within the bounds of the 
charter. I have seen the system at its best. I have seen the guilty 
convicted and punished even though the charter was in place. I 
have also seen the not guilty walk away. Most times when this 
happens the rule of law and the charter have prevailed. It is a tool 
for democracy and a tool for democratic resolution of disputes. 
It is also a tool that applies fairness within the system.
<P>
	This bill is part of a fair, reasonable and responsible approach 
to the problems of public security that face our communities.
<P>
<B>(1105 ) </B>
<P>
	It is a bill that recognizes that intolerances exist in our 
society, intolerances that Canadians abhor. Sections which 
relate to hate crime and to crime arising out of hate recognize 
not special rights for individuals but recognize that our society 
abhors that kind of treatment of individuals. It is not there to 
create special rights for any given group and to provide excuses 
for individual behaviour. It is there because we as a society do 
not tolerate and promote hate. The bill has to be seen within the 
overall framework of Liberal philosophy and of the Liberal 
solutions to problems today.
<P>
	I would like to take a moment to reflect on some of the 
problems in our society other than the Criminal Code, other than 
the behaviour of prosecutors and other than what some think are 
the causes of crime.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6825"> 6825 </A></B>
<P>
	I suggest that what we should look at is crime as a part of 
the overall problems that plague our society. In the city of 
Windsor, part of which I represent, we have had an excellent 
recovery recently from the recession which has really wracked 
industrial Ontario and all parts of the country. Fortunately for 
Windsor our recovery has been on the leading edge of the 
recovery and has been quicker because of our excellent 
industrial base. We have found as we have begun to recover and 
as our unemployment rate has gone down that our crime rate 
has also gone down.
<P>
	I suggest that the Liberal red book and the current government 
policy which promote economic recovery, job creation and 
reforms will give people a dignified means to make a living and 
contribute to our society. This will interact with bills like Bill 
C-41 to reduce and to handle crime in a way that is healthy and 
productive within our society. I would also suggest that as the 
greater Canadian community prospers, we will see a related 
decrease in the types of social problems that plague us.
<P>
	No service is done to the community by firing the issue up to a 
point where it cannot be reasonably and responsibly addressed. 
No service is provided through disinformation to the electorate, 
through driving home a subject irresponsibly and emphasizing 
issues which serve only to inflame and frighten the citizenry 
without offering responsible solutions.
<P>
	Increasing penalties for crimes-in particular I am thinking 
of non-violent crimes, property related crimes, regulatory 
offences and the like-and increasing incarceration penalties 
for those types of crimes do nothing but increase the financial 
burden on our citizenry and force the government into the 
pocket of its citizens in terms of taxation which some people see 
as another form of criminal activity.
<P>
	I suggest that this bill addresses the financial bottom line in 
society in a very clear, creative and helpful fashion. It provides 
alternatives in terms of sentences which are based in the 
community so that offenders will be recognized as offenders. 
Offenders will be punished for their crimes and they will be 
rehabilitated within the community itself rather than being 
isolated and put into institutions which are phenomenally 
expensive to support.
<P>
<B>(1110 ) </B>
<P>
	On the other hand it takes a hard and I would suggest long 
awaited look at criminals whose activities are violent and 
extremely offensive to our citizens. By amending the parole 
section and by taking a good hard look at some of the sentencing 
problems that we have in our system for violent offenders, we 
are offering protection to our citizens where that protection is 
needed and where it is wanted.
<P>
	This bill takes a balanced view. This bill takes a humane view. 
This bill respects the rule of law. It is a statute that fits withinthe overall Liberal philosophy, the red book philosophy, which 
respects the citizenry, which  seeks to protect the citizenry and 
which seeks to elevate the quality of life for all Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Kingsway, N.D.P.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to rise during 
debate at second reading of Bill C-41, legislation which is a 
comprehensive package of amendments to the Criminal Code of 
Canada.
<P>
	I know that my constituents have a number of concerns about 
elements of the legislation. Because we are at this stage in 
second reading in which there are some 10 minutes remaining, I 
want to take this opportunity to focus on one particular 
provision of Bill C-41 which has been the subject of 
considerable debate and controversy.
<P>
	It is the provision of Bill C-41 that deals with the question of 
so-called hate crimes, crimes which are motivated by bias, 
prejudice or hate, and which are based on a number of criteria set 
out in Bill C-41. Those criteria include race, nationality, colour, 
religion, sex, age, mental or physical disability or sexual 
orientation of the victim.
<P>
	The question of the inclusion of sexual orientation of the 
victim has been the subject of some debate both inside and 
outside the House. I want to take a couple of minutes to explain 
why I believe it is profoundly important that sexual orientation 
be included in the hate crimes provisions of the bill.
<P>
	However, before I get to that specific subject, I want to note 
that the reference to hate motivation as a factor in sentencing 
already exists in the province of Ontario. The Ontario attorney 
general has directed crown attorneys to argue that sentencing 
should be increased when a crime is motivated by specific 
hatred. A number of guidelines are in place to guide the work of 
crown attorneys in this.
<P>
	I want to give a couple of examples of circumstances in which 
sentences have been increased because a crime has been 
motivated by hatred. Lelas was a case involving the desecration 
of synagogues. This crime was quite clearly motivated by 
hatred, by anti-Semitism, by the hatred of Jews. The Ontario 
Court of Appeal increased the sentence as a result of that. 
Another is the case of Moyer, a neo-Nazi skinhead who urinated 
on gravestones in a synagogue. This was considered as an 
aggravating factor in sentencing and the sentence was increased.
<P>
	There is the case of Hoolans who went to a so-called hate rock 
concert and was urged to go coon hunting at this concert. Well he 
did. He went out and beat to unconsciousness a Sri Lankan 
dishwasher. When the judge looked at sentencing for this 
particular crime, because the crime was clearly motivated by 
hatred on the basis of race, the sentence was increased.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6826"> 6826 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1115 ) </B>
<P>
	In that light I want to ask what are the implications of the 
argument of the member for Central Nova and other members of 
this House, including the members of the Reform Party? What 
are the arguments for excluding sexual orientation from Bill 
C-41?
<P>
	The arguments are very clear. They say that it is just and right 
and appropriate to increase sentences if a person is motivated by 
hatred on the basis of religion, race or sex, but it is not if you are 
motivated by hatred on the basis of sexual orientation. What 
kind of message would this House be sending to Canadian 
society if we accepted that message?
<P>
	Just last weekend in Toronto two men on a downtown street 
walking home from a cafe, the Second Cup coffee shop, were 
attacked. Six young men piled out of a van and beat up these two 
men with fists, boots, and beer bottles, right in the heart of 
downtown Toronto. As they beat them and injured them, in a 
pool of blood and broken glass they were calling them faggots. 
That is gay bashing. Gay bashing occurs tragically too often in 
my home community of Vancouver, in Toronto, Halifax, and 
New Glasgow, Nova Scotia, and in many other communities. It 
is not always bashing of people who are gay or lesbian. In some 
cases it is bashing people who are perceived to be gay or lesbian. 
They are not gay or lesbian at all but because these thugs, these 
people who are motivated by hatred, believe they are gay or 
lesbian they beat them.
<P>
	This legislation is saying that is wrong. It is saying that if we 
are to sentence people who are convicted of serious crimes of 
assault and other crimes and those people are motivated by 
hatred that judges should take that into consideration as an 
aggravating factor.
<P>
	Frankly, I am astonished that a party like the Reform Party 
which says it believes in law and order would not understand 
that importance. I am very surprised and very disappointed at 
that. I have to say I am even more disappointed in the position 
taken by the member for Central Nova and a number of other 
Liberal members of Parliament on this issue. That member has 
said that sexual orientation should be taken out of Bill C-41, not 
the other grounds in section 41, but sexual orientation.
<P>
	The implication and the message which is sent out by that is 
that it is okay. There is one standard if you beat up people based 
on race or religion and there is another standard if you beat up 
people based on sexual orientation. That is the message that 
goes out. If there is a different interpretation let her silent 
colleagues get up and say so. Let the member for Toronto stand 
up and say what he thinks about that kind of hateful language. 
That is what we are talking about here.
<P>
	In fact, even the vice president of the Central Nova Liberal 
riding association, Janet Rosenstock, has said she is opposed to 
the position taken by the MP for Central Nova in this debate. She 
said the legislation does not single out sexual orientationany more than it does  physical disability. It does not give 
special rights to gays or any other groups. That is the vice 
president of the riding association of Central Nova. She says, 
and perhaps Liberal members might find this interesting, that in 
its simplest terms if the hated are not named specifically 
prosecution of hate crimes is virtually impossible.
<P>
<B>(1120 ) </B>
<P>
	We in this House want to send a very clear and strong signal 
that we believe that prosecution of hate crimes must not only be 
possible but must be vigorously enforced. That is the message 
we want to send out.
<P>
	I urge members of this House to support this legislation. I urge 
members of this House to recognize that this is an issue of 
fundamental justice. It is not an issue of any kind of special 
rights or treatment. I urge that that be recognized.
<P>
	To those who say it is necessary to somehow define sexual 
orientation, I have something to share with them. Sexual 
orientation has been in legislation in this country for a number 
of years. There has been absolutely no need to define it to avoid 
abuses.
<P>
	I appeal to members of this House to support this provision. 
Recognize that to do otherwise would be to send out a message 
of intolerance, a message which this House surely does not want 
to send to the people of this country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leonard Hopkins (Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this bill goes a long way to improving our 
criminal justice system. Yes, it will be debated pro and con.
<P>
	Moves must be made. We as a Liberal Party made these 
commitments during the last election campaign and we will 
carry them out. Improvement in the way sentences of probation 
are decided in the courts and handled in the community for 
example by specifying the information that should be in a 
presentence report and increasing the penalties for offenders 
who break the conditions of their probation are a very important 
part of the provisions in this proposed legislation.
<P>
	We know that during probation period many people have not 
been apprehended, could not be apprehended and went on to 
commit other crimes. The streets in this country have to be made 
safe. The communities across this country, rural and urban, have 
to be made safe. There has to be respect for decency and law and 
order.
<P>
	Canada is looked upon throughout the world as a very 
civilized, law-abiding and internationally interested partner on 
the international scene. It is this government's aim to bring that 
respect to the legal system, the parole system and the justice 
system in general in Canada.
<P>
	There have been horror tales in the media and for just cause 
over the last number of years. The decay of any system must be 
stopped. We must put in its place the barriers and the inhibitions 
that are necessary for that to happen.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6827"> 6827 </A></B>
<P>
	There also has to be a change in the treatment of these people. 
We are not going to gain anything by simply throwing people 
in jail for long terms. They are going to come out the same as 
they were before, or worse. This point has been argued time 
and time again.
<P>
	It is going to be very important that there be proper liaison 
among the national Department of Health, the justice system 
and health ministers across this country to make sure that people 
in prison are treated so that when they do get out they are not a 
threat to society. If they are not ready to be released, they should 
not be released. That has to be a reality in our justice system.
<P>
<B>(1125 ) </B>
<P>
	We heard of the person who a few years ago was stopped at the 
Canada-U.S. border at Niagara Falls by American customs 
people and turned over to Canadian authorities. The Canadian 
police were notified but nothing could be done under the then 
legal system because the person had committed no offence. That 
person committed two murders before being apprehended in 
London, Ontario. He ended up shooting himself. In the interim 
he had shot two women in the head.
<P>
	These things have to receive as serious attention as the crime 
itself. If a person is breaking parole or is out on bail, they must 
be monitored. One iota of disobedience to the bail and parole 
system must be cause for apprehension. That individual should 
be taken into custody so that he or she will not commit other 
crimes.
<P>
	The Government of Canada in co-operation with the 
provincial governments must be absolutely serious about 
putting these new rules into the system. They may never be 
enough so amendments must follow to tighten up the system and 
protect the public. There is no way in a growing society that we 
can allow these offences and unsafe conditions to continue.
<P>
	We have seen examples from around the world where growth 
in the areas of crime and the justice system have been handled 
badly. They ended up with the problems they have today for 
example in Chicago, New York, and other major cities across the 
United States, as well as in England and other countries. We as a 
nation that has grown rapidly in population over the last 20 years 
cannot go in the same direction.
<P>
	The justice and legal system must serve the safety of the 
citizens of this nation today, tomorrow and on into the future. A 
mentality must be built up whereby we will not allow any 
decline in the safety of today's citizens or future citizens of this 
country. Canada can indeed be recognized around the world not 
only as an internationally caring country but as a nation that 
pays great attention to the safety and well-being of all its 
citizens.
<P>
	A big challenge, yes. A big start here, yes. It must be 
continued. We must work on new ideas, a vision of building a 
nation that is safe and respected and will carry  on with the 
qualities that our forebears wanted for Canada.
<P>
<B>(1130 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
intervention in this debate today is going to be relatively short 
but I hope important.
<P>
	I would like to caution the government, the minister, the 
committee about the danger of some of the aspects of this 
particular bill. I want to use a specific example which came to 
mind when I was listening to the debates.
<P>
	I was thinking of little Randy. Randy was a young boy about 
two years old who lived for a while with a very close member of 
our family as a foster child. In order to reunite him with his 
sister, he and his sister were adopted by a couple. Imagine how 
shocked we were when we heard that Randy and his sister and 
their adoptive mother had been murdered. It really hurt our 
hearts. I can hardly speak of it now without the emotion of that 
occasion returning.
<P>
	One of the things in this bill is the government proposal to get 
into the mind of the perpetrator of the crime to find out what 
motivated him. We really do not know what motivated the 
person who did that evil deed.
<P>
	I am greatly offended when I stop to contemplate that 
someone would venture to say that a person took the life of 
another person simply because he had a different coloured skin, 
simply because he had a different religious background, simply 
because he had a different sexual orientation. If that could be 
proven and that person is now subject to a more harsh sentence 
than the person who took the lives of Randy, his sister and his 
mother, leaving that husband and father bereaved in that way, I 
am deeply offended.
<P>
	I believe this government makes a colossal error by starting to 
say that we are going to base sentencing on what we think was in 
the mind of the person.
<P>
	I would like to also say something with respect to sexual 
orientation. The hon. member has talked about that. He has 
added to what other people have said imputing somehow to the 
members of the Reform Party an improper motivation, which I 
think is against the rules of the House in any case. He has said 
that we somehow hate these people because we are talking about 
these ideas.
<P>
	Again, I have some level of resentment being told that I 
cannot openly and honestly debate an issue without getting into 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6828"> 6828 </A></B>
<P>
name calling. That is wrong. I believe we ought to have total 
freedom of speech in this place particularly if we are going to be 
able to debate and to bring in laws which are absolutely the best 
for the future of this country and for its citizens.
<P>
	I do not know how to communicate to the member and to all 
the members of that community that we do not hate them. A 
friend of mine was of that particular orientation. His funeral was 
this year. The hon. member can say that I hate homosexuals and 
he is totally wrong. In the case of this friend of mine who died 
this year of AIDS I know and every thinking person in Canada 
knows that if he would have behaved sexually he would not have 
had that disease.
<P>
	I would like to promote very simply that what we need to do in 
this country is promote sexual fidelity. We need to promote a 
lifestyle which is healthy, right and good. In no way should we 
be promoting a lifestyle which has such dangers, even according 
to what the Minister of Health has said in this House.
<P>
<B>(1135) </B>
<P>
	I would like to urge all of the members of this community to 
recognize that we are trying to do what is right, we are trying to 
do what is good. To legitimize the homosexual lifestyle in this 
way is a wrong direction.
<P>
	Further to that, it is again misguided. I remember when I was a 
young man. Members should all recognize looking at me 
sideways now that I have a propensity for a little wider girth than 
others. I have had that all my life. I was some 180 pounds when I 
was in grade 8. I remember coming into the big city school as a 
farm kid from Saskatchewan. One day some of the mean city 
kids beat me up. The best I know the reason was that they were 
taunting me for being fat and then they proceeded to beat me up. 
It was not a happy experience. It was many years ago and I still 
remember it. It was a traumatic event.
<P>
	By the same token, I do not believe that any citizen in this 
country for any reason whatsoever should be subject to being 
beaten up. It is my understanding that there are laws in place 
right now which would provide for punishment for people who 
do things like that. I submit to the different people who are 
classified specifically in this Bill C-41 proposal that they are 
already included. If you are beaten up the person who did it 
should be found and punished in a substantial way so that there 
is a deterrent to this type of thing.
<P>
	I think we should simply say, as the Reform Party always 
says, a good country, our nation is going to be strong if we can 
come to the place where we treat our citizens equally without 
regard to how they are classified into subgroups, without regard 
to what race they belong to, without regard to whether they are 
male or female, without regard to any of these other 
classifications.
<P>
	I implore, I beg, I plead for the minister and the committee to 
think very carefully of the implications that are being included 
in the proposal that is being given here.

	The House resumed from October 3 consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-53, an act to establish the Department of 
Canadian Heritage and to amend and repeal certain other acts, be 
read the second time and referred to a committee; and of the 
amendment.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Albina Guarnieri (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of The Department of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to rise today in the House 
to speak in support of Bill C-53, an act to establish the 
Department of Canadian Heritage.
<P>
	Over the past few months it has been my privilege as 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Canadian Heritage to 
work closely with him in advancing the department's initiatives 
on many fronts. I have had occasion to journey to the farthest 
reaches of our department's operations, visiting and consulting 
with local officials and community groups. Most striking among 
my findings was the intense enthusiasm of our Department of 
Canadian Heritage personnel whose zeal I am sure is fueled by 
the value they attach to their work.
<P>
	The Department of Canadian Heritage is not some distant or 
insulated agency. It is an active participant in countless commu-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6829"> 6829 </A></B>
<P>
nities. In a real sense the department is a large part what makes 
many towns and cities into strong communities, very often the 
focal point, the gathering ground for communities, events or 
institutions  that might not exist were it not for the support of the 
ministry.
<P>
	From museums, parks and orchestras to sporting and 
multicultural events, literally millions of Canadians are 
attracted to our programs every year. The Department of 
Canadian Heritage is the guardian of our inheritance as 
Canadians. This department, this minister, stands at the gate 
protecting rich and unique elements of our culture, our vast 
stretches of unspoiled habitat, national historic sites, buildings 
and monuments, which offer Canadians a glimpse of the 
struggles that built this country.
<P>
	The Department of Canadian Heritage is the protector of our 
artistic tradition, our sporting tradition, our official languages, 
the multitude of contributing cultures from our native citizens to 
the newest Canadian.
<P>
	This is not a department which regulates a commodity. Our 
product is a better Canada, enriched with its natural and historic 
treasures.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Up to now, the debate taking place in the House has 
highlighted a number of interesting points, not the least of which 
being the diversity of programs administered by the new 
department.
<P>
	Bill C-53 reflects very well the mandate sought by Heritage 
Canada and the scope of its field of endeavour. Although this has 
been mentioned by others, I should repeat that Heritage Canada 
incorporates programs from five existing or abolished 
departments.
<P>
	It is easy for some to say that these programs have little in 
common, but this is a very superficial way of seeing things. A 
more thorough examination reveals that the three main areas of 
activity in the department have a lot in common, and I will come 
back to that later. More than that, they mesh very well and 
contribute to the prime goal of the department which is 
developing Canadian identity centres and encouraging the 
contribution of all sectors of society to the growth and vitality of 
our culture.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	One of the major sectors of the Department of Canadian 
Heritage is Parks Canada, formerly a part of Environment 
Canada. National parks, national historic sites and the historic 
canals under the stewardship of Parks Canada represent some of 
the best examples of Canada's natural and cultural heritage. 
These gems are to be found in every region of the country. The 
economic activity and tourism generated by the department's 
operations in this program area are of vital significance to many 
local economies.
<P>
<B>(1145) </B>
<P>
	The parks service is mindful of its importance to these 
communities and has been at the forefront of efforts to fashion 
innovative partnership arrangements with private and not for 
profit enterprises in carrying out its mandated responsibilities.
<P>
	The second major sector of the department encompasses those 
programs which are aimed at the promotion of Canadian identity 
and civic participation. As one would expect with such a broadly 
based mandate, this sector includes an impressive sweep of 
program areas. In fact some of the government's most important 
initiatives are being implemented in this sector. They include 
the promotion of official languages, the pursuit of excellence in 
amateur sport, the promotion of our cultural diversity, and the 
encouragement of the full and open participation of every 
Canadian in society.
<P>
	Here then are the programs that speak to us regarding what it 
means to be Canadian, that set us apart from the rest of the 
world, and that have helped Canada earn its top ranking by the 
United Nations for overall quality of life.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The third main activity of the department is cultural 
development and heritage. This includes arts, broadcasting and 
heritage preservation, as well as cultural industries like film, 
video, sound recording and publishing.
<P>
	As regards the wide variety of activities involved, the best 
way to describe them is to quote the short statement in the 
government's red book on the importance of culture. Here it is: 
``Culture is the very essence of national identity, the bedrock of 
national sovereignty and national pride. At a time when 
globalization and the information and communications 
revolution are erasing national borders, Canada needs more than 
ever to commit itself to cultural development''.
<P>
	This shows not only the importance of the department's 
programs, but also stresses what its prime objective should be: 
To develop policies and mechanisms to ensure a steady growth 
of artistic and cultural sectors both strong and dynamic.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	During debate on the bill we have heard the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage outline the important connotations imparted 
by the term heritage. For me one of the most meaningful uses of 
the term is to capture myriad ways in which we express 
ourselves not only to our fellow Canadians but to the world. In 
my view heritage conveys the idea of the link between the past 
and the present in matters of human endeavour, whether they be 
related to culture, language, shared values or common 
experiences.
<P>
	When I think of Canada and its heritage what springs to mind 
is a nation forged on the principles of respect for the use and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6830"> 6830 </A></B>
<P>
equal treatment of its two major languages, French and English; 
of respect for the cultural diversity,  the traditions and the 
contributions of its aboriginal citizens and their languages; and 
of fundamental respect for basic human rights and values and an 
all encompassing and abiding devotion to democratic 
principles. It is no exaggeration to say that all these sentiments 
and ideals will find expression and action within the programs 
embodied within the Department of Canadian Heritage.
<P>
	It is vital not to lose sight of what will be accomplished by the 
passage of Bill C-53. Moreover the bill should not be viewed in 
isolation. It is part of a greater reorganization of government 
being effected through the passage of various pieces of enabling 
legislation now in different stages of parliamentary review.
<P>
	This redistribution of programs and responsibilities, as we are 
all aware, had its origin in steps taken by the previous 
government last June. The current government has put its stamp 
on the reorganization, redefined it and refined it. We are now 
proceeding with the task of confirming these changes in law.
<P>
<B>(1150) </B>
<P>
	This exercise, however, is but one component of our overall 
effort to provide Canadians with the most effective and open 
government possible. Toward that end it should be emphasized 
that the government's program review is ongoing and that the 
tabling of the various pieces of enabling legislation is part of the 
process.
<P>
	The wording of Bill C-53 establishes the overall 
responsibilities of the Department of Canadian Heritage without 
being prescriptive as to how the mandate will be delivered. In 
other words the bill does not limit the types of changes that 
government may implement to make services more responsive 
and efficient in the current fiscal context.
<P>
	The enactment of the bill will summon the coming wave of 
re-engineering efforts in the department that can only yield 
even greater efficiencies and more focused services. We must 
not allow Canada to grow pale from the leaching of its natural 
and cultural resources. We believe in a Canada infused by the 
advancement of our sense of Canadian identity and participation 
as a society and by the continuation of our cultural development 
and the protection of our priceless natural and cultural heritage.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, B.Q.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I wish to congratulate my colleague for her 
presentation, which could not be any clearer or more interesting.
<P>
	With regard to her quote from the red book about culture 
being really important, why did the Liberal government not take 
this opportunity to establish a department that could have been
<P>
called something other than the Department of Canadian 
Heritage? I, for one, would have called it the department of tutti 
frutti, since it includes a little of everything whether or not it 
belongs  there. So why not give us a department other than this 
one?
<P>
	Why did the Liberal government not take this opportunity to 
do the right thing? When they were in opposition, they criticized 
the Conservatives for creating such a department; now that they 
are in office, they do the exact same thing the tories did.
<P>
	How is it possible, now that the information highway is just 
around the corner, that no mechanism has been provided for in 
the Department of Canadian Heritage to deal with this subject, 
that there is no regulatory power over the information highway, 
that telecommunications remain separate from 
communications, that the CRTC will continue to be split 
between culture and industry, and that we will never be able to 
resolve copyright issues because this government lacks courage 
once again and does what others did before it? It must go back to 
the drawing board. How can they justify this according to the 
Liberal party's philosophy? I wonder.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Guarnieri:</B> Mr. Speaker, the Bloc Quebecois complaints 
only make the achievements and importance of Canadian 
heritage stand out. We often hear that Canadian culture belongs 
to all Canadians wherever they come from. I think the hon. 
member should be the first one to admit that we save taxpayers, 
including Quebecers, money. She should applaud us instead of 
criticizing us because we do not do exactly what she wants. The 
Bloc's goals are different from those of the department.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay:</b> What are the Bloc's goals?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Guarnieri:</B> You do not understand me? She wants me to 
speak in English. But I want to practice my French but, as you 
can see, she will not give me this opportunity.
<P>
<B>(1155) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order! I would like to 
remind you that comments must be made through the Chair and 
not directly from one member to another. You can use the 
official language of your choice.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Guarnieri:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to reassure the hon. 
member that Canadian culture belongs to all Canadians 
wherever they come from. I read the hon. member's speech and I 
am surprised by her suggestion. She proposes that francophones 
be confined to local cultural resources only.
<P>
	I want to add that Canada's culture and history were built by 
all Canadians together. Sharing our culture and history is the 
basis of Canadian heritage. It is easy to see why the Bloc 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6831"> 6831 </A></B>
<P>
Quebecois is against our goal. I think that Quebecers and 
Canadians agree with us.
<P>
	When the hon. member talks about telecommunications 
coming under the purview of the Department of Industry, is she 
aware of the growing role of telecommunications as an 
important source of Canadian economic activities? 
Broadcasting is easier to integrate into the mandate of Canadian 
Heritage, as it relates to Canadian culture, identity and content.
<P>
	Departments work in close co-operation-and I think the 
hon. member will agree with this-in order to manage these 
sectors efficiently. I wonder why the hon. member is laughing, 
when she should be applauding us for saving Canadians, 
including Quebecers, money. I think that she should be 
applauding.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
hon. parliamentary secretary was talking about looking for ways 
to cut spending in government. I would like to offer one right 
now.
<P>
	The department of multiculturalism is redundant. Not only do 
Canadians not want to see a department of multiculturalism but 
people in various multicultural communities around the country 
do not want to see it. I refer to a recent article in <I>Saturday Night</I> 
magazine wherein noted Canadian writer Neil Bissoondath 
talked about doing away with the whole idea of 
multiculturalism. He happens to come from the West Indies, but 
he is a Canadian writer and that is what he calls himself.
<P>
	There are people in the Liberal caucus who say we must do 
away with hyphenated Canadianism. I urge the parliamentary 
secretary to use her influence on the minister, in conjunction 
with other members of caucus who feel the same way, to do away 
with the department of multiculturalism which is absolutely and 
completely redundant in the eyes of the Reform Party, many 
Liberals, the Canadian public and the ethnic communities 
around the country.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Guarnieri:</B> Mr. Speaker, I sometimes feel the Reform 
Party should be called the 1 per cent party because it spends all 
its time criticizing 1 per cent of the government programs.
<P>
	The government believes in communities, strong linkages 
among communities and promoting understanding from 
wherever people come. The government is committed to 
pursuing programs which foster understanding and harmony.
<P>
	However it is a dark day for members of the Reform Party; 
they should be promoting and endorsing the bill. How does the 
opposition permit itself to criticize an administrative change 
that saves all kinds of moneys for taxpayers and actually reduces 
bureaucracy? The number of assistant deputy ministers has been 
reduced from 14 to 3. It increases efficiency. Actually the 
administrative cost savings will be $7.3 million. They may scoff 
at that, but it is $7.3 million of Canadian taxpayers' money. 
Members of the Bloc and Reform should unite and applaud us 
for this initiative rather than indulging in  tangential tirades 
about programs. These improvements would actually increase 
efficiency. It should leave the Reform speechless but they prefer 
to remain groundless rather than speechless.
<P>
<B>(1200) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, that was an interesting 
exchange. I rise to oppose Bill C-53 because it affirms the 
continuation of officially sanctioned multiculturalism. It 
encourages division along racial, linguistic and cultural lines.
<P>
	We are going to continue to have anglo Canadians, French 
Canadians, native Canadians, Chinese Canadians and a host of 
other hyphenated nationalities, but apparently no plain, 
ordinary Canadians. John Diefenbaker must be spinning in his 
grave.
<P>
	It is ironic that a department dedicated to ``the preservation 
and enhancement of Canadian heritage'' should be charged with 
state sponsored multiculturalism. This is a contradiction in 
terms.
<P>
	For generations Statistics Canada, which used to be called the 
Dominion Bureau of Statistics, has been obsessed with our 
ethnic origins. Until fairly recently one could not even if born in 
Canada be recorded by the census taker as a Canadian. Ottawa 
now accepts the reality that we Canadians exist. However the 
1991 handbook for census takers assures us that they must 
continue to inquire into the racial origins of our ancestors, again 
I quote: ``to ensure that everyone, regardless of his or her 
cultural background, has equal opportunity to share fully in the 
economic, social, cultural and political life of Canada''.
<P>
	I am not sure what that pretentious bureaucrat slop means but 
one interpretation could be this. The government wants to know 
where the money should be sent to buy votes, where to distribute 
the pork and how to tailor certain government policies to 
appease voters whose first loyalty is still to the old country.
<P>
	The Liberals and the scattered remnants of the other two 
traditional parties endorse official multiculturalism. This 
foolishness began with the racially and linguistically biased 
concept that Canada is a coming together of two founding 
nations, French and English. This understandably irritated 
native Indians, western Canadians of Ukrainian ancestry, 
Newfoundlanders whose ancestors were here centuries ago and 
just about everyone else. As a pedigreed Heinz 57 Canadian I 
was a little ticked myself.
<P>
	To resolve the problem it was ordained that everyone belongs 
to a distinct subspecies of homo-Canadiansis, another of the 
Trudeau government's wonderful legacy of destructive policies. 
The maintenance of ancestral culture should be a matter of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6832"> 6832 </A></B>
<P>
personal choice at one's own expense. That would be 
commendable.
<P>
	What we do not need are federal politicians saying: ``Here is 
money to preserve and promote the cultures of the societies 
which your ancestors wished to escape from''. This is an 
absolutely immoral abuse of the power of taxation.
<P>
	It is the Reform Party's position that official multiculturalism 
is a divisive force that encourages ghettoization and wastes our 
tax dollars to do it-$25 million last year. This annual slush 
fund is doled out to hundreds and hundreds of entities without 
justification.
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	Why for example should the various Ukrainian committees 
get hundreds of thousands of dollars in public funding? If they 
want to dance the prysyadka, more power to them. They are 
better men than I, but why should I help to pay for their 
athletics? Most of them are at least fifth generation Canadians. 
The first and second generations living in rude cabins in 
northern Alberta and Saskatchewan got all the exercise they 
needed clearing land and working away from home to earn a 
little hard cash. They prospered, helped to build a nation and 
preserved their language and culture with no help from anyone.
<P>
	Four years ago I spoke at a Reform Party organizational 
meeting at a hamlet north of Yorkton, Saskatchewan. The 
meeting was held in the Ukrainian hall, a 70-year old building 
made from hand hewn logs, nicely finished and decorated with 
icons, scrolls and pictures of patriarchs. No civil servant had had 
a hand in it. That is multiculturalism.
<P>
	Why do the descendants of these Ukrainian settlers have their 
hands out now? I suspect it is because they see everyone else 
lining up for grants. Being practical people they want some of 
the action.
<P>
	According to clause 7(a) of the bill the minister may provide 
financial assistance in the form of grants, contributions and 
endowments to any person. That is outrageous. One of the 
principal functions of Parliament is the approval of 
appropriations. This legislation gives the minister, in other 
words the bureaucrats, carte blanche to give away money 
without even cabinet oversight.
<P>
	The long list of grants to cosy little social and cultural 
organizations contains such gems as $12,000 to the Icelandic 
League-more fifth generation Canadians-to finance a 
convention; $22,575 to the Institution of Ethnic Minority 
Writing; $72,000 to the National Council of Canadian Filipino 
Associations-we are going to dance the tinikiling 
too-$20,000 to the Multicultural History Society of Ontario. 
Here is a beauty: $19,254 to the Lu Hanessian Productions: Love 
Notes, to produce a musical review of 27 songs and musical 
vignettes about human relationships.
<P>
	The government has apparently become a little sensitive 
about these long lists of grants that appear in newspapers. More 
and more of this stuff is being camouflaged in grants to umbrella 
groups like the  Canadian Council for Multiculturalism 
Intercultural Education, $205,000; the Cross Cultural 
Communications Centre, $114,000.
<P>
	I have been thinking of organizing a club for my particular 
ethnic group. I will call it the Mixed Origins Line Dancing 
Association for the Genetically Challenged. That should be 
good for a grant of at least $100,000, provided I make the 
application in a red envelope.
<P>
	I grew up in an ethnically diverse community. All of western 
Canada had been ethnically diverse for generations, when 
Toronto was still a WASP enclave where on Sundays travellers 
could starve or die of thirst right on Yonge Street. Times have 
changed; I will not pretend that we lived in a sea of brotherly 
love. Every group felt superior to some other group, but we got 
along. We were glued together by a common language, shared 
history, the adverse conditions of that time and place and, above 
all, by a lot of intermarriage.
<P>
<B>(1210) </B>
<P>
	Now the federal government by stressing diversity instead of 
human commonality is weakening that glue and it is weakening 
the social fabric of our nation. Ghettoization is in; adaptation to 
new surroundings is out. Why learn the language and social 
customs of your adopted country when you can hide in an 
enclave from which emissaries are sent out every day to come 
back with sustenance and interface with the wicked outside 
world.
<P>
	Every few years a politician will stop in your community, 
figuratively pat people on the head and patronizingly solicit 
your votes as a vehicle to combat racism or preserve cultural 
diversity.
<P>
	Now lest any hon. member dismiss my deeply held 
convictions on this matter as the insensitive views of one white 
guy in a suit, somebody who does not understand, I would like to 
conclude my remarks by quoting a few recent immigrants.
<P>
	Dr. Rais Khan is a very wise new Canadian who heads the 
department of political science at the University of Manitoba. A 
couple of years ago he was guest speaker at the Reform Party 
assembly in Winnipeg. I would like to quote some of his remarks 
verbatim. He said: ``I did not come here to be labelled as an 
ethnic or as a member of the multicultural community or to be 
coddled with preferential treatment, nurtured with special 
grants and then sit on the sidelines and watch the world go by''. 
Later in the same speech, he said: ``If I want to preserve my 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6833"> 6833 </A></B>
<P>
cultural heritage, that is my business. If I want to invite you into 
my home to eat some spicy traditional food, that is our business. 
If I expect you to pay for my cultural activities, that is your 
business''.
<P>
	Bharati Mukherjee, a writer who emigrated to Canada from 
India, felt marginalized here. She blamed Canada's obsession 
with multiculturalism for making her a psychological 
expatriate, so she moved to the United States after being here for 
15 years. She says that Canada has chosen to be a mosaic but by 
preserving differences it also preserves bias.
<P>
	One of the most eloquent opponents of multiculturalism is Al 
Meghji, a professor of law at Dalhousie University. I believe he 
is Canadian born but in the eyes of the multiculturalists he is an 
Indo-Canadian whose fragile identity must be preserved from 
the dark forces of assimilation. I will quote him at some 
considerable length.
<P>
	He states: ``Multiculturalism undermines the efforts of those 
who are seeking to forge a national identity and prevent the 
disintegration of an already fragile nation. Whatever the 
purpose of multicultural policy, the net result is that it highlights 
and accentuates differences among Canadians. What is needed 
is not a policy that emphasizes differences but one that promotes 
common goals and nationally shared values while at the same 
time allowing the expression of individual identity''.
<P>
	I have one last name on my list. He has been previously 
mentioned. I would like to quote him at a little more length. Neil 
Bissoondath is a prominent Trinidad born Canadian author. 
Some of you may have read his collection of short stories 
<I>Digging Up the Mountain</I>. He was a darling of the chattering 
classes until he had the temerity to question the doctrine of 
official multiculturalism. Now he is in big trouble for saying 
things like multiculturalism is a policy that seeks merely to keep 
a diverse population amenable to political manipulation.
<P>
<B>(1215 ) </B>
<P>
	A very prominent and very white chatterer who is well known 
to most of us in this House has asked a snide question. Now he 
wants to reject his brothers, his sisters, his nieces, his nephews. 
So much for politically correct tolerance.
<P>
	It is the responsibility of government not to encourage 
immigrant people to maintain their separateness but to help 
them, especially through language courses to integrate into 
Canadian society. Even that would be more than the old timers 
got. They put down their roots, helped each other and thanked 
the stars that they had arrived here. Their children became 
unhyphenated Canadians through their own efforts and now this 
government like those that have preceded it for the last 20 years 
is trying to rehyphenate their great grandchildren. You cannot 
bind a nation together with hyphens.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morris Bodnar (Saskatoon-Dundurn, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened with great interest to the speech of the hon. 
member for Swift Current-Maple Creek especially with 
respect to his comments dealing with the Ukrainian community 
in Saskatchewan. I am one of that community and my hand has 
never been out for any moneys from any group for funding for 
any of the cultural events that either I or any of my children have 
attended and continue to attend.
<P>
	In particular in Saskatchewan we have groups such as the 
Hutterites who came from Europe to escape both language and 
religious oppression. They were hard working people who came 
to Canada to preserve their religious beliefs and language.
<P>
	Can the hon. member tell us whether these individuals are 
objecting to integration into Canadian society? Should they be 
treated in some different manner to prevent them from being 
able to live in communities on their own where they preserve 
their language and their religion and are not integrating into 
society? The speech seemed to indicate that they should. This 
applies not only to the Hutterite communities but to the 
Mennonite communities, et cetera.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
very astute observations. I applaud him for not participating in 
riding the gravy train. He probably noticed that I was looking 
right at him when I made that portion of my speech.
<P>
	With respect to the Hutterian Brethren, I do not think there is 
any contradiction when I say that I have no problem with their 
continuing to live their lives apart from Canadian society the 
way they do. The reason is that they do this entirely with their 
own resources. They are not subsidized. They are not getting 
part of that $25 million a year. They do not have civil servants 
coming around telling them: ``Fellows, have we got a deal for 
you''. They are very independent people. There are several of 
their colonies in my constituency and I have no problem with 
that at all. I have problems with the other things I mentioned.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have two questions. I listened to the hon. member and 
I find myself in accord with some of his remarks and in 
disagreement with others.
<P>
	When he talks about rejecting multicultural policy, is he not 
really talking about rejecting a kind of implementation of it? I 
take it the hon. member is not really against multiculturalism. 
He is against a multiculturalism policy which tends to divide us 
rather than unite us. If I understand the member correctly, he 
still is in favour of our multiethnic nature as a country.
<P>
<B>(1220) </B>
<P>
	I have also been looking at the grants issue to various ethnic 
groups and I have found during the last government a correlation 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6834"> 6834 </A></B>
<P>
between payments to ethnic groups and election years in which 
the actual payments increased.
<P>
	Would he care to comment on those two points?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
comments. I will go to the bottom first and work back up.
<P>
	I am aware of those figures. I had intended to mention them in 
my speech but through oversight I did not, and I thank him for 
bringing that to the attention of the House.
<P>
	I know that this is by its very nature a multiethnic society. 
There will be people who will be assimilated quickly into a 
melting pot, as they call it south of the border. There will be 
others, like the Hutterian Brethren, who will maintain their 
individuality for generations.
<P>
	As long as this is done as a matter of free individual choice, 
neither I nor my party has any difficulty with it. The magic 
words are free individual choice. Do it on your own folks. Do not 
expect me to pay for it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Gallaway (Sarnia-Lambton, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I speak to the House today as one who supports Bill 
C-53.
<P>
	Today I would like to speak in a comparative fashion 
concerning the comments made by the hon. member for 
Kootenay East before the House broke for the recess. At that 
time he proposed that national parks be removed from the 
Department of Canadian Heritage and put into the Department 
of the Environment. In reviewing his comments I fail to 
understand the rationale.
<P>
	He stated that he has, in a very anecdotal way, some 
experience with national parks, as his riding contains three of 
them. In his specific examples of concerns he spoke only to one 
environmental situation, namely the difficulties of maintaining 
naturally evolving forests. The remaining issues he mentioned 
dealt with maintenance of highways, user fees, enterprise units, 
hiring practices and office locations. I would suggest that these 
are administrative as opposed to environmental issues.
<P>
	Nevertheless there are undeniably important links to be 
maintained with Environment Canada in the science and 
research sectors as they relate to national heritage exemplified 
in the national parks system. This is being accomplished now 
through a memorandum of understanding between the two 
departments. Specific areas of interest include membership on 
the science committee on participation, the biodiversity strategy 
and the protected areas strategy, all of which are multilateral 
initiatives involving a wide range of government departments.
<P>
	The Department of Canadian Heritage is both the client 
department of Environment Canada and a leader on specific 
issues such as the protected areas strategy in the same way that 
other departments such as fisheries and oceans are both clients 
and leaders on specific environmental issues. This sharing of 
responsibilities among departments not only focuses the right 
kinds of expertise on the right issues, but in the case of Canadian 
heritage adds an extra supporting voice at the cabinet table for 
dealing with them.
<P>
	Parks Canada is an organization that comprises 
responsibilities for both the natural and the cultural heritage of 
our country and has done so under many different names and 
departments since 1919. It has, quite simply, a natural and a 
cultural component that are not mutually exclusive.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Nationally and internationally, efforts are being made to 
recognize that history, culture and nature are interdependent. 
This is largely reflected in the UNESCO Convention on the 
protection of natural heritage and world culture, which he 
represents as the minister responsible for Parks Canada.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As the new Department of Canadian Heritage includes the 
bulk of natural cultural programs over and above those within 
Parks Canada, there is a unification of that element of our 
national and international responsibilities.
<P>
<B>(1225 ) </B>
<P>
	Moreover the national parks and national historic sites are 
tangible symbols of the best of our Canadian identity. The 
Department of Canadian Heritage has national responsibilities, 
programs for the enhancement of Canadian identity that will 
build on this element as well.
<P>
	An example of this kind of synergy that is developing 
throughout the new department of heritage is the heritage 
tourism initiative which we on this side of the House are 
supporting. Given the wide mandate the department now enjoys, 
there are tremendous opportunities to build an exciting, 
economically significant and, probably most important, a 
sustainable international program based on the cultural 
institutions and natural wonders of this country. To this end the 
government is also committed to the completion of the national 
parks system, the expansion of our national historic site themes, 
and the establishment of new national marine conservation 
areas.
<P>
	I would point out that new guiding principles and policies for 
the range of activities undertaken by Parks Canada were 
completed under the umbrella of Canadian heritage. When these 
policies were tabled in the House last March it was to 
considerable acclaim for the many stakeholders involved in 
these aspects of national heritage. There was a clear 
demonstration that they had been involved in their development.
<P>
	With regard to the specific concerns raised by the member for 
Kootenay East I would note that it does appear strange that the 
Department of Canadian Heritage is involved in the road 
maintenance business. However I do not comprehend how that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6835"> 6835 </A></B>
<P>
translates into an argument for returning the national parks to 
Environment Canada.
<P>
	In any event there are roads, national transportation corridors, 
that pass through some parks. There is no question about that. As 
they are within park boundaries there is an obligation of the 
responsible department to ensure their suitability and safety. In 
some parks work is contracted out or performed under an 
agreement with the province.
<P>
	The member will be interested to know that Parks Canada is 
reviewing all its road operations to ensure the most effective 
means of proper maintenance. That could well mean 
consolidation of operations in the four mountain parks.
<P>
	I understand well the member's argument that highways are 
normally managed by provinces and should not be funded by 
Parks Canada. Accordingly the government will take the 
member's suggestion under advisement.
<P>
	I found that the member's comment on road tolls for 
commercial through traffic in national parks to be somewhat 
confusing. There was no such road toll nor is one being 
contemplated.
<P>
	On the question of the enterprise unit for the operation of hot 
pools I believe that this project is turning out to be successful 
and should be a good pilot for similar ventures. Staff will 
continue to be hired on merit and where appropriate, business 
opportunities that can be realized will be pursued. I welcome his 
support for a more businesslike approach to park operations as 
exemplified by the enterprise unit at the hot springs. The 
member will be pleased to know that this initiative is one of 
many that represent the future direction of management in our 
parks.
<P>
	I trust that I have answered the member's concerns. I conclude 
by saying I am proud to support Bill C-53, which creates the 
Department of Canadian Heritage.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, at the departmental 
briefing, officials from this new department told us there would 
be no streamlining, no downsizing and no cash savings. A few 
moments ago the parliamentary secretary was talking about a 
saving of $7.3 million.
<P>
	I wonder if the hon. member could tell us where that saving is 
going to come from. Where is it going to get that money, 
especially since there is a recommendation tabled with the bill 
that will allow the department to spend more money? I wonder if 
the hon. member could straighten us out on this point.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gallaway:</B> Mr. Speaker, in all fairness it is difficult to 
answer a question raised in an earlier speech with respect to a 
speech made by the parliamentary secretary. Perhaps the 
member ought more properly to have addressed the question to 
her.
<P>
<B>(1230 ) </B>
<P>
	As I understand the concerns raised by the hon. member, I 
have been advised by the parliamentary secretary that the figure 
of $7.3 million will come through streamlining administrative 
procedures within the department.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, B.Q.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we are 
here today to debate a bill establishing the Department of 
Canadian Heritage and amending and repealing certain Acts. 
This bill is known as C-53.
<P>
	Its title suggests that this bill simply reorganizes a 
department. The heritage minister himself presents it to us as a 
technicality. But in fact, this bill goes far beyond the mere 
restructuring of a department. Indeed, this bill proposes an 
inefficient and dangerous distribution of government 
responsibilities.
<P>
	Let me highlight two important points where the bill is 
seriously off track. First, let me point out a serious 
inconsistency in the sharing of departmental responsibilities. 
Once again, the government is acting in such a way that the left 
hand will not know what the right hand is doing, since the 
sharing of responsibilities between the departments of Industry 
and Canadian Heritage raises various problems of jurisdiction, 
competition and policy.
<P>
	To illustrate what I am saying, I shall now quote what the bill 
says about the department's field of jurisdiction. First, clause 4 
says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>4. (1) The powers, duties and functions of the minister extend to and 
include-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In French, the bill says ``de façon générale''. What does this 
mean?
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-all matters over which Parliament has jurisdiction, not by law assigned to 
any other department-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	If it is already somewhere else, the heritage minister does not 
have to be concerned with it, and anyway it is ``de façon 
générale''.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-relating to (Canadian) identity and values, cultural development-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Let us look at some areas of jurisdiction. Subclause 2 says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(<I>d</I>) cultural heritage and industries, including performing arts, visual and 
audio-visual arts, publishing, sound recording, film, video and literature;</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This subclause also includes broadcasting and the 
formulation of cultural policy as it relates to foreign investment.
<P>
	My colleague said that it is a real mish-mash. You see, the 
minister's portfolio includes the arts, cultural industries, 
museums, heritage, broadcasting, physical fitness, amateur 
sport, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6836"> 6836 </A></B>
<P>
multiculturalism, the status of women, parks, historic sites and 
canals, state ceremonial and protocol and so on. I felt like saying 
``Alouette'' at the end of this long list.
<P>
	There is a problem and let me mention an obvious one, 
copyright. When it comes to culture, copyright must be strictly 
and effectively protected. Here, copyright comes under both 
Industry and Heritage; Industry is in Bill C-46. There is a 
problem.
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
	I would also like to mention a document just recently 
published by the Canadian Conference of the Arts that points 
out, with respect to copyright, that the division of powers 
between industry and heritage will slow down the legislative 
process that should one day lead to fair compensation of artists 
and creators for the commercial use of their works. I understand 
the government's good intentions, but I quite simply do not 
believe there will be any concrete results.
<P>
	Secondly, I would point out to this House that the bill does not 
address the cultural and societal impact of technological 
advances and in particular of the so-called electronic highway. 
The second objective set out in the Throne Speech with respect 
to the electronic highway is to strengthen Canada's cultural 
sovereignty and identity, in the singular, I note, as if there were 
only one cultural identity in Canada.
<P>
	The stakes are high. Certainly, in Canada, Quebecers have a 
cultural identity. Can we speak of one cultural identity for the 
rest of Canada? I am not sure we can. Maritimers have their own 
values, heritage and history. Canadians from the Prairies have a 
different history, heritage and set of experiences that are also 
uniquely their own. The same can be said for Canadians on the 
West Coast and for Ontarians, with their very different history. 
This assumption of a single Canadian identity worries me.
<P>
	I was speaking of the electronic highway, technological 
advances and the Department of Canadian Heritage. The latter, 
in its eagerness not to miss anything, is aiming in all directions, 
but is missing the real targets, the challenges we must meet in 
the next few years, not ten or twenty years down the road.
<P>
	And here we should mention technology. Broadcasting, 
communications and telecommunications are being 
revolutionized. As I speak, the real stakes, the real players, the 
real pieces of this incredible puzzle are not immediately 
apparent. The problem is a multi-facetted one. On the one hand, 
there are the suppliers of telephone services and infrastructures, 
the telephone companies, of whom there are several in Canada. 
On the other hand, there are the cable distributors, which bring 
television to the homes of so many Canadians and Quebecers.
<P>
	These two major players are in the process of merging and 
using computer technology to transmit their signals, with the 
result that there will no longer be any difference between my 
telephone conversation and a television broadcast. The 
electronic signals travelling through the wires will be the same.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	The contents will change but the container will remain the 
same. This container will travel at very high speed on the optic 
fibre, which is basically a glass wire along which light can 
travel. Light can carry much more information in one second 
than electrical current. In fact, it is ten times faster. This means 
that a single fibre-optic cable can replace a huge number of 
copper wires. Then there is the coaxial cable of the type used by 
cable distributors. This cable is also capable of carrying large 
amounts of information.
<P>
	With these cables, we are on the way to acquiring the physical 
capability to carry information of any type from point A to point 
B at astounding speeds. Technologically, this is feasible in the 
very short term. The problem is knowing what information will 
be carried.
<P>
	If we are talking about telephone conversations, just between 
you and me, that will not make much of a difference. If the 
technology enables me to make banking transactions from my 
home, that is already an improvement on the present situation. If 
I can make banking transactions with other countries around the 
world, with electronic movement of capital, then the flow could 
be substantial and I understand that the Department of Industry 
would want to look into this. As a matter of fact, so should the 
Department of Finance and the Department of National 
Revenue.
<P>
	In terms of programming, what would happen to cultural 
programs and television programs as we know them? Will we 
continue to have local antennas broadcasting according to the 
familiar sequence? I do not think so. We are headed for a drastic 
changeover. At present, you turn on your T.V., select a channel 
and watch what is on, without having any input regarding the 
sequence. This is as if you were to go to a restaurant, went in, 
checked the menu and were told: ``Here are your choices of 
soups, your choices of appetizers, your choices of main dishes, 
your choices of desserts and your choices of beverages, and 
these are your only choices''. Today, when you select say the 
CBC, you take what you are served. It is direct and simple, but if 
you do not like what is on, you turn the dial to another station. 
Again, you watch what that station is offering, in the sequence it 
has decided. But no more.
<P>
	In just a few years, you will find yourself in a situation similar 
to being in a cafeteria. You will not tune in to a station; rather, 
you will look at a list of programs which will have been 
prerecorded-sometimes 20 or 30 years earlier, since there are 
already video libraries containing large numbers of prerecorded 
tapes-and you will decide what you want to see and when. This 
is what I call a cafeteria-style of selection. You want three 
desserts but no soup? Fine, the decision is yours. You want more 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6837"> 6837 </A></B>
<P>
of these vegetables? You do not like turnip or broccoli? They are 
good for you. No, Mr. Speaker, I know that you do like turnip 
and broccoli. So, you choose what you want and then pay for it. 
This is how it will work.
<P>
	The real problem is that each consumer will now decide what 
he or she will consume. The question then is: Who works in the 
cafeteria kitchen and prepares what is available? Who will 
prepare these programs and according to what standards? Who 
will define what is good and on what basis? Who will conduct 
inspections in the kitchens?
<P>
	If this was done in a single facility housing these kitchens, we 
could go there and see what goes on, but these kitchens will be 
located all over the world. The information highway gives 
instant access to data located anywhere. We do not have the 
ability to control what producers do in other countries.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	To what extent will we be able to ensure the second objective 
stated in the Speech from the Throne, namely the strengthening 
of Canada's sovereignty and cultural identity? I am not only 
referring to Quebec's cultural identity, which is a lot easier to 
protect since the majority of Quebecers are French-speaking. 
However, in the rest of Canada, where the majority speaks 
English, access to American production, for example, will be 
incredibly easy.
<P>
	So far, the issue of Canadian content has been discussed in 
terms of broadcasting time. So much time is allocated to 
Canadian programs and so much time to American content. This 
is fine when you are in a restaurant with a fixed menu. The soup 
is Canadian, the potatoes are American, the steak comes from 
western Canada, while the dessert is home-made. However, 
when you are in a cafeteria, you choose what you want and there 
is no way of making sure that a consumer will opt for a quantity 
of Canadian products which is equal, greater or lower than that 
of foreign goods.
<P>
	Of course, one can resort to the video store technique which 
consists in allocating a certain number of shelves to Canadian 
productions and leave the rest for foreign ones. However, 
nothing guarantees that customers will go for Canadian 
productions in a proportion that matches the space allocated on 
shelves. No one is at the door to control what customers choose.
<P>
	We are in a similar situation with the information highway. At 
first glance, it seems that it will not be easy to control. However, 
in terms of technology, the Department of Industry is taking 
quite an interest in wires, cables, connections, interfaces and 
protocols, while the Department of Canadian Heritage is making 
pious wishes regarding our cultural identity.
<P>
	This bill essentially gives the Minister of Canadian Heritage 
the right to talk about heritage without giving him the power to 
regulate or to intervene at any level. It does not give him any real 
power to ensure that Quebec and Canada's values are protected 
at a time when the stakes are extremely high because we find 
ourselves in a situation where we are facing the unknown.
<P>
	I am thinking about this Minister of Canadian Heritage who, 
question period after question period, explains to us when we 
are wondering about the CRTC or the Museum of Nature that 
these organizations are independent, that they have their own set 
of rules and that they will do a good job. Well, do we really need 
a Minister of Canadian Heritage? I think I have expressed my 
concerns very clearly but, to give you a brief summary, allow me 
to say that at a time when the telecommunications and cable 
industries are converging, which threatens the level of cultural 
content from Canada and Quebec, it seems totally inconsistent 
that the mandate of the Department of Canadian Heritage be 
outdated with regard to these issues.
<P>
	In conclusion, I support the amendment proposed by my 
colleague from Rimouski-Témiscouata to withdraw this bill 
which, I am sorry to say, is bland, colourless and has a strange 
smell to it.
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, once again, the Bloc Quebecois 
has expressed its concerns about the federal presence in cultural 
matters. I listened with a great deal of interest to what was said, 
but I must admit I was somewhat surprised at the cafeteria 
metaphor.
<P>
	They worry that people are allowed to choose. They worry 
that people do not have the knowledge, the discipline or the 
ability to make informed decisions about the kind of food they 
should eat.
<P>
	As you know, thousands of people use the Commons 
cafeteria, and I think we have quite a variety. People eat more 
than cakes and cookies. They are concerned about good 
nutrition. All Canadians, especially young Canadians, are very 
much aware of the importance of good nutrition.
<P>
	In the bill before the House today, we want to give Canadians 
a chance to make choices and not necessarily make those 
choices for them, as the hon. member for the opposition 
assumed. I trust the public, and I am confident that our fellow 
citizens can make informed decisions. After all, the purpose of 
this department and the objective of the Government of Canada 
is to establish links among the various elements that make up 
our country.
<P>
	I think we can benefit from the experience of a fisherman 
from the maritimes, a logger from Quebec, and a western 
farmer. I think we should realize that the genius of federalism 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6838"> 6838 </A></B>
<P>
lies in having invited these various elements to come and build 
such an extraordinary country.
<P>
	Once again, the opposition talks about controlling. 
Controlling whom? Controlling choices made by adult 
individuals, by people who want to find a way to express 
themselves? For instance, the federal government never 
intervened when Pierre Falardeau decided to do his film 
<I>Octobre</I>. I must say I do not share the views expressed by Mr. 
Falardeau. However, the Government of Canada, through 
Telefilm Canada and the National Film Board, agreed to 
produce, to fund this film which, as you all know, is raising a lot 
of questions and causing a lot of debate. People say it is not a big 
success because unfortunately, the Government of Quebec 
refused to participate.
<P>
	This goes to show that when partnership is lacking, some 
projects often never get off the ground. And some are often not 
well received by the general public. In any case, I wish the 
opposition would realize that as far as Canadian heritage and 
culture are concerned, the goal of this government and of all 
creative artists has always been to stimulate our intellectual 
curiosity and urge people to reach beyond the horizon. Oddly 
enough, separatist nationalists often say they want a Quebec that 
is open to the world. So why not start with a Quebec open to 
Canada, and vice-versa? I think we already have a system that 
works well and is very open to the range of different opinions we 
have in this country.
<P>
	To go back to the cafeteria metaphor, I am glad to know I have 
a choice and that this choice is a matter of individual freedom. 
Unfortunately, the opposition only proposes to remove or 
control those freedoms we take for granted.
<P>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. de Savoye:</B> Mr. Speaker, to have a choice is great, but to 
have the right choice is even better. But the hon. member 
opposite seems prepared to consume anything, provided he has a 
choice. The Americans rely on the power of money and on 
competition to bring down the price of the cultural product in the 
United States and the price of using communications and 
telecommunications resources and infrastructures. And they 
succeeded at it. But a small price buys a small amount, as is 
unfortunately too often the case on this side of the border.
<P>
	Our cultural industry has great merit and does great things, 
both in English Canada and in Quebec. The danger is that this 
bill, which basically gives no power to the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage, will have a disastrous effect on our culture and our 
cultural industry. I am pleased to see that the hon. member 
opposite shares my concerns. What makes me sad, however, is 
that he does not realize that this bill does not have enough teeth 
to deliver the goods.
<P>
	I would be delighted if he interceded personally with the 
Minister of Canadian Heritage and his caucus to have this bill
<P>
withdrawn and replaced with a bill which would truly deliver the 
goods he was referring to.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagnon:</B> Indeed, Mr. Speaker, I find the remarks made by 
the hon. member opposite quite legitimate. I agree with him that 
the system is not perfect. It is true that further efforts are 
required to safeguard the Canadian cultural space, whether 
French Canadian or English Canadian. And I believe that is the 
primary goal of the Canadian National Broadcasting Strategy. 
There is no doubt that the bill deals with several aspects that 
extend beyond radio and television broadcasting.
<P>
	It also deals with parks, as well as multiculturalism. That is 
true. Matters that affect culture also affect the cultural industry, 
and the hon. member is right in saying that we must remain wary 
of the American competition which, as we know, can be plainly 
disloyal at times not only vis-à-vis the Canadian culture but 
also other cultures worldwide.
<P>
	Take France, England, Japan for example. These are countries 
that already pay closer attention to their cultures because of the 
massive American invasion in our cultural spaces. The fact 
remains however, and I believe all the hon. members agree on 
this, that Quebec and the francophone culture in Canada, which 
certainly extends beyond the boundaries of Quebec, are better 
protected in a federal context than if left to fight the American 
cultural giant on their own, alone, without any friends or allies.
<P>
	<B>Mr. de Savoye:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have time for three short 
quotes. First, I would like to quote the Arpin report to Ms. 
Frulla-Hébert, who was Quebec's minister of culture. It says: 
``We can conclude that overlap between the two levels of 
government clearly exists in terms of structures, programs, 
target groups and even legislation and fiscal measures''. It talks 
about culture here. ``We can even talk about duplication which 
leads to one-upmanship. The two governments have different 
policies and priorities for the same target groups. Measures 
taken by the federal government sometimes flatly contradict 
Quebec's options. Harmonizing the action of the two levels of 
government has always been difficult. The federal government 
never wanted to recognize Quebec's precedence in cultural 
affairs''.
<P>
	To conclude, Keith Kelly, National Director of the Canadian 
Conference of the Arts, said: ``Telecommunication companies 
seem to be prepared to penetrate the world of broadcasting and 
the government must ensure that their activities have a 
beneficial impact on Canadian cultural industries. Reaffirming 
the separation of telecoms and broadcasting companies in these 
two bills simply freezes a status quo which is no longer 
appropriate today''.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, that is why I spoke as I did this morning.
<P>
<B></B>

<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John O'Reilly (Victoria-Haliburton, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to have the opportunity to 
share with hon. members present my views on the legislation 
that will establish in law the Department of Canadian Heritage.
<P>
	As an opening comment I must say that a reading of Bill C-53 
has convinced me of the importance of this piece of legislation. 
This department is called upon to play a central role in the life of 
Canada and Canadians.
<P>
	The legislation reflects the sweep of the new department's 
mandate that includes responsibilities in the areas of cultural 
development, multiculturalism, official languages, heritage 
conservation, national parks, national historic sites and amateur 
sports.
<P>
	Moreover the policies and programs of the Department of 
Canadian Heritage are meant to promote increased 
understanding of our diversity, the involvement of all citizens in 
Canadian society and an increased awareness of our cultural and 
natural wealth. In other words the department is active in those 
areas that have clear links to our identity as Canadians.
<P>
	One of the pre-eminent characteristics of Canada has always 
been its multicultural nature; in fact it is a vital comment of our 
national identity. This multicultural dimension is one of the 
most exciting realities of our society, one that should be 
cherished and nurtured. I find it very comforting therefore to 
read in Bill C-53 that the new department will be responsible for 
the promotion of the greater understanding of human rights, 
fundamental freedoms and related values as well as 
multiculturalism.
<P>
	All Canadians must experience a sense of belonging to the 
country. Multiculturalism seeks to bridge the gap between 
cultural communities with diverse interests and backgrounds. I 
have referred to Canadian heritage as a new department. 
However as most members know the department has been 
functioning well for almost a year and a half.
<P>
	Passage of the bill is a necessary legal step and will serve to 
confirm the areas of jurisdiction within which the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage will exercise his powers and carry out his 
duties and functions, one of the key sectors that will occupy the 
time of the minister in ensuring the growth and development of 
Canada's cultural section. Never has this area been more 
important than now, given the significance of the contributions 
to the Canadian economy.
<P>
	I will not repeat the figures and statistics that others before me 
have quoted in support of that contribution. Rather I will focus 
on the role of the federal government in cultural development. 
Some maintain that culture above all is a way of looking at the 
world and a manifestation of our civilization. This unique view 
of the world is one of the features that allows one group to  
distinguish itself from others. In short, without culture there is 
no identity.
<P>
	Most would agree that the federal government's 
responsibility in cultural matters extends to those areas that are 
pan-Canadian, interprovincial and international in scope. 
Federal endeavours in these areas remain complementary to 
those of the other levels of government. It is crucial there be 
many agents of cultural development and for governments to 
play an active role. The federal government's role is to ensure 
that Canadian artists, creators and cultural industries are able to 
produce and that Canadians have access to those cultural 
products.
<P>
	No better example can be given than the current efforts of the 
Minister of Canadian Heritage to ensure that the Canadian 
cultural content will be readily accessible to Canadians on the 
rapidly evolving information highway.
<P>
	I will now turn briefly to the department's specific programs 
to promote the country's two official languages. These programs 
are designed to provide opportunities for Canadians to 
appreciate and profit from our rich linguistic heritage and to 
communicate with and participate fully in federal institutions 
such as the one we are in today.
<P>
	As anyone who has travelled exclusively and extensively 
abroad will attest, it bears emphasizing that Canada remains one 
the world's most favoured nations. Our prosperity and civility 
are products of much hard work and cannot be taken for granted. 
Duality is an essential element for our identity and our defining 
characteristics.
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	The English and French languages and the people who speak 
them have shaped Canada and helped define its identity. The 
federal official languages policy is designed to reflect this 
reality. I am proud to be a member of a government committed 
to a vision of Canada where vital English speaking and French 
speaking minority language communities can contribute to the 
economic, social, cultural or scientific life of our country.
<P>
	The Minister of Canadian Heritage also has responsibilities in 
the areas of heritage policies and programs. The Department of 
Canadian Heritage provides support and assistance to museums 
across the country. At the same time the department ensures that 
the environment in which our national museums function, 
including the National Archives, the National Gallery, the 
Museum of Civilization, the Museum of Nature and the National 
Library, is conducive to giving Canadians maximum 
accessibility to our cultural heritage.
<P>
	When I think of the heritage of Canadians my thoughts often 
turn to our national parks and national historic sites. The 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6840"> 6840 </A></B>
<P>
Minister of Canadian Heritage is charged with the weighty 
responsibilities of preserving these priceless examples of our 
nature and cultural and  natural heritage for the benefit of 
present and future generations. These parks and sites represent 
the very essence of our identity as Canadians.
<P>
	Parks Canada is one of the major components of Canadian 
heritage. It provides strong leadership in the management of 
protected heritage areas and aims at promoting sound principles 
of stewardship and citizen awareness. Parks Canada also leads 
the field in ecological and commemorative integrity by adhering 
to international conventions. Canadians can take pride in the 
internationally recognized contribution of Parks Canada to 
heritage conservation.
<P>
	Nationally and internationally there is a trend toward 
regionalization, that history, culture and nature are intertwined. 
This is strongly reflected in the UNESCO convention 
concerning the protection of world culture and natural heritage 
for which the Minister of Canadian Heritage is Canada's 
representative.
<P>
	In summary, it is clear the programs of the Department of 
Canadian Heritage span Canada's past, present and future. In 
many ways the department can be regarded as the flagship of 
Canadian identity, bringing together the diverse mix of federal 
programs that will help us confront and surmount the challenges 
that lie ahead.
<P>
	I look forward to the passage of the legislation and the official 
creation of the Department of Canadian Heritage.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Before recognizing the 
member for Surrey North, I want to advise the House that the 
block of five hours of debate which entitled members to speak 
for a maximum of 20 minutes with a 10-minute question or 
comment has lapsed. We are now going to the next stage of 
debate which allows for 10-minute interventions without 
questions or comments.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Margaret Bridgman (Surrey North, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is an honour to participate in any debate in the House. 
Today I join in the debate on Bill C-53 concerning the creation 
of the Department of Canadian Heritage.
<P>
	Before getting into the text of my talk today I refer to a 
comment that was made earlier in the debate about the saving of 
$7.3 million in relationship to the bill. At a departmental 
briefing it was indicated there is no streamlining involved with 
the bill; there is no cost saving and there are no layoffs. I am left 
a bit mystified as to where the saving of $7.3 million will come 
from.
<P>
	A number of speakers have preceded me in the discussion and 
have addressed a number of the components singled out by the 
government as comprising the mandate of the department.
<P>
<B>(1310 ) </B>
<P>
	When reviewing the items in the bill one wonders what 
criterion was used for the selection of these items for the 
department. For example, according to Bill C-53, it includes 
such things as multiculturalism, national parks, historic sites 
and canals. It moves on to the field of amateur sports and the 
advancement of equality and status of the English and French 
languages. Then it goes into the field of broadcasting and so on.
<P>
	When the present government was restructuring the ministry 
at the beginning of this session it would seem that items which 
were left over along with a few others that were pulled from 
other departments have been lumped together to create the 
Department of Canadian Heritage.
<P>
	This questioning of the practicality of placing diverse and 
unrelated items in the same department leads to a more 
fundamental question as to what is Canadian heritage. Webster's 
dictionary defines heritage as something that we inherit at birth; 
in other words it is like a legacy. It is something or anything that 
is derived from the past or from tradition. By definition, then, 
heritage of an individual or group or a country is what we 
actually inherit at birth, that which was created and moulded by 
the actions of those who preceded us, just as what we do now in 
our lifetime will become the heritage or the mould of the 
lifestyle for those who come after us. For example, briefly, those 
in the present inherit a base from the past to build on for those in 
the future. That would be what heritage is.
<P>
	A basic source contributing to our heritage is the consensus of 
our society to recognize specific events and/or issues as being 
valuable to retain for our future development and to create and 
maintain these things through tangible symbols as a constant 
reminder for those who follow us in the future. When events of 
the past no longer directly influence how we govern our 
lifestyles today, they tend to move from the concept of heritage 
into what we call our history.
<P>
	Following this definition, I question the purpose of the 
Department of Canadian Heritage. I feel that the citizens of the 
country do not need a Department of Canadian Heritage at all. 
We in the House must realize that everything we do in terms of 
the laws we pass, the issues we discuss, will become part of the 
legacy we leave to those who follow us, which will be their 
heritage.
<P>
	Instead of there being a specific Department of Canadian 
Heritage, all departments or ministries should be responsible 
through the legislation they propose for the development and 
maintenance of everything we do, of the heritage for those who 
are to follow, not just a single department.
<P>
	The government's role is simply to provide a legislative 
framework for all persons living in Canada and to provide an 
overall framework within which individuals and groups of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6841"> 6841 </A></B>
<P>
individuals and Canadians generally can define their own 
existence. As long as they operate or  define it within the 
parameters of Canadian legal jurisdiction it will become or 
carry on as heritage.
<P>
	For example, persons who come to Canada have the 
opportunity to maintain their heritage, such as language or 
dress, as long as that heritage or the components of that heritage 
do not come into conflict with established Canadian laws, the 
equality of men and women, for example.
<P>
	People should not come to Canada to recreate the country they 
left. That begs the question of why they left in the first place. 
People who immigrate to Canada do so because we have a 
country that is very attractive to people all over the world. Our 
response to those who come should not be to reproduce the 
country they left behind but to do our best to maintain Canada so 
that it will be as attractive to other people as it was to them.
<P>
	On this subject I quote from an October 5 article in the Globe 
and Mail written by Sonja Sinclair, a freelance writer and 
self-described Canadian by adoption rather than birth:
<P>
<B>(1315 ) </B>
<P>
	``At the risk of being politically incorrect, I believe that those 
of us who left our original homelands whether by choice or 
necessity have no business complaining that the country that 
offers us a refuge happens to be different than the one we left 
behind. This does not mean that we should not criticize things 
that we believe to be wrong or better still try to improve those 
that seem to be imperfect. Neither does it mean that we should 
forget where we came from or if we choose keep alive our native 
language and our culture. What we should not do is expect the 
government or our fellow citizens to do it for us and foot the 
bill''.
<P>
	Canada's history is filled with cultural groups that 
immigrated to this country and maintained their own heritage. 
For example, the persons of Ukrainian descent who immigrated 
to western Canada this century did not have a department of 
heritage to show them or to help them maintain their traditions. 
They did that on their own and their community in Canada is 
much stronger for it.
<P>
	Anyone who has been to a wedding in Vegreville can attest to 
the enduring strength of the Ukrainian culture in Canada. It is 
government arrogance to believe that people with different 
cultures will maintain their cultures only as long as they are able 
to receive money from federal governments to help them 
remember their own heritage.
<P>
	Therefore, what it is to be Canadian, that is our heritage, is 
defined by the actions of the people and groups of people within 
the parameters of legislation as determined by the governments 
of this country.
<P>
	The meaning of Canadian should be defined from the bottom 
up and not the top down. The process for defining our nation 
should go from individuals to groups of individuals, to 
community, to province, to region, to nation. This is the only 
way our struggle for identity will be resolved.
<P>
	We do not need a Department of Canadian Heritage. 
Government's role is to provide good legislation and parameters 
for the present and future growth of our country. With this our 
heritage will be looked after by the citizens themselves.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Maria Minna (Beaches-Woodbine, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to speak in support of Bill C-53 because I 
believe this nation is probably the world leader when it comes to 
identifying the importance of heritage and what that means to all 
of us.
<P>
	To suggest that we do not need a department of heritage is to 
suggest that this country does not have a vision or focus or 
direction as a nation and nothing to build, that things will 
happen as they may, that regionalism will evolve as it may, that 
one part of the country need not talk to the other part of the 
country and that culture need not be reinforced in any which 
way.
<P>
	However, today I would like to concentrate my comments 
around the whole issue of multiculturalism which hon. members 
of the Reform Party have made a great to do over in this House in 
the last several days.
<P>
	What is multiculturalism? The first problem is that the 
members have totally misunderstood what that is. They keep 
referring to it as the Ukrainian community out west or the such 
and such community somewhere else which maintained their 
dance, their culture and their food. That is not only what 
multiculturalism is about. That is such a minor part it happens 
quite by itself as an hon. member rightly pointed out.
<P>
	Multiculturalism is a fundamental policy that acknowledges 
the reality of what Canada is today. It is a multicultural society 
made up of peoples from all over the world.
<P>
	Over the years it has been to the advantage of what used to be 
referred to as the mainstream to maintain the status quo of us 
and them. In the discussions even today I keep hearing the us and 
them, those people, the cultural people, the multicultural 
people. Those are the people who are neither English nor 
French. With respect, that is not what multiculturalism is all 
about. Multiculturalism defines this country. That means if one 
looks at a circle the perimeter of the circle is multiculturalism 
and that is Canada. Within the circle are Canadians of British 
descent, Canadians of French descent, Canadians of Italian 
descent and so on, and the aboriginal community. Within that 
circle is where we try to develop programs to deal with equity 
and to arrive at an equitable kind of society.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6842"> 6842 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
	Without the fundamental policy, the concept of 
multiculturalism, I will tell members what happens. I have dealt 
for 20 years with program delivery of services in this country. 
Multiculturalism applies to every government department, not 
just to the department of multiculturalism. It is a policy, it is an 
idea. When policies are developed by different departments if 
the concept of multiculturalism is not taken into account at the 
very development of that policy the delivery of that policy will 
not reach everybody. It will be very inequitable.
<P>
	The people developing both the policy and the mechanism 
with which to deliver it do not have either the experience or the 
understanding of the different peoples of this country. In order 
to be able to understand the needs of people in this country, in 
order to build a policy and a delivery mechanism that does not 
have barriers within it that would prevent people from accessing 
what is their right to access, that policy is not developed 
properly.
<P>
	The policy assists in schools, the discussion of equality within 
the school system, so that children will learn about one another 
and are able to respect each other's backgrounds, are able to 
work together and be proud of who they are. The curriculum in 
this country for the longest time-these are very simple 
examples that should not even have to be made-ignored totally 
the contribution to Canada and around the world of peoples of 
different cultural backgrounds.
<P>
	When we take into account the policy of multiculturalism we 
begin to say we must take into account all the contributions of 
all the people in this country. Christopher Columbus was not a 
North American; his name was Cristoforo Colombo. There are 
many others who came to this country over the last 200 years. 
People of Chinese background who built the railway in this 
country made a contribution to build this country. The 
Europeans who cleared the west made a contribution to this 
country. The Italian Canadians who built the railway as well and 
were incarcerated during the second world war, many of them 
built this country. This is not an us and them country. It is a we 
country.
<P>
	Canada is a nation that is evolving. The culture of this country 
is evolving. It is not a British culture entirely. We are very 
respectful of the institutions.
<P>
	The member across the way from the Reform Party a week ago 
suggested that people of immigrant background if we continue 
with multiculturalism will not respect Canadian institutions. I 
find that insulting. I am a Canadian and I respect Canadian 
institutions.
<P>
	What is a Canadian? I was not born here. I came here at the 
age of nine. I am very proud of who I am and where I come from, 
but I am a very proud Canadian first and foremost. To suggest 
that people who have heritage that is not English or French are 
not proud Canadians is an insult to people in this country. 
Multiculturalism is the  equalizer. It is the acknowledgement of 
what we are as a nation and that is what we are building.
<P>
	Countries around the world have called us and asked us to 
share our experiences with them. Australia has taken our policy 
and taken it much further than we have. Germany has recently 
asked that we help it to develop a similar policy because the 
world around us is changing. We have countries where because 
of religious or ethnic differences people are killing each other.
<P>
	We in this country are developing a model of coexistence, of 
mutual respect for one another and that is what multiculturalism 
is about. It fosters that respect. It helps us to build an evolving 
society. Nothing is static.
<P>
	Every one of our heritages is just as important as the other. No 
one is more or less important.
<P>
<B>(1325 ) </B>
<P>
	It does not mean that Canada as a state and as a country is not 
something that we are all proud of and that is first and foremost 
in our minds. It does not mean that Canadians who are not of 
British or French background did not fight and die in the world 
wars.
<P>
	Some people say that multiculturalism is divisive and is 
causing the divisions and the breakup of this country. That is 
highly insulting.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Look around, it is.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Minna:</B> It is not. You are. Through you, Mr. Speaker, I am 
sorry.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I thank the hon. member 
for recognizing her indulgence.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Minna:</B> I am sorry, but it does not. It is not the people like 
myself who are neither of English nor French background who 
are causing the breakup of this country.
<P>
	We believe in multiculturalism, in having a policy that 
acknowledges that this country is not what it was 200 years ago. 
Even then it was not what people claim it was. It was a 
multicultural nation from day one.
<P>
	The model that we are building is one that we can be very 
proud of. The moneys used are for programs to develop and 
implement the ideology and concept of multiculturalism. One 
may disagree with a specific program but to disagree 
fundamentally with the policy is absolutely wrong.
<P>
	I want to quote some of the statements that have been made in 
this House over the last week. One of the statements suggests we 
are funding specialist groups at the expense of the taxpayer. Are 
we not all taxpayers? Are the people who receive the funds not 
taxpayers? Why do some suggest that of us and them, those 
people are not taxpayers? This policy is not one of us and them, 
it is a policy of all of us. It affects every single Canadian.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6843"> 6843 </A></B>
<P>
	There were statements such as this policy encourages large 
groups to remain apart from the mainstream. Who is the 
mainstream? In metropolitan Toronto the mainstream is all of 
us. There are some 100 different languages spoken. That is the 
mainstream of metropolitan Toronto, Hamilton and many other 
large urban centres in this country. I am not sure what is meant 
when people say the mainstream and what that is supposed to 
be.
<P>
	Sometimes I am asked why I do not become a Canadian. What 
does Canadian mean? Canadian simply means that you are a 
citizen of this country who respects the laws and the citizens of 
this country and who will work and fight for this country.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> We choose the government.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Minna:</B> We choose the government, that is right. We vote 
and we have a democratic process. That is what Canadian 
means. Every Canadian in this country has a different heritage, a 
different place that their parents came from, a different vision or 
a different region, but we are together as Canadians and that is 
what Canada is about. We are hybrids, some of us.
<P>
	Some Canadians are first generation, some third, some fourth. 
Nonetheless, we are citizens of this country and we are 
Canadians. Multiculturalism is the only policy that this country 
has which is the equalizer, which brings this country together to 
create the model that this world needs.
<P>
	In of all places, the <I>New York Times</I>, a writer stated that if 
Canada killed multiculturalism and the experiment died here it 
would be a sad state of affairs because if it died in Canada there 
would be no hope for the rest of the world to develop the same 
thing. I say to this House that it is time that people began to look 
at this government policy and include themselves in the future 
of this country instead of trying to maintain the status quo that 
never was.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, B.Q.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the bill we are debating today in the House is a perfect example 
of the measures which we strongly oppose and which explain 
why many Quebecers have come to embrace the sovereignist 
option. That is why I support the amendment of my colleague 
from Rimouski-Témiscouata to withdraw this bill and refer its 
subject matter to the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage. 
The purpose of this amendment is, of course, to prevent the 
House from proceeding to second reading of this bill, which 
deals with the concept of promoting the Canadian identity. A 
basic reason why we are opposed to this bill being debated now 
in this House is that many ethics problems have not been 
resolved yet.
<P>
<B>(1330) </B>
<P>
	When we talk about promoting the Canadian identity, it goes 
without saying that the mandates and subsidies of the various 
government agencies will support this goal.  Such is the case 
with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation which should 
logically promote a big and beautiful Canada, but especially a 
united Canada.
<P>
	A declaration made by the Prime Minister of Canada on June 
18 leaves no doubt as to the directives given to the CBC. The 
Prime Minister said: ``There is a law governing the CBC's 
operations and I will ask them to obey this law. Among the 
obligations outlined in the law is that of letting people know 
about Canada's advantages''.
<P>
	They would ask a broadcaster to voluntarily provide biased 
information in order to fulfil a mandate given by the Canadian 
government. It is very difficult to swallow. During an election 
campaign, for example, the air time allocated to the main 
political parties is monitored to the second. If one party gets 
more coverage than another, the news room will soon receive a 
telephone call from the party that feels slighted. This golden 
rule is the only guarantee that the population will be shown both 
sides of the coin.
<P>
	Reflecting his leader's thinking, the Minister of Foreign 
Affairs said in 1977: ``I cannot see the CBC taking a neutral 
stand to show both sides of the issue. During the referendum 
campaign, employees must stand squarely on the pro-Canada 
side''.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, as this statement shows, our Minister of Foreign 
Affairs was already advocating in 1977 that this Crown 
corporation-24 per cent of whose operating expenditures are 
being paid by Quebecers-should take a biased position. Today, 
this same Minister of Foreign Affairs travels around the world 
preaching a healthy democracy, which he would flout here in his 
own country.
<P>
	I saw him last Sunday in Haiti with President Aristide 
extolling the benefits of democracy. If democracy is healthy in a 
country like Haiti, why would he deny that this same democracy 
is just as beneficial here in Quebec, in Canada? It is very 
dangerous for the future.
<P>
	It remains to be seen whether the opinion of the minister I just 
told you about has evolved since 1977, but I doubt it. What the 
Prime Minister and his Minister of Foreign Affairs said amounts 
to favouring, for example, the no side during the next 
referendum campaign, either by giving them better air time or 
by boycotting events favourable to the sovereignists. It amounts 
to asking Bernard Derome to look disgusted when mentioning 
the benefits of having a sovereign Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	Such an attitude means one of two things: first, all 
Radio-Canada employees are federalists, or at least lack some 
professional ethics and agree to give a biased view in their media 
coverage; second, Quebecers do not realize that democracy is beingcheated. For all those journalists, news desk officers, producers, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6844"> 6844 </A></B>
<P>
technicians and others who have contributed to establishing 
Radio-Canada's reputation as a serious and credible 
organization, these comments are outrageous and reflect  a 
blatant lack of respect for the right of Canadians and Quebecers 
to be informed. In fact, such comments jeopardize the 
credibility of Radio-Canada's news bulletins.
<P>
	On top of these horror stories, the daily <I>Le Devoir</I> reported 
last April that the gap between programming budgets for the 
French and English networks is constantly increasing. There is 
no alternating here: every year the gap gets greater. Last year, 
the difference was $76.4 million. Indeed, Radio-Canada's 
budget was $69.7 million, while CBC got $146.1 million. And 
then Radio-Canada is being told how to present its news 
bulletins. There are limits to taking advantage of Quebecers.
<P>
	To say that a nation is defined by its culture and its language is 
stating the obvious. We will continue to fight relentlessly until 
we get all the necessary tools to ensure Quebec's cultural 
development. Quebec's interests cannot be the same as that of a 
population with a different culture. The best example of this is 
the recent film released on the events which occurred in October 
1970, to which the hon. member for 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine referred this morning. 
The producer, Pierre Falardeau had to defend his project because 
a Liberal senator campaigned against it, claiming that Telefilm 
Canada should not have to support such projects. Political 
schemers and movie producers do not have much in common.
<P>
	In conclusion, the mandate given to the Department of 
Canadian Heritage goes totally against Quebec's will. We urge 
the government to recognize Quebec's distinct and specific 
character and we will keep doing so.
<P>
<B>(1340) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Eleni Bakopanos (Saint-Denis, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Bill C-53 takes a very realistic and comprehensive approach to 
the new realities and problems confronting Canadian society. 
The new Department of Canadian Heritage is an instrument to 
promote Canadian identity. Multiculturalism is a part of this 
new department because it helps to define us as Canadians.
<P>
	The department's programs and policies reflect the changes 
that are taking place in how we see multiculturalism, in terms of 
its realities and present problems. At first, the purpose of the 
policy on multiculturalism was to protect cultural identities and 
promote exchanges between cultures. However, since 1988, 
when the Parliament of Canada unanimously-I repeat, 
unanimously-passed the Canadian Multiculturalism Act, the 
policy has evolved considerably. In addition to its initial 
cultural dimension, it now includes a social and economic focus.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We know that exclusion can be said to present a threat to 
democracy for it impedes equal and full participation for all. It 
leads to alienation, a sense of disenfranchisement, and feelings 
of powerlessness. Alienation leads to political apathy that 
diminishes both the society and the individual within society.
<P>
	According to the 1991 census of Canada, 42 per cent of 
Canadians identify themselves as having at least one origin 
other than British or French. Canadians with origins other than 
British or French now make up the majority in every major 
urban centre west of Montreal. By 2006 the proportion of 
Canadians who are visible minorities is expected to be between 
13 and 18 per cent. In Toronto some estimates suggest the 
proportion could be as high as 50 per cent.
<P>
	The increasing diversity of our population presents a 
profound challenge for Canadian society. In order to avoid 
conflict and maintain social cohesion, institutions within 
education, policing, justice, media, health and social services, 
business, labour, municipal and other sectors will have to 
redouble their efforts to develop policies, programs and 
practices adaptive to the reality of Canadian diversity. At the 
same time public education initiatives are necessary to promote 
among Canadians the value of their diversity and the tangible 
benefits that can be derived from it.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The federal multiculturalism policy is dynamic, because it 
responds to new challenges to society. Today, both policy and 
programs provide a response to major problems connected with 
racism and racial discrimination and to the problems 
encountered by immigrants seeking to become a part of 
Canadian society.
<P>
	I want to make it clear that multiculturalism is everybody's 
business, not just that of members of ethnic and cultural 
minorities. We all gain if we are able to give everyone a chance 
to make his way in society and make a full contribution towards 
building a stronger country.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Canadians are consistently expressing growing concerns 
about racism and racial discrimination. In November 1993 
Decima Research found that an overwhelming 86 per cent of 
Canadians have identified racism as a problem in Canadian 
society. Further, 53 per cent of Canadians believe that racism 
has increased over the past four to five years. When asked to 
identify those individuals or organizations that could best 
promote harmony and acceptance, a majority cited the federal 
government and/or the Prime Minister. In March, Ekos Research 
found that over three-quarters of Canadians feel that an
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6845"> 6845 </A></B>
<P>
appropriate future role for government is to ``promote tolerance 
and understanding throughout Canadian society''.
<P>
	I would submit that the above facts clearly demonstrate that 
this bill reflects the aspirations of Canadians and that the 
programs that it enables respond to the demands of the majority 
of Canadians. This government is in touch with Canadians.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It is in our own interests to try and preserve harmony. A 
society that understands the value of diversity and is prepared to 
make the adjustments that are necessary will enjoy an enviable 
reputation internationally.
<P>
<B>(1345) </B>
<P>
	John E. Cleghorn, president of the Royal Bank of Canada, 
says that our success as a nation depends on our ability to 
channel our country's rich diversity in ways that will make us 
truly competitive on the world markets. Because of an 
increasingly globalized economy, Canadian businesses must 
turn to new markets.
<P>
	In doing so, they can take advantage of Canada's abundant 
resources and a knowledge of other cultures, other languages 
and other ways of doing business. I would even say that 
businesses that are able to make this adjustment will have a 
competitive edge when the time comes to hire, and keep, 
qualified staff in a tight labour market. Multiculturalism 
reflects Canada's basic values. Multiculturalism derives from 
the general framework of civil, political, social and linguistic 
rights enshrined in the Canadian Constitution.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	These values are consistent with the results of a large national 
attitude survey conducted in 1991. On questions relating to 
diversity an overwhelming 95 per cent of citizens believe you 
can be proud to be Canadian and proud of your ancestry at the 
same time. Seventy-six per cent believe that multiculturalism 
applies to all Canadians regardless of ancestry and 73 per cent 
have close friends who come from different cultural 
backgrounds.
<P>
	Canada's multiculturalism policy is an eloquent testimony to 
our commitment to upholding the value of diversity as well as 
setting an example for the rest of the world. As a member of the 
United Nations our country has signed several international 
articles affirming our commitment to better the human 
condition at home and abroad.
<P>
	The international convention on the elimination of all forms 
of racism and racial discrimination obliges us to take positive 
measures against racial discrimination. The international 
covenant on civil and political rights addresses the rights of all 
persons to enjoy their own culture, practice their own religion 
and use their own language.
<P>
	Other articles to which we are a signatory such as the 
international covenant on economic, social and cultural rights 
and the international convention on the alienation of all forms of 
discrimination against women speak with conviction about 
basic Canadian values.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It is extremely important for the Government of Canada to act 
on its commitments and realize the values proposed therein. 
This is even more important today, when countries throughout 
the world are turning to Canadians for support. Every day we 
hear news about civil disobedience, political oppression, public 
chaos and fighting in the streets. It is a reminder that these 
societies urgently need a model on which they can base hopes 
for a better future.
<P>
	If as legislators, parents and citizens, we can keep working 
together to improve the Canadian vision, we will have 
something to offer the world, something of immense value. This 
brings me back to the real purpose and crucial role of the 
multiculturalism programs that will be part of the new 
department proposed in Bill C-53. These programs will help 
Canadians, whatever their cultural roots, become full members 
of our society and make a significant contribution to that 
society.
<P>
	That is why the lion's share of the $22 million worth of 
subsidies and grants administered by these programs is intended 
to help new Canadians become integrated into our society and to 
eliminate racism and racial discrimination throughout Canadian 
society. We also support efforts to deal with problems such as 
institutional change and the integration and participation of all 
individuals in Canadian society.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Let me also emphasize that a great deal of work involving no 
funding is carried out by officials of these programs. For 
example, our strategy on diversity and the economy forges 
important partnerships between government, business and 
communities to seize the economic opportunities afforded by 
our diversity. In a similar way we are working with our federal 
colleagues in the Departments of Justice, Solicitor General, 
National Revenue and others to accelerate work on the issue of 
hate crime, the importation and distribution of hate propaganda.
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
	Examples of the department's strategic partnerships include 
its work with the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police, the 
Canadian Advertising Foundation, the Canadian Association of 
Broadcasters and the Canadian Bar Association.
<P>
	As an ideology, multiculturalism reflects the reality that our 
society is becoming increasingly diverse. It is an ideology based 
on the shared values of acceptance and mutual respect. It is a 
visionary statement about the kind of society we are all really 
working to achieve, one in  which each Canadian can realize his 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6846"> 6846 </A></B>
<P>
or her full potential, economically, socially, politically and 
culturally.
<P>
	Bill C-53 provides the government with a framework for 
action by which it can continue to build a society based on 
fairness, respect and is inclusive of each and every Canadian.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Colleagues, as a junior 
presiding officer it is not my place to call the attention of the 
House to anyone in the gallery. However earlier this day I was 
fortunate enough to have the visit of a group of young students 
from Bishop Macdonell School in my riding. I want them to 
know that if they are in the House, and if I could acknowledge 
them, I would. I would simply say welcome and thank you for 
your visit.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, like 
my colleague across the way I am proud to be a Canadian. Prior 
to that I was an immigrant. I see no reason to support this bill.
<P>
	I begin with the idea that this bill is going to save $7.3 million. 
I cannot find this anywhere in the document. Rather it appears to 
me to be a hodge-podge of ideas designed to remove more tax 
dollars from the pockets of taxpayers.
<P>
	The bill proposes an omnibus department of government 
designed to promote a greater understanding of human rights. 
How often do we hear that? It has not one word about human 
responsibilities.
<P>
	The bill proposes a department to promote fundamental 
freedoms and related values. The term related values has no 
meaning to most Canadians. What values are related to 
fundamental freedoms? Could it be that the term may give 
another minority group another reason to challenge the current 
charter or human rights legislation because their values are 
related to fundamental freedoms?
<P>
	The bill allows for the establishment of multiculturalism, 
another tax grab. The Liberal government started 
multiculturalism as a means of using tax dollars to buy votes and 
it continues to do that today. Canadians, if given a choice 
between funding special interest groups under the guise of 
multiculturalism or funding education, health care and social 
services, would always vote for the essential services, not for a 
waste of tax dollars.
<P>
	I recently attended a multicultural event. It was marvellous. 
We had ethnic food, represented by 14 countries, flags flying for 
each country, ethnic dancing. It glorified the splendour of young 
men and women, wearing ethnic costumes, depicting the varied 
artistic culture of their homelands.
<P>
	This event did not cost taxpayers one red cent. It was entirely 
funded by those in attendance. There was a $20 admission fee. 
Not only did everyone have a great time, the event earned 
enough money to assist one group with its building fund. That is 
my kind of multiculturalism, the proud display that cost 
taxpayers nothing.
<P>
	The bill proposes to finance the cultural aspect of the status of 
the artist. Could anyone please tell me what that really means? It 
surely sounds like another waste of taxes to special interest 
groups who are so successful in lobbying the government for 
hard earned tax dollars. Another example of a catch-all phrase 
that steals taxes from essential services is the government's 
intent to fund cultural and heritage industries, including every 
form of entertainment imaginable.
<P>
<B>(1355) </B>
<P>
	In case the government does not know, we have a vibrant 
entertainment business in Canada that does not need tax dollars 
to survive. It is funded on a user pay system. If citizens partake 
in any event they pay for it. What is wrong with the free 
enterprise system funding cultural heritage industries? All the 
user-pay system does is stop wasting tax dollars.
<P>
	The government proposes that this new super department will 
oversee sites, canals, battlefields, railway stations and federal 
buildings of historical importance. I ask, who decides this 
importance? More special interest groups clamouring for tax 
dollars? More than likely.
<P>
	Also the bill proposes to have control of national parks. Since 
there are national parks in my riding this is of special interest to 
me. My constituents already know a small band of radicals have 
the heritage minister's ear. Instead of allowing Canadians 
access to their national parks he seems intent on doing whatever 
is instructed by these radicals to prevent our national parks from 
being open to call Canadians.
<P>
	It seems the minister listens to those who are already 
established in the parks and are preventing others from doing 
likewise. Again, special interests will control this department.
<P>
	The bill proposes to encourage and promote development of 
amateur sport. Yet every parent I know that has their child in 
organized amateur sports like hockey, ringette, baseball and 
soccer are finding it more difficult each year to afford keeping 
their child in any of these sports. Again, special interests receive 
the tax dollars.
<P>
	The bill proposes to advance the equality of status of English 
and French with the use of federal tax dollars. The provinces 
should be controlling language, not the federal government. 
Again special interests will benefit and all Canadians will pay.
<P>
	The bill will allow spending tax dollars on state ceremonies 
and Canadian symbols. May we ask what ceremonies and what 
symbols, or dare we ask?
<P>
	The bill also proposes to fund with tax dollars the formulation 
of cultural policy as it relates to foreign investment. Can anyone 
in the House tell Canadians exactly what this means? Who 
knows? I doubt if this government knows either.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="6847"> 6847 </A></B>

	<B>Ms. Paddy Torsney (Burlington, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, today 
marks a significant event in the history of our nation. Sixty-five 
years ago on October 18, 1929, Canadian women were formally 
recognized as persons by the British Privy Council.
<P>
	This victory came after a lengthy political and legal battle led 
by the famous five: Emily Murphy, Louise McKinney, Nellie 
McClung, Irene Parlby, and Henrietta Muir Edwards, five 
persons of incredible vision and perseverance.
<P>
	As a result of their work and the subsequent decision, women 
became eligible for appointment to the Senate. One year later in 
1930 Corinne Wilson became the first woman to sit in the Senate 
of Canada.
<P>
	Today with 18 women in our Senate, we continue to work 
toward equality for all persons in every facet of our society. As 
we keep alive the spirit of the famous five and the legacy of the 
persons case, Canadians can be proud of our strong history of 
activism and our continued commitment to social justice.

	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière, B.Q.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
presenting his economic statement yesterday, the Minister of 
Finance simply added a purple cover to the document presented 
in 1984 by the Liberals' new mentor, Michael Wilson.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance is trying to tell us that social 
programs are the main obstacle to employment in Canada. 
Nevertheless, considering how much the population has grown 
in the past five years, we are still some 800,000 jobs short of the 
1990 employment level. That is nothing to boast about.
<P>
	Given this fact, what are they proposing to us? Solutions 
which the Liberals criticized and scorned every day that the 
Conservatives were in office. There is a limit to inconsistency
<P>
and political expediency. From their first reactions, the people 
know this limit better than the Minister of Finance does.

	<B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, Trooper 
Kyle Brown has been sentenced to five years in jail on charges of 
manslaughter in the death of a Somali prisoner. The minister of 
defence is now appealing, demanding a longer sentence for 
Brown.
<P>
	The minister and the military establishment knew all along 
that a longstanding defence existed for Brown who was obeying 
an order of his superiors, an order that he did not understand to 
be so outrageous as to be obviously illegal. The Supreme Court 
last March reaffirmed the availability of this defence.
<P>
	Furthermore, the minister and the military establishment 
ignored the well known effect of Mefloquine, a malaria drug 
administered to Canadian troops in Somalia. Side effects 
include violent dreams, hallucinations, confusion, anxiety and 
mental depression. Mefloquine could have precipitated the 
murder of the prisoner and Master Corporal Matchee's 
attempted suicide.
<P>
	The minister of defence should today order the release from 
military detention of Trooper Kyle Brown pending an 
investigation into this affair.

	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon 
(Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 65 
years ago today, women won the right to be recognized as 
persons.
<P>
	We in the Liberal Party use persons day to honour the 
accomplishments of women and to acknowledge that we still 
have a long way to go. The members across the way in the 
Reform Party celebrate it by belittling the accomplishments of 
women.
<P>
	The member for St. Paul dismissed women in the Liberal 
caucus, claiming they were given their jobs by the Prime 
Minister. She must be confused by her own party's selection 
process. After all, it was the Reform Party that had candidates 
fill out an application form.
<P>
	Many women contested nominations in the Liberal Party, far 
more than got elected. The battle waged by every female Liberal 
MP was real. The fact they made it through a male dominated 
and sometimes sexist process must not be diminished.

Speaker, I rise today in celebration of the birthday of a very 
important political scientist in our country's history. Today is 
the birthday of Pierre Elliott Trudeau, a man who served this 
country and served this House of Commons for many years, a 
man who believed in strong national programs. From strong 
national programs we created a great national will.
<P>

recognize the great work that he has done on behalf of Canada.

	<B>Mme Maria Minna (Beaches-Woodbine, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the member for Beaver River suggested in her 
statement that some women MPs on the government side were 
not duly elected.
<P>
	The residents of Beaches-Woodbine are well informed on 
their democratic rights as citizens of Canada. After six months 
of meeting and discussing with them the Liberal agenda as 
outlined in the red book and after six months of evaluating my 
credentials and preparedness for public office, the voters of 
Beaches-Woodbine gave me 9,000 votes more than the next 
closest candidate.
<P>
	It would seem that the member has forgotten a very important 
event that took place in October 1993 which is called an 
election.

	<B>Mr. Richard Bélisle (La Prairie, B.Q.):</B> Mr. Speaker, year 
after year, the Auditor General denounces federal 
mismanagement that costs taxpayers billions of dollars.
<P>
	Do you want some examples? What about the $4 billion 
wasted by inefficient federal management of real property? 
What about the $3 billion of contracts issued without bids, when 
the Auditor General himself says that $1 billion could have been 
saved here? And what about the billions of dollars of military 
spending that is no longer justified today?
<P>
	Instead of slashing only social programs that meet the needs 
of the poorest people in our society, the government should first 
clean up its own yard. Examples of wasted public funds are not 
lacking. The government should start by properly correcting its 
poor management instead of blaming the unemployed for all the 
fiscal problems in this country.

	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to draw the attention of this House to a 
piece of propaganda masquerading as a news story.
<P>
	In this story Alliance Quebec wrongly accuses the Reform of 
wanting a unilingual country by passing a resolution at our 
assembly calling for the repeal of the Official Languages Act.
<P>
	This is the type of propaganda the government and its status 
quo allies use to colour the fact. If the government and its 
language lap-dogs were to speak the truth they would tell 
Canadians that the repeal of the act will cost nothing but will 
save millions.
<P>
	Bilingualism in Canada is safe through the guarantees 
contained in the BNA and the charter. Alliance Quebec knows 
these facts but refuses to state them, not because it fears for the 
future of French and English in Canada but because it fears the 
loss of over a million dollars in annual federal funds which it 
receives through the Official Languages Act.
<P>

$534,738,000,000.

is right for Canada. We were elected because of our commitment

	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, B.Q.):</B> Mr. Speaker, there was 
disbelief on international financial markets after the comments 
made yesterday by the Minister of Finance. The fact is that these 
stakeholders are simply asking the minister to take concrete 
action to stop the wasting of public money. Yet, one year after 
his appointment, the Minister of Finance is still content to 
merely look at the extent of the damage caused to Canadian 
government finances.
<P>
	The deputy chairman of the Deustche Bank of Canada 
summarized the concerns of the financial community when he 
said that the finance minister's pledge to lower the deficit is 
certainly praiseworthy, but that investors will want to see 
concrete action. Must we conclude from the finance minister's 
failure that our 127-year old federal structure is too heavy and 
obsolete to adequately meet the challenge of improving the 
situation of government finances?

speaking of howling, it appears I may have struck a chord by 
questioning the Liberals' nomination not election process. The 
normally docile government backbenchers came alive with 
protests and howls of indignation.
<P>
	The hon. member for Cumberland-Colchester passionately 
claimed that she was duly elected in her riding and the hon. 
member for Edmonton East-I could go on and on today-went 
to great lengths to show that residents in her riding and no one 
else chose a Liberal candidate.

	How about some testimonials from those who were perhaps 
appointed? How about the hon. member for 
Etobicoke-Lakeshore? Why is she so quiet? What about York 
Centre or Hull-Aylmer? Nothing to say? We want testimonials 
from these people. How about my friend from 
Saskatoon-Humboldt? Does she have any comments on the 
nomination?
<P>
	Were these people appointed or democratically nominated, 
not elected? Do they subscribe to the views of their Prime 
Minister who when asked why he appointed more than 14 
candidates, male and female, said in a press conference 
``sometimes Canadians just cannot be trusted to make the right

Saskatchewan and was pleased with both the boys and girls

<P>
	These fine young men and women from all across our country 
have developed their skills and talents at the championship level 
and deserve the recognition of all the members of the House. 
Together with their hard work and effort this competition has

apprenticeship programs in New Brunswick. Over those 50 
years 50,000 diplomas and certificates have been granted to 
New Brunswick students in 65 different occupational areas.

	New Brunswick is proud to offer its citizens new occupational 
programs in the field of high technology, thus preparing them to

	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, B.Q.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, yesterday the Minister of Finance sounded the 
alarm on the state of federal public finances. He said, and I 
quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We are in hock up to our eyeballs. That can't be sustained.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Does he share 
the gloomy diagnosis of the distressing state of federal finances, 
as given by his Minister of Finance? Does he intend to take 
urgent action to kill the deficit?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, when you are $500 billion in debt, you have a serious 
problem. That is what the Minister of Finance said yesterday, 
and we are taking steps to remedy the situation by reducing the 
annual deficit. The objective we clearly stated in our campaign 
platform was to bring the deficit down to 3 per cent of GDP after 
three years. We will do what it takes to get there.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, B.Q.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, once again, all we get is words and a rehash of the 
objectives the government set out in the red book more than a 
year ago. What we have is a case of total paralysis, as confirmed 
by the Prime Minister, while his Minister of Finance also told 
him yesterday that the situation is untenable.
<P>
	My question to the Prime Minister is this: Does he not realize 
that after almost a year in power, it is high time that his 
government decided to act and that what he just said is no longer 
enough to calm the growing concerns of the financial 
community?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we brought down a budget in February, and we 
predicted a deficit of $39.7 billion. We are confident that at the 
end of the year, we will be below that level.
<P>
	At the time, we also predicted that the deficit would be around 
$32 billion at the end of the second year and would drop to $25 
billion-the level required to meet our objective of 3 per 
cent-by the end of the third year. We said, I said so myself as 
did the Minister of Finance, that we would do what it takes to 
meet our objectives.

<B><A NAME="6851"> 6851 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, B.Q.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister has been very frank with us, 
since he just told the House they will do absolutely nothing 
between now and the budget next February to deal with the 
disastrous situation his government just disclosed. This is a 
very serious matter. We have here a clear and flagrant 
admission of irresponsibility.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, through you I would like to say to the Prime 
Minister, and to the government that has often asked us for 
suggestions on concrete measures that the Bloc has been 
suggesting concrete measures for some time but the government 
has refused to listen. What is the government waiting for to 
cut- Here are some concrete measures. Make a note of them, 
why not. What is the government waiting for to cut the fat out of 
federal operating expenditures? To eliminate the 
unconscionable waste caused by administrative overlap? To get 
rid of tax havens? To abolish the undue privilege represented by 
family trusts? Those are concrete proposals. Would the Prime 
Minister care to respond?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the question put by the Leader of the Opposition is a 
very broad one. He is talking about fat and unconscionable 
spending, without being more specific, which is exactly what 
the Minister of Finance is being now. He is talking to committee 
members. As for family trusts, the problem, as suggested by the 
Finance critic for the Bloc Quebecois, was referred to the 
committee that is looking into the matter right now, to see if 
family trusts are paying the taxes they should be paying. We will 
act on the committee's recommendations as soon as the 
committee has finished its work.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, B.Q.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, when it comes to reducing the deficit, the government 
is still turning a deaf ear to the various suggestions it receives 
from all over, including the Official Opposition. The 
government's only recipe is massive cuts in social programs, at 
the expense of the poorest people and the unemployed. To do 
this dirty work, the Minister of Finance is counting on his 
colleague in Human Resources Development.
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	Why does the Prime Minister refuse to admit that his 
government is going the wrong way by attacking the poorest 
people and the middle class with cuts to social programs, when 
he should first reduce his spending, end waste and duplication 
and fight tax evasion?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if the member would take the time to read the paper 
presented by the Minister of Human Resources Development he 
would see that what we are doing is taking some of the money 
available, not to give it to frequent claimants and so on, but we 
want to give them the training they need so that they will be able 
to have a job and have the dignity of working.
<P>
	Canadians do not want the people of Canada who are 
unfortunately unemployed to remain on welfare or 
unemployment insurance. What they want is a government that 
will use this money to create jobs so they will have the dignity of 
working. That is exactly what this government will do for them.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, B.Q.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, they are putting a purple colour on the Conservatives' 
blue book, which says that we are in the red. Does the 
government's inaction in the past year and its inability to attack 
the deficit not confirm that the federal structure is too 
cumbersome, paralysed, paralysing and incapable of the 
downsizing required to reduce the debt crisis?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we have faced up to our responsibilities. We were the 
only political party that put in writing in a red book exactly how 
we would achieve our objective. The financial community 
thinks that it is a realistic objective; a deficit of 3 per cent of the 
gross national product is the level required in Europe for all 
countries in the European Community to qualify for the new 
European currency, the ecu.
<P>
	Right now, I think that not one European country has been 
able to achieve this level, but we will get there in the third year 
of our mandate, as we promised in writing in our red book. If you 
want a copy, I can send you one; I have it here.

urgency and importance of reducing the deficit and the debt and 
this is going to cripple the government's deficit reducing efforts.
<P>
	Some ministers such as the finance minister appear to 
recognize and demand more serious and substantive spending 
reductions. Other ministers such as the Deputy Prime Minister 
only reluctantly agree to mild spending reduction. The silence 
from the Prime Minister is deafening.

	The cabinet and the Prime Minister's resolve to substantially 
reduce spending is still in doubt. Yesterday I directed a question

finance minister. I note also that the Canadian dollar dropped 
yesterday. I do not know if there was any connection.

	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> I will read from the red 
book. Any responsible government must have as its goal the 
elimination of the deficit. This is our goal.
<P>
<B>(1425) </B>
<P>
	Given the current state of the economy a realistic interim 
target for the Liberal government is to seek to reduce the deficit 
to 3 per cent of gross domestic product by the end of its third 
year in office and we will do it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the money markets believe that the cabinet is divided 
and many Canadians do too. If the cabinet does not get its act 
together we are going to need another aisle in this House with 
the hard headed Liberals and Reformers on one side and the soft 
headed Liberals and the Bloc members on the other.
<P>
	The other evident division in the cabinet is between those who 
think that tax increases are still possible and advisable and those 
who know that they are not.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister give an unequivocal guarantee that 
tax increases are not an option for deficit reduction?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have a lot of very nice members of Parliament but 
they want to be re-elected and they do not want to be seen with 
the Reform Party. That is a very good reason to keep our team 
together.
<P>
	We are preparing the next budget at this time. It is the first 
time since I have been a member of Parliament, and it has been 
quite a few years, that there are prebudget consultations with the 
Canadian public. The Minister of Finance tabled documents 
yesterday. He is tabling more documents today and everybody 
will be able to have input. There will be a budget and what will 
be in the budget will be written after we have listened. If we are 
consulting it is better not to make up our minds before  the end of 
the consultation. We do not want to laugh at people that way.

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, B.Q.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
notwithstanding the extremely difficult fiscal background 
described by the Minister of Finance yesterday, we learn that the 
Canadian Army is presently taking part in an international 
missile firing competition in Florida.
<P>
	Canadian F-18s are expected to launch missiles that cost up to 
$400,000 each. We are also told that over 60 members of the 
Canadian Forces-pilots, technicians, controllers-are taking 
part in this competition called Operation William Tell.
<P>
	In the present context where the government is about to cut 
billions of dollars at the expense of the poorest of the poor and 
the middle class, does the Minister of National Defence not 
agree that he should immediately put a stop to this shameful 
waste?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Michael Collenette (Minister of National 
Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member displays his ignorance about the role of the 
armed forces. That was obviously seen in the manifesto of the 
Bloc Quebecois in the last election when it called for a 25 per 
cent cut in defence expenditures and then objected to cuts when 
they occurred.
<P>
	With respect to the William Tell exercise this is a normal 
exercise by the Canadian air force and it involves the firing of 
live missiles which cannot be done in Canada and can be done 
under the auspices of a bilateral training agreement we have 
with the United States. This is nothing abnormal, it is done quite 
frequently.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, B.Q.):</B> Mr. Speaker, let us 
put the question to the Prime Minister; he seems to have a lot to 
say on this matter. How can the Prime Minister of Canada 
tolerate such squandering at a time when our country is literally 
on the brink of bankruptcy, according to his Minister of 
Finance? Should he not be acting to stop the squandering 
allowed by his defence minister, with his tacit consent?
<P>
<B>(1430) </B>
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we have commitments to other countries. And Canada 
stands to gain from European forces coming to train in Canada 
on a regular basis as part of these military exchange programs 
between allies. There is, as a matter of fact, some controversy 
about this in Labrador.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6853"> 6853 </A></B>
<P>
	So, we have more foreign military training in Canada than 
Canadians training abroad. This cannot be a purely unilateral 
affair. We must co-operate with the other forces, and that is 
precisely what the Minister of National Defense is doing. In 
the case in point, he is co-operating with the Americans, but 
when the Belgians, the Germans or other forces come and train 
in Canada, in one province or the other, we all like to see them 
spending money in Canada. It helps the Canadian economy.

	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday the finance minister presented a policy paper that in 
many respects, to be fair, is supportable. One of the minister's 
points was that increased productivity was key to economic 
growth. Yet just the day before the Deputy Prime Minister 
released a report calling for billions of dollars of new gasoline 
green taxes.
<P>
	Would the Prime Minister state the position of the 
government in promoting productivity? Does the government 
advocate raising taxes or lowering taxes?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I never released any 
such report.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Deputy Prime Minister knows that every time Canadians go to 
fill up their gas tanks with $25 worth of gas, it costs $12.50 in 
federal and provincial taxes. Yet through her rather 
uncharacteristic silence she has implied that even higher 
gasoline and carbon taxes are possible; she has implied that.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of the Environment. So that it 
is very clear to Canadians, will the Minister of the Environment 
demonstrate her commitment to improving the productivity, as 
was stated in the paper yesterday, of Canadian business by 
rejecting any kind of proposed tax grab in the carbon industry?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I just told the whole 
House that I never released any such report.
<P>
	If the member wants to be true to the people of Canada, why 
does he not tell the truth and admit in the House that the Minister 
of the Environment in no way released any such report. Stop 
setting up strawmen so you can try to burn them down.

	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, B.Q.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	Yesterday, the Minister of Finance announced in his economic 
statement that the government intends to end subsidies for 
megaprojects. While the government slashes social programs, it 
will sink over $250 million into the Hibernia project this year 
alone.
<P>
	If the Prime Minister wants to be taken seriously, are we to 
understand that his government has now committed itself to not 
sinking the additional hundreds of millions of dollars required 
by the Hibernia project?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, several million dollars have already been spent on this 
project, which will be completed within two or three years. 
Ending the project now would make us lose all the money 
already invested. If we had to do it all over again, perhaps we 
should not have gone ahead. However, stopping now would be 
an enormous loss. We must complete this project because, when 
it starta producing oil and natural gas in three or four years, we 
will be able to recover if not all at least a large part of the money 
invested so far. We would be very ill-advised to stop now, as 
these investments will start paying off in two or three years.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, B.Q.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Prime Minister has a short memory. He should remember that 
his party supported the Hibernia project when they were in 
opposition.
<P>
	How can the Prime Minister refuse to make a commitment not 
to invest any more public funds in this very risky venture, when 
there is no evidence that this project will ever be profitable?
<P>
<B>(1435) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, a minute ago I explained something very simple to the 
member. There was a lot of investment in that and some of these 
projects have not produced the results anticipated. It happens 
like that many times.
<P>
	At the moment we have invested millions of dollars in that 
project. The project is scheduled to start producing oil in three 
years and will be an available resource to be sold abroad or for 
Canadians to use in Canada.
<P>
	It would be stupid to stop the project at this time because we 
would lose the benefits that would come from it. I must tell the 
hon. member that a lot of the work on the project is being done in 
Quebec at the moment.

The Prime Minister invited the premiers to the same forum and

<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we were committed in the red book to having a forum 
of that nature. We kept our word. When we introduced the 
project members of the opposition said that we had to invite 
some people from the provinces.
<P>
	The minister negotiated with them. At the beginning they 
asked to have several representatives. We said that was fine. 
After that they wanted to have as many as ten. We said that was 
fine. Some said some premiers would like to be there, that we 
should let them come. We said yes, yes and yes. If they do not 
come we are back to square one.
<P>
	We began with no invitations. We have now invited them and 
they are not coming. We will just do what we said we would do in

National Forum on Health, the Prime Minister has written to his 
provincial counterparts inviting them to attend on a consultative 
basis. The Minister of Health sent a similar invitation to her 
provincial counterparts but never received any answers.
<P>
	How can the government persist in trying to hold its National 
Forum on Health when it is so obvious that the provinces do not 
wish to participate in that forum in its present form?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this is a consultation exercise involving experts as well 
as other stakeholders. We asked the provinces to make 
suggestions and we welcomed their proposals. The forum is not 
a decision-making body. Its purpose is to look at the issue and 
make recommendations. This exercise is not binding on the 
federal government nor on the provinces. There are other 
initiatives involving the provinces, such as the meeting of 
federal and provincial health ministers.
<P>
	Again, this is not a federal-provincial program: it is a

make any decisions; I will simply preside and listen. I invited 
these people to discuss the issue. I will not be making speeches.

the provinces, the National Forum on Health will be a totally 
futile exercise which will cost over $12 million to Canadian 
taxpayers?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we have the support of all intermediary organizations 
involved, including the Canadian Hospital Association, the 
Canadian Medical Association and others, because they realize 
that in order to have a national plan, we must establish national 
standards. Also, what works in one province could be used

in 1993?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr.

service in the country that loses over $300 million a year and is

	The hon. member would know, because he has a very definite 
interest in it, that we are trying to do everything we can to 
maintain levels of service across the country. It is true that we 
have made cuts to VIA with respect to personnel. There have 
been no cuts or even requests put before us for eliminating any 
of the routes.
<P>
	We still have another area to look at, that is what happens with 
the ongoing labour negotiations at VIA. The commitment of the

Public Accounts of Canada were tabled today. The Minister of 
Finance included in his 1994 deficit prediction half a billion

one of the reasons the 1994 deficit is lower than the minister's 
original prediction is that the cost of that tax boondoggle was 
added to the previous year's deficit.
<P>
	When will the government come clean with the Canadian 
public and make real, and I mean real, cuts to the deficit rather 
than use smoke and mirrors to make us think that progress is 
being made?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to 
answer the question because we have made real cuts. We made 
real cuts in our budget of February. We took $5 of spending cuts 
for every dollar in taxes. They were real cuts and we will meet 
our deficit target.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, perhaps 
we should debate real cuts. The government did not stop there. It 
changed the 1993 accounts to make the 1994 accounts look 
good. The government reduced the 1993 deficit by $569 million. 
It reduced the 1995 projected deficit by $200 million due to 
accounting changes, and there is not one penny of savings to the 
Canadian taxpayer.
<P>
	What is the reduction in the 1994 deficit that will be dumped 
on the Canadian taxpayer's lap in coming years by accounting 
changes that are supposed to be deficit reductions?
<P>

then education minister, by myself and by Daniel Johnson.
<P>
	This general agreement is still in force. This agreement 
benefits people in the area by keeping the Collège de Saint-Jean 
open with a military presence and students coming from the 
Quebec education system. It would be a great pity if the Quebec 
government were to indicate now that it does not want to abide 
by the terms of the general agreement, but I do hope that it will 
not do so.

costly duplication?

which the hon. member refers, but I am sure, given the long

embarrassment to a favourite program not only of this 
government but also of the Mulroney government.
<P>
	Why should we expect a different standard from the current 
catch of DFO insiders appointed to examine this minister's 
handling of the 1994 salmon disaster on the west coast?
<P>
<B>(1455 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his question. If he 
were serious about seeing constructive improvement in the 
management of the salmon resource in British Columbia, rather 
than getting up and asking questions and impugning the 
reputation of somebody like the Hon. John Fraser, former 
Speaker of the House of Commons, who chairs the panel that he 
has called the panel of Liberal insiders, he might do what the 
president of the Fisheries Council of British Columbia and what 
the president of the Union of Fishermen of British Columbia did 
at lunch time today. They sat and had a constructive meeting 
with me to get something positive done, not just to throw out 
allegations.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the former 
Speaker of the House is hardly independent. He is now an 
appointee of the government as ambassador for the 
environment.
<P>
	The 35,000 member B.C. Wildlife Federation and the 12,000 
member B.C. Fishermen's Survival Coalition have joined me in 
calling for an independent judicial inquiry.
<P>
	When will the minister acknowledge the growing support for 
this and act?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is questions like these that test the 
so-called commitment of the leader of the Reform Party to give 
due recognition to the honour and integrity of people who have 
served long and well in the public good of the country. That kind 
of attack on the former Speaker of the House of Commons is 
unwarranted and I shall look to see Mr. Manning repudiate it 
right away.

	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, B.Q.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs.
<P>
	Yesterday, the minister made light of an unacceptable, 
insidious and inflammatory statement made by an employee of 
the Canadian embassy in Japan, namely the academic relations 
officer. This employee accused Hydro-Quebec, on the basis of 
an ad that this provincial Crown Corporation had nothing to do 
with, of fuelling racial tensions between Quebecers and the 
Mohawks.
<P>
	Does the minister not realize that, by refusing to call this 
employee to order, he is in fact condoning a glaring breach of 
ethics and lack of judgment?
<P>
	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, after this question was put to me in this House 
yesterday, I asked an official of my department to make an 
inquiry. Naturally, as the alleged incident took place in Japan, I 
have not received an answer yet, but as soon as I have, I will 
gladly follow up on the hon. member's question.

	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Transport.
<P>
	During his speech on the proposed amendments to Bill C-22 
the minister stated that the Pearson consortium was seeking 
$445 million in damages through the courts. In fact that is his 
answer to virtually every question we ask.
<P>
	However court documents clearly indicate no amount has 
been claimed, only the right to have damages settled by an 
arbitration tribunal in accordance with the provisions of the 
airport contract.
<P>
	Can the minister tell the House why he is continually 
misstating the facts? Is it because he is trying to scare the public 
into

<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we did not get the true face of Reform last week but we 
are getting it today.
<P>
	In the documents presented to the court the claim is for some 
$172 million but there are third party claims as well. What I said 
to the hon. member, and what I say to the people of Canada, is 
that the total amount of claims that have been submitted to Mr. 
Wright, who represents the Government of Canada in this matter 
is $445 million that the deficit cutting Reform Party is prepared 
to put at risk just to satisfy its little political games.

Immigration.
<P>
	Persons responsible for criminal atrocities may attempt to 
gain entry to Canada following an exodus of military police and 
paramilitary personnel from Haiti. In particular, the attachés 
and the tontons macoutes have been implicated in human rights 
violations and murders against the Haitian people.
<P>
	What is the government doing to ensure that these human 
rights abusers are prevented from gaining entry into Canada?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
his very sensitive question and say two things.
<P>
	First, those individuals who commit acts against humanity are 
inadmissible under the Immigration Act. This includes 
individuals who have been involved with de facto regimes in 
Haiti since the coups of September 1991.
<P>
	Second, individuals wanting to visit Canada from Haiti or to 
make application as landed immigrants need to have security 
checks. In that regard a list is being compiled of all persons who 
have been close to all de facto regimes, including individuals 
who may have perpetrated acts against humanity, so that our 
officials and our offices may be advised that such individuals 
are inadmissible.
<P>
	We are taking every possible precaution to protect society 
against those who have contributed to acts against humanity.

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="DEPARTMENTOFCANADIANHERITAGEACT">DEPARTMENT OF CANADIAN HERITAGE ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill 
C-53, an act to establish the Department of Canadian Heritage 
and to amend and repeal certain other acts, be read the second 
time and referred to a committee; and of the amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
before question period I opposed the bill. After question period, 
realizing we went another $8 million into debt, I oppose it even 
more. Now it is $8.5 million and climbing.
<P>
	The bill proposes to allow the minister to provide financial 
assistance in the form of grants, contributions and endowments 
to any person. If that is not an invitation for every special 
interest group to bend the ear of the minister and grab tax 
dollars, I do not know what is.
<P>
	The problem with that is quite simply that we have no tax 
dollars to spare. We are spending 39 cents of every tax dollar to 
fund the interest on our debt, and the government wants to spend 
some of the remaining 61 cents to satisfy special interests. It 
sounds like a red book Liberal idea to me.
<P>
	The bill proposes to allow the minister to establish a Canadian 
council composed of seven to twelve part time members, 
including a chairperson, one or two vice-chairs and not more 
than nine other members to be appointed and hold office during 
the pleasure of the governor in council.
<P>
	If that is not an ideal position for hacks, special interests and 
friends of the government to feed at the tax trough, I do not know 
what is. At a time when the government will not reduce our 
deficit spending or debt, the government wants to spend more 
tax dollars on cronies. The patronage continues.
<P>
<B>(1505) </B>
<P>
	The bill proposes that the head office location of the Canadian 
council be set by the minister. Are there any bets the chosen 
location has no relation to the bill but has significant political 
meaning to the government?
<P>
	The bill offers the government further excuses to give its 
political cronies, hacks and high donation buddies ample funds 
from the public trough and easily allows any special interest 
group that can successfully lobby the government its turn at the 
trough.
<P>
	The bill does not take into consideration the fiscal and 
financial state of the treasury. The manner in which this tax and 
spend government will tax Canadians to spend their hard earned 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6859"> 6859 </A></B>
<P>
dollars on political favours and to further increase the feeding 
frenzy of political hacks and cronies for which the government 
is famous will know no bounds if the bill is passed into 
legislation.
<P>
	At a time when the government readily admits essential 
services desired by Canadians will be reduced, how can it justify 
further expenditures of tax dollars on the funding of hacks, 
special interest groups and friends of the minister?
<P>
	Canadians must now ask whether they support the continuing 
waste of tax dollars being presented in the bill. I know what 
grassroot Canadians will say. It would be a resounding no. It is 
too bad grassroot Canadians could not get constituent 
representation with members of the government, because the 
bill would never be tabled for consideration if they would bother 
finding out. The government prides itself on making the tough 
decisions without having to ask its constituents for their input. 
The government has already said it knows what is best for 
Canada.
<P>
	With bills like this one Canadians know the government only 
knows what is best for its friends who will feed at the trough 
well established by this kind of bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, the bill describes the central role that the 
Department of Canadian Heritage will be called to play in the 
life of Canada and Canadians.
<P>
	The legislation creates a department which will have 
responsibilities in the areas of national parks, historic sites, 
cultural development, amateur sports, multiculturalism and 
official languages. All those areas have clear links to our 
identity as Canadians.
<P>
	I will speak today specifically about the official languages 
responsibilities of the Department of Canadian Heritage, the 
English and French languages and the people who speak them 
that have shaped Canada and helped define its identity. Surely 
Canada's linguistic duality has its origins in the very nature of 
the country.
<P>
	The official languages policies put forward by the 
Government of Canada since the 1970s are the reflection of a 
generous and creative vision of Canada. It is a Canada where 
English and French speaking citizens can feel at home wherever 
they choose to live. It is a vision of Canada where vital English 
speaking and French speaking minority language communities 
can contribute to the economic, social, cultural and scientific 
life of the country.
<P>
	In order to translate this vision into reality, federal 
institutions have become bilingual. It is the institutions that 
have become bilingual. The government co-operates with the 
provinces to ensure that our linguistic duality is reflected in the 
education system and other services in the areas of justice and 
health.
<P>
	The government has recognized that it has a role in enhancing 
the vitality and development of official language communities 
from coast to coast to coast, both by supporting the development 
of their institutions and by supporting their efforts to have their 
rights respected. It has also worked to promote the recognition 
and the use of two official languages with a wide range of 
organizations within Canadian society.
<P>
	The official languages programs of the Department of 
Canadian Heritage are designed to provide opportunities for 
Canadians to appreciate and profit from our rich linguistic 
heritage and to communicate with and participate in federal 
institutions.
<P>
<B>(1510 ) </B>
<P>
	The Government of Canada believes that the great majority of 
Canadians share these goals. We all know that the Canada of 
tomorrow is being built in the classrooms of today. Few would 
doubt the importance of education to any community and of 
support for minority language education. The federal 
government works toward the full participation of both 
language groups in all aspects of Canadian society.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	These programs do much more than support the vital 
contribution of official language minority communities. They 
allow them to contribute to our country's economic growth. For 
example, recent progress in education for francophone 
minorities has been a big help in reducing the illiteracy and 
school drop-out rates, thus raising the post-secondary 
attendance rate.
<P>
	The 1991 census revealed that the number of francophones 
outside Quebec went up slightly in absolute numbers. Nearly 1 
million French speaking Canadians, or about 14 per cent of 
Canadian francophones, live outside Quebec. They are found in 
all regions of the country and account for about a third of the 
population of New Brunswick. The largest community in terms 
of numbers is in Ontario, where almost 1 million francophones 
live.
<P>
	Even in my own province of Manitoba, there is a significant 
number of francophones and a vibrant community. Minority 
language education is a good indicator of these communities' 
viability. There are some 660 French language primary and 
secondary public schools outside Quebec. By ratifying the 
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms in 1982, the federal 
and provincial governments made commitments to official 
language communities.
<P>
	Section 23 of the Charter gives minorities the right to be 
educated in their own language and to manage their own 
schools, as just happened in Manitoba. In the Mahé decision, the 
Supreme Court said that this section is ``the cornerstone of 
Canada's commitment to bilingualism and biculturalism be-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6860"> 6860 </A></B>
<P>
cause of the essential role of education in maintaining and 
developing linguistic and cultural vitality''.
<P>
	By allowing parents to fully participate in the operations of 
their school boards and ensuring that together they can turn their 
schools into truly francophone living environments, we also 
discourage dropping out and give a head start to several 
generations of our very young children. That is why the federal 
government must continue to help the provinces and territories 
fulfil their constitutional obligations to their official language 
minorities.
<P>
	As with any government policy, this policy, its objectives and 
its implementation may be misunderstood and misinterpreted. 
Even here in the House of Commons, we hear comments that 
reflect a misunderstanding of the objectives of the federal policy 
on official languages. I would like to take this opportunity to 
clarify certain facts about supposedly imposed bilingualism.
<P>
	The 1969 Official Languages Act stated that French and 
English had equal status in all Canadian parliamentary and 
government institutions. It was revised later to take into account 
the provisions of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As a result of this policy everyone has the right to use English 
and French in Parliament and Parliament must enact its laws in 
English and in French. Everyone has the right to appear and 
proceed in the official language of choice before any federal 
court and any criminal court. The public has the right to 
communicate with and receive services from the institutions of 
Parliament and the federal government in either of the two 
official languages.
<P>
	English speaking and French speaking Canadians have equal 
opportunities for employment and advancement in federal 
institutions. The composition of federal institutions must reflect 
the presence of the two official languages communities in 
Canada.
<P>
<B>(1515 ) </B>
<P>
	The federal government is bilingual so that the citizens do not 
have to be. Every Canadian has the right to remain unilingual. 
Universal bilingualism has never ever been the goal of the 
policy. The B and B commission stated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A bilingual country is a country where the principal public institutions must 
provide services in two languages to citizens, the vast majority of whom may 
very well be unilingual.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The key concept in all of this is that it is the choice of 
individual Canadians. So much for the supposed enforced 
bilingualism.
<P>
	This policy is one that not only reflects what Canada was, 
what Canada is and what Canada can be. It is an open policy, a 
policy that reaches out and encourages people to participate in 
the official language of their choice. In doing so it does not 
exclude other groups from participating fully in Canadian life. 
That is what sets it apart.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I could speak for a long time but I understand that I am coming 
to the end of my speech. It is unfortunate because I had so much 
to say. However, I would like to close simply by asking all 
members of the House of Commons to look with their eyes, their 
minds and their hearts open at this policy encouraging all 
Canadians to get involved.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, B.Q.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
thank you for allowing me to make a comment on Bill C-53.
<P>
	With the establishment of the Department of Canadian 
Heritage, the government only accentuates existing differences. 
Once again, the federal government ignores the cultural 
distinctiveness of Quebec by attempting to promote a 
hypothetical Canadian identity. The minister's mandate is at 
odds with Quebec's fundamental interests. The Liberal 
government openly denies the distinct and specific character of 
Quebec. Moreover, it seeks to reinforce even more the 
centralizing power of the federal government, at the expense of 
provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	Ottawa will make decisions affecting Quebecers' culture, 
based on its own priorities. One can imagine what bright future 
awaits our province. Already, the allocation of smaller budgets 
is an unfair treatment. Indeed, the discrepancy in the budgets for 
Radio-Canada and CBC is a blatant example of federal 
bilingualism. The budget of the English network is more than 
double that of the French one, this-and make no mistake about 
that-for an equivalent number of viewers. We are not talking 
about population but about the number of people who watch 
television.
<P>
	For the same public interest program, the English network 
spends $58,000, compared to $34,000 for the French one, in 
spite of the fact that the number of viewers is the same. This 
discrepancy is a blatant example of so-called federal 
bilingualism. When the Liberal government says white it means 
black. The Liberals talk about bilingualism but they do not 
provide the same means to French-speaking and English 
speaking groups. I could go on and on.
<P>
<B>(1520) </B>
<P>
	Considering that the cultural future of a nation is based on its 
language, we can see that the efforts to promote a Canadian 
identity will ignore Quebec's own cultural identity.
<P>
	But there is more. This bill does nothing to correct the 
government's inconsistency regarding the sharing of 
departmental responsibilities. On the contrary, it accentuates 
the existing discrepancies. Why is that? Is it to slow down the 
process? Is it to increase costs? Maybe. It becomes difficult to 
understand the inconsistencies of the Liberal government. Are 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6861"> 6861 </A></B>
<P>
the Liberals creating an administrative monster over which the 
minister will have no control?
<P>
	This inconsistency on the part of the Liberal government was 
also demonstrated with the information highway. Responsibility 
for policy lies with the Department of Industry, while the 
Department of Canadian Heritage is responsible for content-in 
other words, culture.
<P>
	Both departments share similar responsibilities but differ in 
their approach to procedures and content. Actually, one is 
concerned with the framework, while the other concentrates on 
content. The future seems pretty clear-cut. The Minister of 
Industry will approach culture in a way that promotes the 
interests of large corporations and users, at the expense of the 
creators. Since the Minister of Industry will be responsible for 
programs and policies, this does not leave much room to the 
Minister of Canadian Heritage, who is to reinforce cultural and 
social values.
<P>
	Hon. members must realize that our cultural future is at stake. 
Both departments will be on a parallel course, without any 
consultation between the two. To build something you need 
co-ordination.
<P>
	The House will recall the lack of consultation when the 
Advisory council on the Information Highway was established. 
When appointing the committee, the Minister of Industry failed 
to include members from the cultural community. The Bloc 
believes, and we are not alone in this, that culture lies at the very 
heart of the information highway, and the Bloc Quebecois also 
believes that jurisdiction over culture and communications is a 
provincial matter.
<P>
	Today, Ottawa makes decisions unilaterally. Quebec has been 
excluded from major decisions, where Canadian cultural 
interests are crowding out Quebec's distinct identity. 
Apparently, good government means denying a distinct identity. 
This has been borne out by the Liberal government. In spite of 
repeated requests, it has failed to amend its procedures with 
respect to copyright and intellectual property. The government 
ignores the major contribution made by authors, creators, 
performing artists and other parties in Quebec that make this 
province a living force.
<P>
	One wonders who, will get his views on copyright across, the 
Minister of Industry or the Minister of Canadian Heritage. Will 
it be the Minister of Industry, who prefers the straight copyright 
system that benefits large corporations, or will the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage manage to convince his colleague to opt for a 
copyright system with neighbouring rights. Under this system, 
author, creator, performing artists and producers all enjoy rights 
with respect to the future use to be made of their work.
<P>
	For once, the Liberals will have to get their act together.
<P>
<B>(1525) </B>
<P>
	In this connection, it is a serious mistake to give the Minister 
of Industry ultimate responsibility for copyright policy. This 
area should be the responsibility of the  Minister of Canadian 
Heritage, who would then have a mandate to propose policies to 
Cabinet and to table bills accordingly.
<P>
	Will the Minister of Canadian Heritage, who often says he is 
powerless to act, have enough political clout this time around to 
persuade his colleague to avoid total disaster on such an urgent 
and important matter? Canadian creators have been waiting for a 
long time.
<P>
	Last Sunday on TV, the ADISQ Gala was a good example of 
the work done by Quebec artists to disseminate Quebec culture 
throughout the province, across Canada, in the United States and 
Europe. There are no ifs and buts about it: this bill should be 
revised. In its present form, it contains too many aspects that are 
inconsistent or poorly defined.
<P>
	Therefore, the Bloc Quebecois will support the motion moved 
by the hon. member for Rimouski-Témiscouata.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Glen McKinnon (Brandon-Souris, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak on Bill C-53, the bill to create the 
Department of Canadian Heritage.
<P>
	This bill is designed to give legal status to the amalgamation 
of five previous organizations: the Secretary of State, the 
Department of Multiculturalism and Citizenship, the 
Department of Fitness and Amateur Sport, the Parks Canada 
component of Environment Canada and the cultural 
broadcasting and heritage components of the Department of 
Communications.
<P>
	This new department has functioned well over the past year 
and reflects the government's commitment toward more 
efficient and effective government. The Department of 
Canadian Heritage lays the foundation for the promotion of 
Canadian cultural heritage and identity which are important 
sources of social and economic enrichment.
<P>
	I wish to speak at this time on what I feel to be one of the most 
important aspects of this legislation, the preservation of 
Canada's national heritage.
<P>
	As Canadians we value our freedom, our clean environment, 
the breathtaking beauty of our natural scenery and the hard work 
of those men and women who helped make this country what it is 
today. With this in mind the proposed legislation intends to 
preserve Canada's rich past and to stimulate a profound concern 
for ensuring the survival of historic places, artefacts and 
structures.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6862"> 6862 </A></B>
<P>
	Inasmuch as these areas and sites represent the very essence 
of our identity as Canadians, so is the concern that our historic 
legacy continues to be maintained and that we are motivated 
to protect our natural resources and commemorate our historic 
places.
<P>
	The vast expanse of Canada's environment presents an 
interesting array of terrestrial and marine ecosystems: the 
Arctic tundra, the western mountains, the prairies, the 
Precambrian Shield, the Atlantic, Arctic and Pacific coasts. The 
environment also includes places and landscapes associated 
with our human heritage. These historic places, which represent 
thousands of years of human history and encompass places of 
work and worship, commerce and culture, evoke all our 
aspirations and all our values.
<P>
	For more than a century the Government of Canada has been 
involved in protecting Canada's outstanding national areas and 
in commemorating significant aspects of Canadian history. This 
extensive experience has enabled Canada to be recognized 
internationally as a world leader in the management of heritage.
<P>
	Parks Canada as an integral part of the Department of 
Canadian Heritage is committed to establishing an extensive 
and comprehensive network of protected heritage areas that 
fully represent Canada's natural and cultural heritage.
<P>
<B>(1530 ) </B>
<P>
	Canada's national parks system began in 1885 when 26 square 
kilometres around mineral hot springs near Banff Station, 
Alberta were set aside for public use. The Rocky Mountain Park 
Act of 1887 defined the first parks as public park and pleasure 
grounds for the benefit, advantage and enjoyment of the people 
of Canada.
<P>
	In 1930 the National Parks Act dedicated the national parks to 
the people of Canada for their benefit, education and enjoyment 
and made provisions for their sustained enjoyment for future 
generations.
<P>
	In 1917 Fort Anne in Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia, was set 
aside as a historic site, followed in 1919 by the establishment of 
the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada. These two 
significant events set the ground for Canada's system of national 
historic sites.
<P>
	Following the second world war the Historic Sites and 
Monuments Act of 1953 reflected the strong sense of national 
purpose that was found in Canada. The act provided statutory 
authority for the designation of natural historic sites as well as a 
legislative basis for acquiring and contributing directly to the 
care and preservation of these sites.
<P>
	As Canadians we appreciate the beauty of the natural 
environment and the richness of our history. Canadians share 
this heritage with each other and welcome others to value, 
respect and learn about it. We celebrate the rich heritage through 
national historic sites, national parks, park preserves, heritage 
railway stations, historic canals,  marine conservation areas, 
heritage rivers and federal heritage buildings as well as 
historical markers.
<P>
	These national symbols contribute to our Canadian identity in 
numerous ways and it is for this reason that I eagerly await the 
enactment of the Department of Canadian Heritage.
<P>
	With this legislation Canadians can be assured of the future 
preservation of Canada's illustrious past.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, it 
is my pleasure to speak to Bill C-53 today. This bill establishes 
the Department of Canadian Heritage and amends and repeals 
certain other acts. This bill also makes multiculturalism and the 
official languages the responsibility of the new department. 
That is the topic of my address today.
<P>
	Let me start by repeating what we have already heard from 
this side of the House. The Reform Party supports the rights of 
citizens and private groups to preserve their cultural heritage 
but the Reform Party wants them to do so using their own funds. 
The Reform Party is opposed to using taxpayers' money to fund 
multiculturalism.
<P>
	I am opposed to Bill C-53 because it entrenches 
multiculturalism, bilingualism and the financing of special 
interest groups. I have no problem with different ethnic or 
linguistic groups keeping their culture; I am all for it. As the 
trade critic for the Reform Party I believe this kind of diversity 
is one of Canada's strengths in this great country.
<P>
	New immigrants and second and third generation Canadians 
help Canada display an outward looking approach to business 
and trade practices. They do so by maintaining linguistic, 
cultural and family ties with other countries. Besides speaking 
English and French, Canadians speak many aboriginal 
languages, German, Ukrainian, Mandarin, Arabic, and 
Norwegian, the language of my wife's ancestors.
<P>
	That is great. I have no problems with this and I have no 
problem with different groups maintaining organizations to 
preserve their language and culture. I do not think that 
government should get involved in the process.
<P>
	In my riding of Peace River there is a strong Sons of Norway 
organization which has been in place for 75 years and I have 
some colleagues who know quite a bit about that. How did it 
survive before multiculturalism? It did not need federal 
government grants to survive. It did it on its own initiative.
<P>
	My riding has a strong French population in the Falher area 
which has been there since about 1912. These people kept their 
language alive on their own before there were any federal 
moneys available to them and they did so by their own hard 
work.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6863"> 6863 </A></B>
<P>
	My riding has a German society and a Ukrainian group. All 
of these organizations were doing fine before the federal 
government started emptying its piggy bank.
<P>
<B>(1535 ) </B>
<P>
	My riding also has a Filipino association, an East Indian 
cultural society and a Scottish society. I suspect that all of these 
groups will survive very well on their own initiative and 
according to their own needs when we abandon this very 
divisive policy we have in place.
<P>
	This whole multiculturalism process, and some would say not 
a process but rather a mess, started just over 20 years ago with 
the royal commission on bilingualism and biculturalism. Many 
witnesses appearing before the commission appeared because 
they wanted to protest the notion of two founding peoples and 
two nations. They were right.
<P>
	We in the Reform Party also reject this notion. Canada is a 
very different country today than it was in 1867. Our new 
Canada would be a country of 10 equal provinces all with the 
same opportunities and rights, not one built on two founding 
peoples.
<P>
	After all, a country built on two founding peoples in 1867 did 
not even recognize that the very first people here, the aboriginal 
people, certainly should have fit into that category. It was 
misguided from the very beginning. Before the English and 
French came to this country Indians and Eskimos were the first 
people here. We have seen several waves of immigration since.
<P>
	We were all immigrants to this country at one time or another, 
but we do not need the federal government to promote our 
culture and languages. We can do it very well on our own.
<P>
	At the time of the royal commission on bilingualism and 
biculturalism, roughly 44 per cent of the population could claim 
to be of British descent; 29 per cent could claim to be of French 
descent; another 27 came from other ethnic backgrounds, 
German, Italian, Ukrainian, Dutch, Polish, native Indian, 
Chinese, Jewish or East Indian.
<P>
	People who sprang from stock other than English and French 
objected to the notion that these two were the most important 
groups in Canada. They made the point that Canada is a mosaic 
of people from many different ethnic and linguistic 
backgrounds.
<P>
	Prime Minister Trudeau announced the official 
multiculturalism policy in 1971. Many people felt it was meant 
to diffuse the concerns about official bilingualism in areas 
where there was absolutely no need for a second language.
<P>
	Multiculturalism started with a budget of $3.5 million. The 
budget has since grown to $39 million. Of this almost $15 
million is spent on community support; $5.5 million goes to 
heritage cultures; and $6.5 million goes to race relations. Many 
proponents of multiculturalism today point to race relations, the 
last item, as being a worthy area of funding. I would agree.
<P>
	Racism is a problem in Canada today and there is a role for the 
federal government to play here. Racism is not a multicultural 
issue. Race relations is the domain of the human rights 
commissioner. It is so stated in the mandate of the Human Rights 
Commission.
<P>
	The Canadian government should not pay people to be 
different. This leads to balkanization and divisiveness. Instead 
of dissolving racism, multicultural funding emphasizes and 
hardens it. Instead of diminishing separatist strategies, 
multicultural funding further creates and encourages people to 
be different.
<P>
	I know it is not politically correct to state that I am against 
public funding for multiculturalism but a lot of people in Canada 
feel this way and they expect their representatives to express 
their views publicly. These people are not racists or bigots. They 
think that government has no role to play in funding special 
interest groups and I totally agree with them. Culture cannot be 
dictated or controlled by the state. Therefore, I am opposing Bill 
C-53 proposed here today.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Bruce-Grey, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
it is certainly my pleasure to rise today in the House to speak on 
Bill C-53, an act creating the Department of Canadian Heritage.
<P>
	The purpose of the bill is to effect the establishment of the 
Department of Canadian Heritage in statute and thereby amend 
and repeal certain other acts.
<P>
	The proclamation of the Department of Canadian Heritage 
Act will be the culmination of a process that began more than a 
year ago when the department of the day decided to proceed with 
a wide ranging reorganization of federal government 
departments. Passage of the bill will fulfil a number of technical 
yet nonetheless important requirements.
<P>
<B>(1540 ) </B>
<P>
	First, it allows for the appointment of the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage and outlines the jurisdictions within which 
he will exercise his powers and perform his duties and 
responsibilities. The bill has been drafted so as to promote the 
minister with the flexibility that will be needed to carry out 
these responsibilities both now and in the future.
<P>
	The legislation will also permit the government to assure the 
status of the Canadian heritage employees and to formalize their 
transition to a new department. The entire process is consistent 
with the government's commitment to its employees and 
respects the principles of existing workforce adjustment policy.
<P>
	In short, the bill will give the department the legitimate basis 
it requires to assume the rightful share of the responsibility for 
implementing the mandate given to the government by the 
people of Canada.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6864"> 6864 </A></B>
<P>
	Broadly speaking, the Canadian heritage minister will work 
for the betterment of our country in matters relating to 
Canadian identity and values, cultural development, heritage 
and areas of natural and historical significance for the nation.
<P>
	Much has been said about the diversity and complexity of the 
new department that Bill C-53 will start. Certainly it reflects the 
richness of the activities and the fact that the new department 
comprises programs from the former and existing departments, 
namely the Secretary of State, Communications Canada, 
Multiculturalism and Citizenship, Environment Canada and 
Fitness and Amateur Sport.
<P>
	It is easy for some to claim that the department's program 
areas are disparate and ill matched but this is a superficial 
assessment. A closer examination will reveal that the 
department's principal sectors have much in common. Chiefly, 
they will work together in support of its primary objective which 
is to enhance our sense of Canadian identity and to encourage 
the contribution of all segments of society to the growth and 
vitality of Canadian culture.
<P>
	Canadians know that this government is committed to fiscal 
responsibility in all areas of federal endeavour. They can be 
assured that Bill C-53 is consistent with that over-arching 
objective and therefore with the comprehensive review of the 
federal government's objectives now under way.
<P>
	For those who value the bottom line, they will take comfort in 
the knowledge that for 1993-94 the Canadian heritage portfolio 
appropriations total $2.97 billion, a reduction from the previous 
year by some $76.1 million. In addition to these actual savings 
in money, there will be other longer term efficiencies realized 
through the regrouping of areas of responsibilities from the 
various departments through strengthening the linkages 
between program areas and through the elimination of 
duplication.
<P>
	The government appreciates that there are some concerns 
about the decision to divide the responsibility for broadcasting 
and telecommunications between Canadian heritage and 
Industry Canada. There are many valid reasons for so doing. The 
inclusion of telecommunications in the Department of 
Industry's portfolio recognizes the increasing role of 
telecommunications as an important economic generator in the 
Canadian economy.
<P>
	On the other hand, broadcasting is more closely related with 
the identity and cultural Canadian content mandate of Canadian 
heritage. Strong co-ordination and liaison exists between the 
departments to ensure that effective management of these two 
sectors are compatible and will work out well.
<P>
	In light of responsibilities and the program areas gathered 
within the Department of Canadian Heritage, the government 
believes that the passage of Bill C-53 will have far reaching and 
enduring positive benefits for all  Canadians. We are all 
confident that a detailed examination of the bill by the Standing 
Committee on Canadian Heritage will clearly show this to be the 
case.
<P>
<B>(1545 ) </B>
<P>
	As a society, culture is very important. We are made up of a 
diverse people. We have two founding nations. We have 
diversity with the First Nations. Culture is an expression of the 
Canadian identity. It connects us with our past and projects to 
our future. It makes for a better life and allows people to express 
themselves. Therefore I am glad to be here and to participate in 
this discussion.
<P>
	It is very important that we use new ideas, innovative 
approaches, cost saving techniques, yet respect the rights of the 
workers and see that we have some mechanism to make sure 
they can fit within the department or be trained for something 
new.
<P>
	I am pleased to speak on behalf of this bill.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau, B.Q.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, Bill C-53 is aimed at establishing a department 
which would have the following duties, as stated in clause 5, and 
I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>[-] initiate, recommend, coordinate, implement and promote national 
policies, projects and programs with respect to Canadian identity and values, 
cultural development, heritage [-]</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This bill is unacceptable because it definitely infringes upon 
an area of responsibility that which must remain under exclusive 
provincial jurisdiction. It fails to recognize the distinctiveness 
of Quebec society and provides none of the guarantees required 
to protect the francophone and Acadian communities in Canada.
<P>
	René Lévesque, the former Premier of Quebec, used to 
describe Quebec society as two nations within the same country. 
This means we are in fact dealing with two majorities, two 
complete and separate societies trying to get along within a 
common framework. The fact that we were made into a minority 
from a numerical point of view does not change a thing. Just as a 
civilized society will never force a smaller man to feel inferior 
to a larger one, civilized relations between nations demand that 
nations consider and treat each other as equals in law and in fact.
<P>
	What matters today and for the future it that we realize every 
day more clearly on both sides that this answer has had its day 
but now a drastic revision of the bill or a completely new bill is 
urgently required.
<P>
	The people of Quebec must preserve their collective 
personality and, to do so, they need unfettered powers, 
particularly in the areas of cultural rights and 
telecommunications.
<P>
	This bill enables the federal government to interfere with 
cultural issues, because it has the power to make expenditures 
without the consent of the provinces. This bill fails to recognize the 
distinctiveness of Quebec society. Quebec is prevented from 
setting its own priorities, as the federal government sets the budget 
and  makes decisions regarding the distribution of federal
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6865"> 6865 </A></B>
<P>
assistance without taking into consideration the basic needs of 
Quebecers.
<P>
	A similar line of reasoning culminated in the 1976 white 
paper by Dr. Camille Laurin-who was again reelected in the 
riding of Bourget-and became the Quebec policy on cultural 
development. During its first mandate, the Lévesque 
government demonstrated that Quebec could support its own 
cultural development. In a context of political and economic 
subordination, the cultural life of a people is weakened.
<P>
	On October 12, in Paris, the federal Minister of Foreign 
Affairs said that culture will become one of the priorities of the 
Canadian foreign policy. The daily <I>Le Devoir</I>, in its edition of 
October 13, 1994, mentioned the meddling of the federal 
government: «Cultural relations will be, along with political and 
economic affairs, one of three pillars of the Canadian foreign 
policy, that the joint committee of the House of Commons and 
the Senate has been mandated to review».
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	The cultural services of the Canadian embassy in Paris will 
benefit greatly from this change of direction. In this case, 
Ottawa is making a complete turn around. We know that 
Conservatives had decided to sell the large building the embassy 
is using on the Esplanade des Invalides, in Paris. The Liberals 
have now decided to give the building a new lease on life. The 
other federal institutions currently leasing offices in Paris, like 
Telefilm Canada and NFB, will move out of their present 
accommodations and into this building.
<P>
	This is only a first step. Next year, the building, probably 
worth $30 million, will be renovated from top to bottom. The 
improvements will cost approximately $2 million.
<P>
	This recent example shows that the federal government is 
trying to dilute Quebec culture in a pan-Canadian cultural 
identity based on bilingualism and multiculturalism.
<P>
	In the past, every Quebec government, even the Liberals, 
claimed exclusive power over cultural matters. Why such 
useless overlapping? Overlapping jurisdiction in the 
management of cultural programs automatically leads to 
confusion and dissatisfaction.
<P>
	In 1992, Mrs. Liza Frulla, the Quebec Minister of Cultural 
Affairs in the former Liberal government, said this to the 
Standing Committee on Culture: ``Federal programs are 
developed in an essentially Canadian perspective. Quebec must 
constantly be on guard to ensure that it gets and keeps its fair 
share. The same is true of federal legislation and regulations. 
The CRTC ruling on French song quotas in broadcasting and 
ongoing negotiations regarding the federal bill on the status of 
the artist are cases in point''.
<P>
	During this period of recession, Canadian taxpayers must pay 
tremendous amounts of money to maintain this overlapping 
jurisdiction over cultural matters. The Bloc Quebecois is 
committed to honouring Quebec's cultural priorities.
<P>
	First, the Bloc Quebecois will make sure that federal actions 
are consistent with the main orientations of Quebec culture. 
Second, the Bloc Quebecois will also demand that Quebec 
receive its fair share of federal spending on the major cultural 
institutions, such as the museums, the National Film Board and 
the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. Third, the Bloc 
Quebecois will also make sure that cuts at the Canadian 
Broadcasting Corporation do not have a negative impact on the 
French network and, in particular, on Quebec artists. Fourth, the 
Bloc Quebecois will also ensure that the Quebec cultural milieu 
receives its fair share of grants from federally subsidized 
organizations, such as the Canada Council and Telefilm Canada, 
as well as program resource envelopes.
<P>
	The arts, culture, heritage and communications must be the 
four cornerstones of Quebec's cultural policy. The ultimate goal 
of this policy must be to ensure the development of Quebec's 
cultural and social identity through the introduction of 
conditions conducive to artistic creation. Our goal must be the 
distribution of creators' works, access by individuals to culture, 
the growth of cultural industries, the preservation of our 
heritage, and finally the development of communications.
<P>
	On March 14, 1994, <I>La Presse</I> reported that a recent Gallup 
poll asking Canadians their opinion of bilingualism found that a 
small majority of them, 54 per cent, thought that official 
bilingualism had been a failure in Canada.
<P>
	I will conclude with René Lévesque's thoughts on what it 
means to be a Quebecer. In his view it means, above all else, and 
indeed on occasion to the exclusion of all else, that we have an 
attachment to this particular corner of the world, the only one 
where we can be fully ourselves, and that we know in our hearts 
that Quebec is truly the only place we can call home.
<P>
	Being ourselves, according to the former premier of Quebec, 
consists essentially in maintaining and developing a personality 
that has lasted for three and a half centuries.
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	We cannot enforce this vital difference. That has not been 
possible for some time now.
<P>
	For all these reasons, I support the motion by my hon. 
colleague from Rimouski-Témiscouata proposing the 
following amendment:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6866"> 6866 </A></B>
<P>

Heritage and to amend and repeal certain other Acts, be not now read a second time

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Bonnie Brown (Oakville-Milton, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it is my pleasure to take part in the debate on the bill to 
create the Department of Canadian Heritage.
<P>
	The proposed legislation is a technical measure that officially 
recognizes a departmental structure that combines official 
languages, Canadian studies, native programs and state 
ceremonials from the former Department of Secretary of State 
of Canada. It combines arts, heritage, cultural and broadcasting 
responsibilities from the Department of Communications. It 
brings in multiculturalism programs from the Department of 
Multiculturalism and Citizenship, amateur sports from the 
Department of Health and Welfare Canada and Parks Canada 
from the Department of the Environment.
<P>
	At this juncture in our nation's history, with forces that are 
trying to dismantle this entity we call Canada, and with 
technology changing the borders of the world, combined with 
the increasing diversity of our population at the same time that 
dramatic changes are occurring within mature economies 
throughout the world, I feel it more important than ever to have a 
department such as Canadian heritage.
<P>
	The department, although only a year old, has already begun 
to face up to the dramatic changes that Canadians are facing. 
The Secretary of State for Multiculturalism has already 
recognized the daunting task of nation building in a culturally 
diverse nation, reconciling that cultural diversity with national 
identity and the overwhelming need to maintain national unity.
<P>
	Another important aspect of the new department is 
development of both cultural and heritage property. The 
Minister of Canadian Heritage recognizes the importance of 
new technologies and the burgeoning information highway. The 
minister also understands that this information explosion will 
have important ramifications for Canadian artists.
<P>
	The Department of Canadian Heritage is of the utmost 
significance to Canadians. Its programs are inextricably linked 
to our everyday lives and their relevance, be it cultural or 
economic, is felt by each and every one of us.
<P>
	I believe that the new department embodies the democratic 
principles that are inherently Canadian. Canada is a nation 
forged on the principles of respect for and use of its two major 
languages, of respect for cultural diversity, of respect for the 
traditions and contributions of its aboriginal citizens and the 
fundamental underlying respect for basic human rights and 
values.
<P>
	Another major sector of the department which should not be 
forgotten is Parks Canada. Parks Canada commemorates, 
protects and presents, both directly and indirectly, places which 
are significant examples of Canada's cultural and natural 
heritage in ways that encourage public understanding, 
appreciation and enjoyment.
<P>
	The economic activity in tourism generated by the 
department's operations are of significance to many local 
economies throughout the nation. Our parks service has been at 
the forefront of efforts for innovative partnership arrangements 
with private and not for profit enterprises in carrying out its 
mandated responsibilities.
<P>
	In closing, the Department of Canadian Heritage 
encompasses elements that set us apart from the rest of the world 
with wide ranging concepts that are truly Canadian: cultural 
development, official languages, multiculturalism, and human 
rights.
<P>
	With these principles in mind, I eagerly anticipate the 
enactment of this legislation.
<P>
<B>(1600 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I rise 
to speak on Bill C-53, an act to establish the Department of 
Canadian Heritage and to amend and repeal certain other acts.
<P>
	On October 18, 1994, as we are about to celebrate or lament 
the first anniversary of the election, because that was when the 
Liberal government came to power, we have to take a look and 
say: ``What is this Liberal government trying to do?'' Here we 
are 12 months after the election, the first time that the Liberals 
have been in power after nine years. We would have thought that 
they were bursting at the seams with new ideas, new policies and 
new philosophies to get this country back on track, bring the 
deficit under control, create jobs in this country and we find that 
we have another of a long list of reorganizations that was started 
by the previous Prime Minister who led a party that is no longer 
even represented in this House. We can only assume how well 
the Canadian people endorsed the idea.
<P>
	Let me just quote Bill C-46, reorganization of the Department 
of Industry, Science and Technology to change its name to the 
Department of Industry; Bill C-47, reorganization of the 
Department of External Affairs into the Department of Foreign 
Affairs and International Trade; Bill C-48, reorganization of the 
Department of Energy, Mines and Resources to the Department 
of Forestry and Department of Natural Resources; Bill C-49, 
reorganization of the Department of Agriculture into the 
Department of Agriculture and Agri-Food; Bill C-52, 
reorganization of the Department of Public Works into the 
Department of Public Works and Government Services; and now 
we have Bill C-53; a long list but not I am afraid an impressive 
list from a government that in its first year we would have 
thought would bring forward some serious policy.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6867"> 6867 </A></B>
<P>
	As I mentioned these are strictly holdovers from the previous 
government. I would like to ask the government of the day, the 
Prime Minister of the day and all these ministers of the day 
when we are really going to get down to the business of running 
this country. The next election is going to be looming long 
before the 1997 date that we had anticipated if they keep up 
this speed.
<P>
	The hon. Minister of Finance as we speak is talking about his 
new paper, creating a healthy fiscal climate and economic and 
fiscal update. Yet all the other ministers can talk about is 
reorganization and renaming their departments.
<P>
	We really do want to attack this gross budget deficit that we 
have and the horrendous debt that we have accrued. I read in the 
transitional part of the bill, clause 9(1), that nothing in this act 
shall be construed as affecting the status of an employee who 
immediately before the coming into force of this subsection 
occupied in essence any other position in all these other 
departments that are being renamed.
<P>
	We have gone through all this for nothing, just simply 
nothing. There is no effort, attempt, or serious recognition by 
these departments. If they are going to reorganize surely this 
would be the time when they would seriously review everything 
that is being done by their departments.
<P>
	The Minister of Human Resources Development tabled a 
document a couple of weeks ago telling us how he was going to 
review all the programs by the department under his control. 
What did we end up with? It was hardly even rated a discussion 
paper as Canadians still wait for the government to produce 
serious policy on how it is going to handle the reorganization of 
the major programs that we give to Canadians. As we speak, as I 
mentioned, the Minister of Finance has given us another fluffy 
warm statement that contains nothing, just nothing, about what 
he is going to do to accomplish his timid objective of bringing 
the debt down to $25 billion by 1996-1997. I have to admit I am 
at a loss that this government cannot do more.
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	The previous speaker talked about the great and wonderful 
things this department is doing. One of them of course is (a) 
under clause 2, the promotion of a greater understanding of 
human rights, fundamental freedoms, and related values. The 
Minister of Justice under his Bill C-41 wants to bring hate 
crimes or sections of our community that many people find 
abhorrent. We are not going to protect them with additional 
rights because the Minister of Justice wants to bring in these.
<P>
	I am questioning why the Minister of Canadian Heritage is 
also responsible for doing the same thing. How many civil 
servants are thinking and working and spending our taxpayers' 
dollars trying to bring forth policies that Canadian taxpayers do 
not want?
<P>
	Next is (b), multiculturalism. We in the Reform Party say that 
a Canadian is a Canadian and is equal from coast to coast. With 
this policy of multiculturalism the government feeds and 
channels large amounts of money to individual groups in our 
society to keep us separate and apart, yet at the same time 
hoping we will all come together. I find this mind boggling. If 
we can offer any advice to this government then surely it would 
be to abolish this whole idea of multiculturalism and start 
talking about Canadians being equal from coast to coast. 
Everybody is the same.
<P>
	It goes on to the arts including the cultural aspects. These are 
nothing new and surely we could review and save many millions 
of dollars.
<P>
	The public accounts were tabled this morning. I have not had 
time to go through them. I will. I have not had the time. I have 
had only had a few hours and there is a large amount of money, 
$165 billion, spent by this government last year. We will be 
going through that. We will find there are many instances where 
this government is wasting taxpayers' money ad infinitum. We 
can quite easily tell the Minister of Finance where he could cut.
<P>
	I remember several months ago in this House we raised the 
point that the Department of Heritage gave a $10 million 
grant-I beg your pardon, it was a smaller grant-to a 
conference in Vancouver that was racist. Because of the fact that 
we raised the issue the minister of heritage withdrew the grant.
<P>
	We are paying these ministers to do the job and I do not think 
they are doing the job. They bring no policy. They bring no fresh 
ideas. Therefore I find that this whole idea of reorganization to 
accomplish nothing is totally abhorrent and a waste of 
taxpayers' money.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak 
in this debate today on Bill C-53 to create the Department of 
Canadian Heritage.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I must say that I certainly do not agree with what I have heard 
the Bloc Quebecois members say earlier today. It may come as 
no surprise to you, but allegations were made to the effect that, 
by amalgamating three or four departments into a single one, the 
federal government was attacking provincial powers. That is 
nonsense! As if it made a difference to have one minister 
accountable for three or four departments instead of one 
Secretary of State and different ministers, in terms of attacking 
these powers. That is absurd! And the people of Canada, 
particularly those living in Quebec who have heard these 
remarks made by Bloc Quebecois members, must know the 
truth. They must be told that what these members said is not 
true. I have to use parliamentary language even if I disagree with 
my colleagues opposite.

	I have also heard the Reform Party say that it is wrong to 
group those ministries together in an effort to save taxpayers' 
dollars. I really do not understand the logic of the Reform Party 
on this one. Of course that is true of most things Reformers.
<P>
	The Prime Minister reduced the size of cabinet. I remember 
there were as many as 44 ministers in the last cabinet. There 
were so many of them that the area outside the west door looked 
like a used car lot with all the limousines there. Our Prime 
Minister cleaned that up. When he was sworn into office he 
named 22 ministers. He cut it down to size. When you cut it 
down to size you have to unite the departments under one 
minister in an effort to save money. That is what the Prime 
Minister did.
<P>
	The people in the Reform Party pretend to be frugal. I know 
that sometimes when you pretend to be frugal there are 
allowances that make it otherwise. Shall I say that sometimes 
the suit is a little different from the reality in that particular 
party.
<P>
	The fact still remains that the Prime Minister produced very 
positive initiatives.

	We have cut spending. We have cancelled projects, although 
we have not yet been able to get rid of the aircraft bought by Mr. 
Mulroney, the former Prime Minister. We have implemented the 
Gagliano plan to cut costs here in the House of Commons. And 
the list goes on. Just today, as we speak, the Minister of Finance 
is indicating ways by which further savings could be made.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	There are the people across the way who say that this is an 
attack on provincial autonomy or some such thing. That is the 
usual diatribe as indicated very eloquently by the Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Prime Minister in her usual forthrightness and 
eloquence. She indicates of course that this is complete and utter 
nonsense. How correct she is. We do need a Department of 
Canadian Heritage.
<P>
	I want to tell members something. Last week I had a meeting 
in my riding with a group of constituents in an effort to preserve 
what is known as the Sir John Johnson manor home. Sir John 
Johnson is one of the pioneers of this country. His body is buried 
in the eastern townships of Quebec. He was the leader of the 
United Empire Loyalists who came to Upper Canada from the 
Mohawk Valley of New York in 1784. He brought with him the 
community known as the United Empire Loyalist refugees. 
Remember the word refugees. That is what they were known as 
then.
<P>
	Today the Department of Heritage owns that building, the 
building of one of the founders of this country. You certainly 
could call Sir John Johnson the founder of Ontario without 
contradiction. After all he established a  colony there in 1784. 
He personally owned lands in that area. The John Johnson manor 
home belongs to the Department of Canadian Heritage through 
what used to be known as Environment Canada Parks Service. 
That has been amalgamated into that department.
<P>
	We had a meeting the other day with officials of that 
department, recognizing the budgetary constraints, to see what 
we could do to bring the community together with Heritage 
Canada to save that structure. What do we get from people in the 
people across the way? People in the Reform Party say that a 
national treasure like that should presumably be disposed of and 
the people in the Bloc Quebecois say there is no role at all for the 
federal government to preserve national heritage and significant 
sites.
<P>
	I see them nodding in approval as if there were no such things 
as founders of Canada. They have a lot to learn. I suggest they 
spend some time in my constituency, or in their own, speaking to 
constituents who know better, who know the truth. They know 
that the national historic sites belong to all of us as Canadians. I 
feel there is a role for the Government of Canada in this kind of 
thing.
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	At any rate, the people of Canada through their government 
already own these assets.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	And the same holds true for Fort Frontenac and other 
structures elsewhere in Ontario and Canada, monuments and 
historical sites that belong to the people of this country through 
the Department of Canadian Heritage.
<P>
	I cannot understand and never will understand this attitude of 
the hon. members opposite, the Reform Party extremists who 
advocate getting rid of everything because the people of Canada 
are not entitled to their heritage, their buildings, their 
monuments, as well as those from the Bloc Quebecois who 
claim that Canada no longer exists as we speak.
<P>
	No, I disagree with both positions held across the way. I for 
one am very attached to the history and heritage of our country. 
As the member of Parliament for Glengarry, this high place of 
Canadian history, I must at least be an amateur historian. That is 
part of the heritage of my riding.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is the heritage of the great people of that area. I see 
Canadians of Scottish origin who came to Glengarry, and the 
mix they have had with the French Canadians who came shortly 
afterwards, and also the Irish who came in the 1840s and 1850s. 
Those three groups together created the area which I now have 
the honour and privilege to represent.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6869"> 6869 </A></B>
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary just said very eloquently: ``That 
is what Canada is all about''. She is right.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, B.Q.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am very pleased to speak on this bill to 
establish the Department of Canadian Heritage.
<P>
	On reading the bill, I felt that I sensed Pierre Elliott Trudeau's 
ghost reading over my shoulder. This bill contains everything 
that has characterized Canada's federal system, especially since 
the Trudeau years. First of all, Quebec's identity is diluted. At 
the same time, an effort is made to create a culture and a heritage 
that exist nowhere but in the minds of those who created this 
artificial federal country, Canada.
<P>
	The bill says that the Department of Canadian Heritage was 
created to instill in Canadians a deep feeling of identity and 
belonging based on bilingualism and multiculturalism. Well, 
there is quite a long way to go.
<P>
	Here are a few statistics on bilingualism, because you might 
have lovely images, high-sounding speeches, but there is 
nothing like reality to help you understand. Statistics Canada's 
figures, which should not be challenged by the government or 
other interested parties, show the assimilation rate of 
francophones in Newfoundland was 24.7 per cent in 1986 and 
55.3 per cent in 1991. What a success! In Prince Edward Island, 
it was 42.6 per cent in 1986 and 47.6 per cent in 1991, an 
increase of 5 per cent. These are signs that bilingualism, at least 
the model that has been proposed, has not worked very well.
<P>
	I shall give another example. In Nova Scotia, the assimilation 
rate was 31.8 per cent in 1986 and 41.1 per cent in 1991, an 
increase of 9.3 per cent. At that rate, in the time it takes to create 
the Department of Canadian Heritage, there will be no 
French-speaking minority left in the rest of Canada.
<P>
	The second element is multiculturalism. Multiculturalism, 
which is as difficult to pronounce as it is to understand, is a 
product of the thinking of the Trudeau years.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	To support this statement, I will quote Claude Corbeau, the 
rector at the University of Quebec in Montreal, who does not 
boast about being a Quebec separatist. In his policy report, he 
said that ``multiculturalism may marginalize Quebec's 
identity''. This is a rector at a Quebec university who 
popularized a certain image of Quebec's culture and reality.
<P>
	His reasoning is not so hard to understand. Let us look at the 
areas that will come under the purview of Canadian Heritage. 
This is duplication country. On that there can be no compromise 
from Quebec. These are not minor sectors; they are of vital 
importance to Quebec.
<P>
	The arts, heritage, culture, broadcasting are all in there. These 
sectors are not purely economic. It is a matter of survival. In 
broadcasting, for example, Quebec even created Radio-Québec, 
not yesterday but in the 1940s under Duplessis. Since then, we 
had to fight for every inch, while the Supreme Court, which 
always leans on the same side, kept telling us that we had no 
control over this important cultural element.
<P>
	Culture gives us another good example of duplication, as we 
have two stakeholders in cultural matters in one country. We 
heard earlier the hon. member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell tell us about the Canadian people 
and therein lies the problem. As long as we do not recognize that 
the Canadian Confederation was founded by at least two peoples 
and by the Natives who were here before us, as long as we do not 
recognize the equal value and contribution of these founding 
peoples, we are developing what I would call an utopia, the 
utopia of the Department of Canadian Heritage. Try to find 
another country in the world where you have to qualify the word 
``heritage'' by adding ``Canadian''.
<P>
	Have you heard about the department of Norwegian or 
Swedish heritage? A simple, normal, natural country would not 
feel the need to add anything to ``department of heritage'' as it 
should be understood that it is that country's heritage. The 
problem is that, in Canada, people never realized that there are 
in fact two countries.
<P>
	There is another provision explaining the department's role. It 
says that the department is to develop and offer programs which 
support a strong sense of identity among Canadians. But you 
cannot force a sense of identity on people. Let me give you a few 
examples which show why Quebec cannot really identify with 
the rest of the country.
<P>
	During the war, when the referendum on conscription was 
held, 96 per cent of voters in my riding of Kamouraska opposed 
that measure. That response pretty well reflected the overall 
results for French-speaking people in Quebec. In spite of that 
strong opposition, the federal government went ahead and 
imposed conscription. You will have to talk about Canadian 
heritage for a long time and show pictures of those who died 
overseas before you can convince us, considering that we did not 
even want to go to war. This is not to say that we overlook the 
contribution made by veterans, but the fact is that this episode 
deeply affected people.
<P>
	There is another episode which also deeply affected people. In 
this case, it is the Liberals and in particular the current Prime 
Minister who are responsible. I am referring to the 1982 
unilateral patriation of the Constitution.
<P>
	The government can say what it wants about a department 
established to promote a strong sense of identity among 
Canadians, it can try to force it upon us, but this will not work. 
As long as we are not accepted for who we are and as long as our 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6870"> 6870 </A></B>
<P>
signature does not appear  on the Constitution, the government 
cannot expect us to promote Canadian heritage.
<P>
	Let me give you one last example which is of particular 
interest to me. In the seventies, the community of Forillon was 
expropriated to create a federal park. Today, that park is a good 
tourist attraction for the region, but I can tell you that back in the 
seventies, those who were forced to move did not develop a 
strong sense of Canadian identity, nor would they have seen the 
need to establish a department with such a mandate.
<P>
	There are plenty of sectors which relate to the French reality 
in Quebec and in North America.
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	We cannot be forced to accept that as a model for all of 
Canada. Quebec has its own identity, which must be recognized 
by Quebekers, by Canadians and by our society as a whole 
because of our decent contribution to it.
<P>
	To conclude, we are against the establishment of a Canadian 
Heritage Department because this would be a constant negation 
of the exclusive jurisdiction needed by Quebec to ensure its own 
cultural, economic and social development. In order for Quebec 
to contribute to the richness of North American life, its needs 
must be met. As long as the Canadian government does not 
recognize and acknowledge this reality, francophones in North 
America will continue to insist on ensuring their survival.
<P>
	Today, the proposed Canadian Heritage Department is yet 
another proof for Quebecers that the only way to ensure their 
development is to have their own country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Francis G. LeBlanc (Cape Breton Highlands-Canso, 
Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to 
speak on this bill to establish the Department of Canadian 
Heritage.
<P>
	This is a technical piece of legislation that formalizes the 
structure and the sharing of departmental responsibilities 
implemented when our government took over.
<P>
	However, as several of the previous speakers pointed out, this 
bill refers to fundamental areas over which, within the federal 
government, the minister will have jurisdiction. These areas 
include, for example, culture, national identity, official 
languages, national parks, multiculturalism, etc. During the few 
minutes I have, I want to address one of these areas, the issue of 
culture.
<P>
	Some of our colleagues opposite are questioning the 
legitimacy of the role played by the Canadian government where 
our culture and our cultural development are concerned. By 
arguing that the federal role is not legitimate, they are 
questioning the bill's rationale. Unlike them, I believe that this 
role is crucial and has been tremendously beneficial to our 
country and all the regions, especially Quebec.
<P>
	Culture is not an exclusive jurisdiction; it belongs to 
everyone. In this sense, and despite all the constitutional 
exegesis put forward by the Official Opposition, the Act of 1867 
does not give one level of government more jurisdiction over 
culture than the other.
<P>
	Cultural development concerns the provinces; it concerns the 
federal government; it concerns all municipalities, professional 
groups, the creators themselves of course, as well as the cultural 
businesses, the volunteers and the private sector. Finally, 
culture is also a question of individual choice, because if each 
and every one of us is the product of a specified cultural 
environment, the creation of a work of art, just like the decision 
to appreciate this work of art, to read it, to listen to it, to watch it, 
always results, in fact, from an individual choice.
<P>
	I sincerely believe that, in order to offer a vast, fair and wide 
array of choices, we need a large number of cultural 
development officers and governments which play their roles. 
The goal of the federal government in this area is to ensure that 
the Canadian artists, creators and cultural businesses can work 
and that Canadian citizens have access to their productions.
<P>
	One of the great ironies of this debate in which the opposition 
forces us to engage is that some people feel that we have to 
apologize for having public policy objectives that are so 
normal-to use an adjective of which the opposition is very 
fond-for there is nothing in these objectives that is 
unacceptable or threatening to anybody, especially not to the 
province of Quebec.
<P>
	It is also ridiculous that we should have to defend ourselves 
against allegations that we are ignoring the cultural 
distinctiveness of Quebec or of other regions in our country. 
Ottawa plots Quebec's cultural demise? This could have come 
from the <I>Union nationale</I> in the Duplessis years. By the way, 
Duplessis had nothing but contempt for culture.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	The federal government, an agent of cultural standardization 
imposed by a ruling group against the wishes of the powerless? 
These sound like the cries of a people oppressed by one of those 
totalitarian regimes recently condemned by history. The 
Department of Canadian Heritage, a machine used to create an 
official culture? If it were true, we would all be trembling, 
starting with the creators of this country who do not seem to see 
this as a serious threat. If we look closely at this issue, how can 
we sum up the federal government's intervention in cultural 
matters over the few decades in which it has played an active 
role in this area?
<P>
	The fact is that several generations of creators and performers 
from Quebec have produced and presented their work to the 
public through institutions created, managed or funded by the 
federal government. Let us just mention Radio-Canada, the 
Canada Council, the National Film Board, Telefilm Canada, the 
National Arts Centre or the department whose minister is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6871"> 6871 </A></B>
<P>
responsible  for these institutions before the House, namely the 
Department of Canadian Heritage.
<P>
	As far as I know, half a century of efforts by those institutions, 
of support and assistance programs for artists, publishers, 
museums, producers and the sound recording industry did not 
hinder the profound originality of artists in Quebec, on the 
contrary. Those efforts nurtured and developed their creativity, 
and their works gained exposure not only in Quebec, but also in 
the rest of Canada and abroad. In short, those programs and 
institutions have been important contributing factors in the 
cultural vitality of Quebec, and all Canada can be proud of that.
<P>
	The works of the likes of Michel Tremblay, Jacques Godbout 
and Denys Arcand did not lose any of their Quebecois identity 
for that. It is absurd, sad and distressing that our colleagues 
across the way cannot understand that what is done in Quebec 
can also be considered Canadian.
<P>
	Of course, the federal government must look after 
Canada-wide, interprovincial and international aspects, but that 
responsibility complements those of other levels of 
government. In reality, except in sectors where it has a clear 
constitutional jurisdiction, like copyright, federal action is 
limited to cultural products with an interprovincial or 
international scope like broadcasting. The federal government 
is also active in the promotion and sharing of cultural treasures 
outside provincial or national boundaries.
<P>
	For art lovers, the names of Emily Carr, Alex Colville, Tom 
Thomson, Geneviève Cadieux and Jean-Paul Lemieux bring to 
mind landmark works that gained international recognition. 
Should we be satisfied with saying that one belongs strictly to 
British Columbia, the second only to Nova Scotia, the third to 
Ontario alone and the last two to Quebec? They are also 
Canadian artists.
<P>
	That is why Canada created the National Gallery and supports 
a country-wide network of museums and museum-related 
institutions. That is why Canada encourages artists to attend 
schools of higher learning like the National Theatre School of 
Canada and that is why Canada supports artists who get to 
perform across Canada and abroad and who even reach 
international fame.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	In a world-wide marketplace where artistic recognition as 
well as economic profitability is often decided abroad, the 
Canadian government has a mission to accomplish. The 
international free trade negotiations gave us a good example of 
the role played by our country and of the complementarity 
between this role and that of other levels of government.
<P>
	When it negotiated the cultural exemption in the free trade 
agreements with the United States and Mexico, Canada not only 
assumed its responsibility but also maintained the 
responsibilities of the provinces towards their own artists and 
cultural industries.
<P>
	Therefore, I would say that the Department of Canadian 
Heritage is a basic institution if we are to carry on with our 
cultural development which has given such excellent results 
until now and which should be sustained by the federal 
government and the provinces. If we do not provide ourselves 
with the necessary tools to carry on this mission, we are 
virtually abandoning a responsibility which has proven to be a 
most profitable one for Canadians.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> It is my duty, pursuant 
to Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the questions to 
be raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows: The 
Honourable Member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve (Mr. 
Ménard)-Defence Industry Conversion.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to voice my opposition to Bill C-53. I do so 
for a number of reasons, not the least of which is the inclusion of 
a royal recommendation.
<P>
	This provision allows the government to spend money 
implementing the bill. If the bill is meant to streamline 
government operations, why is there a need to spend money in 
order to save money? How much will this cost and will it really 
save tax dollars? We do not have the answers to these important 
questions. These are vital matters for future debate.
<P>
	I have chosen today to focus my remarks specifically on how 
the bill relates to official languages. I would like to preface my 
comments by clearly stating that the Reform Party in no way 
discourages individual bilingualism. Unfortunately the bill will 
legislatively entrench something we do not believe in. I am 
speaking of the holus-bolus financing of any group which 
claims to have as its mandate the furthering of official languages 
in Canada.
<P>
	While we support the efforts of these groups, we believe they 
should be self-financing. With health care, unemployment and 
welfare programs in jeopardy due to a lack of funds, how can we 
continue to spend millions promoting something as divisive to 
Canadians as official languages?
<P>
	This year alone the Ministry of Canadian Heritage is poised to 
give away over $31 million of hard earned taxpayers' money to 
these special interest groups. Not only are many of the grants of 
questionable value, the real travesty is that there is no way of 
determining how the money is used.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6872"> 6872 </A></B>
<P>
	The government appointed watchdog of official languages 
programs and policies is the Standing Joint Committee on 
Official Languages, which meeting I just left to attend this one. 
However that committee has openly stated that its mandate does 
not include spending. In fact the committee has twice voted 
down motions which would have resulted in comprehensive 
studies on how much money, such as these grants, is actually 
being used.
<P>
	This brings me to section 88 of the Official Languages Act 
which will be amended by this bill. This section refers Ministry 
of Canadian Heritage reports, including spending estimates, to 
the standing joint committee for review. As I have already 
stated, this committee has neither the will nor the intestinal 
fortitude to conduct any meaningful review.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	I make this statement not out of any sense of malice toward 
the committee but because of what I experienced during my time 
in it.
<P>
	For example, when I proposed a motion to study all official 
languages' spending, I was greeted with scorn and distrust. To 
quote one of the hon. Liberal members, ``This 
motion''-meaning Ringma's motion-``is inflammatory and 
illegal and it calls national unity into question. The member 
should be ashamed of acting like this and trying to divide the 
country''. What nonsense.
<P>
	I have sat on this committee since its formation under the 
auspices of the 35th Parliament. It has only issued one brief 
report to Parliament, which was more of a summary than a 
report, and it has not submitted even one recommendation to the 
House. In fact, my research shows it did not issue a single 
recommendation during its last two years under the 34th 
Parliament.
<P>
	Given these facts, I have to ask how we can even consider 
legislatively entrenching such an important duty to a committee 
that is really more of a lapdog than a watchdog.
<P>
	Another area of concern is the ministry's mandate for official 
languages as spelled out in the bill we are discussing. The 
mandate calls for the advancement of the equality of status and 
use of English and French. Under this mandate the ministry will 
spend $245 million this year on official languages in education. 
The constitutions of 1867 and 1982 clearly state that education 
is a provincial responsibility. Why then is this ministry spending 
a quarter of a billion dollars in this area of provincial 
jurisdiction?
<P>
	Similarly, the ministry will spend $65 million to promote 
official languages. Again I have to ask: Why? When programs 
like old age pension, unemployment insurance, welfare and 
health are under constant attack due to a lack of funding, why is 
the government placing such a high priority on spending in areas 
where it has no jurisdiction?
<P>
	The government has shown it cannot even handle the areas 
where it has responsibilities. Why on earth is it looking for ways 
to spend money it does not have in areas where it does not 
belong?
<P>
	The biennial assembly, or convention if you will, of the 
Reform Party which was held here in Ottawa a few days ago 
passed a resolution calling for the repeal of the Official 
Languages Act. At the same time, it passed another resolution 
which would give responsibility for language and culture to the 
provinces. We believe this arrangement would be practical and 
would get the federal government out of the business of 
promoting languages.
<P>
	The federal government has a responsibility for language 
equality clearly expressed in the Constitution, in section 133 of 
the BNA act and in sections 16 through 23 of the Charter of 
Rights and Freedoms. Let the central government exercise its 
responsibilities under the Constitution. Let the provinces and 
special interest groups do whatever promotion of whatever 
language they want without a subsidy from Ottawa.
<P>
	Reform supports freedom of speech, not comprehensive 
language legislation. Reform recognizes that the linguistic 
reality in Canada is that French is predominant in Quebec and 
English is predominant elsewhere. We support the philosophy of 
territorial bilingualism which will recognize this reality.
<P>
<B>(1645 ) </B>
<P>
	Reform believes all Canadians are equal and oppose funding 
of special interest groups which are claiming distinct status. As I 
said, we endorse individual bilingualism and extend this to 
languages other than French or English in recognition of the fact 
that over 12 million Canadians are of an origin which is neither 
French nor English. These other languages also give Canada 
strength and character.
<P>
	Other than the constitution, if Canada needs other language 
policies these should be decided upon by the people as a whole 
and not by an elite here in Ottawa.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mac Harb (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
International Trade, Lib.): </B>Madam Speaker, this bill confirms 
the structure of the Department of Canadian Heritage and brings 
together the various components that promote our national 
identity. My colleagues who have already taken part in this 
debate have well established the importance of this grouping to 
the new Department of Canadian Heritage.
<P>
	Personally, I think that it will be a useful tool that will allow 
us to face the new realities and new challenges of the Canadian 
society. One of these major realities is the multicultural nature 
of Canada which is evolving very quickly.
<P>
	According to the 1991 census, no less than 42 per centof Canadians say that at least one of their parents is neither 
French nor English. In fact, in all major urban centres in
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6873"> 6873 </A></B>
<P>
the western part of Montreal, for example, a  majority of the 
population is neither French nor English. It is expected that, by 
the year 2000, the percentage of Canadians from visible 
minorities will go from 13 to 18 per cent.
<P>
	Some even maintain that this percentage could reach up to 50 
per cent in Toronto. This rapid growth of Canadian diversity 
raises deep challenges that our society will have to face very 
quickly.
<P>
	There is no question that Canada is a land of welcome and that 
our country provides a peace and a security that are seldom seen 
elsewhere.
<P>
	Finally, we recognize that Canada is a country of openness 
and opportunity which millions and millions of people all over 
the world only dream about. We have the chance to live in this 
country and we are fully committed to its continued economic 
and social development.
<P>
	We must avoid conflicts and maintain social harmony. That 
can only be achieved by defining wise policies based on the 
equality of every Canadian. Better still, we must ensure that all 
Canadians, whatever their origin or religion, can participate and 
fully contribute to the life in our society. We must make more 
efforts to develop policies that are well adjusted to Canadian 
diversity.
<P>
	I believe that all the members in this House understand why 
Canada is a country that foreigners wished they lived in. 
Sometimes, some people do not seem to understand how we all 
benefit from the numerous cultures that the people who chose to 
live here bring with them. Too often, we understand 
multiculturalism in terms of ethnic food, and the folkloric 
dances and customs of the various ethno-cultural communities.
<P>
	There is much more than that. Thousands and thousands of 
immigrants have developed the resources of this country. They 
have colonized vast territories and they have helped to build our 
cities.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	Most Canadian regions have inherited the characteristics of 
various cultural groups. This diversity gave a unique character 
to the Canadian identity and to our culture. Canadian 
multiculturalism has two main characteristics. It encourages 
Canadian citizens to contribute actively to our society in either 
of our official languages.
<P>
	Multiculturalism also encourages us to eliminate the barriers 
to a full and equal participation. Teaching of heritage languages, 
supporting artists in ethno-cultural communities and the 
promoting of transcultural activities are initiatives that help 
develop cultural harmony in our country. We acknowledge the 
fact that the roots of every citizen play an important part in his or 
her identity.
<P>
	In Canada, no one is forced to forget his culture to be 
welcome. This is what makes Canadians a unique people. While 
acknowledging that our roots constitute an important part of our 
identity, Canadian multiculturalism is calling on us to commit 
ourselves to Canada. It respects the cultural identity of every 
citizen, it encourages creativity and intercultural exchanges.
<P>
	Multiculturalism helps us to become aware of our duties but 
also of our responsibilities towards society. The 
multiculturalism program will now become very logically a part 
of the Department of Canadian Heritage. I must pay tribute to 
my colleague, the hon. Secretary of State for Multiculturalism 
and member for Mount Royal, for the outstanding job she is 
doing, building bridges between the ethno-cultural 
communities and the rest of the Canadian society.
<P>
	I admit that we are all taken aback at one time or another when 
we see how quickly the face of this country is changing. All too 
often, we claim to be open to multiculturalism in Canada, but 
not next door, not in our backyards. That is why so much remains 
to be done to make all Canadians aware of the advantages and 
benefits of multiculturalism.
<P>
	One major benefit we derive from our diversity is that it acts 
as a valuable asset in our trade relations on the global market. 
The chairman of the Royal Bank of Canada explained just 
recently that our future as a nation depended on our capacity to 
channel this wealth arising from our diversity to improve our 
competitiveness internationally.
<P>
	Canadian businesses must open up new channels of trade. 
This is certainly easier and faster to achieve by drawing from 
our cultural communities a manpower that knows the languages, 
ways and customs of target countries. In the end, that is how our 
business leaders develop local resources and assests to get ahead 
of their foreign competition.
<P>
	My point is that we must continually ask ourselves about the 
kind of country we are building. We must be confident and 
serene enough to shape our national identity according to our 
reality and our needs. In that sense, the establishment of the new 
Department of Canadian Heritage opens up such fascinating 
prospects.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, B.Q.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, on October 3, the member for 
Rimouski-Témiscouata tabled an amendment to Bill C-53. 
This bill is ambitious, because the purpose of this big shake-up 
is to shamelessly take control of what is called Canadian culture 
in this country. It is not surprising that, with this amendment, the 
Bloc Quebecois seeks to return this bill to the Standing 
Committee on Canadian Heritage.
<P>
	In other words, what the Official Opposition is saying to the 
House is this: Members of Parliament, show political maturity 
and demand that the government do its homework again. In his 
speech on October 3, the minister gave us the following 
definition to think over:  ``Heritage is the set of signs that enable 
us to recognize ourselves as individuals who belong to a group 
or 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6874"> 6874 </A></B>
<P>
even a country. Heritage is closely linked to questions of 
individual and national identity, which is why it can have such 
far-reaching and important influence''.
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
	While the traditional definitions of heritage as found in the 
dictionary refer essentially to a specific past which we 
recognize as our roots, the minister speaks of the set of signs by 
which Canadians would define themselves as belonging to the 
same reality. Some questions come spontaneously to mind. 
What do you think Quebecers, even federalists, will choose as 
the sign of what they are and what they want to be: the maple leaf 
or the fleur-de-lis?
<P>
	Who can say out loud that our national anthem, which was 
written by Basile Routhier, generates the same sense of 
belonging from sea to sea as La Marseillaise in France or <I>God 
save the Queen</I> in England? And what about the Rockies, the 
Mounted Police and our coins bearing the effigy of the Queen?
<P>
	The minister's plan, you will readily admit it, goes way 
beyond these heritage symbols. Suffice to quote here very 
briefly the minister: ``We hope to rally the mighty forces of 
multiculturalism behind a cultural identity that is uniquely 
Canadian''.
<P>
	Since he only referred in his speech to the French Canadian 
culture when he talked about the official languages and the TV5 
network, how could we not infer that we must absolutely bring 
back not only the Quebec culture but the aboriginal culture as 
well in the ideal and so-called safe melting pot of 
multiculturalism, in this world where the American culture is 
prevailing everywhere?
<P>
	Madam Speaker, you will easily understand that, given all of 
this, it would be suicidal for the Official Opposition to support 
Bill C-53.
<P>
	In spite of the minister's noble intentions, how can the 
Canadian Parliament not be concerned that today's culture, our 
writers, our artists, what I call our heritage in the making, are 
considered to be an industry in the same way as steel, shoes and 
chickens?
<P>
	As for the review of the Copyright Act, for example, who will 
eventually have the last word? The Minister of Industry or the 
Minister of Canadian Heritage? We can safely assume that the 
Department of Industry, which already has this power, will 
retain it, since nothing in Bill C-53 clearly allocates 
responsibilities to either department.
<P>
	Here is another example which should be cause for alarm in 
this House. With the emergence of the information highway, the 
speed of communication is approaching Mach 2. Is it reasonable 
to limit the stakes to marketing fibre optics? This is however, the 
conclusion we must reach since once again the Minister of 
Industry will be the project manager. But it also means that we 
are  refusing to recognize that the major revolution brought 
about by the information highway is bound to rapidly and 
profoundly change the global culture.
<P>
	It is often said that war is too serious a matter to be left up to 
generals; could it be that culture is too serious a matter to be left 
up to businessmen? Quebec culture is too precious to be left up 
to the goodwill of the federal government. The State of Quebec 
must have exclusive jurisdiction over Quebec culture.
<P>
	For the past 30 years, the federal government, using its 
powerful spending authority, has shamelessly interfered with 
Quebec culture. Its objective was clearly to weaken Quebec 
culture. It has resulted in overlapping and duplication and 
created a dependence on the federal manna on the part of our 
creative minds.
<P>
	In 1991, the total budget of the Quebec government for 
cultural institutions amounted to $426 million whereas that of 
Ottawa was $2.8 billion.
<P>
<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
	I wonder whether I understood what the minister meant when 
he said that both official languages ``are inextricably linked to 
Canadian identity and culture. For this reason it is vital to 
promote them and broaden their sphere of influence''. Am I 
naive in thinking that Radio-Canada's budget is sizeable enough 
to make a major contribution to the survival of francophone 
communities? Is it naive to think that when a number of the 
French network's stations were closed down recently in the 
regions, this was a clear indication of the strong position of 
French in these regions, a position so strong that these stations 
were no longer needed?
<P>
	I am not naive, and few Quebecers are, as we can see in the 
following extract from the conclusion of the Arpin report: 
``Harmonizing action by both levels of government has never 
been easy''. The federal government has always refused to 
recognize Quebec's leading role in cultural matters.
<P>
	In 1992, Mrs. Frulla-Hébert, at the time Minister of Culture 
in the Bourassa government, went even further, saying there was 
little or no consultation on programs by the federal government 
with Quebec. Genuine co-operation was practically 
nonexistent, and when it did occur it was often at Quebec's 
request.
<P>
	Recently, UQAM president Claude Corbo criticized the 
tendency of federal policies to downplay and ignore Quebec's 
identity. I hardly think Bill C-53 would change his mind.
<P>
	The Minister of Canadian Heritage referred to Bill C-53 as 
the flag ship of Canadian identity. Metaphors are often not very 
apt, and this one is no exception. The cargo does not seem to be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6875"> 6875 </A></B>
<P>
properly stowed, and the ship may not be able to weather the 
storms ahead.
<P>
	Any admiral worth his salt does not go out to sea with a ship 
that is poorly equipped. In concluding, I would therefore like to 
offer the Minister of Canadian Heritage some thoughts by 
Marcel Rioux, whom he must have met, considering his abiding 
interest in things cultural: ``Why, at the slightest spark of life, 
do we go on hoping and manage to resist the pessimism and 
cynicism that lies at the root of so many foolish and unthinking 
decisions? To me, it is an act of faith in all those who built this 
country, and that is why I keep on hoping against hope''.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simon de Jong (Regina-Qu'Appelle, N.D.P.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it is with pleasure that I join the debate today. Bill C-53 
is an important bill because it establishes a very important 
department, the Department of Canadian Heritage. Yet I am 
afraid I will have to vote against the motion and the bill in front 
of us.
<P>
	May I hasten to add for entirely different reasons than the 
reasons I have heard from both opposition parties today that I 
cannot accept the arguments put forward by members of the 
Bloc. There is a need in Quebec and in other parts of Canada for 
a cultural presence by the federal government. I think the first 
people to recognize that would be the artists in Quebec.
<P>
	The artists in Quebec would abhor just having to depend upon 
the Quebec government. Just having to depend upon one source 
of support and assistance in the arts is not in the interests of the 
artists. All too often they have found in terms of past 
governments, and I suspect the present government as well, that 
the political agenda of the provincial government is at variance 
with the artistic interests of the artists.
<P>
	Artists in Quebec also want to have the federal government, 
the Canada Council, the National Film Board, the SRC, all the 
federal cultural institutions. They also want them. I am not 
surprised by the objections raised by the Reform Party though I 
am saddened by them. Surely they also must recognize that 
cultural institutions are really what define the people in a nation.
<P>
<B>(1705 ) </B>
<P>
	Our cultural institutions help define what Canada is. They 
allow us to be able to see and hear and listen to other Canadians 
without the intervention of the government. Surely the Reform 
members are not so naive to assume that if you just leave it to 
market forces Canadian culture would be totally swamped by 
American culture. The economics would dictate that. Surely it is 
a naive belief in saying the federal government should get out of 
this area. They will do as much damage as what the Bloc is doing 
to the well-being and the maintenance of this country. Once you 
destroy the cultural identity you have destroyed this country. In 
this way the Bloc and the Reform are indeed in cahoots and 
working well together in that.
<P>
	May I quote quite an excellent article that appeared in the 
<I>Globe and Mail</I> on May 8, 1994, by Michael Valpy. ``Why, 
indeed, maintain a multibillion dollar military 
establishment-when what is under attack in Canada is largely 
militarily indefensible; the alien control of our commerce, our 
resources, our jobs, our entertainment, publishing and other 
forms of communications''. Mr. Valpy was discussing a paper 
that was written by University of Toronto political scientist 
Franklyn Griffiths. He quotes Mr. Griffiths and this is the quote I 
wish to put on the record: ``The state of our cultural life'', he 
writes, ``is now of greater importance than the state of our armed 
forces in determining our ability to make choices for ourselves 
in a world where military challenges to our country have 
diminished relative to non-military or civil dangers''.
<P>
	Again, I wish to agree with Valpy's thesis which is that the 
attack on Canada as a nation is really more in terms of 
non-military areas like our cultural sense of identity and sense 
of who we are.
<P>
	I oppose this bill because this government's record in this area 
has been dismal. We have a weak minister and a weak 
department. It was referred to by members of the Bloc when they 
expressed their concern about issues like copyright and as well 
questions concerning the information highway, whether it is the 
ministry of industry or the ministry of heritage that is really in 
control.
<P>
	I suspect it is the ministry of industry rather than the ministry 
of Canadian heritage. We have a weak department and a weak 
minister. The Canadian cultural institutions and values are not 
being well protected.
<P>
	The other reason why I would have to oppose this bill is that 
the government as well as the previous government when it 
signed the FTA and the NAFTA continued to refuse to release 
the documents both on the FTA and the NAFTA on cultural 
discussions. We really do not know yet what is allowed and what 
is not allowed under the free trade agreement and under the 
NAFTA. How can we operate in terms of defining, strengthening 
and protecting Canadian cultural institutions when the public 
and as well those cultural institutions do not know what has been 
given away? How can we continue?
<P>
	Historically in this House all political parties have supported 
the notion that the federal government has a role to play in our 
cultural institutions. That is why Conservatives started the CBC 
as well as Liberals, generally supported by New Democrats or 
the CCF, even the Social Credit Party when it had members in 
this House.
<P>
	There was a recognition by those who are part of the English 
culture part of Canada, standing so close to the American border 
with its dynamic and very powerful cultural industries, that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6876"> 6876 </A></B>
<P>
unless we had an interventionist government, unless we 
followed something other than just market forces, our cultural 
identity as a country would be swamped.
<P>
<B>(1710 ) </B>
<P>
	There is a belief that all political parties in this House have 
traditionally agreed to, that as Canadians we have some identity, 
some values as Canadians that are unique, that are important and 
that are worth preserving. This is our contribution to the 
civilization of the human race.
<P>
	It is worth the money we invest there. Without that 
investment, the Canadian cultural identity would disappear and 
then one has to once again ask oneself: ``What do we have as a 
country?'' We might as well then join the United States.
<P>
	There is another important reason that I wish to mention in my 
remarks in terms of the importance of Canadian cultural 
industry. It creates jobs, many jobs. There are more jobs in the 
cultural sector than in fishery or in forestry. It is also a source of 
foreign earnings.
<P>
	I hear members of the Reform Party talk about our taxpayers. 
Yes, indeed, taxpayers' dollars are involved but artists also 
create tax revenue. There was a study that was done in Toronto in 
the spring of 1993 which showed that the cutbacks in the Canada 
Council in fact decreased government revenues greater than the 
cutbacks.
<P>
	They went through numerous performing companies after the 
cutbacks of their support by the Canada Council. They 
determined how many musicians were laid off, how many 
productions did not occur. Those performers, musicians, artists, 
actors and actresses were no longer working, were taking UI or 
welfare and were no longer paying taxes.
<P>
	There was the loss of tax revenues from the loss of admission 
tickets. They found in this study that the government lost more 
money through revenue loss than had it continued to support the 
arts the way they it had formerly done.
<P>
	I am also concerned, very much so, with our deficit. There is a 
need as well for wise spending and for trimming government 
expenditures. Let us do it with intelligence because in some 
areas when one cuts one will create more harm and there will be 
a greater loss of revenue than the money one will save from the 
cuts in those areas.
<P>
	In conclusion I wish to restate that it is with sadness that I 
cannot support Bill C-53 because of the reasons that I have 
stated in my speech.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to speak today on Bill C-53, an 
act to establish the Department of Canadian Heritage.
<P>
	I want to use this opportunity to talk about what it means to be 
Canadian. In 1993 when the Right Hon. Kim Campbell 
announced the reorganization of her government, the big selling 
point was the reduction of federal departments from 32 to 23 and 
the elimination of all minister of state positions.
<P>
	She further justified the new structure by selling it as a 
significant step toward streamlining government. This was 
going to give Canadians a leaner, more accessible government. 
Multiculturalism was placed under her new Department of 
Canadian Heritage together with a mishmash of other programs 
and responsibilities.
<P>
	Recognizing the level of public support for reducing the size 
of federal bureaucracy, the new Liberal government kept most 
of her changes and multiculturalism remained quietly buried in 
a new superministry of Canadian heritage.
<P>
	This Liberal government failed to inform the Canadian people 
that the public perception of a government commitment to 
downsizing is unfounded. We have fewer ministers than we had 
under the previous government but now we have nine secretaries 
of state in addition to the full fledged ministers.
<P>
	One of these new secretaries of state has a portfolio solely 
devoted to multiculturalism and the status of women.
<P>
<B>(1715 ) </B>
<P>
	The only major difference between a secretary of state and a 
minister is the name. Secretaries of state are not allowed to sit in 
cabinet and must report through the minister, but they have 
offices, staff and responsibilities for policy development in the 
departments to which they are assigned. They also receive an 
extra $35,000 a year salary and a car allowance.
<P>
	This is not downsizing. What about the Canadian heritage 
department itself? Will taxpayers save any money through this 
restructuring and reorganization? Apparently not. When 
announcing the official establishment of this new department, 
top bureaucrats made it very clear that there would be no layoffs. 
Civil servants are being shuffled between new ministries but 
their jobs are secure, even if the future of some of the programs 
is not.
<P>
	The number of employees in the multicultural program will 
remain at approximately 6,000, the same as 1992-93 levels. 
Multiculturalism now falls under another department but it is 
possible to compare current funding to that of previous years. In 
1992-93, $39.8 million was spent on multicultural programs. 
Last fiscal year it was $36.9 million, and this year's forecast is 
$38.8 million. This does not include some of the spinoff 
programs that fall under the government's multicultural agenda.
<P>
	For example, although the proposed Canadian race relations 
foundation is not functioning yet, the federal government
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6877"> 6877 </A></B>
<P>
earmarked $24 million for it. This is hardly  what I would call a 
stellar performance in cost reduction or downsizing.
<P>
	Why do we have the multicultural policy we do? Why do we 
spend money to support special interest groups to maintain or 
rediscover their differences, rather than for the promotion of our 
shared symbols and positive Canadian qualities?
<P>
	Immigrants have come to Canada for countless reasons over 
the years. For many it represented a place of safety to rebuild 
lives shattered by wars. For others it was a land of opportunity; 
if they worked hard they could become financially secure, send 
their children off to university and express their will within a 
democratic society.
<P>
	These people came to Canada to become Canadians. They 
willingly left their country of birth and chose Canada as their 
new home. They came here to build a new life and a new reality 
for themselves and their children. To them, Canada symbolized 
hope. It was not just a place where they could become rich. It 
represented freedom from oppression or tyranny, from hunger or 
civil strife.
<P>
	It was a land that, for the most part, accepted them as 
newcomers and tolerated their differences until they learned 
more about their chosen country and its culture.
<P>
	Refugees come to our shores for many of the same reasons. 
Because Canada is isolated from refugee generating countries 
by vast oceans and by the United States, refugees must make a 
conscious decision that this is the country they want to move to. 
They must make extensive plans and pool their resources just to 
get here to claim refugee status. I believe they choose Canada 
for the same reasons that immigrants have in the past; an 
opportunity to get ahead in a country they are proud to be part of, 
a country that respects human rights and freedoms, a country 
where they will not have to live in fear.
<P>
	Although immigrants and refugees left their homes to find the 
Canadian dream, what do newcomers to Canada find today? 
They discover a government that promotes cultural diversity, 
that tells them it is more important to maintain the identity they 
left behind than it is to become a Canadian. How many years is it 
before they are truly considered a Canadian? With our 
multicultural policy, how many generations will it take before 
people start thinking of themselves as Canadians rather than as 
outsiders? How can we eliminate racism or ghettoization if we 
perpetuate hyphenated Canadianism? How much time will it 
take for this government to understand that being a Canadian to 
a Canadian is more important than where you or your ancestors 
came from?
<P>
	Everyone should be proud of their roots but they should also 
be proud to be a Canadian. We should be working toward the 
creation of a single national identity that we can all live with. 
Being Canadian is more than holding down a job, it is people 
pulling together for a common purpose and a common goal. This 
country is  built on the efforts of people who came from all over 
the world to help create a nation they are proud to call home.
<P>
	Throughout our history immigrants have worked hard to help 
forge the country we see today. They started out as immigrants 
but they built it as Canadians, for Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1720 ) </B>
<P>
	We are among the most tolerant people in the world. 
Regrettably, we have also had black periods in our history 
during which certain groups were not respected for their 
contribution or were denied access to our institutions and to 
some fundamental human rights.
<P>
	We have grown a great deal over the past several decades. We 
have abolished institutionalized discrimination and promote 
respect for human rights at home and abroad. We must remain 
vigilant to ensure equality of opportunity for all Canadians but 
we must not let the pendulum swing so far toward 
accommodating special interests that we lose sight of who we 
are.
<P>
	By promoting all cultures we will end up with none. What 
glue will hold our nation together?
<P>
	As the make-up of our population changes, our national 
culture will naturally evolve to reflect that diversity. It is not 
something government can legislate or control. When 
government steps in, as it has, to encourage differences between 
people rather than fostering unity by encouraging common 
Canadian values other segments of our society will feel 
threatened because they will perceive their cultural values to be 
under siege.
<P>
	When the cultural make-up of our population has changed to 
the point that our institutions no longer reflect the Canadian 
identity then there will be overwhelming public support and 
pressure for those changes to occur.
<P>
	Government cannot dictate culture and government cannot 
control its expression. The government's role should be to 
clarify our similarities, not aggravate our differences. Cultural 
change occurs over generations but a nation must have a 
touchstone for its national identity, a reference point that 
immigrants from other countries can refer to.
<P>
	We leave them floundering, having to rely on our 
multicultural policy of celebrating diversity as a guide to what it 
is to be a Canadian.
<P>
	Canada has a distinct identity. We can all feel it. We know it is 
there but most Canadians cannot articulate it. When asked what 
it is to be a Canadian, many people used to respond that it is not 
being an American. We are more than a negative. We have our 
own positive sense of national identity and it must be 
communicated to all newcomers to this land.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6878"> 6878 </A></B>
<P>
	To me being Canadian is many things. Being Canadian is 
truly believing in our inherent right to freedom of speech and 
expression, freedom of religion, the right to assemble and to 
demonstrate peacefully, freedom of the press, tolerance for 
differences and respect for human rights and democratic 
institutions. These are some of the common values I believe 
make us Canadians.
<P>
	There is also an expectation held by the majority of Canadians 
that we will continue to support and, if necessary, defend our 
individual and collective rights to these freedoms.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Parliamentary Secretary 
to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
listened with great interest to the members of the Bloc and the 
members of the Reform Party, particularly on their views on 
multiculturalism. It is obvious they do not have a clue what 
multiculturalism means and what it is all about.
<P>
	I want to tell them a little bit about what multiculturalism is. 
Multiculturalism is a vision of Canada. One of the things that is 
really lacking on that side is a vision of Canada. It has no real 
vision of Canada. It does not understand that multiculturalism is 
valuing our cultural diversity and how important it is to value 
our cultural diversity.
<P>
	As someone who came to Canada as a young boy at the age of 
six, I know a lot about multiculturalism. I know a lot about some 
of the barriers that immigrants face when they come here. Our 
family came here in 1906. If some people would read the history 
of what happened in British Columbia they would understand 
that at that time we did not have a policy of multiculturalism and 
there were laws that discriminated against certain groups. If we 
talk about the <I>Komagata Maru</I>, I ask everyone to read about that 
or the exclusion act. All of those things will give members a 
better idea of why multiculturalism is so important.
<P>
	One of the Reform members said that everybody is the same. 
Everybody is not the same. I have three children and they have 
different needs. They are not the same. For some reason the 
Reform Party thinks if we treat everyone the same we are 
treating them equally.
<P>
<B>(1725 ) </B>
<P>
	People have different demands. People have different needs, 
just as the aboriginal community has different needs. As a 
society we have to recognize that. We have to make sure that 
they participate.
<P>
	The Reform Party members are the same people who took the 
lead to campaign against Sikhs in the RCMP even though it was 
against the charter of human rights. The legal courts have shown 
that. Do members think they will change their policy even 
though the courts have ruled it is against the charter in a recent 
decision?
<P>
	The Reform Party members actively have a policy which 
discriminates. I say that they do not understand what 
multiculturalism is. It is about bridging, about communication. 
That shows how little they know because they are not interested 
in listening when somebody has a different view.
<P>
	Multiculturalism is about communication between different 
cultures. It is about bridging, about participating, about 
including Canadians. That is what multiculturalism is.
<P>
	For members who want to talk about treating people equally, 
in their convention they had a resolution that says that 
immigrants should not get any social benefits for the first five 
years, but they want them to pay the same taxes. They do not 
want to give them a break on the taxes. They do not want to give 
them any social benefits for the first five years. Is that treating 
people equally? That is not treating people equally. That is about 
dividing Canadians. That is what we do not want. We want to 
include Canadians, not divide them. That is what the Liberal 
Party is all about and what this Liberal government is all about.
<P>
	I am very proud of my culture and heritage and I believe it is 
very important that people know about their roots. If you do not 
know your roots you do not know where to go. I have learned 
that it is very important.
<P>
	There are many business people in the Reform Party and they 
should understand how important multiculturalism is in this 
global economy. In the province of British Columbia people 
recognize that. The recent government has said in the schools it 
wants to be able to teach Mandarin, Cantonese and Punjabi 
where the needs are. That is important for the global economy 
and for us from an economic point of view to have growth in 
jobs. We cannot work in isolation. That is why it is so important.
<P>
	In my own riding there is an area called the Punjabi market 
where many Indo-Canadians have their shops. The other day I 
opened a convention at the Pan Pacific and a tourist from the 
U.S. said: ``I have heard about the Punjabi market. I would like 
to go down there and do some shopping''. That is how important 
it is from an economic point of view to have that cultural 
diversity.
<P>
	In the area of arts and culture the members of the Reform 
Party think that we can cut all the funding for arts and culture 
and then when we have the money all of a sudden all the artists 
and the infrastructure will come back; that sure, we can cut all 
the funding for arts and culture and five years from now it will 
be very simple to all of a sudden fund it again and all the art and 
culture will flourish. Life is not that simple. Art and culture are 
very important to this country and it is very important to 
maintain them.
<P>
	I was on a trip to Europe this summer and when you visit a 
museum like the Louvre or a city like Edinburgh you really 
understand how art and culture are very important. I hope 
members of the Reform Party will also  look at that with an open

GOVERNMENT SERVICES ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed from October 17 consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-52, an act to establish the Department of 
Public Works and Government Services and to amend and repeal 
certain acts, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee; and of the amendment.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Pursuant to Standing 
Order 45(5)(a) the House will now proceed to the taking of the 
deferred division on the amendment of Mr. Marchand at second 
reading of Bill C-52, an act to establish the Department of 
Public Works and Government Services and to amend and repeal 
certain acts.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Madam Speaker, I think you would find 
unanimous consent to apply the result of the vote at report stage 
on the amendment to Bill C-49 to this vote.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Do we have unanimous 
consent?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee:</B> I rise on a point of order, Madam Speaker. I would be 
delighted to participate in the unanimous consent for the most 
recent division.
<P>
	I was absent from my seat and I would ask that as the votes are 
being applied my vote be applied with the government caucus.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Meredith:</B> I rise on a point of order, Madam Speaker. I 
was also absent for the vote on Bill C-49 and I would appreciate 
if my vote would be recorded on Bill C-52 as supporting it.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Cowling:</B> Madam Speaker, I was unavoidably detained; 
I was not able to be here. However I would have voted with the 
government had I been here.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bryden:</B> Madam Speaker, I would like my vote to be 
recorded as being with the government on this amendment, if I 
may.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. We had 
an agreement with the government whip that we would apply to 
this vote the same as we voted on Bill C-49 and the last member 
of Parliament who just rose to say he wanted to vote with the 
government voted opposite to the government on Bill C-49.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Easter:</B> Madam Speaker, I just want to be sure that this 
vote is opposite to the report stage motion, or is it the same as 
the report stage motion and not the recorded amendment?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Order. This motion is 
opposite to the amendment of the hon. member for Malpeque on 
Bill C-49.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Easter:</B> I rise on a point of order, Madam Speaker. I 
would wish that my vote be applied in the reverse to what it was 
on the amendment to Bill C-49, in other words with the 
government.
<P>
<B>(1830 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dromisky:</B> Madam Speaker, on a point of order, I wish to 
vote with the government on this motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Steckle:</B> Madam Speaker, on a point of order, I also wish 
to cast my vote on the side of the government on the motion 
itself.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peterson:</B> Madam Speaker, on a point of order, I would 
like my vote to be applied-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.

<P>
	He said: Madam Speaker, I know the hour is late and we have 
just been through a number of votes but I am hoping that the 
members who are still here, or those that are watching from their 
offices or on their way to their offices, could take a few minutes 
to pay some attention to the bill presently before the House.
<P>
<B>(1835 ) </B>
<P>
	This is actually the second time that I have brought the bill 
forward. I presented the bill in the last Parliament as Bill C-289. 
The title of the bill is the Remembrance Day Act.
<P>
	One of the problems we have had in the past in dealing with 
Remembrance Day is that the farther we get from the time that 
we have actually had a conflict where loss of life has taken 
place, the more likely it is that we will forget the sacrifices that 
were made by the many men and now women of the Canadian 
Armed Forces in the pursuit of liberty and freedom for people all 
around the globe.
<P>
	Remembrance Day goes back quite far. It used to be called 
Armistice Day and it was celebrated at Thanksgiving. Then 
around 1931, it became Remembrance Day. Everybody in the 
country believes that Remembrance Day is a holiday and I guess 
by definition that is what it is.
<P>
	What exactly holiday means is quite another thing. Does 
holiday mean, as I used to think it meant, that it is a day set aside 
and nobody, unless they are deemed to be an essential employee, 
goes to work? Does holiday mean that it is time to go to the 
beach or to take a few hours off and relax?
<P>
	The Remembrance Day holiday is quite different. It is 
different than any other holiday on the books. It is different 
because it is not meant as a time for people to take time off. It is 
meant as a time of solemn remembrance of those who fought for 
liberty, for freedom, for those who have given up their lives in 
pursuit of these very noble goals.
<P>
	Every member in this Chamber represents veterans. In 
Canada today there are over 700,000 veterans, many of whom 
were wounded, many of whom have lost very good friends. They 
saw their best friend die in front of them far away in a foreign 
land with no shoulder to cry on. It was done in the pursuit of that 
tangible called freedom.
<P>
	It seems the further we get away from the date of a conflict 
where lives are lost, we forget. It is far too easy for me as a 
39-year-old and certainly for my children who are three, eight 
and ten to forget how important that contribution has been for 
us.
<P>
	I introduced Bill C-289 in the last Parliament. The 
importance of that bill at the time was to make sure that at least 
in the area that we control as a government in the agreements 
that are entered into under the Public Service Staff Relations 
Act, we ensure that we honour the memory of those who have 
given their lives and of the veterans who are still are out there, 
many of whom have been wounded.
<P>
	There are people like my father, Sharkey, as they called him 
because he was a good boxer in his day, who was shot twice. He 
fought in the Italian campaign after the liberation of Holland, 
and lost many of his friends. The bill will ensure that my 
children see the example set by the federal government in 
ensuring that every collective agreement that is entered into by 
the Government of Canada, that this holiday, this special time of 
remembrance, is not traded away.
<P>
	Members are going to ask: ``Is that not the way it is?'' Yes, 
that is the way it is. The reason I introduced the bill two years 
ago and the reason I reintroduced it is that there seems to be a 
possibility-and if it is a possibility, it is a probability-the 
federal government negotiators through Treasury Board-it is 
no different even though the government has changed-with the 
same mandate who hammer out collective agreements may 
change the holiday. I support the collective bargaining process.
<P>
	However there may come a time, because it always happens, 
that the federal government through its Treasury Board 
negotiators and a union of the Public Service of Canada through 
its negotiators will decide to trade away Remembrance Day for 
another holiday. It darned near happened two years ago at 
Canada Post.
<P>
	That is when this came to my attention. My father who is a 
veteran, president of the Cape Breton Highlanders Association, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6887"> 6887 </A></B>
<P>
called me and said: ``What am I reading in the paper? They are 
trying to trade Remembrance Day away, maybe for an extra 
benefit, maybe for a little bit more hospital coverage''. That was 
never the purpose of the holiday in the first place.
<P>
<B>(1840 ) </B>
<P>
	I introduced the bill and it received an unusual amount of 
support, so much so that the Conservative government, even 
though Treasury Board told Tory members not to support it, rose 
above partisanship and supported the bill in sufficient numbers 
that even a lowly Liberal backbench opposition member's 
private member's motion passed at second reading.
<P>
	It was one of the proudest days I have had as a member of 
Parliament. It showed that this place can work. If the principles 
are noble, the motives of members will be above reproach and 
they will support the right things. Unfortunately it did not get 
through committee.
<P>
	Therefore I introduce it again today in honour of the 60,000 
men who died serving our country in the first world war and all 
those who died during the second world war. Over 1.1 million 
Canadians served proudly, people like my father. During the 
Korean war over 300 Canadians gave their lives and hundreds, 
perhaps over 1,000, more were wounded. We must not forget 
those who served in the Persian gulf-thank goodness there was 
no loss of life-and our peacekeepers who are out there in some 
of the worst conditions in the world. They are down in the hell on 
earth that is Rwanda. They serve us proudly in Bosnia, where 
some have been injured and killed while serving our country 
abroad.
<P>
	I reintroduce the bill and I seek support from members. This 
bill will not encumber Treasury Board. That is bogus. I heard 
that argument from Treasury Board officials. Tomorrow I will 
try to get some assurance from the minister that before decisions 
are made about what does and does not encumber Treasury 
Board that they at least consult with the members who put the 
bills forward.
<P>
	The bill does nothing more than seek to entrench in law the 
current practice and that is to make sure that Remembrance Day 
is a holiday in federal collective agreements. It does not do 
anything to the business community. It does not do anything to 
collective agreements under the labour code. It simply says that 
for agreements entered into by the federal government with its 
own employees, under the Public Service Staff Relations Act, 
that unless one is a designated employee whose services are 
essential, one shall have Remembrance Day as a day of solemn 
remembrance for those men and now women who have been 
injured or killed defending peace, liberty and life abroad for our 
country, and that day will always be in federal public sector 
agreements as a day of solemn remembrance.
<P>
	I ask the members who are prepared to speak to keep that in 
mind. When we last raised this in the House I could not believe 
the response from nearly every legion in Canada. The president 
of the Royal Canadian Legion came to see me. Letters were sent 
in. Veterans from the second world war feel as they are getting 
older that it is far too easy for their grandchildren and maybe 
their great grandchildren to forget the sacrifices that many of 
them have made.
<P>
	I am seeking the support of the House to debate this bill. It 
will tell the veterans across Canada that the contribution that 
they made for this country and also what they gave up, is not 
going to be forgotten by the Parliament of Canada. It is a very 
small thing to do. Remembrance Day must always be held as a 
solemn day of remembrance for those who have gone before us 
in serving their country.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Godin (Châteauguay, B.Q.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak today on behalf of the Official Opposition in 
this debate on the bill that would include Remembrance Day as a 
holiday in public service collective agreements.
<P>
	This is not the first time that the member for Dartmouth has 
proposed such a thing. Indeed, he presented a similar bill in the 
previous Parliament. Unfortunately for him, the Conservative 
government arranged to defeat his bill when it was considered in 
committee. That was on February 18, 1993.
<P>
	That bill, like the one before us, was intended to prevent the 
government from putting the Remembrance Day holiday on the 
negotiating table with the unions. It was feared that this holiday 
would be traded for an extra day after the Boxing Day holiday.
<P>
<B>(1845) </B>
<P>
	Some guarantee had to be provided to enshrine this sacred 
holiday in our collective memory. This is the day when we 
remember the ultimate sacrifice made by those who went to war 
and enabled us to enjoy again the most precious gift: peace.
<P>
	This initiative reflects numerous decisions made over the 
years to that effect. This holiday is already in the official list of 
holidays included in section 166 of the Canada Labour Code, 
part III. It is also included in the Public Service Terms and 
Conditions of Employment Regulations. Every collective 
agreement signed by the Public Service Alliance of Canada with 
Treasury Board includes Remembrance Day in the list of 
holidays.
<P>
	Already in 1921, a day of commemoration was established in 
the Armistice Day Act, which said, and I quote: ``Throughout 
Canada in each and every year-the eleventh day of 
November-being the day in 1918 in which the great war was 
triumphantly concluded by an armistice, shall be a legal holiday 
and shall be kept and observed as such under the name of 
Armistice Day''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6888"> 6888 </A></B>
<P>
	In 1931, another act specified that this legal holiday would be 
called ``Remembrance Day'' and would be observed on 
November 11. In the Holidays Act, chapter H-5, Revised Status 
of Canada, 1985, Remembrance Day is the second holiday 
mentioned, right after Canada Day.
<P>
	One might wonder why have a bill to protect a holiday which 
already seems to be formally recognized. The purpose of this 
legislation is to eliminate the risk that this holiday might be used 
as a bargaining tool and be replaced by an additional day 
elsewhere in the calendar, a measure which would be at odds 
with the purpose of Remembrance Day, which is meant to be a 
day of commemoration and respect.
<P>
	The fact is that such a substitution is a possibility. There is a 
provision in section 195 of the Canada Labour Code which says 
that ``Any other holiday may be substituted for a general 
holiday''. Consequently, this substitution is a right which can be 
exercised or claimed. According to section 195, the parties to a 
collective agreement can notify in writing the Minister of 
Human Resources Development that a specified day has been 
designated as a holiday in lieu of a specified general holiday. 
Under the same section of the Canada Labour Code, where no 
employees of an employer are represented by a trade union or 
where a class of employees is not provided for under a collective 
agreement with regard to general holidays, the Minister may 
approve the substitution of a designated holiday, at the request 
of the employer, if satisfied that a majority of the employees or 
class of employees concur with the application.
<P>
	This goes to show that such provisions do exist and continue 
to exist, unaltered, without excluding holidays like 
Remembrance Day. We therefore take this opportunity to 
caution the sponsor of this bill. This piece of legislation would 
give a clear indication to the government. It would send a clear 
message to labour, but it would not eliminate the present 
loopholes that allow the substitution of general holidays and are 
likely to continue to allow it after this bill is passed.
<P>
<B>(1850) </B>
<P>
	We know how important the eleventh hour of the eleventh day 
of the eleventh month is since 1918. It is important not only for 
the veterans for whom this day represents the quintessence of 
their existence, for the soldiers who made the ultimate sacrifice 
in order to restore the world peace we now know, for the civil 
servants and the workers, but also for the children, the future 
generations who need tools to remember all the lessons passed 
down to them, from the most marvellous to the most tragic. We 
must protect the Remembrance Day to preserve our collective 
memories, pay tribute to the past and accept responsibility for 
the future.
<P>
	I am convinced that the government as well as the unions and 
the citizens realize the importance of the Remembrance Day, a 
day to pay tribute to our veterans,  to remember the horrible 
lessons the war has taught us, and to pass on a message to future 
generations.
<P>
	In brief, we support this bill in principle. We hope that the 
Remembrance Day will never be abolished, moved or replaced 
and that, in order to achieve this goal, all current federal labour 
legislation will be modified accordingly.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
gives me pleasure to speak on this motion. I, too, have lost 
relatives, in fact close relatives, due to these tragic wars. It has 
always been in my heart to make certain that these memories are 
not forgotten.
<P>
	We have before us Bill C-251 to provide that Remembrance 
Day be included as a holiday in public service collective 
agreements. This bill asks that Parliament negotiate on behalf of 
the public service.
<P>
	Parliament should never be involved in negotiating contracts 
for the public service or any other union. Bargaining is the role 
of union officials, union employees and union bargaining teams, 
not members of the House of Parliament. It is my understanding 
that the public service has already bargained for its workers to 
observe Remembrance Day as a holiday. Why then is this bill 
before Parliament?
<P>
	It seems that under the current negotiated contracts that 
workers deemed essential for the public safety or public interest 
must work on Remembrance Day but do not receive extra 
remuneration. Essentially this bill will provide extra payment 
for those deemed essential or required to work for the public 
safety.
<P>
	Let us think for a moment why it is that we pause at the 
eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month to 
remember: Lest we forget the sons and the daughters of 
Canadians in the time of the country's greatest need who chose 
to travel to foreign lands and defend this country against tyranny 
and dictatorship. Lest we forget many of the sons and daughters 
who did not return to the arms of their loved ones following the 
long, long journey to fight for democracy and freedom, yet they 
ensured that the same highest qualities remained in our 
government. Lest we forget thousands upon thousands of 
Canadians who offered up the ultimate sacrifice, their lives, so 
that we at home could remain free to choose how we should live 
our lives.
<P>
	I have heard tales of the carnage of war. I have listened to 
veterans of the wars talk about their time over there. Not too 
often do these men and women talk about the battles over there. 
They talk about the times that bring fond memories, the detailed 
preparations for battle, the training for battle, or the nights of 
quiet reflection remembering home.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6889"> 6889 </A></B>
<P>
	The reason those who faced the horrors of battle do not talk 
of seeing friends or comrades in arms who entered the fray but 
did not return is because of the pain that such recollections 
would bring.
<P>
	Those of us who have not experienced total war do not really 
understand the cost in human lives and human memories that 
such conflicts inflict. Those veterans of such times recall the 
horror, and believe me, none I know of say that those times were 
filled with glory.
<P>
<B>(1855 ) </B>
<P>
	Veterans ask us all to remember those who gave their lives for 
our freedom because they want Canadians to recall the total 
price that war brings. Veterans want those living today to 
remember total war costs. The cost is lives.
<P>
	No one in this House would dare ask Canadians to not honour 
the memory of those who offered the supreme sacrifice, their 
young lives, so that we today can stand on Remembrance Day to 
thank and remember them.
<P>
	By not supporting this bill, I do not make light of the sacrifice. 
None of those who died sought death. They were seeking to give 
life to this country and in doing so they died.
<P>
	I cannot support this bill, not because I do not believe we 
should not remember them but because I believe this House 
should not diminish the freedom of workers and management to 
choose on what terms they will agree to work together.
<P>
	As for the portion of this bill that will make it mandatory for 
those required to work on Remembrance Day to receive extra 
remuneration, I say this. If those we are remembering could 
freely choose to give the ultimate sacrifice so Canadians can be 
free, surely Canadian workers can freely choose to work on 
Remembrance Day without complaining about extra money.
<P>
	Our young of years gone by were prepared to travel across the 
sea, live in mudholes and dwell in the cold and damp to preserve 
our freedom. They chose to do that. Surely it is not too much to 
ask those required for public safety or essential services in these 
times of peace to do so without thinking of their paycheques.
<P>
	Members of this House must never allow the memory of our 
young men and women who died so we may be free to diminish 
in this land. We must honour them so we will continually recall 
the price we must pay when we involve this country and our 
young in war. Surely we can remember them without a bill that 
essentially removes a freedom they fought for, the freedom to 
negotiate working conditions. Surely those who are needed to 
labour on Remembrance Day can do so without demanding extra 
pay.
<P>
	Our young of the past died so we could be free. Our young of 
the present can pause at the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of 
the eleventh month to remember those who died and why we 
must remember that war has a price.
<P>
	Surely that price is more than time and a half on a paycheque 
and that price is more than removing one freedom from those 
who fought and died for our many freedoms.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Gallaway (Sarnia-Lambton, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Bill C-251 has in this House a history which today I 
would suggest we have a chance to rewrite, not in the sense of 
being revisionist historians but rewrite perhaps out of a sense of 
duty.
<P>
	On May 20 of last year this bill died in this Chamber-it was 
known as C-289 at that time-because of many factors, the 
principal of which was somewhat of a disagreement among and 
between parties and interest groups. That is, I would suggest, 
tragic because an act of remembrance is not a political or 
partisan fact.
<P>
	We have seen in this same House in the past several months 
debates concerning the role of Canada in its military and 
peacekeeping. Although we as a country are not necessarily one 
of the major military leaders globally, we have garnered much 
respect internationally because of the extreme competence of 
our personnel and their effectiveness on these missions.
<P>
	I really should ask the question: Why have we for many years 
been sending soldiers and our armed forces everywhere in the 
world? I think the response is quite simple. It is simply because 
in this country there is a belief that we Canadians should try to 
look for and from time to time make peace.
<P>
	I believe that Canadians share a common set of beliefs, 
attitudes and values and that one of these elementary or core 
principles is our role as makers of peace on this globe. Surely I 
do not need to tell those present in this place of the hundreds of 
thousands of lives lost in this century.
<P>
<B>(1900 ) </B>
<P>
	These were lives that were freely given because we as a 
country believed that it was a basic value shared in this country 
and the importance of our place in the world order. Of course, 
those who contributed the most are not here to ask us as a 
national collective to remember them.
<P>
	Next year, 1995, will mark the 50th anniversary of the end of 
World War II and one would expect and undoubtedly there will 
be many national and international ceremonies to mark the end 
of the war. One obvious conclusion to be seen at these 
ceremonies is the fragility, the aging process, of those who were 
directly involved.
<P>
	Wars or armed conflicts always operate on two distinct levels. 
On an individual basis it has a profound effect on those who 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6890"> 6890 </A></B>
<P>
were directly involved. Today the veterans of World War II in 
this country are on average in their  seventies and are declining 
rapidly in number. That unfortunately is a simple fact of life.
<P>
	There is a second level to this. Wars have affected and 
moulded national identities and impressed, which is surely the 
case in this country, and reinforced the attitudes and values in 
our dealings with other sovereign states.
<P>
	In Canada there is no doubt a realization that we as a country 
became an international entity and acquired a national 
conscience and identity because of our role in the major 
conflicts in the first half of this century; conflicts in which, 
unfortunately, the youth of this country fueled our endeavours. 
Today we do virtually nothing as a country or on a national basis 
to recognize the importance of the sacrifices made.
<P>
	I know that this bill has reached the point of national 
consensus from a provincial perspective. There are a number of 
individuals in this country who are vitally interested in this bill.
<P>
	One principal proponents of this bill is a lady by the name of 
Mrs. Wilma McNeil, to whom I spoke this afternoon. She has 
written to all ten premiers. The responses have been unanimous 
in support.
<P>
	It is interesting to note and to put on the record here today that 
at least one premier in this country believed and put it in writing 
to her that he thought it was some sort of a holiday already. He 
did not realize the lack of the role of the federal government in 
this day.
<P>
	Mrs. McNeil has also waged an information war to advise 
veterans organizations in this country about this bill. These 
groups, the core of which represent those who survived the war, 
have unanimously endorsed this bill.
<P>
	Finally, I am speaking here today in support of this because I 
think it is an opportunity for the government and for members of 
Parliament to recognize the importance of this, not only on an 
individual basis because that will fade with time, but we as a 
national collective, as a country, recognize that this represents a 
day which has great importance to the national attitude and 
belief and, most important, the national values of this country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
in addressing Bill C-251, members will recall that this same bill 
was introduced by the same member three years ago. It was 
designated a votable item at that time and it passed first and 
second reading and was referred to committee. The committee 
voted against the bill four to three, even after appearances from 
the army, navy and air force veterans and the Treasury Board. 
After that the bill was returned to the House and eventually 
dropped from the order paper.
<P>
	It seems that the subject of this bill has already been carefully 
considered and the substance of it rejected by the House. With so 
many other priorities in the House of Commons and so many 
other good private members' bills that have never seen the light 
of day, I am perhaps  not all that surprised to see that this bill has 
come back to the House.
<P>
	Why would the committee choose this particular bill and this 
particular topic unless it somehow intends to choose bills that 
have been rehashed or bills of little import, unless it intends to 
make the business of Private Members' Business even less 
relevant than it is already?
<P>
<B>(1905 ) </B>
<P>
	Perhaps the committee choosing these bills is trying to deflect 
the political troubles that inevitably arise when this House 
considers weighty topics that are truly relevant to the issues of 
the day.
<P>
	We must not avoid talking about the things that Canadians are 
talking about. The direction of this government should be put 
into reverse by tackling the tough issues first instead of putting 
off the repairs until tomorrow, wall papering over the cracks and 
ignoring the holes in the ceiling of Canada's national House.
<P>
	On to Remembrance Day in this particular bill, it appears to 
me that this bill really is redundant because in many ways the 
matter is already entrenched in federal legislation. Canada's 
labour code lists Remembrance Day as a general holiday. It is 
also included in the regulations attached to the Financial 
Administration Act and the Federal Holidays Act lists it as one 
of three national holidays.
<P>
	If Remembrance Day were the subject of much dispute it 
might be different. If hundreds of thousands of public servants 
were not already receiving Remembrance Day as a holiday I 
might be more inclined to agree that the heavy hand of 
legislation must be applied to this matter.
<P>
	This is not the case and on the contrary allow me to quote from 
article 12 of the master agreement between the federal 
government and the Professional Institute of the Public Service 
of Canada a union representing about 31,000 federal employees: 
``The following days shall be designated paid holidays for 
employees: New Years Day, Good Friday, Easter Monday, the 
Sovereign's birthday, Canada Day, Labour Day, Thanksgiving 
and Remembrance Day''. The list goes on.
<P>
	This is a voluntary agreement arrived at in a consensual 
manner between 31,000 federal public servants and the 
Government of Canada. The master agreement already 
designates Remembrance Day as a paid holiday.
<P>
	There is even a more sweeping document that says the same 
thing. It is the master agreement between the Public Service 
Alliance of Canada and the government representing another 
total of 170,000 federal public servants. It too designates 
Remembrance Day as a paid holiday.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6891"> 6891 </A></B>
<P>
	It is clear that I must oppose this legislation for a number 
of reasons. The first reason is that it is not necessary. Treasury 
Board tells me that a grand total of 382,000 federal employees 
already stay home on November 11, receiving time and a half 
pay, giving them the opportunity to consider the tremendous 
price that was once paid by so many courageous Canadians.
<P>
	This bill must also be opposed because from a Reform Party 
point of view we believe there should be a minimal involvement 
by the state in these types of matters. The state should not be 
legislating on matters that can be negotiated voluntarily 
between parties. This of course has been a problem with 
Canadian governments for far too long.
<P>
	The government needs to become involved where there are 
clear practices of obvious abuse but we can see from the master 
agreements I have quoted from that the government has been 
very generous to give the day off even when many private sector 
workers do not receive Remembrance Day as a holiday.
<P>
	Do you know the costs to the taxpayer of this part of the 
agreement, Mr. Speaker? The Treasury Board estimates it at $50 
million to $75 million for this one day's pay.
<P>
	We have already paid a big price for Remembrance Day 
observances. Obviously there is no need whatsoever for 
government involvement in this case.
<P>
	That leads naturally to the second reason for my opposition to 
Bill C-251. Why should the federal public service have another 
holiday entrenched in law when the private sector does not? If 
the member for Dartmouth really thought that Remembrance 
Day was important enough to be included in collective 
agreements why stop at the public sector? Why not extend this 
bill to include the private sector?
<P>
	Perhaps he does not realize what he is doing, that he is 
unwittingly offering a special privilege to the public sector 
toward enlarging the benefits and powers enjoyed by 
governments and government workers.
<P>
	I would ask the member also to consider an unfortunate side 
effect to this bill which is to unconsciously deepen the wedge 
between private and public sectors. While the private sector has 
already weathered the storms of recession, while it has 
experienced massive layoffs and is now leaner than ever before, 
the member for Dartmouth would entrench public service 
benefits even more deeply than they are already. In essence he 
would further secure the isolation of public servants from our 
devastating fiscal problems, problems that may one day bring 
this government crashing down.
<P>
	We have a public service that is respected worldwide. Our 
public service is the equal of any and as much as we might like to 
shield our public servants from decades of indulgent spending 
by federal governments, the chickens are proverbially coming 
home to roost.
<P>
<B>(1910 ) </B>
<P>
	Yesterday the finance minister could do nothing but crow 
about the debt and deficit and warn that government services 
and programs and yes, even jobs, must tumble in the coming 
months. This is the third reason I oppose the bill. It is not 
financially possible to guarantee the benefits that public 
servants have now, much less offer them more security and more 
insulation and isolation from what is happening in the real 
world.
<P>
	The final reason for my opposition to this piece of legislation 
is more broadly philosophical. A collective agreement is by 
definition an agreement between two parties. This implies a 
process of negotiation in which items are traded back and forth 
until both sides agree on an acceptable package of items they can 
both live with. It is a process of mutual compromise.
<P>
	When the government begins to legislate more and more 
elements of collective agreements it puts both parties at a 
distinct disadvantage because it reduces the number of possible 
compromises that can be made by either party. This makes 
agreements harder to negotiate. It is sort of like trying to sell a 
car with a precondition that the buyer must be willing to pick the 
car up in another city. It makes the sale much harder to negotiate 
when some of the terms are set beforehand.
<P>
	I would remind members that the president of the Public 
Service Alliance of Canada has mentioned that it might be 
possible that all holidays will be subject to negotiation between 
parties in the months ahead. I wonder if even the union 
representing our federal workers would support this type of 
legislation.
<P>
	My opposition to this legislation has nothing to do with 
Remembrance Day. It has nothing to do with the respect and 
gratitude I feel for those who sacrificed so much to bring me and 
my generation peace and prosperity. I guess I would be called 
one of the baby boomer generation and I have never experienced 
the agonies of war. However, I am not that far removed, even 
from World War II.
<P>
	My father joined the air force during the war. Allow me to 
read from a book written about my father entitled <I>A Canadian 
Story</I>: ``On October 26, 1943 he went to the number six 
recruitment centre in Winnipeg to enlist and when he arrived he 
was informed that he could indeed sign up but that anyone under 
the age of 18 had to have his parents' permission. Bill'', my 
father's name, ``took the necessary form, walked outside the 
building, forged his mother's signature and went back in''.
<P>
	My dad was just a 17-year old kid but he was willing to do just 
about anything to do his part for the country. He served with the 
air force for two years even here in Ottawa: ``On October 9, 1945 
Bill was discharged from the air force. His two years in the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6892"> 6892 </A></B>
<P>
service of the king was similar to that of many other young men. 
He had volunteered to serve his country when it needed him, as 
did millions of others''.
<P>
	I am not untouched by the war and I am not untouched by the 
sacrifice of people like my father. In the end, he only had to 
spend two years of his life in this cause, but he was willing to lay 
down his entire life if that is what his country asked of him. I can 
only hope that if, God forbid, the necessity arises again, I would 
be willing to do as much to serve my own country.
<P>
	Remembrance Day is a vital reminder of the price Canadians 
paid for the things we hold dear and let us hope that Canadians in 
both the private and public sectors, in homes and in businesses, 
in their personal and public statements will remember the 
sacrifices made by our ancestors.
<P>
	Legislating additional public service holidays is both unwise 
and unnecessary in order that they may be remembered.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (St. Boniface, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on Bill C-251, 
this piece of legislation.
<P>
	I want to commend my colleague for having brought it forth. I 
want to correct a couple of things. First of all, this is now a 
recognized holiday in the collective agreement. It can float. 
That is the issue. The point about an extra $50 million to $70 
million is totally erroneous. One could counteract by pointing 
out that if it is worth that much in a collective agreement it could 
be traded off.
<P>
	What my colleague is seeking to do is make absolutely certain 
that it is a holiday on that day. Why is that? It is because of the 
sacrifice of the soldiers and their families and their supporters. 
Because of their sacrifice, we want to set this day aside to make 
absolutely certain that we remember what they contributed to 
this nation, the freedom that we have today, the greatest gift 
apart from health that anyone could possibly have. Because of 
their sacrifice we have one of the finest, if not the finest, nations 
in the world. We started with a real head start because this is a 
wonderful country, but when we think of what they have 
contributed to the very fabric of the nation surely we can set a 
day aside throughout the nation to remember what they have 
contributed.
<P>
<B>(1915) </B>
<P>
	Unfortunately we take what we have for granted. I remember 
going to church services where the pastor indicated that we take 
our good health for granted until we start losing it. Then we 
suddenly we start to remember how important it is.
<P>
	We take our freedoms for granted. We take the greatness of 
the country for granted. We take this wonderful, magnificent 
country of ours too much for granted. We have to stop and 
reflect, to think, and to say thank you. That is what we want to 
say. We want to say thank you to our soldiers. We want to say 
thank you to their families. We want to say thank you to those 
who supported them. That is what this is all about.
<P>
	We want to set a day aside to remember the wars, remember 
the destructiveness of wars, and remember that war should be 
passé. We want to remember those who died. We want to 
remember those who were wounded. We want to remember 
those who came back but who have passed on. We want to make 
sure that we do not forget their sacrifice, their tremendous 
contribution to the country, this free country.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	My hon. colleague wishes to have this day set aside in 
memory of the sacrifices made by our soldiers, their families 
and those who supported them. We want to remember the wars. 
We want to remember those who died on the battlefields. We 
want to remember those who were wounded and those who came 
back, but have since passed on. We want to remember their 
contribution to our country, to what is probably the most 
beautiful and perhaps the best country in the world. We want to 
remember that they gave us a country where we can live in 
freedom.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	That is really all I really wanted to say. This is an important 
initiative. This is an initiative that we should all be supporting. 
This is not an initiative that should be somehow shunted aside 
because of supposed costs. There are no costs. We simply ask 
that we set a day aside that is consistent throughout Canada so 
that we can remember those who served.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harold Culbert (Carleton-Charlotte, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to speak on Bill C-251 this 
evening in the House. The bill will ensure that Remembrance 
Day is respected by public servants in the way that it was 
intended. For this reason I fully support the hon. member's bill 
and would like to commend him on bringing it forward.
<P>
	Remembrance Day is much more than a holiday or a day off 
during the longer days of fall. It was introduced into our country 
as a day to do just that: to remember, to remember those who 
gave their lives so that we the people who stand before you 
today, Mr. Speaker, would be able to enjoy the freedoms we now 
have. It is to remember those who fought, those who made the 
supreme sacrifice with their lives, and those who sacrificed here 
at home during the two world wars and in Korea. It is to 
remember, simply so that we will not forget the sacrifices that 
touched so many Canadian families.
<P>
	Children growing up today have no recollection of the 
sufferings that took place during those times of strife. To them it 
is another story in our history books. The recognition of 
Remembrance Day sparks questions in these children and in turn 
they will become informed. In this way the sacrifices and the 
<P>

<B><A NAME="6893"> 6893 </A></B>
<P>
tragedies will never be forgotten, for it is when we forget that 
history repeats itself.
<P>
	Remembrance Day has always been and should always be 
recognized on November 11. As it now stands the day can be 
used as a bargaining chip to obtain an extra day off at some other 
time of the year. Remembrance Day was not intended to be part 
of a lengthened festive season. It is a time to be solemn, to 
remember, to respect, and not to rejoice.
<P>
<B>(1920) </B>
<P>
	Of course there are exceptions in the bill for those people who 
provide services that are essential to public safety or interest. 
These people will naturally have to work on this day and will be 
compensated appropriately. However in general Canadians 
should not be required to work. The country must hold on to 
those things that are most important to our history, not put them 
aside as if they belong to another era. We must teach our 
children it is important to respect those who died, fought and 
sacrificed so that we would be able to stand in front of the House 
today to debate the issue.
<P>
	In my constituency of Carleton-Charlotte there are many 
veterans and many families of veterans who gave their all, in 
many cases loved ones who gave their lives, so that we might 
enjoy our Canadian freedoms. I shudder to think what might 
have happened to our world without their sacrifices.
<P>
	I urge all members of the House to think of future generations 
and what will happen if we are allowed to forget.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Richardson (Perth-Wellington-Waterloo, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to participate in 
the debate and to pay tribute, as have past speakers who are 
either for or against the concept of Remembrance Day.
<P>
	I had the opportunity to follow my father to Europe in the 
early 1950s when the Canadians went over and I saw the 
devastation in the countryside. I spent a lot of my younger life 
serving in the NATO forces. Nothing can teach like visiting a 
graveyard with the headstones of 5,000 to 10,000 soldiers. I 
refer to the second previous speaker who mentioned his father 
joining at 18 years of age. I went into Beny-sur-Mer and saw 19 
and 20 year old sergeants; they hardly let them lead a section 
today. These young people gave their lives. I saw their graves 
for miles.
<P>
	Nothing struck me more than when I went to Vimy Ridge and 
saw the massive battlefield and the Canadian monument which 
is part of Canada in France. Later I went to Verdun and saw on 
the hill, as far as the eye could see in the trees, the white markers 
where a million people had died in the first world war around 
Verdun, both German and French soldiers. The slaughter in 
those periods touched me deeply.
<P>
	I hope we never have to see it again, but the remembrance of 
such an event was burnt deeply in my mind. As a consequence I 
hope we can teach in school about the history of wars. Although 
it can be a vicarious kind of experience for the teacher and the 
students, it can ask people to remember not to make the same 
mistakes of the past. We can imagine what it must feel like never 
to have returned.
<P>
	Those are questions that are deep and piercing. Neither the 
teaching of history nor the experience of imagination come 
close to explaining the depth and intensity of the experiences of 
generations of Canadians who went through the first war, the 
second war and the Korean war. Some of them had such horrible 
experiences they will never talk about the war; they have a bond 
of silence concerning their experiences. Sometimes we can 
never get some people to stop talking about them, but that is the 
spectrum of the effect of those experiences on them.
<P>
<B>(1925 ) </B>
<P>
	That is why we gather as Canadians to remember and to give 
thanks in our hearts for the peace and freedom our forefathers 
brought to us from those wars. Never as Canadians have we ever 
sought to go to a war with unjust cause. We have never sought to 
go to war to take a piece of another country's land. We have 
always gone for an honourable and just cause. For that we should 
be proud.
<P>
	Some older people know about the personal way of the 
sacrifices but they are fast leaving us. There are few working 
people who experienced the second world war. There are some 
who experienced the Korean war. There are no oral histories to 
be given in the future. There must be some tangible recognition 
of that sacrifice which gives people a moment to reflect.
<P>
	One thing struck me. Every family had a right to select what 
would go on the headstones. I was 21 years old when I saw the 
headstone of a 21-year old corporal from the Winnipeg Rifles. It 
read: ``To all the world he was a soldier. To me he was all the 
world''.
<P>
	It was a rather choking experience because I never really got 
too emotional about it. I got into it as a young guy, all gung-ho, 
ready to go and do my bit for my country and to gain some 
experience. That may have the motivating force for some of our 
soldiers. However that headstone struck me as very sentimental.
<P>
	These kinds of things are very tangible. I wish someone would 
make a reasonable video to capture the spirit, the headstones, 
the actions that took place on D-Day, and all other events they 
experienced. They should keep it short and sweet because war is 
hell. We must keep that in perspective. We never want to step 
into it.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="6894"> 6894 </A></B>
<P>
	The older people remember the dark days of war. It left great 
impressions with them. In my father's family there were three 
boys. One joined the army. One joined the navy. One joined the 
air force. They all had different experiences but all came back 
with different attitudes. However one thing they had as a group 
was that they never wanted to go to war again. That was 
significant. However the cause being just can be presented in a 
way that may motivate people like them to go at it again.
<P>
	I have seen the news coverage of D-Day re-enacted and the 
role that Canadians played in a proud way, giving up their lives. 
When I was there I represented my regiment, the Queen's Own 
Rifles of Canada that landed at Beny-sur-Mer. I was serving 
with a fellow in the regiment who was had been there. He was a 
platoon commander. Of all 110 men in the company that went in, 
19 survived. It is an awful to think about what we left on the 
beaches. We had with us some of the sergeants who had served in 
other companies at the same time. They kept our history alive by 
making an attempt at their objectives on D-Day, which as we 
know eventually broke the back of the Nazis and brought peace 
to the world for a short period of time until the Korean war.
<P>
	I ask members to give due consideration to tangibly 
recognizing that sacrifice. The people in the employ of the 
government are perpetuating governmental institutions to some 
effect. That is why I stand today to support the bill.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
delighted to follow my hon. colleague from Stratford to speak in 
support of this bill.
<P>
	Several years ago I had perhaps one of the greatest 
experiences that one could have as a member of Parliament. I 
had the honour to go with the Canadian delegation to the 75th 
anniversary of the battle of Vimy Ridge in the company of 14 of 
the veterans of that battle, which was Canada's first. Many of us 
say it was perhaps the battle that forged our country. All of the 
veterans were over the age of 90.
<P>
	I remember one, a mere lad of 93, chasing one of his comrades 
age 95 around one of the monuments. I was astounded at the 
energy and the drive of these people at their great ages. I guess 
one had to have the constitution of a tank to survive in the 
trenches of 1914, 1915, 1916, 1917 and 1918.
<P>
	I saw some of the cemeteries that my hon. colleague talked 
about. I remember going through the largest Commonwealth 
cemetery. I cannot remember whether it was in France or 
Belgium. There were rows and rows of those little white 
headstones with maple leaves that said over and over again: ``A 
Canadian soldier known only to God''. I defy anyone not to be in 
tears after going through that.
<P>
	I also briefly went with some veterans of World War II on this 
trip to Dieppe. I saw that fearsome and frightening beach where 
young Canadians fought and died in such great numbers.
<P>
	Consequently, I would like to add my voice as the member for 
Halifax, the largest navy base in our country, a place where from 
all corners of Canada we remember with thanks and respect. I 
think that we should see Remembrance Day as a statutory 
holiday so that never, ever will we forget and so that the children 
and future generations will also know what Canadians have done 
to preserve their freedom and their heritage.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The time provided for the consideration of 
Private Members' Business has now expired.
<P>
	Pursuant to Standing Order 96(1) the order is dropped from 
the order paper.
<P>
	It being 7.33 p.m., this House stands adjourned until 
tomorrow at 2 p.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 7.33 p.m.)
