the vast majority of the world's population is made up of young

no information about their sexual and reproductive health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Annually two million people between the ages of five and fifteen

World and the International Conference on Population and 
Development have said both developed and developing countries 
must work to remove legal, regulatory and cultural barriers to 
sexual and reproductive health so that adolescents are able to 
have better access to the information and services about their 
health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since July 11 is World Population Day, I call upon CIDA and 
colleagues on both sides of this House to use this occasion to 
support initiatives that promote the sexual and reproductive 
health needs of young people.

as we break for the summer, all members will have the opportunity

want to learn more about their heroes, heroes like William 
Barker, Billy Bishop, Dr. George Mackay and many other Canadians.

Canada's economy has grown at an annual rate of 4.2% in the past

rose by nearly half a cent yesterday.

anniversary, are we any closer?  Are children in poverty any 
better off? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The answer is a resounding no.  Kids are worse off.  Families in 
poverty are worse off and the number of people and the depth of 
poverty is increasing.  What a disgrace.  And what an absurdity 
and insult that the Liberal government speaks about ending child 
poverty yet every action, program and cutback has taken us in the 
opposite direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one sign of hope.  The report from the subcommittee on 
children and youth at risk is raising the issues that need to be 
addressed and is questioning government policy.  As we end this

who spoke boldly and plainly about the deficit of social policy 
in regard to children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Addressing inequality and growing poverty in a rich country like

separation of Quebec from the rest of Canada.   Anything less

studies, which comes to approximately $66,000.

about Bill C-49. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Skeena yesterday railed against the 25%

is and it is time that it stopped in the House.

Canada's blood system has failed us again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Joel Pinon lied about his history when he donated blood, but 
his lie is only part of the problem.  Someone was given Mr.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
as the member knows, when people give blood they are asked 
questions to identify and eliminate risk.  In the case the member 
refers to, someone was asked the right questions.  The 
appropriate and safe procedure was followed.  Apparently the man 
was dishonest in responding.  As a result, the regulatory 
agencies have acted.  They have traced the blood.  They have 
tested it and it has tested negative.  The regulatory agencies 
are doing everything they can to respond in an appropriate way.

other provinces and territories, Quebec has been abandoned in

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council for

to affirm the specific nature of Quebec within Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have differing opinions, however, on the consequences of 
social union.  In our opinion, this agreement is going to 
reinforce affirmation of the specific nature of Quebec within 
Canada,  and if the unique character of Quebec society is not 
explicitly mentioned in the agreement, which Mr. Ryan 
justifiably regrets, that is very much contrary to the wishes of 
the Government of Canada. 
<P><A NAME="LINK63"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the nation 
builders in Ottawa are determined, in the name of an abstract 
and doctrinaire vision of individual and provincial equality, to 
introduce asymmetry into our federal system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When is the minister going to quit playing with words and 
concepts and tell Quebecers clearly that his vision of the 
federalism of the future is an even greater centralization than 
we have at present, which does not correspond to what Quebecers, 
even federalist Quebecers, want?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council for

federation.  Even Mr. Parizeau, the shadow leader of the Bloc 
Quebecois, has acknowledged that it was the most decentralized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I shall take the hon. member literally, however.  He is calling 
for clear questions to be asked of Quebecers.  If he asks 
Quebecers clearly whether they want to renounce Canada in favour 
of Quebec as an independent state, what the Prime Minister of 
Canada said in 1995 to the then Leader of the Opposition and 
leader of the Bloc Quebecois is really extremely true “If you 
ask a clear question, you will take quite a beating”.

express such a favourable opinion”.

must consider it very disappointing to find himself isolated in 
his abstract and doctrinaire concept of nation building, 
according to the words of Claude Ryan himself.

occur, all to his credit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Back to the argument now.  Mr. Ryan did say things we agree

<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not inclined to question this power in principle for two 
reasons.  First, the spending power is an essential power of 
sovereign states.  Second, in the past this power was necessary 
or very useful, to say the least, in situations of serious 
economic and social difficulty in the promotion of equal

farm income disaster.  Now flooding is causing a natural

<P><A NAME="LINK150"></A></P>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>SENATE SECURITY 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK151"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today on a question of privilege to invoke your 
judgement and that of those in the House on a matter which I 
believe infringes our privileges as members of parliament and 
threatens our ability to dutifully carry out and fulfil our 
obligations to represent our constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has come to our attention that the management of the Senate 
security circulated a memorandum to the security guards earlier 
this week featuring the picture of the member for 
Regina—Qu'Appelle and five other members of the House.  The memo 
includes photographs of the following members: the member for 
Regina—Qu'Appelle, the member for Sarnia—Lambton, the member 
for Calgary West; the member for Matapédia—Matane, the member 
for Charlevoix, and the member for Québec East. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question is why these members were singled out from all 
other members.  It is true that none of them has offices in 
Centre Block or East Block or the Senate buildings.  However, 
that is also true for many other members of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why then are they being singled out?  We can assume that such a 
memo was not circulated as the lead-up to a beauty pageant.  No, 
I understand that in the realm of security protocol such a memo 
featuring the photographs of selected individuals serves as a 
warning to security staff. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my contention that these members are being singled out 
because of their activities this week in a rally that was held on 
the hill on Tuesday, June 8, 1999, to raise publicly issues 
surrounding the other place and the modernizing of parliament. 
These members were involved in this rally and have been involved 
in other activities surrounding the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a serious matter when certain members are singled out for 
different treatment because of their activities or beliefs.  It 
is also extremely serious when the security force of the other 
place, indeed parliament's own security, suggests that certain 
members of the House should be treated differently for whatever 
reason. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I submit that the sending of this memo of photographs of certain 
members to the Senate security is wrong and puts into question 
the privileges of the members in the memo.  Furthermore, I submit 
that the singling out of these members because of their 
activities works to undermine the duty and privilege of all 
members to freely represent their constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If you find that I have a question of privilege, Mr. Speaker, I 
would be prepared to move the appropriate motion to refer this to 
the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs. 
<P><A NAME="LINK152"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I investigated this issue 
earlier this morning and received the following explanation for 
the action.  It is that the administration of the Senate wanted 
to be certain that all members in question would be treated with 
particular courtesy if they appeared in the precincts of the 
other place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is entirely logical and rational that they would do this 
since the last member of the House of Commons who regularly voted 
against the Senate estimates later experienced a remarkable 
conversion and was himself appointed to the Senate.  I am 
referring to Senator Eugene Whelan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take it then that Senate authorities wish to get off on the 
right foot with future prospective senators such as the member 
for Regina—Qu'Appelle.  I wish him good luck in his appointment 
to the Senate in the future. 
<P><A NAME="LINK153"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  We have an allegation and we have an 
apparent explanation for it.  This is not a debate.  This is a 
question of privilege that has been raised and I think both sides 
of it were presented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know who issued the particular memo. However, it is the 
end of the session and I will take it upon myself to look into 
the matter and, if it is necessary, I will get back to the House 
of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime we will revert to Routine Proceedings.

<A NAME="LINK171">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, political parties should in 
their advertising or promotion refrain from using the name or the 
likeness of any individual without having first obtained the 
written consent of that individual. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to be here in the 
last hour of the last day of what will certainly end the spring 
session.  Probably, as most people assume, there will be a 
prorogation and a new speech from the throne in the fall. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a certain closing of the circle on this motion.  I 
presented it for consideration on the first day I had the 
privilege of sitting here as a member which was September 23, 
1997.  I want to take the House through what the developments 
have been since then. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To get into what has transpired and what led to this motion, one 
has to go back to December 1998 when the Prime Minister of Canada 
participated in a town hall debate on CBC television.  People 
from various parts of the country were flown in to put questions 
to the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of those questioners turned out to be someone who is a 
resident of the city of Regina and the federal constituency of 
Palliser who asked a question on unemployment.  The answer from 
the Prime Minister triggered a lot of interest and controversy 
for several weeks.  As a result, a clip of that was seen on 
national and regional television. There were pictures in the 
paper and so on for several weeks thereafter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we move forward to the election campaign that was called on 
April 27, 1998.  About two-thirds of the way through that 
campaign, the individual was astonished to be told that her image 
and a voice-over of the question she had asked of the Prime 
Minister was being used in television ads by a particular 
political party.  She immediately went to the party and was told 
that the ad would be withdrawn in a couple of days.  She wanted 
to know how they had managed to run her likeness in their 
advertising without first obtaining any consent from the 
individual in question.  Her name is Lori Foster. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without putting too fine a point on it, it is fair to say she 
felt that she was given the runaround.  There were commitments 
made that the ad was going to be withdrawn in a couple of days, 
that it was only running in western Canada and some other places, 
all of which proved to be untrue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ad ran right up until the end of the campaign, the last day 
of advertising prior to the June 2 election.  It was certainly 
running nationwide because Ms. Foster was getting phone calls 
from her friends and acquaintances who live in Atlantic Canada. 
They said that they had seen her on television and had seen her 
picture in newspaper ads. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She had contacted the party in question.  It was the Reform 
Party that ran that ad.  She thought she had received assurances 
that the ad was going to be withdrawn immediately or very 
quickly. It was not true.

<A HREF="#LINKT19"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>After the election on June 2, Lori Foster was one of the first 
individuals to contact me in my new role as member of parliament 
for Palliser.  She said that she did not want what happened to 
her to happen to anyone else ever again.  She thought it was a 
terrible invasion of her privacy. She had not been consulted in 
advance by the party in question before her likeness and her 
words were used in a television ad.  She came to her new member 
of parliament and I took the matter to the House of Commons on 
September 23. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to quickly go over the technicalities.  It is true that 
Ms. Foster did not sign a release at the time of the news 
broadcast on CBC television. She was advised by the corporation 
that segments of the program might be rebroadcast for news 
purposes as they subsequently were. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In her letter to me following the June 2 election, she wrote 
“By using my likeness and identifying me by name and city, the 
implication was that I was a supporter of the Reform Party. I do 
not want what happened to me to happen to others”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree entirely with the sentiments expressed by Ms. Foster in 
her letter.   But I also want to say very clearly to the House 
that I do not want this to be interpreted as an embarrassment of 
one political party at the expense of all the others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my lifetime I have worked in the backrooms of my political 
party, the New Democratic Party.  I know that in the life of an 
election campaign things happen extremely quickly.  One party 
presents an attack ad.  The focus on the party that was attacked 
in that ad is to get out a counter message as quickly as 
possible.  Shortcuts are taken. I do not think we can take 
shortcuts when it comes to the privacy of ordinary Canadians. I 
would make a differentiation between what Ed Broadbent called 
ordinary Canadians and people who choose to run for elected 
office, once they have entered the theatre, have put on the 
greasepaint or whatever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion is not to suggest that if a political party wishes 
to run a picture of a rival and show him or her in a poor light 
that that is a judgment that should not be accorded to them. 
That is a right that they should have and this motion therefore 
should not apply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, if somebody wanted to run an attack ad against the 
Prime Minister, the Leader of the Official Opposition or the 
leader of our party, that comes with the territory.  It does not 
come with the territory to single out or give the impression that 
someone who is in a clip on a news broadcast is identified in an 
ad, in this case a female whose likeness was identified in an ad, 
and singled out for fame or infamy as the case may be, at least 
not without the consent of the individual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of my purposes in addition to bringing this to the attention 
of the House today is to appeal to all of us as practising 
politicians.  We have an obligation to work with our political 
parties and with the folks in our backrooms, all five parties in 
this instance, to ensure that certain rules and procedures are 
followed.  Lord knows that political parties and politicians are 
not exactly at the top of the social scale these days.  We need 
all the help we can get in terms of doing our job to the best of 
our ability without infringing on individual people's rights and 
privacy.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased that the chair responsible for House procedure is 
here and I believe will be participating in the debate. 
Following Ms. Foster's notice to me and advice on this matter, I 
did manage to have a hearing with that committee in January 1998. 
This is the committee that oversees Elections Canada and would 
be, I suppose, the committee that would be charged with making 
any changes to our electoral laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I stand to be corrected, but I do not believe that committee has 
reported on its deliberations since the 1997 election and in 
anticipation of the future general election.  I hope the debate 
today will focus attention on this particular issue.  If the 
committee has not seen fit in its draft report to do something, 
that it would take this under serious advice and bring it forward 
at the earliest opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as I am aware, this is the only time that this particular 
issue has been raised in this parliament.  It has certainly not 
been discussed in any way, shape or form here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have tried to explain, I believe the matter is of 
significant public interest because the privacy of all Canadian 
citizens could well be at risk during election campaigns if we do 
not do something about this and do it quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is certainly true that electronic media are becoming more and 
more prevalent, some would say invasive, in covering election 
campaigns.  The media, in the course of a day's work, approach 
thousands of ordinary citizens seeking opinions on electronic 
town hall meetings, news clips, streeters, full interviews and 
participation in documentaries.  For the most part, citizens 
agreed, as Ms. Foster did in this instance, to participate in 
news programming, but would be surprised, as deeply surprised as 
Ms. Foster was, to learn subsequently that their image and 
likeness appeared on an advertisement for partisan purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is involved is indeed the question of privacy of citizens, 
the faith in the impartiality of the media and trust in the 
political process itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue is of importance in Regina.  It received a lot of 
publicity just days before the June 2, 1997 election.  Obviously 
what happened in Palliser could happen anywhere in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was pleased that when I appeared before a committee that looks 
at motions and considers whether they are deemed to be votable or 
not, I did receive a good hearing.  I am very pleased that this 
motion has been deemed votable.  It is my understanding that 
since this is the last day of this session that we will be 
bringing the motion back in the fall and there will be other 
members of parliament who will participate in the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to report on what Canada's privacy commissioner had to 
say last year with regard to privacy matters.  He said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet we so take our privacy for granted in a democracy; it is so 
self-evident it has almost ceased to be evident.  Respecting one 
another's privacy is an integral ingredient in the glue of mutual 
respect which helps hold a free society together. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree entirely with the privacy commissioner's remarks in this 
instance.  I believe that we as politicians should apply his 
description and dicta to our own behaviour and that of our 
political parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am appealing to the House and to the sense of honour and fair 
play that exists among members, to send the signal that they 
believe the privacy of our fellow citizens is something worth 
protecting especially during election campaigns.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My intention, which is embedded in the motion, is to protect 
individual citizens, ordinary Canadians, against the invasion of 
their privacy, in particular during campaigns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am aware that no one or no political party is forced to act on 
a private member's motion, and of course we accept that reality. 
However, I would ask members from all sides of the House in all 
five parties to admit that surely a citizen's right to privacy 
should not be invaded in the way in which it occurred with Ms. 
Foster in the spring of 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have, to the best of my ability, deliberately refrained from 
attempting to turn the debate into a controversial and partisan 
political issue, aside from stating the obvious facts. I have had 
an e-mail or two from the party in question asking why I was 
picking on them.  That is not my intent. I think we do have to 
state the historical facts.  We cannot rewrite history.  That is 
what happened in May 1997 and that is what we are dealing with 
here today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In February, I appeared before the Standing Committee on 
Procedure and House Affairs, which was looking at whether to make 
this a votable item or not, and I did feel that I received a 
sympathetic hearing at that time.  I am anxiously waiting for the 
committee's report on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report from the Standing Committee on Procedure and House 
Affairs stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>While concerns were expressed by some members of the Committee 
about the enforceability and limits of such a provision, other 
members supported this proposal. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have accepted that trying to get changes to the act may be a 
rather long and perhaps futile process.  It is for that reason 
that, rather than attempting a legislative change, I have 
prepared the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Privacy to me is not political correctness.  It is not a flavour 
of the month.  It is a bedrock human value, which a former 
Canadian supreme court justice described as “at the heart of 
liberty in the modern state”. It is also not an individual right 
enjoyed at the expense of society as a whole.  “Respecting one 
another's privacy is an integral ingredient”, said Commissioner 
Phillips, “in the glue of mutual respect which helps hold a free 
society together”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether to reveal or conceal the details of our lives are 
decisions for us to make, not for others, and certainly not for 
the state, except in the most limited and exceptional 
circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Never has the matter of privacy been more vital to an 
individual's free existence, nor more threatened, than in the 
technologically advanced societies in which we live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Political parties can respond to attack ads in a matter of 
hours.  They often take shortcuts that do not include obtaining a 
waiver from the individual to use his or her photograph, likeness 
or voice in a particular ad.  People will say that there is 
nothing in the rules so it can be done and the devil take the 
hindmost.  I do not think that is good for political parties, 
politicians or for democracy in general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would appeal to the House to support this resolution which I 
firmly believe is as non-partisan as it can be. 
<P><A NAME="LINK172"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, yesterday 
when I rose in the House I hesitated to say that I was glad to 
speak because democracy was being trampled on in the House.  I 
was ashamed to stand in the House in those circumstances.  Today, 
however, I am indeed proud to stand on behalf of the people of my 
riding of Elk Island, the most wonderful riding in the whole 
country, notwithstanding your riding, Mr. Speaker. 
I represent my constituents and all Canadians in what I am going 
to say right now.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that in Private Members' Business we come closer to 
democracy here than in any other part of parliament.  The rest of 
it, unfortunately, is too often just a total sham. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to first congratulate the member from Saskatchewan, the 
province where I grew up and received my good start in life, for 
bringing the motion forward for debate. I am also very pleased 
that it is votable since I am one who believes that every time a 
private member brings a motion it is because he or she feels it 
is important to him or her and it should be voted on.  I am in 
favour of that. I am also anticipating that democracy will again 
work and the members here will soundly reject the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think this is a very well-founded motion at all, and I 
will give the House my reasons.  I want to first assure the 
member that I am not reacting in a partisan way, even though in 
the letter he sent to all members of parliament he used about 
two-thirds of the letter to describe the occurrence with Lori 
Foster and the Reform Party's use of her likeness in its 
advertising.  He then put a little disclaimer at the end and said 
that the example he used was not about the Reform Party, that it 
was just an example.  I will take his word that he just used that 
as an example, and in the good spirit of parliament's last day, I 
will show him that I am not going to respond in a partisan way 
either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I am going to speak against the principles of the bill 
because I think they are really not well-founded.  It is 
important for us to hear once again what the motion is.  To all 
of those Liberal members listening, to all of the other fellow 
members on the opposition side here and to those millions and 
millions of Canadians watching on CPAC, whose services we so 
appreciate, I want to again read the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, political parties should in 
their advertising or promotion refrain from using the name or the 
likeness of any individual without having first obtained the 
written consent of that individual. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the words that I have spoken show the basic flaw in the 
motion.  Without the exclusion of members of parliament and 
others who have deliberately chosen to be in the public domain, 
the words “using the name or the likeness of any individual”, 
unfortunately, if this were passed, would include them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first thing this motion would need is an amendment to say 
that any of us who dare to stand for public office, who dare to 
stick our faces in the cameras or our mouths into the 
microphones, are open game. I accept that.  Having run for public 
office, I know that my constituents are going to hold me 
accountable.  I know that I am going to be held accountable in 
this place.  I know from time to time I am going to be on 
television. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not on television very often because I have a problem with 
not saying enough controversial stuff.  Unfortunately, the media 
only likes to pick on controversy and seems to somehow avoid the 
hours and hours of debate that we in the House engage in, which 
is sound, solid and based on good reasoning and good analysis. 
Consequently, I personally am not on television very much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I certainly expect that, whether it is on television or 
radio, in our own ads promoting the Reform Party, that even some 
of my political opponents will want to say, “Guess what”, and 
then they will use my name.  My opponents will say, “Guess what 
the hon. member for Elk Island said” and they will then use my 
name and maybe my picture.  I think that is fair game. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would love the exposure that the Liberals and, if there are 
any left, the Conservatives and the NDP would give in my riding 
or elsewhere across the country by saying “This is what the hon. 
member said”, because if I said something, I hope I meant it.  I 
hope I do not say things I do not mean. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the opposition is going to give me additional exposure for 
having said something that I believe, I would want thank them for 
the free advertising.  The hon. member over here is objecting. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1245"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT23"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I repeat what I said.  If I have said something that I believe 
in, and hopefully I will not say things I do not believe in, then 
if somebody else quotes me and says this is what this member 
believes, and if that enters into political debate and helps 
Canadian voters make choices on whom to support, then let them 
use it.  Maybe that is why they never use my particular 
statements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need the amendment so that we do not say any individual. 
Unfortunately, those of us who are in public life should not be 
excluded.  It is part of fair debate.  He mentioned that, but his 
motion does not reflect what he said in his speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happens if we do make an amendment?  Who draws the line? 
What about one of my staffers?  What if he or she says something? 
I personally think that is okay because I hope my staffers also 
honestly reflect the things that are coming out of our office and 
our basic philosophical framework.  If there is an inconsistency, 
it deserves to be exposed.  I have no problem with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about my wife or my family?  I have a little more of a 
problem with that.  Yet sometimes people's families say things or 
become involved in certain functions or activities which are 
perhaps in the public interest if the other member of the family 
is running for public office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would speak against this motion because it is unworkable. 
First, it is too inclusive.  Second, it is unworkable.  Who is 
going to determine where the line should be drawn? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are engaging in an exercise to reduce debate, communication 
and dialogue, which is unfortunate.  I really think that as 
Canadians we are strengthened by dialogue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every year we have young people coming from other parts of the 
country on student exchange programs.  Quite often they come from 
Quebec, but they also come from eastern Canada.  One thing I have 
observed is that when these young people move across the country 
and dialogue is increased, we get a much better understanding of 
each other.  Any motion such as this, which would say that we 
cannot use a person's name or likeness in a debate or in fair 
comment, would reduce communication.  Therefore, I again urge 
members of the House to vote against the motion.  We have to have 
as much communication as possible to come to a fuller and better 
understanding of each other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last thing I want to say relates specifically to the case of 
Lori Foster.  I know she was upset because what she said she 
obviously believed in.  However, her statement was used in the 
promotion of a political party in which she did not believe.  I 
respect her for that.  I think I understand why she would be 
disheartened by this use of her likeness.  However, the fact of 
the matter is that I do not believe she was misquoted.  I do not 
believe she was in any way misrepresented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I really wish that we could get away from this prejudice, and I 
am not applying that statement to her.  I am speaking of us as 
individuals. We sometimes prejudge things, not by what is said, 
but rather by who says it.  That is judgmental and prejudicial. 
I wish we could move away from that.  I wish we could get down to 
debating ideas and avoid personal attacks.  I really wish the 
message that was given that day on the CBC program would have 
simply been used as factual information in the case of the 
debate.  Very frankly, I and my colleagues were among that group 
which wanted to address the questions that Lori Foster opened up 
on that particular occasion.  We did that in all sincerity and in 
all honesty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am looking forward to the day when unemployment in this 
country is reduced dramatically, because we have a government on 
the other side that does real things in this country to solve 
that problem. 
<P><A NAME="LINK173"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mauril Bélanger (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I had not planned 
initially to speak to this motion, but I have been asked to 
express my thoughts.  They are my thoughts and not the thoughts 
of anyone else. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1250"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the intention of the motion put forward by the member 
for Palliser is honourable.  I can relate to it personally.  In 
the 1997 general election I was at the receiving end of some 
unsavoury practices used by the NDP candidate in Ottawa—Vanier. 
I am not photogenic at the best of times.  I recognize that.  He 
used a less than flattering picture of me, as well as my name. 
As a matter of fact, in one of his brochures he used my name more 
often than his own.  That alone should give me reason to support 
this idea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can refer to the recent election in Ontario when the Tories 
used McGuinty's photo and name perhaps more often than they used 
Harris' name and photograph.  That too should give me reason to 
support this idea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can also refer to the famous TV ads that the Reform Party ran 
in the dying days of the last campaign with pictures of four 
Canadians whom they thought did not qualify to be prime minister 
because they came from a certain province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sense what the hon. member is trying to accomplish and I would 
be tempted to support it, but I will not, for three different 
reasons.  I think that even the member for Palliser might agree 
that what he is trying to do needs some work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first reason is that I think it is incomplete and somewhat 
superficial because he is dealing with the visual only, or the 
audio.  He does not also deal with incomplete quotes.  I had that 
done to me by the very same NDP candidate in the 1997 general 
election in Ottawa—Vanier.  Something which I had said was taken 
totally out of context and was incomplete to try to paint a 
picture that was not a reflection of what I had said.  It had 
been taken out of context.  Not only was it out of context, it 
was incomplete.  He took half a sentence.  That kind of thing 
would have to be dealt with in the member's motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second reason I will not support this motion is because of 
its angle of approach.  The second half of his motion reads: 
“refrain from using the name or the likeness of any individual 
without having first obtained the written consent of that 
individual”.  It is a restrictive and negative type of approach, 
as opposed to a positive one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member had said something like “for all political 
parties and their representatives, their candidates, the people 
who work for them as volunteers, or paid individuals, to 
encourage civility, fair play, decency and common sense”, and 
real common sense, not the kind we are exposed to sometimes, “to 
encourage honour”, to take a positive approach to what he is 
trying to get us to support, then I think he might have a bit 
more success in obtaining support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Too often we forget that these are very basic matters which are 
involved in all of our interpersonal relations and in society in 
general.  The values that we too often demean or forget, that are 
too often left aside by the sensationalism, or the crass, or the 
rhetoric and so forth, are the things we should perhaps be 
encouraging in the arena of public policy, in the arena of 
politics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of refraining from doing this and that, and obtaining, 
if the member had suggested that we encourage all political 
parties to tend toward decency, honesty, civility and fair play, 
he would have a much greater chance of getting my support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third reason I will not be supporting his motion in its 
current state is that when the crunch comes and we have some 
people who do things that they should not be doing, such as was 
done in the example he used—and I believe that he is 
right—there is a great levelling factor, the electorate. 
I have tremendous respect for the intelligence of the electorate. 
It will see through things like that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen time and again attack ads which have been so 
outlandish they have actually caused the people to turn against 
those who generated those ads or that literature or the 
preposterous documentation that might be prepared. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I go back to my example of the 1997 general election in 
Ottawa—Vanier.  I really believe that the poor showing of that 
NDP candidate was due in part to his kind of campaign.  The 
brochure he put out left a very bad taste in many people's 
mouths.  As representatives of the electorate, we have to rely on 
its intelligence to be able to see through some of the stuff 
which some people unfortunately put out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Elk Island has made an interesting point in that 
if a person is an incumbent, for instance, it will be rather 
difficult for the other candidates not to use that person's name 
and what he or she said.  It is a matter of understanding how the 
system works.  Yes, I would expect that at some point in 
campaigns the other parties might want to refer to something I 
said.  If it is on the record of the House of Commons, 
<I>Hansard</I>, I cannot see why they should not be able to do 
that, and even use it in their literature or propaganda.  The 
member for Elk Island made an interesting point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, the bottom line is the electorate, the people 
who cast their vote, who have taken some time to look at what has 
been put out by some people, either on radio, on television or at 
the door, through the mail system or delivered by volunteers. 
Those people who have looked at it tend to be very sophisticated, 
much more so than we sometimes think they are, and they make 
decisions based on the tone of what has been put out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To summarize, I believe that the intentions of the member for 
Palliser in putting forward Motion No. 97 are very valuable and 
very supportable, except that it is not complete in that he only 
covers visuals.  He does not cover a distortion of someone's 
statement to an end that is obviously not fair to the person 
whose statement is being distorted.  He fails to cover that.  He 
fails to cover other things which I am sure other colleagues will 
mention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member's attempt to correct a wrong is too far-reaching 
in the sense that he is covering things which others will bring 
up, and he is also failing to include certain things that should 
be included, such as the use of words; the content which is 
twisted to satisfy the ends. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, it is what I categorize as a negative as opposed to a 
positive approach.  He should be appealing, in my sense, to fair 
play, to decency and to honour.  To be able to represent people 
in this House is an honour.  Politics is an honourable 
profession.  We forget that at times and we let too many people 
slander this profession without fighting back.  I think we should 
be fighting back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge the hon. member to use a very positive approach.  Let us 
call on the good and the decent among us, as opposed to 
restricting this and this because of this and that.  Then I think 
he would have much more success in getting our support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I think that when the crunch comes, we all should be 
very respectful of the intelligence of the electorate in 
determining what is true and what is twisted and what has been 
shamelessly used to reach one's end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that members of this House all have sufficient 
experience in their own ridings to know that people in the end 
understand really what is going on and that they can tell the 
difference and do not have to be instructed otherwise.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to speak to Motion No. M-97.  The intent of this motion 
is to encourage political parties to refrain from using the 
likeness or name of an individual in advertising without first 
obtaining the written consent of the individual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While this motion is fraught with some flaws in terms of 
implementation and enforceability, the wording of the motion is 
nebulous enough that it can serve as a means to encourage parties 
to refrain from that type of negative action. It would not 
constrain unnecessarily or create some sort of regulatory burden 
that would be excessive, oppressive and unenforceable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The use of someone's likeness in an advertisement is an issue 
far larger than political parties and should be addressed with 
some study relative to advertising regulations and marketing in 
general.  It raises some ethics questions.  Someone's name or 
likeness should not be used in an advertisement not just for a 
political party but for virtually anything without their written 
consent. This is something the House should consider. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion focuses solely on political parties and on political 
advertisements but I think there are wider and broader issues 
involved.  Companies that manufacture any product should not use 
somebody's name, image or likeness without some type of written 
approval first. The reference to a person's likeness is vague in 
the motion and I have some concerns about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion the motion is vague. It basically urges parties in 
this House to refrain from this type of advertising.  We would do 
well to support the motion because it sends out a message. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a more fundamental issue relative to political 
advertising as it has evolved, particularly over the last 10 
years. There is an ever increasing level of nastiness and 
negativity in political advertising.  Much of it emanated from 
political campaigns in the U.S. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first example was when George Bush beat Mike Dukakis for the 
U.S. presidency. At that time Willie Horton ads were used. 
Willie Horton was released from the Massachusetts penitentiary 
system. He committed murder, rape or some other heinous crime. 
The ad was used against Mike Dukakis and had a significant 
impact. This was the first use of such overtly negative 
advertising. Since then there has been an ever increasing level 
of negative ads. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last federal election many Canadians were appalled, 
shocked and disappointed with the ads that one party ran.  The 
ads showed the faces of Quebec political leaders with crosses 
marked over them. This implied that in some way one's origin in 
this great country should have an impact as to whether or not 
others should vote for that individual.  These were very negative 
ads, particularly in the national unity context which is so 
precarious. 
In the national unity context, for a party to run those types of 
negative and incendiary ads that were aimed purely at political 
leaders from Quebec I thought was very inappropriate, 
irresponsible and unfair.

</I></B></P><P align=left>A broader issue that is not addressed in this motion but perhaps 
should be in the future would be the negativity of political 
advertising.  The motion could be broadened to look at other 
products as well. I do not want to make political parties 
commodities any more than I fear they already have become, but we 
should be looking at something to that effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should also be cognizant of the trends that are occurring in 
political advertising and organizing. Increasingly political 
consultants and organizers are becoming almost corporatized. 
There has been a growth in the political organization industry. 
Ultimately that will come at a cost. The cost will be the level 
of authority and power that traditional grassroots organizations 
have.  In the future it is going to be more and more difficult 
for political parties and individual constituency associations to 
run the campaigns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the whole electoral process it seems that increasingly 
elections are being fought more by consultants, spin doctors, 
pollsters, media advisers and less by constituency organizations, 
poll captains and the like as was traditionally done in the past. 
That is not without its risks in terms of the strength of the 
grassroots democracy we all value. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend the hon. member for having brought forward this 
motion.  I do not see a downside to supporting the motion.  It 
sends out a sound message to political parties.  It does not 
unnecessarily constrain political parties with any sort of 
oppressive regulatory burden or sanctions. It sends out a worthy 
message.  I believe the motion should be supported. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish all members of the House a very enjoyable, safe and 
restful summer.  I look forward to seeing them in the fall as we 
continue the important deliberations of building a Canada that 
will be prosperous and fair for all Canadians into the 21st 
century.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères—Les-Patriotes, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I do not want to cast a shadow on the enthusiasm of our 
colleague from Palliser, who was saying he was honoured to be 
among the last speakers in this final hour of this last day of 
this session, which, it seems, will end today and, in all 
probability, will be prorogued. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right off, since he will not unfortunately be the last speaker 
in this last hour of this final day since fate decrees that I 
will probably be the last speaker, I must unfortunately tell him 
that the Bloc Quebecois will not support his motion, not because 
it is not a good one, not because the reasons for it are not 
praiseworthy or reasonable, since they are. The reasons 
underlying this motion are totally credible, reasonable and 
honorable under the circumstances.

<A HREF="#LINKT28"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I think it is appropriate to clarify things to some 
extent and to explain why the Bloc will unfortunately not 
support the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of provisions, there seems to be a problem in 
the text of the motion itself which provides “Political parties 
should refrain”. First, they use the conditional, which means 
that the motion as such will not truly be binding. Second, there 
is the choice of the verb “refrain”.  This is not a very strong 
verb and does not say that we must not do so but rather that 
we must avoid doing so. In my opinion, this motion is not as 
rigid and restrictive as it ought to be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, I can well understand that the hon. member drafted 
this motion in response to a problem that arose in the last 
election campaign.  A lady was greatly surprised to find not 
only her image but her words as well being used without her 
authorization in an advertisement.  The political advertisement 
was for the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After this rather particular case, we came to realize that, for 
our fellow citizens, being used in a campaign can indeed cause a 
problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should state right off that there is a distinction between 
ordinary citizens and public figures. 
When men and women decide to get involved in public life, they 
are agreeing to the widespread use of their picture, their name 
and their words, and to some extent this cannot be controlled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must be acknowledged that during an election campaign it goes 
without saying that we can use the image and words of public 
figures.  This motion does not take that into account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nor does it take into account the fact that in an election 
campaign there are frequently photographs or videos with a scan 
over a crowd or of us standing in front of large numbers of 
people behind us.  It is virtually objectively and logistically 
impossible to ask each and every one of those persons to 
authorize their inclusion in a promotional photo or video for 
the party in question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that where we see eye to eye with the member for 
Palliser is when he tries to ensure that we cannot use the image 
or the words of individuals as promotional tools, such as making 
them appear to say things they did not actually say or take a 
stand they did not necessarily take.  We could agree with him on 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, as it now stands, the motion before us does not 
allow this sort of distinction.  It is too general.  It is not 
sufficiently enforceable.  For all these reasons, therefore, as 
I pointed out earlier, we will be voting against the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to point out that the Bloc 
Quebecois is opposed to this motion not because we feel that it 
is legitimate to take the images or words of our fellow citizens 
and, as I mentioned earlier, have them appear to be saying 
things they did not necessarily say, or take stands they did not 
necessarily take.

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not the case. During the last election campaign, 
the Bloc Quebecois obtained written authorization from everyone 
who appeared in any of its campaign advertising.  So it is not 
because we oppose the actual principles underlying this motion. 
As I said earlier, those principles are entirely laudable and 
legitimate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is that the wording of the motion does not remove 
this obligation in the case of public personalities who have 
allowed their image and words to be broadly disseminated without 
requiring authorization, nor does it remove it in the case of 
people who might be included in a crowd scene, and it is 
virtually unfeasible to seek the authorization of each and every 
member of a crowd. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all these reasons, and with a certain twinge of regret, I 
must tell the member for Palliser that we are unable to support 
his motion but that we find the underlying principles entirely 
laudable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like other members, I would not want to fail to wish 
all of my colleagues a fine summer. Contrary to what our fellow 
Canadians may think at times, when we say that the work of the 
House adjourns in mid June or at the end of June when they think 
“You are on holiday”, we know full well that we have a lot of 
work ahead of us in our individual ridings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will be spending an enormous amount of time with our 
constituents, which unfortunately we do not have the time to 
do between September and June. Over the summer, we will have an 
opportunity to meet them, to travel around our ridings, to take 
part in events there and to be with these people who have put 
their trust in us and deserve an opportunity to discuss a whole 
series of current event issues with their representatives in 
this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish a fine summer to each of you. Perhaps during this 
period, we will each find a few days to spend with our near and 
dear ones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish you all a good vacation and especially, a fine summer in 
your ridings.

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, pursuant to Standing Order 108(4)(b), and specifically, to 
the study of Part VII of the Official Languages Act, the Standing 
Joint Committee on Official Languages, six (6) members of the 
committee and the necessary staff travel to Moncton, New 
Brunswick; Summerside, P.E.I.; St. John's, Newfoundland; Halifax, 
Nova Scotia; Gaspé, Quebec; Sudbury and Toronto, Ontario; 
Sherbrooke and Montreal, Quebec; Vancouver, B.C.; Edmonton, 
Alberta; Regina, Saskatchewan; and Winnipeg, Manitoba in the fall

Committee.

If the motion were to include a statement that we are approving a 
sum not to exceed $117,700 that would be agreeable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I notice that the figure in 
the documents is $116,466 and that the hon. member has rounded it 
off, but I certainly would accept that point.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  To be clear, I gather that the motion 
is being amended to provide that some words such as “provided 
that the sum to be expended for travel shall not exceed 
$117,700”.
