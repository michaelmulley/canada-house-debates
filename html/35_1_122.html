C-239, an act respecting the decade of the brain, be read the 
second time and referred to committee.
<P>
	She said: Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time today.
<P>
	I am pleased to introduce debate on Bill C-239, a bill that 
would declare the 1990s the decade of the brain. First, I would 
like to recognize and thank all the individuals and organizations 
that have since early in the decade assisted in this legislative 
endeavour.
<P>
	The legislation I am speaking on today is the duplicate of a 
private member's bill introduced in 1992 by the previous 
member of Parliament for Niagara Falls. Private members' bills 
can take a number of years before they are debated in the House.
<P>
	Given that we are already in 1994, members may ask what the 
purpose of the bill is and what will be accomplished by declaring 
the 1990s the decade of the brain.
<P>
<B>(1105 ) </B>
<P>
	My response is that the legislation will help to raise the 
awareness of Canadians and will help to focus attention on the 
prevention, research, treatment and rehabilitation of brain 
related diseases and disorders. I believe this to be a worthwhile, 
rewarding goal, as do many of my hon. colleagues.
<P>
	We only have to look at numerous examples in the world 
community to see this is an important issue worthy of our 
attention as legislators. In 1986 at the 39th world health 
assembly, the World Health Organization called on member 
states to apply preventive measures with regard to mental, 
neurological and psychological disorders and to include these 
activities in their long term health strategies.
<P>
	In 1991 Dr. Nakajima, director general of the World Health 
Organization, urged all governments to designate the 1990s as 
the decade of the brain. Our neighbours to the south did this in 
1990. In 1992 the member states of the European community 
followed suit, forming an ad hoc task force.
<P>
	The World Federation of Neurology proclaimed the 1990s to 
be the decade of the brain in 1992. As we speak, researchers 
from my riding are gathering with over 12,000 other 
professionals in Miami to discuss among other subjects 
advances made in the decade of the brain.
<P>
	They have expressed to me their support of the bill before the 
House. Treatments that would have seemed miraculous 10 years 
ago are now reality and are being applied successfully. We can 
now look to a day when new drugs may free patients from their 
struggle with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's.
<P>
	Regeneration research is providing new expectations, new 
hopes for patients with spinal cord and various other brain 
injuries. In every riding in Canada research efforts and 
treatments continue, utilizing more and more advanced and 
ground breaking technology. In my own riding of London West a 
young scientist has recently commenced a new research project 
focusing on brain functioning. Currently magnetic resonance 
imaging shows brain anatomy clearly. Functional magnetic 
resonance imaging will allow us to view the working brain and 
will help map out the centres concerned with such aspects as 
speech and motor activity.
<P>
	There is no doubt the human brain is a remarkable feature that 
distinguishes us from other living creatures. A mere 3-pound 
mass of interwoven neurons controls all our activities. The brain 
is the most complex and mysterious wonder of creation. It has 
been called the seat of human intelligence, the interpreter of 
senses, the keeper of memory, in essence the sanctum of the 
soul.
<P>
	Ailments of the brain carry with them heart rending 
disabilities that can rob us of the very essence of personhood. A 
healthy mind is essential for living a full life with total liberty 
and independence. A great threat to the independence of the 
elderly are diseases of the brain. Cognitive mental stability 
enhances the ability to heal and recuperate, to cope and to 
overcome physical ailments.
<P>
	Unfortunately like all things human the brain is not perfect, 
being subject to injury and disease, including the time of 
development in the youngest members of society. Diseases are 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7700"> 7700 </A></B>
<P>
not limited by geographical borders. Nor do  they recognize any 
difference in language, gender, race or economic status. Any 
human being in the world community is a potential victim of a 
brain related illness.
<P>
	I would be very surprised if any member of the House had not 
been personally affected by such diseases and disorders. All of 
us have had a friend, relative or family member who has suffered 
the tragedy of brain related illness. At the beginning of the 
decade it was estimated that five million Canadians were 
affected by disorders of the brain ranging from congenital 
malformations, degenerative disorders, neurogenetic disorders, 
epilepsy, multiple sclerosis and stroke, to problems with 
learning, hearing, language and speech.
<P>
	I have been encouraged by the numerous physicians, 
individuals and associations that have given me support to work 
for the recognition of the decade of the brain. I am aware of 
many who fought for this long before I was involved. Many of 
these people devoted their careers to the treatment and 
elimination of brain related illnesses. Designating the 1990s as 
the decade of the brain would be an acknowledgement of their 
contributions and an encouragement for them to continue with 
their noble crusade.
<P>
	Studying the brain has enormous potential for the health of 
Canadians, while decreasing the severe economic and emotional 
burdens placed on our society by brain disease and disorder. In 
efforts to see the legislation proclaimed, I have also been 
contacted by people who are right now directly affected, 
sometimes tragically. I have received scores of letters from 
parents whose children have died or are dying of brain tumours.
<P>
<B>(1110 ) </B>
<P>
	I have listened to people faced with the difficult task of caring 
for loved ones who suffer from brain disorders. There is more 
eloquence in their private struggles with adversity, more 
eloquence in their challenges and their grief than I could ever 
hope to bring to the Chamber today. It is because of these people 
that I encourage members to lend their support to the bill.
<P>
	In 10 minutes it is impossible to speak on the full scope of the 
problems in research. I would like to highlight two forms of 
brain related illnesses as well as their effects.
<P>
	Today over one-quarter of a million Canadians suffer from 
Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. By the year 2030 it 
is estimated that this figure will have increased to over 
three-quarters of a million. The social and human costs of 
Alzheimer's disease are devastating. A person's ability to 
understand, think, remember and communicate is affected. The 
process is always a progressive degenerative one that means the 
formerly self-reliant men and women slowly become dependent 
upon others.
<P>
	The disease has a similarly devastating impact on the 
caregivers who are often family members. Family members 
must cope with long periods of emotional, financial and 
physical stress. Hence we see that the health  and well-being of 
the family members become just as important a concern as that 
of the person with the disease.
<P>
	Each year thousands of Canadians are diagnosed with a 
primary or secondary brain tumour. Since brain tumours are 
located at the various control centres of thought, emotion and 
physical function, they can cause serious impairment in motor 
functions, vision and language abilities and make treatment 
very difficult.
<P>
	In 1982 in my home of London, the Brain Research 
Laboratory was established with both experimental and clinical 
research units. The Brain Tumour Foundation of Canada was 
also a founding member of the North American Brain Tumour 
Coalition, a network of brain tumour organizations dedicated to 
increasing public awareness of the nature of the brain tumour 
and of the availability of treatment options.
<P>
	London has also seen the establishment in 1991 of the brain 
tumour tissue bank which acts as an international resource from 
which researchers from Canada, the United States and other 
nations are able to obtain tissue samples to carry out 
experiments.
<P>
	Brain tumours were highlighted in the bill not because they 
are any more or less important than any other disorder or 
disability, but rather it was an association that I was involved 
with at the time when work began on the bill. I have also had 
some insight through other areas of my previous work into the 
devastation that mental illness can play in antisocial, violent 
acts. I can think of no other aspect of our criminal justice and 
health systems where everyone involved is a victim.
<P>
	Measures can be taken to facilitate even more effective 
sharing of knowledge, information and resources to accelerate 
the research for effective prevention and treatment of brain 
related illnesses. Canadians must recognize the relationship 
between the health of the brain and the well-being and quality of 
life of individuals. Brain related illnesses exact a tremendous 
toll in human suffering, often during the most productive years 
in a person's life.
<P>
	I have mentioned previously the effects that this can have on 
the individual and his or her immediate circle of family and 
friends. However we must acknowledge the tremendous 
financial cost of such illnesses.
<P>
	Dr. John Evans in the November 1994 Flavelle lecture at the 
University of Western Ontario stated that neurological diseases 
require more people to be hospitalized than any other disease 
group and therefore consume a disproportionate share of scarce 
health resources. He stated that the staggering burden of the cost 
of treatment and rehabilitation is estimated to be approximately 
$300 billion annually for the United States and Canada. In the 
area of Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia alone Cana-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7701"> 7701 </A></B>
<P>
dians spend approximately $3.3 billion a year providing care for 
afflicted individuals.
<P>
	This debate should not be reduced to dollars and cents. To do 
so is to cheapen the humanity of all involved in the issue. We are 
talking about the health and happiness of our children, our 
parents, our friends, our partners and ourselves. No one can go 
through their lives untouched by brain related illnesses. We all 
age eventually and our independence will be linked to our 
physical and mental health.
<P>
	I stated at the beginning of the speech that the legislation 
would help to raise the awareness of Canadians and would help 
focus attention on the importance of the research in this critical 
medical field. I am seeking approval today of an 
acknowledgement of that fact and action that will benefit 
Canadians today and into the future.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Roger Simmons (Burin-St. George's, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am delighted to second and give my support to Bill 
C-239. Let me, at the outset, congratulate my good friend and 
colleague from London West for taking this significant and 
important initiative. It is not a new initiative. Others have put it 
to the House before, including the former member for Niagara 
Falls. Several efforts have been made to have the House do what 
other legislatures and other jurisdictions have already done. As 
my friend noted in the debate, this includes the United States 
which as a result of a proclamation by former President Bush is 
now observing the decade of the brain with considerable results. 
However I will come back to that.
<P>
<B>(1115) </B>
<P>
	First, let me read for the information of the House some 
portions of a handwritten letter that came to a member of 
Parliament from northern Ontario. In part it reads as follows:
<P>
	``On May 21, 1992, our 20-year old daughter died from a 
malignant brain tumour. Our lives and the life of her only sister 
will never be the same''. Later the parents who wrote this letter 
said: ``Most people can only imagine the pain of standing at your 
child's side, helplessly watching her die. We believe that, had 
we known more about the symptoms of brain tumours, our 
daughter would have had medical attention sooner, would have 
lived longer and might even be writing this letter herself''.
<P>
	In the most graphic and eloquent terms, more so than I could 
express, this letter states very clearly why we need to have 
greater awareness, greater public profile for the brain and brain 
related diseases.
<P>
	The parents wrote: ``We believe, had we known more about 
the symptoms of brain tumours, our daughter would have had 
medical attention sooner, would have lived longer and might 
even be writing this letter herself''.
<P>
	The impressive aspect of this initiative by my friend from 
London West is that it has garnered so much support from the 
scientific community. The letters that have come to me and to 
other members of Parliament, but particularly to the member for 
London West, are very gratifying. People who know this issue 
inside out are saying in the most urgent terms: ``Let us do it. Let 
us declare this the decade of the brain because it will have the 
effect of focusing awareness on an important issue: issues 
related to prevention, research, treatment and rehabilitation in 
this vital area''. That is why literally every organization that one 
could mention is on side.
<P>
	We wonder at the list, such organizations as the Alzheimer 
Society of Canada, the Canadian Mental Health Association, the 
Canadian Brain Tissue Bank, the Canadian Paraplegic 
Association, Epilepsy Association of Metropolitan Toronto, 
Epilepsy Canada and Huntington Society of Canada. The list 
goes on.
<P>
	Let me read excerpts from another letter from the dean of 
medicine at the University of Western Ontario. He says in part: 
``Allow me to speak in favour of the concept of the decade of the 
brain. It is truly an essential initiative from a number of 
perspectives in light of the discussions that are currently 
nationally relative to both research and the health care system''. 
He makes two or three specific points. First, the dean of 
medicine of the University of Western Ontario talks about the 
aging population: ``Increasingly we need to seek alternatives to 
institutionalizing older Canadians. With the passage of time 
AIDS tends to be associated with problems afflicting bone, 
bladder and the brain. In other words there is an increasing 
disease burden relating to fractures, incontinence and dementia 
that will affect our senior citizens and which results in the need 
for admission to hospital''.
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
	Then he talks about the impact it would have on 
disadvantaged children. In short he makes the case that what is 
needed is more focus on this important issue.
<P>
	If I sound as though I am repeating myself on the issue of 
awareness, it is because the bill is such simple legislation. We 
are not asking for the expenditure of great gobs of public money. 
We are simply asking to enact a bill that will focus on this 
important issue. The effect will be felt in many areas.
<P>
	Let me again demonstrate my point by reading from another 
letter, also from the dean of medicine at Western.
<P>
	``As former vice-president of the North American Brain 
Tumour Coalition, I can relate to you that the declaration of the 
decade of the brain legislation in the United States has resulted 
in increased awareness of brain related disorders. This has 
occurred at local, state and national levels. The support for 
charitable organizations and for patients with tumour related 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7702"> 7702 </A></B>
<P>
disorders has changed because of this legislation. Many 
pharmaceutical companies that I deal with use the decade of the 
brain  logo on their letterhead and are fairly supportive. The 
decade of the brain legislation in the United States has resulted 
in a number of new initiatives which I have been involved with. 
As a member of the board of directors of the Brain Tumour 
Foundation of Canada, I have interacted with several U.S. 
organizations. I can relay to you that there is a commonality of 
purpose in goals among our organizations. We are working 
together to help both Canadian and U.S. patients''.
<P>
	The point of the letter from the dean of medicine is the point 
of my speech, the point of the intervention made by my 
colleague from London West in introducing the legislation. The 
legislation, as simple as it is in its wording, will effectively 
focus attention on this very important issue. And so we should.
<P>
	An estimated five million Canadians are affected by disorders 
of the brain ranging from stroke, degenerative disorders, 
problems with speech, language and hearing. Today these 
patients are justifiably hopeful as a new era is unfolding in brain 
research. We can help smooth that along a bit by giving our 
support to this very significant piece of legislation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
with great pleasure that I rise in the House today to support Bill 
C-239, the Decade of the Brain Act, introduced by the hon. 
member for London West.
<P>
	The human brain, a mass weighing more than one kilogram 
and essentially consisting of nerve cells that control our 
emotions, reactions and activities, is one of the most impressive 
and mysterious wonders of creation. This seat of human 
intelligence, which enables us to control our movements, 
interpret our senses and interact with our environment, 
continues to intrigue researchers and scientists throughout the 
world.
<P>
	In recent years, science has made it possible to clarify certain 
aspects of the human brain, but too many questions still remain. 
How does the brain function? By what is it affected? How can we 
prevent its degeneration? The rise in diseases related to 
disorders of the brain means that increasing our knowledge in 
this field is no longer an option but a necessity and also one of 
the greatest scientific challenges of our time.
<P>
	Japan was the first country to launch a scientific program in 
1987 to maximize the effectiveness of neurological research. 
Three years later, the Americans proclaimed the nineties as the 
decade of the brain and decided to set up a wide-ranging 
research program. The Europeans followed suit in 1992.
<P>
<B>(1125) </B>
<P>
	The purpose of Bill C-239 is therefore to ask Parliament to 
follow the example of other western countries and to declare this 
decade the decade of the brain and, at the same time, support and 
recognize the importance of research in this field.
<P>
	The brain is the seat of many neurodegenerative disorders and 
diseases like Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's, of mental 
health problems like schizophrenia, emotional disorders, drug 
addiction and neurological disorders such as learning 
disabilities.
<P>
	Canadians suffer from a wide range of neurological diseases. 
In 1989, the Canadian Neurological Coalition sponsored a 
ten-year retrospective survey of the frequency of neurological 
diseases in Canada. The results of this survey are disturbing: it 
was found that more than one Canadian out of six is affected by 
some mental disorder.
<P>
	Our mental health is a very fragile thing and over a lifetime, a 
number of emotional problems may affect its delicate balance. 
We may experience a divorce, the loss of a loved one, the loss of 
a job, poverty, drug addiction, alcoholism or stress, and one 
morning we get up and we are in poor mental health. The balance 
is upset. The very strong are able to overcome such problems but 
others are not.
<P>
	More than 50,000 Canadians today are also suffering from 
multiple sclerosis, the neurological disease most frequently 
found among young adults in Canada. Researchers have yet to 
find a way to treat this disease, and there is no explanation for 
the fact that Canada is one of the countries where the probability 
of getting this disease is particularly high.
<P>
	There is also the problem of brain tumours. According to the 
Brain Tumour Foundation of Canada, brain tumours rank second 
as the cause of death in children under 14 and third as the cause 
of death in men between the ages of 15 and 34. The number of 
deaths caused by brain tumours increased 100 per cent between 
1968 and 1987.
<P>
	And what about Altzheimer's, a neurodegenerative disease 
that causes the irreversible destruction of brain cells and is one 
of the main causes of death among the elderly, although we now 
know it can strike at any age. Today, more than 250,000 
Canadians are affected by Altzheimer's and related dementias, 
and it is estimated that 30 years from now, their number will 
reach 750,000 30 years from now.
<P>
	In addition to the social impact, neurodegenerative diseases 
also have economic repercussions that cannot be ignored. We 
already invest substantial amounts of money in patient 
treatment and accommodation. As the number of individuals 
affected by this disease increases, long-term treatment will put 
an additional burden on health costs.
<P>
	According to a study on health and aging in Canada, 
Canadians spend approximately $3.3 billion annually for the 
treatment of at least 150,000 people with Alzheimer disease in 
long-term health care facilities. This figure does not include the 
costs to families caring for afflicted relatives at home.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7703"> 7703 </A></B>
<P>
	It is clear that diseases of the brain, including mental illness, 
degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and stroke are very 
costly. By making the public aware of disorders and disabilities 
of the brain, we will be encouraging increased support for 
research in this field, and thus stretching our health care dollars.
<P>
	The decade of the brain has already begun. As I have already 
mentioned, Europe and the United States have proclaimed the 
1990s the decade of the brain, and a number of research centres 
in Quebec and in Canada are already on board.
<P>
	The Montreal Neurological Institute will be playing a major 
role in the upsurge in research resulting from the proclamation 
of the decade of the brain in the United States, decreed by 
President Bush in 1990. The Neurological Institute, an affiliate 
of McGill University, with about sixty professors, neurologists, 
computer scientists, students and other researchers, is 
participating in one of the most ambitious projects to come out 
of the decade of the brain: the creation of a computerized atlas of 
the most complex organ in the human body, the brain.
<P>
<B>(1130) </B>
<P>
	This project to map the brain is part of an extensive program 
being carried out by a large consortium of research centres, 
co-ordinated by the National Institute of Mental Health in the 
United States and funded by eleven American agencies. The 
Montreal Neurological Institute, which is a member of this 
consortium, is the only non-American institution to take part in 
this important project, an indication of its reputation.
<P>
	The Montreal Neurological Institute and its McConnell 
Centre have become leaders, possibly world leaders, in the field 
of brain mapping. Although we must recognize their excellent 
research and their contribution to medical research in Quebec 
and Canada, we must regret that this work is largely supervised 
and financed by foreign interests.
<P>
	In medical and pharmaceutical research, Quebec and Canada 
have the ability to excel and be leaders and, for that, we must 
continue to promote research and development. Proclaiming the 
1990s the Decade of the Brain would be major support, since it 
would make Canadians and governments aware of investment in 
prevention, research, treatment and rehabilitation for those who 
suffer from various diseases of the brain.
<P>
	Today, millions of Quebecers and Canadians and their 
families have the right to hope that science will elucidate the 
mysteries of the human brain. Following recent discoveries in 
genetics, with research and exhaustive studies compiled over 
many decades and extremely sophisticated medical equipment, 
scientists are about to penetrate one of the most closely guarded 
secrets of our civilization.
<P>
	The impact of such a discovery is incalculable. Not only 
would it help to finally find a cure for the terrible mental 
illnesses that ravage our society but it would also make it 
possible to take a new approach and even cure certain disorders, 
like phobias, addiction and even violent behaviour.
<P>
	While we support research and wait for further discoveries, 
we must propose effective prevention programs. We must 
always keep in mind that as our health care system and its 
funding are restructured, we must adopt an approach based more 
on prevention and education.
<P>
	As health critic of the Official Opposition and as a member of 
the Bloc Quebecois, I am pleased to support Bill C-239 and to 
ask this Parliament to proclaim the 1990s the Decade of the 
Brain.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very 
honoured to enter into today's debate on Bill C-239. I will begin 
by acknowledging the good work of the hon. member for 
London West in bringing the matter forward for our interest and 
debate.
<P>
	I would also like to go on record as applauding all those many 
researchers in the private enterprise companies and certain 
government funded organizations that do research. I would also 
like to give my accolades to those who work in medicine, 
particularly in the area of neurological and brain disorders.
<P>
	I think the bill is somewhat misunderstood because of its 
name. Not long ago a columnist in one of the Toronto papers 
indicated total ignorance of the subject. The same thing 
happened this week in my constituency when I indicated to 
someone that I would be giving a speech on the decade of the 
brain today. She laughed and said: ``Don't you people have 
anything worth while to do there? Everybody has a brain''. She 
had totally misunderstood. When I explained to her that we 
wanted to increase awareness about brain disorders and increase 
awareness and understanding for people with these various 
illnesses and diseases, her attitude changed abruptly. She 
immediately became very supportive.
<P>
<B>(1135 ) </B>
<P>
	I could probably use my time best today by bringing some 
personal experiences into this debate. I have been challenged 
and privileged to be near some people who have suffered from 
brain disorder. I would like to say first that it is right in my own 
family.
<P>
	In February 1945 my mother was taken to the hospital because 
though we did not know it then, it was time for our little sister to 
be born. To everyone's regret there was what was called an 
accident. Actually it was very clearly an error on the part of the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7704"> 7704 </A></B>
<P>
medical people present. It was ignorance. My sister suffered 
brain damage at birth because of oxygen deprivation.
<P>
	My sister is going to be 50 in just a few months now. All her 
life she has suffered from a disorder called cerebral palsy. She is 
a bright young woman and understands everything but she is 
unable to speak. How do we know she is bright? It is because she 
has developed her own language that my mother mostly 
understands and the rest of the family understands to some 
reasonable degree. However she does not speak so that anyone 
else can understand. She is totally dependent.
<P>
	How I wish there had been enough information so that 
hospital workers would know that one does not prevent a baby 
from being born because the timing is inconvenient, thereby 
causing this very severe trauma for our family over the years. I 
will say just as a parenthetical phrase here that I take great 
umbrage at the suggestion from some that perhaps my sister 
should be put away because she is not useful to society. She is 
part of our family and we love her dearly.
<P>
	I would also like to share another experience of a young lady 
who used to come to our home when she was in nurse's training. 
She got married and had a family. One day she and her husband 
and young family were in a car accident that was not of their 
cause. Unfortunately their oldest son, at that time a very bright 
precocious 10-year-old, suffered brain damage. He has become 
totally dependent. His life was never allowed to be fulfilled as it 
would have been had that not occurred. Despite the best medical 
efforts, it seems there was nothing that could be done for him.
<P>
	The next experience is probably the one closest to our family. 
My wife and I know a couple who have been our closest friends 
for years. About 10 years ago my friend who is indeed even 
younger than I-I guess just about everyone is younger than 
I-showed the first symptoms of what was diagnosed as 
premature Parkinson's disease. I do not know how I can express 
and communicate the impact that has had on his wife, his family, 
his own life and those of us who know him and who care for him.
<P>
	My friend went through some research studies. He was 
involved in some of the experimental work. A number of years 
ago he underwent a new and very intriguing surgery. They 
actually took off the cap of his skull. A cavity was made between 
the two hemispheres of the brain in the part that is called the 
caudate nucleus which generates the chemical dopamine which 
is necessary for muscular movement. After a short time they 
operated on him again and removed part of his adrenal gland. 
That was put into the cavity in the brain. They thought that 
perhaps it would stimulate the caudate nucleus again to do its 
work.
<P>
<B>(1140 ) </B>
<P>
	Unfortunately this attempt was not successful and 10 years 
later now my friend continues in total dependency. I am sure 
members can hardly understand the impact that has had on us.
<P>
We try to see him every week, although with this new job I have 
it is more difficult. He cannot speak most of the time. He 
communicates very  poorly and it is a very severe intrusion into 
our relationship because we cannot communicate well.
<P>
	Those are some examples. I am sure all of us can relate to 
someone who has had these problems. The question is what we 
should do about it. The proposal before us is to declare the 
nineties the decade of the brain, the purpose being to promote 
research and understanding. Certainly we must do more to 
promote understanding of these diseases among Canadians and 
people worldwide. People do not know how to react when in the 
presence of those with a brain disorder. They need to be 
educated. They need to be taught.
<P>
	I think of my friend in the hospital. At times he can move very 
easily and then within minutes he is totally immobilized. Even 
the nurses misunderstand and sometimes ridicule him. How 
unfortunate. There needs to be more understanding.
<P>
	We definitely need to put our resources into research. I do not 
think Canadians would approve of the bill if they thought it was 
only making a case for people to travel around the world on 
junkets to get together and have a good time. However if it is 
used for people to work together internationally sharing their 
research and discoveries and promoting advancement in this 
cause, and if it is genuinely used in an efficient way I am sure 
there would be a high degree of support.
<P>
	We need to promote medical research, but we also need to 
start looking very seriously at how we are spending money in the 
whole medical field. It is atrocious that people with brain 
disorders and brain tumours sometimes have to wait for up to 
half a year before they can get an MRI diagnosis while we fritter 
away our money on other things.
<P>
	We need to focus very sharply the limited funds that are 
available to us and use them for properly directed research. We 
need to make sure that some very distinct objectives are met in 
that research.
<P>
	We could accomplish a great deal if we were to focus on this 
issue in the same way the Americans did some several decades 
ago when they said they would put a man on the moon. They put 
all their resources into it, all their technology and top scientists. 
It is definitely a challenge to us to do that and to focus our 
resources. I am sure that through research and with our scientific 
abilities and the available technology we can do very much to 
discover new frontiers in this area.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise this morning to voice my strong support for Bill 
C-239, an act respecting the decade of the brain. I also would 
like to commend my hon. colleague from London West for her 
initia-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7705"> 7705 </A></B>
<P>
tive in bringing the issues of mental and neurological health of 
Canada's citizens to the floor of the House.
<P>
	I feel the case for the adoption of the bill can best be made by 
applying a legislative litmus test. The questions for us are: First, 
can the bill if enacted make a positive difference in the lives of 
all Canadians? Second, can the bill make a positive contribution 
to Canada as a whole? In both instances the answer where Bill 
C-23 is concerned is an unequivocal yes.
<P>
<B>(1145) </B>
<P>
	Formally declaring the 1990s the decade of the brain can only 
serve to heighten awareness, as has been said, of neurological 
and mental health disorders in Canada and throughout the world. 
Awareness can do much to dispel some of the damaging means 
surrounding mental and neurological illnesses and their victims.
<P>
	That awareness can prompt Canadians to monitor their own 
mental and neurological health more carefully in a preventive 
way and thereby prevent ill health. Awareness can increase our 
resolve as a nation to support efforts to develop cures and 
superior treatments for the variety of elements that afflict the 
human brain and the human mind.
<P>
	Some observers of this morning's debate may wonder why we 
in the House have elected to focus part of our energy and 
attention on the health of the brain. Certainly it is not as though 
the afflictions that strike other areas of the human anatomy are 
any less worthy of our attention. Indeed the Canadian 
Neurological Coalition has noted: ``Far from being a single 
organ to be centred out, the brain is the focus of an enormous 
range of frontier medical science as the seed of logic, reason, 
creativity, intelligence and yes, even compassion and human 
understanding in the human body. We are understandably taken 
aback when disease affects the normal, healthy functioning of 
the brain''.
<P>
	Witness the public reaction when a former U.S. president 
announced just this past week that he is suffering from 
Alzheimer's disease. So much of what makes us human is rooted 
in our brains. Mental and neurological illness has the power to 
strip us not only of our good health but also of our identity, our 
sense of human self.
<P>
	The statistics from the neurological association placed the 
number of Canadians affected by disorders of brain at some five 
million, nearly 20 per cent of Canada's population. This number 
only serves to underscore the importance of acting to call 
attention to the various ailments that range from strokes, 
degenerative disorders, neurogenetic diseases, to speech, 
language and hearing disorders.
<P>
	There is hope. Medical scientists in Canada and throughout 
the world are working diligently to find effective treatments for 
the various disorders. As they do so, they are also unlocking the 
mysteries that are intrinsic to the body's most complex organ. 
As our understanding of the brain and the pathogens and 
chemicals that attack it has broadened to techniques such as 
magnetic resonance, imaging and computerized action  
tomography, sophisticated treatments previously unimaginable 
have become reality today.
<P>
	As the neurological coalition points out, neuroscience has a 
direct impact on almost every area of modern medicine, 
including cardiovascular and immunologic disorders. The 
coalition has stated: ``Studying the brain has enormous potential 
for contributing to the health of Canadians and decreasing the 
severe economic and emotional burden exacted on our society 
by the diseases and disorders that affect the brain''. Disorders of 
the brain ultimately affect the remainder of the human body.
<P>
	``Declaring the 1990s the decade of the brain'', the coalition 
adds, ``would ultimately increase public support of research, 
thereby reducing the eventual government burden of hospital 
and service delivery costs''.
<P>
	For the thousands of Canadians who suffer from Alzheimer's 
disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, 
schizophrenia, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, dementia, 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and other disorders, this 
declaration would be proof positive that the government would 
not turn a blind eye to their needs and, indeed, that the 
government would continue to give them the attention they 
deserve.
<P>
<B>(1150 ) </B>
<P>
	It is for these individuals as well as for the health and 
well-being of Canada as a whole that I offer my wholehearted 
support for Bill C-239, an act respecting the decade of the brain.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Margaret Bridgman (Surrey North, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to speak on the bill. I 
commend my colleague for London West. I have listened to the 
debate today. We have discussed the intricacies of the brain. We 
have also discussed numerous illnesses of the brain.
<P>
	The brain is indeed a very complex organ. Attention should be 
given to the brain. I feel strongly that we are not aware of how 
important the brain is to us. Everything we look at, everything 
we do, every philosophy we have has been generated by the 
functioning of our brain. It is an extremely important organ and 
we know very little about it.
<P>
	My colleague from the Bloc commented on the mapping of 
the brain. It was not long ago that we thought memory had a 
specific location in our brain. Experiments that have been done 
on Parkinson's disease have shown that one can have very small 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7706"> 7706 </A></B>
<P>
sections of the brain stimulated and suddenly start singing the 
Coca-Cola song or something.
<P>
	We now realize that the brain is functioning like the rest of our 
body based on chemical components. It is the chemical structure 
of our body that allows messages to pass through the synapses, 
making us function and do things that we think are very 
important to our lifestyle and to build the societies we need.
<P>
	We talk about brain disorders. Someone here previously 
mentioned that five million Canadians are suffering from brain 
disorders. It was also mentioned that a considerable amount of 
the health care dollar is spent on conditions involving the brain, 
which is true, but this does not seem to be a situation that is 
going to go away rapidly. We do not cure a condition of the brain 
in six weeks like we do a fracture of the arm or some other bone.
<P>
	Disabilities of the brain can vary from very minute kinds of 
behaviour pattern to extreme disorders. We really do not know 
why this is happening. It is very essential that we look at this 
organ and try to understand it so we can better understand our 
own lives.
<P>
	For example, in my background of psychiatric nursing I have 
had the opportunity to witness and work with people who are 
totally incapable of dressing themselves. They do not know how 
to put on their pants. They will stick their arm in the pant leg. On 
the other hand, the particular young man I am thinking of could 
be given questions like: ``What is the total of 2,925 plus-?'' 
One could go on and on with a list of figures. He could have the 
answer by the time one was finished saying what the figures 
were. Yet here was a man who was totally incapable of 
functioning in any other way. All that was required to get his 
mathematical mind going was the bribe of a cup of coffee. He 
was very serviceable in the accounting department and that 
seemed to be his role. Those were the days before computers.
<P>
	The other thing we tend to think about is the human brain. We 
have to also consider what has happened over the years in 
relation to our awareness of animal brains. We are now looking 
at the possibility of not being the only species that is capable of 
thinking. There is a tremendous amount of research being done 
on dolphins. We are gradually becoming aware that other 
animals do indeed communicate. This is something that has 
come about because of some people's awareness of the brain, its 
intricacies, its unknown powers, et cetera.
<P>
<B>(1155) </B>
<P>
	We do not actually know what we are capable of doing. We 
hear people talk about having a sixth sense, ESP. Some of us 
think that we know what that means; some of us do not. Some of 
us are very capable of carrying that out. Obviously there is a 
mechanism in our brain that could be developed along this line. 
Again, we do not know because of lack of research or whatever.
<P>
	Also with regard to awareness, we seem to be more aware of 
the mysteries and the wonders of outer space, for example. That 
can be common coffee table talk in restaurants or wherever. Yet 
we do not even know the capabilities of our own brain or our 
own head, our capabilities of what we as a species can do. We 
wonder about outer space and this kind of thing. We are more 
aware of that than what actually makes us who we are. Nothing 
that we have achieved to date would be here were it not for the 
capabilities of our brain, and yet we still do not understand how 
it functions.
<P>
	A few years ago schizophrenia was thought to be, and some 
aspects of schizophrenia are still thought to be, a behavioural 
disorder. Through research it has been discovered that there is a 
physiological situation involved in our bodies that creates some 
diagnoses of schizophrenia.
<P>
	Another tremendous condition affecting us today in our 
present lifestyles is depression. We really do not know why we 
get into the various states of depression, yet we have all kinds of 
drugs and all kinds of people taking these drugs for depression. 
We are rapidly moving into a situation in our society where we 
are going to have a pill for everything. You can probably change 
your personality if you just start taking medication.
<P>
	We realize that the brain is totally dependent on the chemical 
constitution of its environment. We also realize that it is very 
very subject to trauma. There have been situations in which 
trauma has occurred and we do not understand why. It is not only 
trauma. It can be stroke as well. Certain people are left with 
aphasias. These conditions can differ as well. Some people can 
say only half a word. Some people know what they want to say. 
For example, they know it is an ashtray but they cannot 
remember the name so they say ``something to put your cigarette 
in''. This is debilitating for them in their existence. We do not 
know how to help them help themselves.
<P>
	I strongly advocate that the decade of the brain, and I realize 
that we are about halfway through it, be recognized. I think that 
our awareness as a species is inadequate. I would also suggest 
that it not only happen once in a lifetime but that it happen 
probably once every hundred years, if it is going to take this kind 
of legislation or this kind of awareness to make us aware that we 
do not know very much about ourselves and what we are capable 
of doing.
<P>

	<B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Secretary of State (Parliamentary 
Affairs) and Deputy Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons, Lib.)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House take note of the Second Report of the Standing Committee 
on Industry (``Taking Care of Small Business''), presented to the House on 
Tuesday, October 18, 1994.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, in the ten years I have been sitting in 
this House, I have always taken an aggressive and enthusiastic 
stand for the small and medium-sized business sector. This is 
one of my priorities because I know how crucial and invaluable 
the vitality of our small and medium-sized businesses is to our 
economy.
<P>
	Our small business sector accounts for nearly 40 per cent of 
our gross national product. It already provides employment to 
over four million people across Canada and generates a great 
many new jobs. Between 1979 and 1989, 85 per cent of new jobs 
in Canada were created by small businesses. This sector of our 
economy is the one with the highest growth rate. Because they 
are closer to the people and more closely tied to the community, 
small businesses are at the heart of our society. They are part of 
our daily life. The vitality, creativity and success of Canadian 
businesses is recognized world-wide. We all benefit from the 
talent, ingenuity, perseverance and sense of responsibility of our 
small business leaders.
<P>
	Of course, much attention is being paid to Quebec Inc., these 
groups of Quebec businesses that have grown very quickly 
during the 1970s and 1980s. This is the fabulous success story of 
small businesses that expanded greatly in a very short time with 
government assistance, particularly that of the federal 
government. But Quebec Inc. is more than that. It is also 
thousands of less flamboyant and lesser known businesses 
which are nevertheless very successful and, more importantly, 
provide employment to thousands of people.
<P>
	I am very proud of the fact that our government has made 
assistance to small businesses one of its priorities. For years, 
when we were in opposition, I have done everything to try and 
make the previous government realize how important our small 
and medium-sized businesses are to the Canadian economy. I 
asked in every possible way for governmental red tape to be 
reduced, single windows to be established and access to capital 
be made easier. I suggested that our embassies and consulates 
put more emphasis on the export of Canadian products. I called 
for the Canadian government to take a more active part in 
developing new markets in conjunction with businesses.
<P>
	I must say that the events of the past week have made me very 
proud and very happy. Night after night I could watch on 
television as our Prime Minister and hundreds of business 
leaders from here developed trade ties with the most populous 
country in the world: China. The approach used by Team Canada 
has already been widely praised as a model of effective and 
efficient trade development. This is when we were able to see 
how a Prime Minister that takes the trouble to do so can, better 
than anybody else, develop trade opportunities abroad.
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	The team that represented us in China is an all-star team; it is 
the best team our country has ever produced. All my colleagues 
will agree, I am sure, to award the Prime Minister the first star of 
this historic diplomatic and trade mission. However, its success 
is not measured in goals as in hockey. It is measured in terms of 
jobs for our workers and expansion opportunities for our 
businesses.
<P>
	This diplomatic and trade achievement did not happen by 
accident. It rests on this government's fundamental belief in the 
need to identify in concert with the private sector the strategic 
niches likely to enable the small businesses of today and 
tomorrow to achieve their full potential. In this regard, my 
colleague, the Minister for International Trade, has just 
published a report outlining how the government intends, with 
the help of banks, to shore up its support of small exporters.
<P>
	This report sets out an action plan and proposes concrete 
solutions to the needs of small businesses to ensure their 
development and their access to export markets. We still do not 
fully realize how much momentum exports can give our small 
businesses and our economy. For example, Quebec is a trading 
province where not enough entrepreneurs care to face external 
markets. Quebec exports are worth almost $35 billion a year, but 
only 22 per cent of Quebec's small manufacturers export their 
products. And they only export 14 per cent of their production.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7708"> 7708 </A></B>
<P>
	Two hundred businesses account for almost 95 per cent of 
foreign sales. Let us think for a second about the amount of 
business and the number of jobs that would be created if the 
majority of Quebec's 160,000 small and medium-sized 
businesses took full advantage of export opportunities.
<P>
	The action plan identifies three areas where support of small 
exporters must be improved: access to information, access to 
short-term financing and access to intermediate financing. 
Entrepreneurs will recognize these as areas where the 
government's strategic involvement can largely benefit small 
businesses.
<P>
	Through the measures it proposes to make it easier for small 
businesses to access information, this action plan is designed to 
eliminate the real frustrations felt by entrepreneurs who want to 
obtain crucial information on their export capacity. It creates a 
real resource guide that will allow small businesses to save 
precious time in their efforts to break into international markets. 
It gives them access to a team of experts and a series of dynamic 
and effective training programs.
<P>
	We also want to create a climate of co-operation between 
financial institutions and small businesses. This would meet an 
essential need of our businesses. In this regard, the 
government's role is crucial because many entrepreneurs were 
not well treated by financial institutions during the recession. 
As it is, Canada does not have enough businesses that can face 
the new competition, without our small and medium-sized 
businesses having to overcome financing problems.
<P>
	This reality is clearly identified in the report of the Standing 
Committee on Industry entitled ``Taking Care of Small 
Business'', which was tabled recently and which we are 
debating today here in this House.
<P>
<B>(1210) </B>
<P>
	The report deals with the obstacles which our small 
businesses must overcome to find the capital required to grow 
and expand. The committee came to this conclusion: ``Financial 
institutions, especially the banks, in accepting that their own 
responsibility to society is greater than `merely' being efficient, 
stable and profitable, must recognize the importance of small 
and medium-sized businesses to the national economy''. This is 
a very important and serious point.
<P>
	I congratulate the members of the Standing Committee on 
Industry for their clear and articulate report. Obviously, this 
government wants businesses to develop and to create jobs 
which will benefit all Canadians. For that to happen, we must act 
on several fronts. We want services provided by the federal 
government to be concrete, well targeted and, particularly, 
efficient. This is why the Minister responsible for the Federal 
Office of Regional Development-Quebec is in the process of 
redefining the mandate of that agency. The minister wants the 
federal government to become a strategic ally of small and 
medium-sized businesses in every region of Quebec. He wants 
federal services and programs to be  better integrated and more 
accessible for those businesses, everywhere in the province.
<P>
	From now on, federal programs will be based on four 
initiatives which relate to supporting the development of small 
businesses, namely innovation, market development, promotion 
of entrepreneurship and projects which serve as regional 
catalysts.
<P>
	The objective is to allow the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec to help small businesses meet new 
challenges, at a time when markets are increasingly more open. 
The agency currently has 13 business offices in Quebec. It will 
put these offices at the disposal of other federal departments, in 
order to provide an integrated service to small businesses in the 
various regions. The Federal Office will thus become the real 
broker regarding information and programs; it will be the single 
window which entrepreneurs have been asking for so long.
<P>
	Federal services will therefore be accessible to all small and 
medium-sized businesses in Quebec and there will no longer be 
second-class businesses or regions in that province.
<P>
	This work is not only being conducted in Quebec. Federal 
agencies in other regions, including the Atlantic, the West and 
Ontario, are doing the same thing, because the number one 
priority of the government is to develop small and 
medium-sized businesses.
<P>
	Our government formally pledged to cut public spending and 
we are taking measures to reach that goal. We must often make 
difficult choices. However, we are firmly convinced that the 
federal government must remain an efficient partner of small 
and medium sized businesses, because they are the ones creating 
the largest number of jobs.
<P>
	Our approach will be better targeted and will rely more on the 
provision of strategic services than on financial assistance. This 
is what entrepreneurs have been asking for a long time. We are 
going to concentrate on those sectors where the federal 
government is better equipped to ensure real added value. There 
will be no waste, nor any duplication.
<P>
	Real waste would be to ignore the potential of Quebec regions 
by depriving them of efficient federal services. As well, real 
duplication would be for another level of government to build 
from scratch a second international network to open world 
markets to Quebec regions.
<P>
<B>(1215) </B>
<P>
	Canada's geographic location is unique: Two main windows, 
one on the Atlantic, the other on the Pacific, plus a long border 
with the United States. We are in a unique position to develop 
our trade with the largest markets in the world. This is how we 
will ensure our prosperity.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7709"> 7709 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	No doubt our small business sector faces many challenges. 
Our entrepreneurs are concerned about the scope, the 
complexity and the rigidity of the regulatory processes. Our 
regulations are complicated and confusing. Compliance takes 
too much time, effort and money. Regulation by different 
departments or different governments leads to confusion, 
overlap and additional paper burden. Small businesses 
operating outside their own provinces often have to comply with 
different product and operation standards.
<P>
	In 1992 a Canadian Federation of Independent Business 
survey found that 71 per cent of small business owners found 
regulations and paper burden to be an increasing problem. It is 
clear that with their limited resources small businesses face a 
disproportionate burden of compliance requirements. The 
government knows that and it is taking action to reduce that 
burden.
<P>
	The House committee on regulatory reform and federal 
government review has been studying the situation. Thousands 
of small business managers have contributed to the work of the 
committee. More than 1,700 federal regulations are now 
examined and improved.
<P>
	The small business working committees will be submitting 
their report within the next few weeks. The committee on 
business environment has examined the regulatory best 
practices of other countries and governments in areas such as 
sunset legislation, elimination of unnecessary or inappropriate 
licences, certification costs and the use of phase-in periods, 
differential standards and thresholds to alleviate the burden.
<P>
	It is also considering how to reduce the complexity of the 
federal regulatory process, how to reduce or simplify the 
numbers of forms, reports and records required by regulations.
<P>
	We must also improve the delivery of our programs and 
services. Currently there are over 700 federal and provincial 
government support measures for small business. Accessing the 
right program and service is a complex and most often a very 
unfriendly process. There are extensive overlap and duplication. 
Sometimes the government may also be competing with private 
sector suppliers of services for businesses.
<P>
	The government believes that it is urgent to take action. That 
is why the Canada business service centres provide small 
businesses with referrals to sources of assistance. They provide 
quick, accurate information about relevant programs, services 
and regulations as well as some diagnostic assistance.
<P>
	Business service centres minimize telephone runaround, that 
is where small business operators are sent from one office to 
another, from one telephone number to another. The business 
centre is supposed to take care of that problem as well as 
inadequate or incorrect information and duplication of 
government  services. This will enable clients to make well 
informed business decisions in an increasingly global economy. 
Each centre offers a combination of products and services 
tailored to meet the needs of its distinctive client base. Currently 
19 federal business departments or agencies participate in this 
initiative as well as other levels of government and 
non-government organizations.
<P>
<B>(1220) </B>
<P>
	The combination of participants varies from province to 
province with the designated managing partners who are 
responsible for the development and management of the Canada 
business service centres. In British Columbia and Alberta it is 
Western Economic Diversification. In Saskatchewan, Manitoba 
and Ontario it is Industry Canada. In Quebec it is the Federal 
Office of Regional Development and in the Atlantic provinces it 
is the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency. Each managing 
partner is well suited to deliver the best services to our clients, 
the small business owners.
<P>
	We want to go further. We want to spread the business service 
centre concept to every province as a model of co-operation 
between the public and the private sectors. We want to work with 
the private sector, provincial and municipal governments to 
eliminate duplication and overlap.
<P>
	Our colleague, the President of the Privy Council, is currently 
reviewing all federal government programs. A key element of 
his initiative will be a rationalization of small business 
programs.
<P>
	This is more than the words and vague promises we were 
given by the last government. This is action. This is action to 
eliminate duplication and overlap. This is action to minimize 
the paper burden small businesses have to face on a daily basis.
<P>
	I am glad to see the Minister of Industry here listening. I hope 
he will be listening to the debate all day so that in the near future 
he can respond to the report of the House industry committee 
and give us more good policy for small business.
<P>
	In conclusion, this is action to help our entrepreneurs to do 
what they do best. What small business does best is create jobs. 
It is what every government has to do to help small business 
create more jobs and when we have more jobs we have a better 
country.

committee.
<P>
	The committee sat from February to September and then 
prepared the final text of its report. We heard from 58 witnesses 
and received 62 submissions. I must stress that proceedings 
were conducted in a very constructive, cordial and non-partisan 
atmosphere. The problem of business financing is, obviously, a 
non-partisan issue and, although we are particularly interested 
in the political status of Quebec, an issue which will remain 
important and forever present irrespective of the political status 
we choose.
<P>
	In all, the committee came up with 22 recommendations. We 
totally agree with some; we agree with others with some 
reservations; but there are three recommendations on which we 
totally disagree with the view and direction expressed by the 
committee.
<P>
	At this stage, I should probably remind you of the reason why 
the committee considered credit or rather the tightening of 
credit. Because of the recession, many members, especially in 
Ontario, received representations protesting the attitude of the 
business and banking worlds towards small businesses when it 
came to credit. This generated a consensus among members of 
the committee to study this question and find out whether or not 
there was indeed a credit crunch. As we shall see it is not all that 
clear.
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
	Concerning the 22 recommendations, I would like to draw 
your attention to the major ones, those that seem to me the most 
significant, starting with the ones we totally agree with.
<P>
	The first recommendation we agree with and the most 
significant is the second one, a recommendation to the business 
world, and to banks in particular, that they report quarterly on 
lending to small business. The collection, compilation and 
publication of the data would give a picture of past economic 
activity based not only on actual loans, but also on loan 
applications. The information requested would include the size 
of the business, the nature of its activities, the gender of the 
applicant, the number of employees at the time of application, 
the volume of sales and the location of the company, so we could 
have, ideally by municipality, a true picture of the situation.
<P>
	As I mentioned earlier, it proved impossible for the 
committee to demonstrate, appearances notwithstanding, that 
credit was tighter. In spite of all the horror stories which were 
related to the committee and are familiar to any well-informed 
citizen, especially the way borrowers are treated by bankers, the 
committee members were unable to demonstrate that credit was 
indeed getting tighter, due to the lack of proper data. We could 
have demonstrated that credit was tighter if we could have 
shown how many applications had been turned down and how 
many had been accepted. But without the total number of 
applications and the total number of loans, we are not in a 
position to prove that credit was indeed tighter. All we can say is 
that there was a drop in lending  and that it may be due to a drop 
in demand; we have documents from the Bank of Canada to back 
this up.
<P>
	It is presently impossible to prove anything, which justifies 
this seemingly technical but very important recommendation to 
the effect that, from now on, all business stakeholders, 
especially the banking world, should report their activities on a 
quarterly basis.
<P>
	The second recommendation we totally agree with is 
recommendation no. 3; it deals with the drafting of a code of 
conduct which would compel both sides to better manage their 
activities, especially with regard to interpersonal relationships. 
On one hand, borrowers would have to disclose a certain amount 
of information in an objective manner, and on the other, lenders 
would have, of course, to behave constantly in an ethical 
manner, avoiding arbitrary decisions and clearly stating all the 
reasons why the loan is refused, and suggesting alternative 
sources of financing. Moreover, all lending establishments 
would create internal complaints-handling mechanisms.
<P>
	As I said, we do agree with the establishment of a code of 
conduct; we understand that one is already being drafted by the 
Canadian Bankers Association.
<P>
	The third recommendation of the committee with which we 
agree is recommendation no. 5. It concerns the establishment of 
an office of bank ombudsman, in case the internal 
complaints-handling mechanism described earlier fails to 
address the concerns of disappointed and frustrated clients. The 
ombudsman would be independent, impartial and could 
investigate complaints of breach of duty or maladministration 
by the banking world. Also, following the British model, if the 
complaint is well-founded, the bank could be required to pay 
compensation.
<P>
	These are the three recommendations of the committee with 
which we readily agree.
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
	We agree with the rationale behind two other 
recommendations, although we have some reservations. First of 
all, there is recommendation 14 which promotes the creation of 
a new category of banks, the so-called schedule III Banks. Let 
me remind hon. members that Schedule I Banks are the banks we 
are familiar with, that is the six major Canadian-owned banks, 
and Schedule II Banks are foreign owned banks, for example, 
the Banque nationale de Paris and the Hong Kong Bank. Now, 
we would have Schedule III Banks, institutions set up by 
Canadian stakeholders, like Canada Trust, mentioned in the 
report, or by existing groups or very wealthy individuals in 
Canada who would now be able to create their own banks.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7711"> 7711 </A></B>
<P>
	We have reservations, because this recommendation, as 
worded, does not limit the size of these institutions, of these 
Schedule III Banks. There is no restriction to avoid extreme 
concentration of financial powers that would let some groups or 
very wealthy individuals become even richer.
<P>
	We also have reservations about the fact that there is no 
restriction to avoid what can be called incestuous relationships 
between the parent corporation and the subsidiaries set up by 
this parent corporation. There is currently no code of conduct 
for related companies, but what makes it worst is that this kind 
of relationships can be set up at the expense of the people 
dealing with these financial institutions.
<P>
	Moreover, we have no guarantee that the Schedule III Banks, 
these new banks, will be particularly concerned about small 
businesses, even though this bill tends to promote competition 
in the current banking system, by opening the door to new 
players who would be more sensitive to the needs of small 
businesses. The current recommendations include no measures 
to ensure that these new banks deal more specifically with the 
small and medium-sized businesses.
<P>
	As I said, we agree with the principle, but with the 
reservations I just mentioned.
<P>
	We also agree with recommendations 18 and 19, which we 
find a good lead that should be explored and which provide for 
owners of small businesses to invest up to 20 per cent of their 
own RRSPs in their businesses.
<P>
	Since small businesses in general lack capital, we consider 
this to be a good idea even though we should keep in mind that 
the primary goal of RRSPs is to help Canadians and Quebecers 
to better prepare for their retirements. We must realize that this 
will always be some kind of alteration of the terms of reference.
<P>
	The main objective is retirement planning. Until now, people 
were allowed to use this fund to buy a first house; they would 
now be able to invest up to 20 per cent of it in their own 
businesses. This is not a bad idea, but we must remember that it 
is an alteration in the terms of reference. So much so that if the 
businesses go bankrupt, owners will not only lose their 
businesses but up to 20 per cent of their RRSPs also. The loss 
could be significant.
<P>
	Also, nowhere is it stipulated that business people who have 
invested part of their RRSPs must pay it back over a certain 
period of time. Thus, the risk is all the more important. In any 
case, we think that this recommendation is not supported by a 
sufficient number of studies and that an in-depth study should 
be carried out before anything is done.
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
	I will now turn to the three recommendations we completely 
disagree with, as shown in the minority report which is an 
integral part of the report. These recommendations are about 
section 22 concerning labour sponsored venture capital 
corporations, section 8 on the Small Businesses Loans Act and 
section 10 on the Federal Business Development Bank and more 
specifically on changing the name of the FBDB.
<P>
	In case the minister has to leave to attend to his numerous 
obligations, I will speak first on the changing of the name of the 
FBDB. Personally, I find this proposal rather ludicrous. The 
name of the Federal Business Development Bank is known in 
Quebec as well as in English Canada. I think I forgot to mention 
that one of the proposals is to change the name of the Federal 
Business Development Bank to Small Business Bank of Canada. 
This is nothing more than a business decision. It limits 
considerably the bank's mandate because it is not only the small 
business sector that has legitimate needs which have to be 
addressed.
<P>
	Of course, as a nationalist and a sovereignist from Quebec, I 
cannot help but think that the minister and his parliamentary 
secretary want to use the name Small Business Bank of Canada 
as part of their referendum campaign strategy. It is very obvious, 
Mr. Speaker. Every Quebecer will know it. I would almost like 
to see the name changed just before the referendum campaign 
because it would give us one more example to show the people 
the kind of things that the federal government is doing, to show 
them what is going on in the Langevin Block.
<P>
	It is similar to what the government just did with the new 
tourism policy, increasing the budget by $35 million to sing the 
praises of Canada and Canadian federalism from coast to coast. 
It is easy, especially when it is done with the taxpayers' money.
<P>
	There is something indecent about changing the name of the 
Federal Business Development Bank in this period of fiscal 
restraint, right after the announcement of a new war budget. The 
government wants to spend a lot of money at the taxpayers' 
expense to play politics so that Quebecers will soon be able to 
see, as my colleague the parliamentary secretary was telling me, 
nice signs announcing the Small Business Bank of Canada in all 
of the province's regional capitals. This must mean that the 
government is short of arguments, which is comforting to us.
<P>
	Labour sponsored venture capital corporations were our first 
point of dissent. It is a very subtle way for the federal 
government to interfere in an area under provincial jurisdiction. 
I will read to you proposal no. 22. ``Labour sponsored venture 
capital corporations. The committee recommends the adoption 
of a new self-regulating mechanism for labour-sponsored 
venture capital corporations. This mechanism would link the 
annual supply of federal tax credits to the  labour-sponsored 
venture capital corporation's prior investment in small and 
medium-sized Canadian businesses, and be subject to a strict 
annual audit.'' 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7712"> 7712 </A></B>
<P>
And here is where the shoe pinches: ``Where such a 
self-regulating mechanism exists under provincial legislation, 
the federal government would limit its review to ensuring that 
the labour-sponsored venture capital corporation's performance 
meets the objectives for which the federal tax credits were 
provided''.
<P>
	This is a very subtle, technical way of interfering in an area of 
provincial jurisdiction, especially, in the case of Quebec, in an 
area which is very well managed by the Quebec government. 
That government, together with the Solidarity Fund, represents 
a third of all labour-sponsored venture funds in Canada.
<P>
	The Solidarity Fund was set up under a legislation which also 
defines its objectives. The application of that legislation is well 
managed, and we do not accept that the federal government 
could be coming in through the back door, by defining 
objectives for the Solidarity Fund because of the tax credits it 
gives to Solidarity shareholders. If, in the final analysis, and 
hypothetically, these objectives were not met by the Solidarity 
Fund, the federal government could come in and change the 
rules of the game, interfering with the Fund's mandate and its 
portfolio management, because of the tax credits given to 
Solidarity Fund shareholders. That scheme should be exposed. 
It is also an attack on shareholders of the fund.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	If the federal government wants to do away with this tax 
shelter, let it be upfront and say so publicly. Let it be open about 
this, and wage the political fight that will ensue. It should be 
warned, though, that we will join the fray, all the more so 
because the Parti Quebecois government has kept its word and 
eliminated the ceiling forced upon the QFL Solidarity Fund by 
the former Liberal government in Quebec.
<P>
	When this government tries to restrict such a positive 
initiative, an initiative that is costly for the government but 
maybe not that much, when it dares to create difficulties for an 
institution such as the Fonds de solidarité, which is more than a 
mere investment mechanism but is also a means to foster 
regional economic development-together with other actors in 
Quebec such as Mouvement Desjardins, the National Bank, the 
Quebec Deposit and Development Fund, and local actors, the 
Fonds de solidarité managed to create regional units in order to 
fulfil specific regional needs-when this government dares to 
interfere with instead of improving such an initiative, we have to 
expose that action, which we will oppose as forcefully as we 
can.
<P>
	It would be ill-advised for me to do otherwise, since my 
riding benefitted immensely from the Solidarity Fund. When 
you think that CIP Forest Products, a well established pulp and 
paper company, almost a multinational company, which closed 
its doors for all kinds of reasons is now reopening with the help 
of the  Solidarity Fund which invested $28 million in 
Trois-Rivières so that the plant can resume its activities and put 
350 people back to work, you have to admit we will never be 
grateful enough for the Solidarity Fund.
<P>
	The other important point on which we disagree entirely, as in 
the first two cases, has to do with recommendation No. 8 on the 
Small Businesses Loans Act. That act is very popular and 
increasingly put to use. I think it is a sound measure 
implemented by the federal government which supports the 
development of small businesses.
<P>
	However, some committee members were of the opinion that 
the administration of this act is too expensive for the public 
purse. I think that is wrong. We will not successfully fight the 
deficit by reducing investments. On the contrary, we should 
think of investing much more in order to promote the 
establishment and development of small businesses. That is how 
we can promote economic growth.
<P>
	Section 7 proposes the creation of a new program that would 
help export businesses since we know that banks shrink from 
lending on the basis of accounts receivable from foreign 
customers. If memory serves me well, banks will guarantee 
approximately 75 per cent of domestic accounts receivable but 
in the case of foreign accounts receivable, bankers are very 
hesitant, perhaps with good reason. That new program would 
give some form of assurance to the banks.
<P>
	We feel that this program should not exist by itself but be 
included in an broader version of the Small Businesses Loans 
Act. In that way, exporters would benefit from the act, but so 
would the new economy types of businesses, those based on 
technology, research and development, patents, those who have 
no tangible assets as collateral to lenders. The act, therefore, 
should have a broader scope and cover the working capital of 
these small businesses. Then, given the guarantee offered by the 
Small Businesses Loans Act, banks would lend greater amounts 
to these businesses. That would show some vision, some 
innovative spirit in dealing with those who represent Canada's 
economic future, the young entrepreneurs of our new economy. 
We think that is the key to fighting the deficit on the home front.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	As I said before, according to one school of thought, this 
legislation is too expensive for the public Treasury. We think 
that before any attempt is made to downsize the cost of this 
legislation, there should first be a cost-benefit analysis to 
evaluate the number of jobs created as a result of this 
legislation: the amount of taxes paid directly and indirectly and 
the money saved on unemployment insurance benefits and 
welfare payments. To say that this legislation costs the public 
Treasury millions of dollars shows a lack of vision and 
innovative spirit and a failure to see the medium- and long-term 
benefits. That was the third recommendation with which we 
entirely disagreed.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7713"> 7713 </A></B>
<P>
	Before I finish, I would like to touch on two aspects that were 
not included in the committee's recommendations or in 
representations by the Liberal caucus, although the red book, 
their major source of inspiration, mentioned two measures that 
could very well have been included among the committee's 
recommendations.
<P>
	The first measure was the elimination, as planned in the red 
book, of personal guarantees under the Small Business Loans 
Act. The Liberals had promised to get rid of this provision under 
the Small Business Loans Act; so that personal guarantees could 
be used to obtain loans from other sources. The Liberals 
conveniently forgot a promise that would have been a great help 
to small entrepreneurs.
<P>
	A second and more substantial measure was a commitment by 
the Liberal Party of Canada to establish an industrial investment 
fund to the tune of $100 million, four times $25 million, Mr. 
Speaker! It was made quite clear during the election campaign 
that the money would be there, and the mood was very 
optimistic. Strangely enough, very little was said about this in 
committee: no recommendation on the allocation or use of such 
financing, of this amount of $100 million.
<P>
	We can only hope that, if the matter is ever raised again, the 
$100 million or $50 million-which is more likely-will not be 
spent on a new program within a new framework but within an 
existing framework and especially one that already exists in 
Quebec.
<P>
	On a more personal point, something was left out, something I 
myself recommended which was considered for awhile but, 
unfortunately it was dropped from the recommendations. It is 
common practice among banks, and I know this from personal 
experience, that when a business is in trouble or proves to be a 
bad risk, the lender has the right to have an outside firm go and 
check the financial status of the business. It does this at the 
request and for the purposes of the bank, which bills the 
individual, who is already in trouble, for the expenses incurred.
<P>
	This means that the borrower is hit with a so-called double 
whammy: he is already in financial difficulty, and then he gets 
the bad news when this outside firm comes, not to further his 
interests but those of the lender, and in the final instance charges 
a fee that is often quite substantial and may mean the difference 
between survival or going under altogether.
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
	I had suggested that responsibilities be at least shared if they 
could not be completely assumed by the lending institution. This 
was under consideration for a while, but it does not appear as a 
recommendation in the final report. Personally I deplore it.
<P>
	In concluding, I would say that we must always keep in mind 
that when we talk about small and medium sized businesses, in 
Canada, we are talking about 900,000 small organizations, a 
good third of which are located in  Quebec; this is more than just 
a number, it is something we should never lose track of. Small 
and medium-sized businesses are our hope for the future. If they 
flourish, the economy in Canada and in Quebec will benefit. If 
they vegetate, so will our economy. I hope that the report will 
help improve the situation as a whole.
<P>
	I would like to point out that regional economic development 
is a provincial jurisdiction to which Quebec is deeply 
committed. The Canadian government should always keep in 
mind that, when it deals with regional development, it must be in 
a supportive role, not as the driving force.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Okanagan Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to participate in the debate this 
afternoon.
<P>
	It has been a privilege to work on this committee. It was my 
first experience as a member to work on a standing committee of 
the House of Commons. It was an exciting experience and a 
particularly intense learning experience as we were exposed to 
procedural matters. The substance of the committee was very 
significant and required a lot of learning. It was a good 
experience in terms of co-operation among members as well. It 
showed beyond doubt that things can be made to happen if 
people want them to take place.
<P>
	This afternoon I want to focus on three things. First, why is it 
necessary to take care of small business? Second, what are some 
of the major elements affecting small business in the economic 
and changing social environment that we are going to face? 
Third, how will some of the recommendations in the report help 
small business survive today and be prepared to meet the 
challenges of tomorrow? It is within that context we can well 
look at the report as setting some pretty good foundational types 
of statements for the future.
<P>
	Why is it necessary to take care of small business? Small 
business creates jobs. Eighty per cent to eight-five per cent of 
the new jobs created in Canada were created by small business. 
It is also the engine of economic recovery. I can give some 
examples from Kelowna. It has been described by many as the 
best place to live in Canada.
<P>
	What is the economy of Kelowna? It is small business. I can 
give some specific examples. Western Star Trucks recently won 
the Canada export award. In terms of the context of General 
Motors and Chrysler it is a very small operation. Kelowna 
Flightcraft recently got the contract for Purolator and is 
distributing parcels and mail all over the world. Riverside 
Forest Products supplies plywood and lumber products 
internationally and nationally. Then there are literally hundreds 
of small, often mom and pop shop operations that make up the 
basis of the economy of Kelowna. Some of them are on the 
cutting edge of new technology.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7714"> 7714 </A></B>
<P>
	Take for example Brenda Mines which had to close its mine 
just up from Peachland and is now using technology that was 
developed in that mining operation and travelling all around the 
world, centred in Kelowna. These specialists are going into 
South American and other countries helping these people to 
develop their mining operations.
<P>
	Northern Airborne Technology supplies much of the internal 
electronics found in helicopters today. The very same small 
businesses are providing a very interesting transition between 
the old economy and the new economy. We have a truck that runs 
on today's highways and yet is using computer technology in 
terms of the way the trucks communicate with one another and a 
whole system of record keeping is right on the truck as it moves 
across the continent.
<P>
<B>(1255 ) </B>
<P>
	Let us now look briefly at the environment within which these 
small businesses today and tomorrow will operate. Our society 
is in transition. The farmer has become an agribusiness person 
with specialized knowledge and skill in the agricultural 
business. Blue collar industrial workers are becoming auxiliary 
employees in many instances and yet they leave a very 
significant legacy that affects all of us. With them came unions, 
with them came middle income salaries without the need for 
extensive post-secondary education, and with them came strong 
political power.
<P>
	Today a new workforce is emerging. That new workforce is 
the knowledge worker. This workforce will be highly educated 
and manually skilled. The transition from the predominantly 
blue collar workforce to the new knowledge worker will require 
a change of attitude, beliefs and values on the part of every 
member of society. Education will become the centre of that 
society. World economic competitiveness will rely on our 
ability to acquire and apply knowledge. Productivity of the 
knowledge worker will become the economic challenge of 
society and productivity of the non-knowledge worker will 
become the social challenge of the knowledge workforce.
<P>
	To many of us these are new ideas with significant 
consequences. Small business will play a significant role in the 
new economy because small business represents the creativity 
and ideas of the entrepreneur.
<P>
	Let us take the establishment and growth of Microsoft as an 
example. In the beginning it was an idea. Today it is a 
multimillion dollar corporation that remains on the leading edge 
of technology. It is particularly significant that Bill Gates, the 
man who pursued the idea of the Microsoft company, is 
rumoured to have recently purchased the ideas of Leonardo da 
Vinci. That is very interesting: greatness then, greatness now; 
two men, two big ideas, each in their own way changed the world 
they lived in, the world we live in and the world that is going to 
be facing our children and grandchildren.
<P>
	Once farmers ploughed with horses, and today farmers drive 
tractors with electronic sensors to monitor temperature 
bearings, they talk to their home base via electronic telephone 
from pressurized cabs, listening to quadraphonic music played 
on CDs. Internal combustion engines have computerized fuel 
injection systems. Making things is often now the function of 
robots that do not get tired and seldom vary in terms of quality; 
all ideas, all knowledge, all had their roots in small business.
<P>
	Ideas are the key. Some of the characteristics of the new 
economy will require new ideas if our economy, our society and 
our small businesses are to benefit. We must recognize that the 
new economy is knowledge based and that means that 
production will be the application of knowledge and that 
requires not one time learning but continuous learning. It relies 
on highly specialized people.
<P>
	That new economy is also global in scope. Knowledge knows 
no boundaries. It is portable and can be applied almost anywhere 
that people live. It is independent of race, age, sex, culture and 
religion.
<P>
	The new economy also affects and impacts the old economy. 
Whether we live in the new economy or the old economy we will 
still need food, clothing and shelter. This new economy also 
requires its own infrastructure, for example satellites, fibre 
optic cable communication systems and so on.
<P>
	It will significantly affect our workforce. Training and 
education will become central. Increasingly we will rely on a 
voucher system of financing education by individuals. Private 
and public institutions will be proliferating. Industry will take a 
far larger role in the training and education of its people and 
continuous learning will be the hallmark. That learning will 
often be modular in terms of programming and in terms of times 
when it is delivered or partaken of. Productivity and quality will 
both be measured in terms of the availability and efficiency of 
the application of knowledge.
<P>
<B>(1300) </B>
<P>
	Another point that needs to be put in here is that the ownership 
of the means of production will shift and will be redefined. It 
will gradually move into the hands of the workers.
<P>
	For many of us we know that this has already happened and is 
happening right now. Pensions, for example, own increasingly 
large proportions of the equity of businesses and through 
deferred income very many workers are now owning significant 
sections of the means of production.
<P>
	There has also been a shift in sectoral development. Sectors 
that were once the driving force of our economy are no longer as 
important as they once were. Auto, steel, petroleum and housing 
industries are still important. We still need them but they have 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7715"> 7715 </A></B>
<P>
been replaced as significant sectors by semiconductors and 
computers.
<P>
	Health and medicare, communications and 
telecommunications and instrumentations are the new sectors 
that drive the economy. They are the new engines of today's 
economy. Today Canada's electronic industry is larger than its 
pulp and paper industry.
<P>
	The computer service industry in Canada employs more 
people than the auto industry. More people in British Columbia 
work in communications and in telecommunications than in the 
entire forest industry. More people in Ontario are employed in 
business services than in the construction industry.
<P>
	More Quebecois work in health and medical care than in 
construction, textiles, clothing, furniture, auto, forest and 
mining industries combined. We are in the midst of significant 
industrial changes and whether by sheer will or by 
circumstance, we are making the transition from the old 
economy to the new and small business is the key.
<P>
	Why is it necessary to take care of small business? Knowledge 
workers are the ones who will establish small businesses. Small 
businesses will provide the flexibility for knowledge workers to 
develop their ideas.
<P>
	Adaptation to the new economy will require change. Small 
businesses are much more likely to change than are large ones. 
Why? There are fewer people involved. There are not as many 
interrelated parts. Co-ordination and planning are much easier. 
Learning can take part at one's own speed rather than having to 
wait for someone else to catch up.
<P>
	Change can be much faster. The concept stage to the idea 
stage to the planning stage to the implementation stage can 
happen with one person. There is no board of directors to 
persuade. There is no senior manager to convince. There is no 
petty company politics and there are no petty jealousies. Change 
is easier and faster.
<P>
	The rate of change will become a major factor in order to 
maintain our competitive advantage if that is the situation in the 
future and it will be. The small business person also owns the 
knowledge. Take for instance a software company and the means 
of production, the computer.
<P>
	The farmer knows how to farm. He owns the land and the 
machines. The small businessman needs money to get 
established in the first place and then to do the operation that is 
necessary in terms of hiring the right people and in building the 
buildings that are necessary in a manufacturing operation. They 
need money for expansion.
<P>
	There are some serious difficulties with access to capital. One 
of these is excessive taxation both in terms of payroll taxes and 
in particular capital gains taxes. Financial institutions, 
especially banks, stand in the way because they are so large and 
slow to change.
<P>
	Remember, one of the big things we are going to have to do is 
change quickly and to do so successfully. They are often 
untrained in personnel and not knowledgeable about the 
knowledge based industries. There are some notable exceptions 
but by and large they understand only hard assets. They do not 
know how to value what is between the specialist's ears.
<P>
	Concentration of financial powers in the banking community 
in particular is also a resister, a very serious one. In Canada we 
have eliminated the four financial pillars. We used to have 
banks, trust companies, insurance companies, brokerage or 
investment dealers, four distinct financial pillars. Banks now 
function in all four areas. It has reduced competition among 
these sectors. It has reduced the efficiency because the size 
problem makes change difficult and slow.
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	Of even more significance is that because of their 
concentration these institutions now determine policy, a policy 
that is first of all in their best interest and not necessarily in the 
interest of the general public. Governments are unduly 
influenced by that. It is a very serious consideration that has to 
be examined.
<P>
	The report does not deal with this thing but it is one thing that 
is very significant and the omission should be recognized. It is 
really significant that we look at some of the key 
recommendations now and how they will tie in and help small 
businesses and clear the way for them to do the things that have 
to be done.
<P>
	I would like to pay particular attention here to the community 
based venture capital companies that exist in some areas. There 
are a number of people who had advocated these. Larry Zepf is 
the chairman of Canada's technology triangle alliance, 
Kitchener-Waterloo, Guelph and Cambridge. This is a pilot 
project that looks like it is going to do a lot of good things in 
getting venture capital going. Mr. Doyle cited Austin, Texas, as 
a good example of how local venture capital companies can 
work.
<P>
	In that city which is about the same size as Ottawa technology 
jobs since 1981 increased from 10,000 to 30,000, a 300 per cent 
increase since 1981. During that same period in Ottawa the 
number of technology workers increased from 22,000 to 25,000, 
a 13.6 per cent increase. That is all. Who is running the show 
here? Who is at the leading edge?
<P>
	There are some interesting things happening in Quebec. Let 
me quote the senior executive vice-president of the national 
bank: ``With regard to start-up capital the route we prefer is to 
channel our resources through the many regional or sectorial 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7716"> 7716 </A></B>
<P>
risk capital corporations that exist in Quebec''. We would do 
well to listen to these community establishments.
<P>
	Gordon Sharwood, referring to a study by the Canadian 
Chamber of Commerce, states community investment banks to 
assist local entrepreneurs to assess risk and capital and apply 
that capital are the things that we should be advocating in the 
future.
<P>
	Another recommendation that comes out of the report has to 
do with the reporting of statistics to make sure that we get a 
reflection of how well the banks are serving the needs of the 
small business person. The new statistics should be reported 
quarterly and indicate the size, type of loan, the nature of the 
borrower, including gender and employment, the number of 
people in the business, their sales volume, major sector of 
operation and so on. One or more of these banks should report 
quarterly to the industry committee.
<P>
	Another key recommendation is code of conduct. I do not 
know whether we have ever had of such a thing as a code of 
conduct for the banks. They tell us that they have one. When it 
comes to calling them to account, we wonder where that code of 
conduct went. The recommendation says clearly that a code of 
conduct shall be developed and that there should be an 
independent, self-financing position of ombudsman to make 
sure that the banks do live up to the code of conduct that has been 
set.
<P>
	In order for Canadians, business workers, citizens, all of us, to 
receive the maximum benefit from the present economy and to 
be prepared for the new economy we will require a new attitude 
for government. First, the government should get out of the way 
of entrepreneurs; second, set clear guidelines that establish 
level playing fields for every one; and, third, prevent the 
concentration of power by preventing the establishment of huge 
combines and abuses of trust.
<P>
	Another is the development of a new culture and attitude on 
the part of each Canadian saying that government does 
government and business does business. Neither one should try 
to do what the other one should be doing.
<P>
<B>(1310) </B>
<P>
	Specifically I would suggest that the role of government is to 
establish and maintain a culture that rewards entrepreneurship, 
innovation and research, and ensures a level, competitive and 
honest marketplace. To do so it should emphasize achieving first 
an attitude of spending by government that does not exceed 
revenues and results in a balanced budget over a three-year 
period beginning now; second, less interference in the 
marketplace by getting out of business; third, by repositioning 
and renewing government resources to maximize efficiency at 
reduced costs; and, fourth, a commitment to no further tax 
increases for Canadians.
<P>
	We also need a new relationship among businesses, business 
networking where businesses learn to work together in new 
ways to help one another while maintaining a competitive edge 
and a co-operation among businesses to help assess risk in terms 
of getting new capital and negotiating interest rates with banks 
and other financial institutions. This report is called taking care 
of small business. The truth is small business is creativity. Small 
business is ideas and if government gets out of the way small 
business will take care of itself and us. I urge the minister to act 
immediately to implement the recommendations in the report.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a short question for the 
member for Okanagan Centre.
<P>
	Sitting on that committee with him over the last nine months 
was a real privilege. The member provided great insight and was 
passionate in his concern for small and medium sized business. 
He in large measure was one of the reasons why we virtually 
presented a unanimous report to the House. It is something the 
people of Canada really wanted, the first ever challenge to the 
banks of Canada coming forward in a unified way.
<P>
	My question to the member is one of clarification. Members 
of the Reform Party say they do not want the government to 
interfere in business or to get involved in business. Many of the 
recommendations in the report would mean that we would have 
to reopen the Bank Act and would in effect mean that we as 
legislators were giving new direction to the financial 
institutions. Surely the member is not advocating that we walk 
away from giving that kind of advice to banks.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Schmidt:</B> Mr. Speaker, I really appreciate the kind 
comments from the parliamentary secretary. I guess this 
becomes a mutual admiration society at certain stages because it 
was pleasant working together.
<P>
	With regard to the involvement of government in business, 
the key point is that government should not do business but 
should provide the kind of leadership and parameters within 
which businesses can operate and where they can be in 
competition with other businesses so that the marketplace can 
operate and costs can be reduced and that all of us will benefit.
<P>
	It seems to me that money left in the hands of the 
entrepreneur, the individual Canadian citizen, will be far more 
effectively spent than $1 put in the hands of a politician. It is in 
that sense that we make the point.
<P>
	Business people are far more effective in making business 
decisions than government is about making business decisions. 
Government should provide the legislation, a level playing field 
that allows the business person to operate. That becomes the key 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7717"> 7717 </A></B>
<P>
and I am sure the hon. parliamentary secretary recognizes that is 
an appropriate role for government and business. They should 
not be mixed up like this. They should be separate.
<P>
<B>(1315 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I also was 
very happy to have worked on this committee with my hon. 
colleague. Could he clarify for me one comment in his very good 
and very well presented speech? He talked about his concerns 
with concentration in our economy. Since we focused a lot of our 
time on the banking sector I am assuming that is one of the 
specific areas of our economy to which he is referring.
<P>
	As we know, a high concentration of chartered banks basically 
control the banking sector. Has he some specific proposals 
regarding how to break the banks down into smaller units? What 
are his ideas?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Schmidt:</B> Mr. Speaker, the question is an extremely 
cogent one and one that will require more study than I am 
prepared to give it in the next two or three minutes. The fact 
remains that the elimination of the four pillars that I mentioned 
in my speech where we had a separate and distinct function for 
trust companies, for insurance companies, for investment 
dealers and for banks was a useful distinction.
<P>
	Now that the banks are doing all of these things we have this 
concentration of power. Somehow there has to be either more 
competition outside the banking field so this can happen, or the 
whole idea of concentration within the banks needs to be 
re-examined. I would suggest the Bank Act has to be reopened, 
as would certain other legislation. It would be a very useful 
exercise for the House to get involved in that type of activity.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very excited about 
participating in the debate. It is something I felt very strongly 
about in opposition, as did the whole party.
<P>
	As most Canadians will remember, the Prime Minister made a 
commitment even before the red book was published. During the 
last election campaign he made a commitment in the press 
gallery across the street that his would be a government that for 
the first time ever would challenge the financial institutions in 
the country to become much more sensitive to the small 
businessmen and women who are employing right now close to 
80 per cent of the nation's workforce.
<P>
	I put a little emphasis on women because it is not just the 
language that is changing. The facts are also changing by the 
contribution that women are making in terms of owner operated 
small businesses today, not just in our economy but throughout 
North America.
<P>
	I was reading not too long ago in <I>Fortune</I> magazine that 
women owned or operated businesses in the United States 
employed more Americans than all the Fortune 500 companies 
combined. That thrust of women participating in the 
entrepreneurial sector, the small business sector of our 
economy, is no less a dominant factor in Canada. It is very 
important that all of us recognize that, especially the banks of 
Canada.
<P>
	After we were elected the first order of business with the 
industry committee is living up to that commitment. I must 
compliment the members of the opposition, the member for 
Trois-Rivières, and the earlier mentioned member for 
Okanagan Centre from the Reform Party. Without the unified 
spirit and desire to really make this committee work, I do not 
believe we would have the report we have before us today.
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, you have been around here for a long time. I have 
not been around as long as you have, but I do know for a fact it is 
very rare that a committee report has such a unanimous spirit 
about it.
<P>
	A second very rare thing is that there are no copies of the 
report left. We had to order a reprint. It shows the keen interest 
that all members of Parliament have in looking out for the small 
businessmen and women in every constituency across the 
country. We have all said repeatedly that the small business 
community represents the greatest hope for putting Canadians 
back to work.
<P>
	Last week was our recess week and I had the privilege of 
having lunch with a former parliamentarian, a former minister 
of the crown, Paul Hellyer. He has just finished publishing a 
book entitled <I>Funny Money</I>, a common sense alternative to 
mainline economics. As I read the book on the weekend I 
noticed there is just one page of his description of the attitude of 
banks toward small business. For the benefit of the House I 
would like to read a short excerpt from the book <I>Funny Money</I> 
by Paul Hellyer.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Nothing irritates me quite as fast as a bank spokesperson saying, in response 
to the suggestion that they make more money available to small business, ``We 
have to act as guardians of our depositors' money.'' Such fatuous 
double-speak! What they are really saying is that we, and we alone, will decide 
for whom we will create loans and we prefer governments, brokers and big 
business because that way we can make more money for less work. If they were 
only concerned about the safety of existing deposits they would have been less 
cavalier in making loans to Third World governments, large real estate 
developers and the leveraged-buyout monopoly players. It was the banks' 
greed, rather than their prudence as guardians of their depositors' money, 
which ruled the day.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If the whole idea of creating new money is to facilitate the creation of new wealth in 
the form of increased output, then the entire addition to the money stock should be 
directed to that purpose. In effect new loans should be made for either investment or 
consumption because they are the two sides of the same coin! I cannot remember a 
market for anything that some enterprising entrepreneur didn't try to capitalize on. But 
if, as in the Great Depression and in one or two recent recessions, existing  capacity </BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7718"> 7718 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>exceeds demand, entrepreneurs are unlikely to line up for loans to create additional 
redundant capacity. So consumption, which creates income and savings for others, and 
investment are Siamese twins which cannot be separated.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It is the small businesses, which create the most jobs and increased output, 
that have the most difficulty getting bank financing. In the Spring of 1994, 
Helen Sinclair, president of the Canadian Bankers Association, cited one of the 
best known excuses. She admitted that banks have a problem in their 
relationship with small business but defended their caution by pointing out that 
federal government statistics show 50 percent of all small businesses don't 
make it past their fifth birthday. That may be so but an equally interesting and 
important statistic would be the percentage which failed because their bank 
took away the safety net just as they jumped off the highwire. As I mentioned 
earlier, I have never known an entrepreneur, myself included, whose bank 
didn't try to put them out of business at one stage or another of their 
development. It would be in the country's interest if a certain proportion of new 
loans had to be made to small business with limited or no collateral where the 
investors, as a condition, were willing to risk their own savings. Character 
assessment might be part of the consideration. It is one which appears to have 
been pretty well disregarded in recent decades.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Having considered that, the bank should be prepared to lose and write off 
some proportion of the small loans each year. It should satisfy their irresistible 
urge to gamble if they were to gamble on people who want to build real 
products and provide real services for a change.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1325) </B>
<P>
	I recommend the book that Mr. Hellyer put together. It is 
extremely appropriate when we are debating the 
recommendations of this report.
<P>
	The report in question is a very significant signal from the 
government, and supported by the opposition parties. Less than 
a month after it was tabled, we are having an all day debate on it. 
We realize it is a non-votable motion but it is very important 
because it is the Prime Minister, the cabinet, the government 
sending a signal that they are truly committed to the work that 
all members are doing in trying to get the small business 
community going.
<P>
	Therefore Canadians have to ask ourselves what is in the 
report that is going to change the attitude that banks will have 
toward small business. I would like to begin by sharing with the 
House and Canadians that starting with recommendation 
number one in the report the attitude of banks will change.
<P>
	The first recommendation is that the committee proposes to 
continue monitoring small businesses' access to capital by 
calling one or more banks as witnesses every quarter to review 
their performance in lending to small business.
<P>
	I can tell the House that never ever in our history have we had 
a committee complete a report and then institute a 
recommendation whereby a sitting standing committee of the 
House agrees that at every quarter it will continue to do the very 
work that it was doing in the first six months.
<P>
	What does it mean? It means that probably in February, 
because the report was tabled last month, the committee 
members will sit around and say: ``Okay, what three or four 
banks do you think we should invite first to come before the 
standing committee to talk about the new products, the new 
services and the performance that they have given to small and 
medium size business?''
<P>
	We are certainly not going to let them know in advance 
because obviously that would not be fair. What we will do is put 
them all on notice. There are many financial institutions in this 
country of course. Some might want to come right away. We 
cannot do that so we will randomly pull three or four and they 
will come before the committee and report. By reporting to us 
they are in fact reporting to all the people in Canada. At that time 
hopefully they will be proud of the accomplishment they have 
pulled off just since the report has been tabled.
<P>
	However, it does not stop there. The second recommendation 
in the report has to do with the reporting structure. Most 
Canadians do not realize it but the current situation for banks 
reporting to the Superintendent of Financial Institutions is very 
haphazard. In other words, one bank will classify a small 
business loan as anything under $500,000. Another bank will 
say a small business loan is anything under $1 million. Another 
one will say it is everything under $500,000 plus whatever 
mortgages it loans that small business.
<P>
	The point is there is no standardized reporting structure. It 
means we do not have a handle on exactly what is going on with 
the small business portfolios of all the financial institutions in 
Canada.
<P>
	I must say that recommendation number two is a very tough 
recommendation. I am sure that the banks will find it very 
frustrating to live up to this one. This is what it is. The 
committee recommends that the Superintendent of Financial 
Institutions, together with Statistics Canada and the Bank of 
Canada, develop a new format for the collection, compilation 
and publication of statistics on bank lending to small business.
<P>
<B>(1330 ) </B>
<P>
	These statistics should be based not only on the size and type 
of loan but also on the nature of the borrower, including gender, 
according to employment, sales, major sector of operations 
and-key word here-by municipality. These statistics should 
be reported quarterly. That seems self-explanatory but one 
might ask why by municipality is important. Many members of 
Parliament brought to our attention that they felt their 
municipalities were not being serviced by the banks.
<P>
	There might be a remote region of our country where lots of 
people are putting money on deposit but the bank might not be 
putting it back into the community. Recommendation number 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7719"> 7719 </A></B>
<P>
two will allow members of Parliament to call the superintendent 
of financial institutions and say that they want to look at the 
banking activity in the municipalities located in their ridings.
<P>
	If all of a sudden it is discovered that a bank is doing well with 
the loans it is putting back into the small business community in 
the riding, we can let the bank know it is doing a good job. If 
other banks are only taking out deposits and not putting anything 
into the municipality, we can also write nice letters asking: 
``What about our ridings? What about our municipality? The 
deposits you are taking out of here are pretty large. Why can you 
not put some back into the small business community?''
<P>
	I believe recommendation number two is going to have a 
profound effect. Everyone knows that the thing banks fear most, 
believe it or not, is not government regulation. The thing they 
fear most is competition. Banks cannot stand competition. 
Never mind the schedule III stuff, we will get to that, but just 
competition among themselves.
<P>
	If you put the scanner on banks in your municipality and you 
see that two or three of them are a way up there in their 
contributions but a couple of them are not doing anything, that 
does not look good to the depositors and the customers who 
provide their lifeblood and their viability.
<P>
	I am really confident that the recommendation which was 
unanimously accepted will go a long way in stimulating the 
small business community. There are many other 
recommendations in this report I would like to deal with.
<P>
	I would like to deal with the concern the industry critic, the 
Bloc member from Trois-Rivières, stated in his address. The 
member talked about his concern of this government's 
commitment to the Federal Business Development Bank which 
the committee recommended should be changed to the small 
business bank of Canada.
<P>
	None of us supported the condition that exists currently in the 
FBDB. Most of us believe that the Federal Business 
Development Bank needs to rethink its policy approach. It has to 
be much more contemporary. It should look at new instruments 
to get more financial support, not by going to the public treasury 
but possibly by looking at the issuance of preference shares 
which would not have an adverse effect on the treasury of 
Canada.
<P>
	However we believe that the small business bank of Canada, if 
we could rename it that, could act like a supercharger in terms of 
creating more interest in that field. In other words it would go 
back to bringing attention to what it was designed for. It was 
primarily designed to be there when the other financial 
institutions were not supporting small and medium sized 
businessmen and women.
<P>
<B>(1335 ) </B>
<P>
	We looked at one of the best banking systems in Canada, the 
Caisse populaire Desjardins. The people from Desjardins came 
before our committee. They have a fabulous system. We do not 
have such a system in Ontario but I wish we did. We are run by 
the paper pushing towers of Bay Street. That is the problem we 
have in Ontario. We do not have a Desjardins movement. Many 
of us thought that through redesigning and retrofitting the 
Federal Business Development Bank we could create a much 
more aggressive and grassroots approach to banking.
<P>
	Bloc members should not think this is part of a referendum 
strategy. It is a genuine approach to making sure that we have 
more instruments in getting access to capital for small business. 
I jokingly said to Bloc members that maybe we would set up a 
couple of hundred branches of the small business bank of 
Canada in Quebec to accelerate the federal presence in the 
province of Quebec. I was only kidding when I said that so the 
member should not think that is part of our design. We merely 
want to make sure that this bank becomes much more 
contemporary and much more aggressive in dealing with small 
businessmen and women.
<P>
	I will end my remarks by saying that the Prime Minister and 
the Minister of Industry have led the way for all of us in the 
House in making sure that small business becomes a front 
burner sector in terms of policy making. They have also made 
sure that this issue is put on the front burner in terms of 
implementing change in legislation quickly.
<P>
	I hope that the tone of today's debate can continue. The more 
constructive we are in making the recommended amendments 
that are needed to the Bank Act, the quicker we can get on with 
making sure we create that environment the member for 
Okanagan Centre described which will cause the entrepreneurial 
spirit to flourish once again in this country.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have a question for the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister 
of Industry. Concerning the name change from Federal Business 
Development Bank to Small Business Bank of Canada, I would 
say that the principle of helping small business may be 
worthwhile, but we consider that this would restrict the bank 
unduly. And quite frankly, we object to the expression ``of 
Canada'', which we consider inopportune and a bit too 
pre-referendum to our taste.
<P>
	I would like to ask the hon. member whether he believes that 
the report deals fairly, sufficiently and adequately with the 
concept of a new economy, considering that, as he will recall, 
the committee was seeking to limit the application of the act, 
while the opposition fought that notion and argued that any 
restriction should be imposed only after a cost-benefit analysis 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7720"> 7720 </A></B>
<P>
of the pros and cons? As regards the new  economy and the 
guarantees to be given to the lender which make the lender 
insecure, should we examine such issues? Does the hon. member 
believe that the committee has done anything for the 
advancement of science in that field so that the movers of the 
new economy will be better served?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Mr. Speaker, I realize 
that the member for Trois Rivières is talking about the Small 
Businesses Loans Act. We all agree that the Small Businesses 
Loans Act has done a terrific job. When in opposition many of us 
proposed amendments. I have to say that the Conservative 
government of the day, believe it or not, listened to some of our 
amendments and the Small Businesses Loans Act is working 
right now.
<P>
<B>(1340) </B>
<P>
	The problem of course is with the government float of $4 
billion put on that Small Businesses Loans Act. Right now it 
seems the float program has been so successful that the float is 
tapped. Therefore the member from the Bloc is asking whether 
or not I would recommend that we expand the float. This 
decision of course is ultimately the responsibility of the 
Minister of Finance.
<P>
	I say to members opposite that I do not share the pessimism on 
the loan loss on the Small Businesses Loans Act. I think the loan 
loss will be much lower than the pessimists predict. The 
pessimists predict it is going to cost the treasury about $100 
million. I do not share that pessimism. The economy is coming 
back. No doubt there will be some loan loss but I think it will be 
considerably lower. Of course that spin about the loan loss 
provision is causing people to get nervous about the float. In 
fairness the committee said that we would look at it in the next 
60 to 90 days.
<P>
	A far more aggressive thing for us to do is to make sure that 
the banks start picking up some of that slack in the small 
business area which the Small Businesses Loans Act picked up 
over the last year and a half. In other words now that the banks 
realize the Small Businesses Loans Act did its job and they have 
had time to rethink they can pick up the slack. As the member for 
Spadina has often mentioned in committee and in the House, and 
Mr. Hellyer supports his view, we should give some specific 
targets for loans to small business. If we started pushing the idea 
that a percentage of the portfolio in the banks should go toward 
small business then maybe we would not need to augment the 
float under the Small Businesses Loans Act.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I read with great interest the industry committee's 
report on small business. In my view there is one very glaring 
omission and that is the tax base on small business and 
businesses at large. I wonder if the member for 
Broadview-Greenwood would care to spend a few minutes 
talking about what could be done to encourage business through 
the tax base.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Mr. Speaker, that of 
course is a glaring omission in the report. There should have 
been some recommendation as to how this government should 
look at tax reform for small business but that was not our 
mandate.
<P>
	I am confident that over the next 60 days this House of 
Commons will look at comprehensive tax reform in a very 
serious way. We are all getting signals that defending the status 
quo is no longer the right option or the right path to take.
<P>
	The Reform opposition has the view which I happen to share 
that it is time the country had a single tax system, 20 per cent 
across the board. Small business would not pay anything on the 
first $50,000 which would go to reduce paper burden and a lot of 
other things.
<P>
	I hope we can have that debate because I think the whole 
country is ready for it. However that was not the mandate of the 
committee, but stand by.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, BQ): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to speak to government motion No. 16 on the 
Second Report of the Standing Committee on Industry, for two 
important reasons.
<P>
	Primarily, first of all, there is regional development. There is 
all the energy, efforts and action with respect to regional 
development in Quebec, and I am speaking about true regional 
development that will reach all the administrative regions in 
Quebec, not just the major centres or the large cities, but the 
furthest reaches of all administrative regions.
<P>
	This is an exercise that has been going on in Quebec since 
1984. It is a major exercise in defining regional development in 
the regions, and a series of framework agreements are now being 
signed, region by region, with respect to economic 
development.
<P>
	I would simply like to tell my government colleagues across 
the way that regional development is Quebec's business and that 
it is in order to avoid duplication, in order to increase the 
efficiency of actions and investments in regional development 
that all the members of the Bloc Quebecois, the official 
opposition, are simply asking that the federal government 
withdraw from regional development in Quebec.
<P>
	``The Bloc Québécois Members of Parliament on the Standing 
Committee on Industry are of the opinion that the Government 
of Quebec is in the best position to recognize the financing 
requirements of SMEs, and to develop and implement 
programs''. So reads the first sentence in the dissenting report 
by the Bloc Quebecois members of Parliament on the Standing 
Committee on Industry, of which I am a member, studying 
access to financing for SMEs.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7721"> 7721 </A></B>
<P>
	I therefore propose to take this opportunity to speak to 
government motion No. 16 in order to broaden the debate and 
thus express the dissent of the Bloc Quebecois, which continues 
and which is linked to the federal government's overall 
approach to regional development in Quebec.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois is opposed to the interference of the 
federal government in regional development for two very 
specific reasons. First, because the federal government, instead 
of eliminating regional disparities, only made them worse, 
while precipitating the disintegration of peripheral regions, as 
its action was limited to central regions.
<P>
	Let us be quite clear. I mentioned earlier that regional 
development in Quebec concerned all remote areas, and not 
central ones such as major cities. One master agreement after 
another is being signed with the Quebec government respecting 
the economic development of all areas. But such federal 
initiative has traditionally been limited to major urban centers 
and has literally caused the disintegration of peripheral regions, 
that is to say those regions outside of major urban centers.
<P>
	Second, federal government initiatives within Quebec has 
been synonymous with the duplication of organizations. And my 
hon. colleagues know it full well. We all know of overlapping 
responsibilities and instances of horizontal and vertical 
duplication. They have been identified and the government even 
indicated it was prepared to eliminate this overlap and 
duplication in public administrations which are basically 
mismanaged since public funds are being squandered over 
various structures that serve essentially the same function. In 
time, this adds up, as we have seen, to billions of dollars and we 
end up today with a major deficit in the federal budget.
<P>
	As for the disintegration of peripheral regions, I want to make 
something quite clear to our colleagues opposite. Since 1974, 
with the Liberals in power at the federal level, regional 
development was generally funded under federal-provincial 
agreements to which subsidiary agreements were added, as you 
know.
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
	All these agreements covering the decade from 1974 to 1984 
-these were 10-year contracts- totalled $1.8 billion, 26 per 
cent of which was earmarked for the greater Montreal region and 
4 per cent for Quebec City. This means that 30 per cent of the 
total budget for this first set of so-called regional development 
agreements went to central regions. This first Canada-Quebec 
umbrella agreement for 1974-84 followed on the 1970 report by 
Higgins, Martin and Rénaud, which had been ordered in 1969, as 
you will surely recall, by the federal Department of Regional 
Economic Expansion, DREE, for the purpose of directing the 
federal government's activities for economic development in 
Quebec. So it meant a doubling of federal involvement in 
economic development in Quebec.
<P>
	This report concluded that Quebec's economic weakness was 
due to the weakness of its only major centre, Montreal. As a 
result, the federal government's active involvement in Quebec 
in the 1970s set the tone for its approach to Quebec and did 
considerable harm to the Quebec government's regional 
development policies. The federal government sees a whole 
region or province as the focus of its regional development 
efforts. The federal government does not consider the 
geographic and demographic regions that make up a province.
<P>
	From 1972 to 1984, regional development focused on certain 
growth centres. That was the approach. The way to a better 
distribution of wealth involved industrial solutions 
concentrated in urban areas. The policies adopted were 
disastrous for the outlying regions since the urban centres went a 
different way and it aggravated the rural crisis by draining 
workers, resources and capital.
<P>
	I will explain the prime example which concerns the 
allocation of the budget and the corrective action that can be 
taken.
<P>
	A second umbrella agreement was signed in 1984, in effect 
extending the first one for ten years. Knowing full well that 
outlying regions are breaking down, they renewed a $1.7 billion 
agreement for this period, allocating 36 per cent of the budget to 
Greater Montreal and 10 per cent to Quebec City. Between 1984 
and 1994, the federal government increased its involvement in 
central regions to the detriment of outlying regions.
<P>
	On the subject of regional development, it is important to 
respect the extraordinary dynamics between small and 
medium-sized businesses, municipalities and all stakeholders 
in the areas of education and health to organize a region in such a 
way as to prevent an exodus of our young people. This 
situation-the exodus of our young people and the aging of our 
population-is one that the hon. member is experiencing in his 
own region and that is also being experienced in other regions of 
Canada.
<P>
	The subsidiary agreements that make up this second 
Canada-Quebec agreement, such as the regional and economic 
development agreement signed in 1988, confirm the existing 
structural inequalities. Businesses are allowed to set up shop in 
and develop central regions where they will find a concentration 
of people, a market. For some businesses, it is better to be based 
in a densely-populated area with a market of 2 million people 
than to move to an outlying region.
<P>
	As we are fully aware, small and medium-sized businesses 
have different distribution systems for their products. Exporting 
businesses, in particular, can be based outside major centres, 
since they can ship their exports by road or other types of 
transportation allowing them to set up shop elsewhere.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="7722"> 7722 </A></B>
<P>
	Quebec regions are in an advanced state of disintegration. The 
demographic weakening of outlying regions is symptomatic of 
the state of degradation in several regions. The population of 
outlying regions continues to decline dramatically, especially in 
rural areas, thus compromising the settlement and viability of 
these regions. You are aware that people in every region fight to 
keep plants, small businesses, schools and even whole villages 
from closing.
<P>
<B>(1355) </B>
<P>
	This legislation tabled by the new Liberal government to 
establish the Department of Industry is patterned on the 
centralizing principle which has always prevailed within that 
party, in that it provides the same rigid and heavily centralized 
structures, as well as national standards for the whole territory.
<P>
	We will still have an across-the-board policy applying to all 
of the very large Canadian territory, regardless of the particular 
situation in the various regions.
<P>
	Take a look at how program services and business services are 
split within the regional operations branch of the department. It 
says very clearly-and the member who tabled this motion 
should listen-in the development program of the Department 
of Industry, under the heading ``Regional Offices'', that: ``This 
component establishes a general framework designed to 
promote excellence and competitiveness in every region of the 
country. Regional offices participate in the development of 
policies designed to promote the fulfilment of national 
objectives''. We are back to square one, because these are 
precisely the national objectives which ruined remote regions in 
Quebec.
<P>
	By integrating the federal offices of regional development 
and transforming them into service centres for Canadian 
businesses, the Liberal government creates a single window to 
provide information on federal, provincial and municipal 
programs and services in Quebec, with the objective of-

	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
today marks the final day for which a court appeal can be 
launched against the Goat's Eye project at Sunshine Village ski 
resort. This project was approved in 1992 subject to 
endorsement by the Environment Assessment Review Panel, 
which was given.
<P>
	In September 1993 Parks Canada and Sunshine executed a 
construction project agreement and a $100,000 bond was issued 
by Sunshine Village. In November a court injunction was sought 
by outside environmental groups to prevent further 
development. In January 1994 the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage halted development at Sunshine and requested the 
project be referred to a FEARO panel.
<P>
	Sunshine Village then launched Federal Court action to 
enforce its contractual rights with Parks Canada. On October 13, 
1994, the Federal Court of Canada ruled in favour of Sunshine 
Village, given that the environmental assessment provided for 
sensitive management of the ecosystem during construction.
<P>
	On behalf of all Canadians who in good faith conduct 
legitimate business with the Government of Canada, I urge the 
Minister of Canadian Heritage not to launch an appeal against 
the Federal Court of Canada's earlier decision.

	<B>Mr. John Richardson (Perth-Wellington-Waterloo,

<P>
	I wonder if all members of the House are aware of what BST is 
and the effect it has on dairy cows. BST is a hormone that is 
injected into cows at regular intervals to increase their milk 
production. Normal dairy cows remain in full production for 
seven to nine years. However, BST injected cows have to be 
taken out of production after only two years. In addition, these 
animals are covered with red sores and in the end there is 
nothing left but skin and bones.
<P>
	I share the concerns of dairy farmers in my riding who oppose 
artificial stimulation of cows and the resulting emaciation of 
these animals that is caused by the repeated injection of BST.
<P>
	I call on all members of this House to encourage discussion on 
this issue. Milk is a natural, pure food and I believe that this

traditionally nations have defined security by the size of their

government will adopt a broader definition of national and 
international security, encompassing such goals as sustainable 
development, global economic prosperity, capable defence and 
the eradication of poverty and social inequality''.
<P>
	What this resolution is truly about is the need for Canada to 
look at the evolution of its security needs. Less and less we see 
the armed forces as a military combatant. More and more the 
armed forces must be viewed as a useful resource in times of 
public emergency, disaster and participation in international 
peacekeeping efforts.

	The United Nations Security Council has stated that while the 
instability of the cold war is over, the non-military sources of 
instability, economic, social and humanitarian have become 
greater threats to peace and security.

Canada, for Newfoundland, particularly for the Burin Peninsula,

Newfoundland fishermen secure access for at least 10 years to

at a very difficult time, given the disastrous unemployment rate 
and the loss of the Hibernia work recently. It is not the answer to 
every woe, but it does put an end to a long festering conflict 
between the two countries and does mark the beginning of an era 
of co-operation between France and Canada on fisheries as well

the river's shores, environment and inhabitants in an easy to 
understand presentation.
<P>
	These atlas pages deal particularly with the St. Lawrence at 
the heart of the inhabited area (population and shore 
occupation), its many and varied habitats (saline and freshwater 
ecosystems) as well as the shapes and dynamics of the St. 
Lawrence shores from soft embankments to scarped shorelines. 
These pages were presented at the 29th congress of the science 
teachers' association of Quebec, held from October 13 to 15 in 
Montreal.

	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, last week, the Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs received a proposal from the new government of Quebec 
that improved last July's agreement in principle for maintaining 
the military college in Saint-Jean.
<P>
	The minister rejected Quebec's offer of a major financial 
contribution out of hand, on the pretext that it was provincial 
interference in federal jurisdiction. The cat is finally out of the 
bag, since according to the minister, the purpose, as Ottawa now 
admits, is to demilitarize the college in Saint-Jean.
<P>
	How can the minister have the nerve to claim that the Quebec 
government is responsible for closing the military college in 
Saint-Jean when it was his government, in its first budget, 
which decided to close it?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy 
Council for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
and Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, to answer the Leader of the Opposition in the same 
<P>
terms, how can he have the nerve to ask us who is closing the 
college, when we have had an agreement since mid-July 
ensuring the survival of the  college in Saint-Jean, but which the 
Government of Quebec does not want to implement? The 
Government of Quebec refuses to implement an agreement 
signed by the former government and it is the Government of 
Quebec which must bear the blame for closing it if it is closed.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, let us return to the facts. The college in Saint-Jean 
is a military college; the government decided to close the 
military college and make it into a shell of a college, a sort of 
language school.
<P>
	In light of the rejection of Quebec's proposal, I ask the 
minister if we are to understand that the decision to close the 
military college in Saint-Jean is not budgetary, as claimed, but 
rather political; is it not based on the desire to exclude Quebec 
and its institutions from the training of French speaking officers 
in the Canadian Forces?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy 
Council for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
and Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, what the Leader of the Opposition is insinuating is 
entirely incorrect. Under the agreement signed on July 19, there 
would still be 100 officer cadets in Saint-Jean, as well as a 
language course. Yes, military training has been concentrated in 
Kingston because as the army downsizes, we no longer need 
three military colleges; one is enough.
<P>
	The reason the Quebec government wants to keep military 
courses in Saint-Jean, as Louise Beaudoin indicated, is that it 
wants to prepare to have its own army for when Quebec is 
independent.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, this does not show much consideration for all the 
generations of French-speaking officers who were brilliantly 
trained in Saint-Jean, had a great military career and are now 
being told that officers can no longer be trained in Quebec 
because it is a separatist province.
<P>
	I ask the minister if, in his letter of November 9 to his Quebec 
counterpart, he suggested that only the military college in 
Kingston is able to promote ``the values appropriate to the 
Canadian Armed Forces''. How, except for the fact that it is in 
Quebec, is the military college in Saint-Jean unable to meet the 
requirements of the Canadian forces?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy 
Council for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
and Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the college in Saint-Jean has had a great and 
illustrious career. Even though more than 75 per cent of French 
speaking officers in the armed forces were trained outside 
Saint-Jean, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7727"> 7727 </A></B>
<P>
there is no doubt that the college in Saint-Jean played an 
extremely useful role in training French speaking officers.
<P>
	But it so happens that the size of the armed forces is being 
reduced considerably. We only need to educate about 200 cadets 
a year and we will educate them and give them just as good an 
education as they would get in Saint-Jean in the military college 
in Kingston, where Canadian forces personnel will be brought 
together to be educated.
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	We no longer need three colleges; we need only one and that is 
just what we will do in Kingston.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in a 
last-ditch effort to save the college in Saint-Jean, the Quebec 
government offered $8 million a year, enough for this institution 
to run properly, while meeting the federal government's 
cost-cutting targets. The Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
rejected this offer from Quebec out of hand.
<P>
	Can the minister of Canadian intergovernmental affairs tell us 
if the federal government seriously analyzed the budgetary 
impact of the Quebec government's offer to spend $8 million a 
year to run the college in Saint-Jean before it hurriedly rejected 
it?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy 
Council for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
and Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): 
</B>Mr. Speaker, the future of the college in Saint-Jean has been 
studied for months, at least since last year's budget. The former 
government of Quebec and the federal government arrived at a 
solution that would allow the college in Saint-Jean to remain 
open with a military presence. That is the agreement that we 
came to and that we want to maintain.
<P>
	It is no longer possible to use the college in Saint-Jean for 
military training, simply because there are not enough military 
students in Canada. The college in Kingston will provide a 
bilingual education to all military students in Canada. We only 
need one college and the officers to be trained in Kingston will 
undoubtedly receive an education as good as that previously 
provided at the college in Saint-Jean.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, by 
referring to last year's studies, the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs just confirmed that the government 
did not even bother to review the budgetary impact of the 
Quebec government's proposal, and that is serious.
<P>
	How can this minister state that Quebec's proposal does not 
take into account the federal government's budget requirements, 
when transferring military training from Saint-Jean to Kingston 
involves major additional expenditures for building facilities 
that already exist at the college in Saint-Jean?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy 
Council for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
and Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the Government of Canada estimates that it will 
save about $23 million a year-and not $8 million-by closing 
the military college in Saint-Jean and that transferring the 
Saint-Jean students represents only a fraction of the money we 
will save in the long run.
<P>
	There is no doubt that, as far as the Canadian Forces and 
Canadian military training are concerned, concentrating our 
military training in Kingston is a better solution. We also 
offered Quebec $25 million over five years so that the college in 
Saint-Jean could remain open. That is the acceptable solution, 
one that will allow the college in Saint-Jean to remain open, and 
that we want the Quebec government to honour because it signed 
an agreement to that effect.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="IMMIGRATIONANDREFUGEEBOARD">IMMIGRATION AND REFUGEE BOARD</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
immigration minister released confidential names and 
testimony to his embattled appointee to the IRB, Michael 
Schelew. These were names of people who had accused Schelew 
of intimidation and wrongdoing but gave testimony under the 
promise of confidentiality.
<P>
	My office consulted with the privacy commission and was 
told that the minister's actions are grounds for a complaint 
under the Privacy Act. The minister released to someone 
accused of intimidation the names of his accusers before any 
discovery was made.
<P>
	How can the minister of immigration possibly justify this 
gross contravention of the Privacy Act?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, throughout the process I took 
great care in terms of not releasing or disclosing those names. 
Once the chair made her report available to me, my counsel 
wrote a letter to the deputy chair asking for his response to that 
report and the appropriateness of the recommendation.
<P>
	It was then on the advice of the justice department that those 
names be disclosed to the deputy chair's counsel so that 
individual may respond in kind.
<P>
<B>(1425) </B>
<P>
	At the same time the IRB was advised of that and 
subsequently advised those individuals. It was on the advice of 
the justice department. The justice lawyer communicated those 
names to the counsel for the deputy chair. Our officials have also 
been in touch with the same privacy commissioner.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7728"> 7728 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
find it remarkable that an investigation could go on in this 
fashion and yet there be influence against a witness who may 
pose as a potential witness in a future investigation or a court 
hearing.
<P>
	This weekend Schelew called two of the people and actually 
went to the home of another person who had filed complaints 
against them, like an accused calling on the victims for a little 
chat before a trial.
<P>
	The minister has repeatedly said that the IRB is at arm's 
length and that he does not have any influence over it. Will the 
minister admit that he has exercised influence by improperly 
releasing confidential information in an attempt to bolster the 
defence of appointee Michael Schelew?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I reject that completely out of 
hand. I repeat for the hon. member that the names were disclosed 
to the counsel of Mr. Schelew on the advice of the justice 
department in response to my request for the deputy chair to 
respond to the report of the chair and the appropriateness of the 
recommendation and that the IRB members in question were 
advised immediately by the IRB.
<P>
	Second, with respect to the report made by the chair to me, I 
take that report as well as the response by the deputy chair very 
seriously. I also say to the member that it is very extensive, 
particularly the report. My office received the response late 
Thursday. I had a chance to look at it for the very first time only 
on late Friday evening. We are taking the matter very seriously 
and I would suspect that the member would not want me to 
speculate until a decision has been rendered which will be done 
in the right way.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
this minister clearly thinks he is above the law. The minister has 
not violated-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I would ask the hon. member to put his 
question, please.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hanger:</B> Mr. Speaker, the minister has not only violated 
the Privacy Act but also basic justice. We are talking about an 
investigation here and witnesses.
<P>
	As a former police officer if I were to release information to 
an accused in a crime of those people who were accusing me or 
an individual before any charges were laid that would cost me 
my job and probably there would be criminal charges against 
me.
<P>
	Recently in Ontario two ministers-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I would ask the hon. member to put his question 
now, please.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hanger:</B> Mr. Speaker, will this minister admit that he has 
made a gross and inexcusable violation similar to those 
ministers in Ontario who had to resign and consider doing the 
same?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I ask the member to put the 
entire situation in proper context.
<P>
	I first received five names from a media outlet. Upon 
receiving those names I wrote the chair of the board to have her 
look into the allegations made by these five individuals. In my 
letter to her I explicitly left out the names. I phoned her and 
verbalized the names. She did the same in her report.
<P>
	Subsequent to that I asked through my counsel at justice that 
the deputy chair be seized with the chair's report and respond to 
the appropriateness of the recommendation. Following that the 
counsel to the deputy chair asked the counsel at the Department 
of Justice for the names in order that that individual may defend 
himself.
<P>
<B>(1430 ) </B>
<P>
	Only after advice from the Department of Justice was the 
advice that we had to give those names to the lawyer of the 
deputy chair. Nothing has been compromised. No one is above 
the law. This minister and this government have followed the 
process flawlessly.

	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs.
<P>
	Team Canada's trip to China gradually became a political 
show where investments totalling billions of dollars are 
announced when, in fact, these figures are arrived at by adding 
contracts signed a long time ago with mere letters of intent 
regarding eventual contracts, as in the case of the CANDU 
reactors. In fact, the communique released in Beijing by the 
Canadian government states that the federal government is not 
responsible for the accuracy of information relating to 
investments or to the value of contracts.
<P>
	Will the Minister of Foreign Affairs admit that the Team 
Canada mission is essentially a political show, since most of the 
contracts announced are either only letters  of intent or were 
known long before that trip, and that the government itself 
refuses to endorse the figures released?
<P>
	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, our political opponents are obviously very bitter 
following the extraordinary success of the mission led by the 
Prime Minister.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7729"> 7729 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ouellet:</B> I am aware of the bitter reaction of minister 
Landry and I am disappointed to see the opposition member 
adopt the same attitude. The fact is that Team Canada, which is 
led by the Prime Minister and includes nine premiers as well as 
some 300 business people, made an extremely successful trip to 
China which is unprecedented. Chancellor Kohl made a visit 
which resulted in contracts totalling some four billion dollars 
for Germany; a trip by the US trade representative, Mr. Brown, 
resulted in business deals of some $5.2 billion. Yet, the total 
figure for these two missions is not even as high as the amount of 
the contracts obtained by the group led by the Canadian Prime 
Minister.
<P>
	In other words, this is an extremely successful trip and, 
instead of minimizing its results, our opponents should be 
pleased because this will mean jobs for Canada and particularly 
for several Quebec ridings.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, if the 
minister stands by what he just said, how can he explain the fact 
that the $800-million contract for Dominion Bridge, which was 
hailed as one of the major achievements of that mission, was not 
signed during Team Canada's trip to China but last June?
<P>
	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.): 
</B>Mr. Speaker, the chairman of that company thanked the Prime 
Minister for putting the final touch to a contract which was 
taking time to finalize.
<P>
	Our friends in opposition should realize that, ultimately, 
several contracts being negotiated can only be finalized and 
approved through a final political decision. Meetings between 
high-level political representatives help finalize contracts for 
which negotiations often drag on for too long.
<P>
	I can assure the hon. member that, with this visit, the Prime 
Minister was able to help many Canadian businesspeople, 
including some from Quebec who had the courtesy of joining 
Team Canada to China. This initiative helped finalize and sign 
contracts which will translate into thousands of Canadian jobs in 
the months to come.

	<B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration.
<P>
	The minister has shown a fondness in the past for stating with 
much bravado that he is in charge. He is fond of telling us that 
the buck stops with him.
<P>
	Now we learn that his office has broken the confidence of 
members of the Immigration and Refugee board and filed 
complaints against suspended deputy chief Michael Schelew by 
releasing their names to Mr. Schelew. This is a clear violation of 
section 29(a) of the Privacy Act which states that confidential 
information may not be released for any purpose other than that 
for which it was collected.
<P>
	The fact remains that provisions of the Privacy Act were 
broken. Did the justice department advise the minister to break 
this act? If not, will the minister tell the House specifically what 
the advice was that he was given by the justice department?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I responded to his colleague 
in the first round of questioning.
<P>
	I repeat once again that there was caution throughout the 
process of not releasing or disclosing any such names to the 
point where I chose not to write those names to the chair in 
asking quite appropriately for her to review the allegations that 
were made by these individuals. When she wrote me the letter 
attaching the report, she made reference to the fact that if those 
names were to be disclosed to me that I would make those names 
available.
<P>
	When the deputy chair was asked to respond to the report and 
the appropriateness of the recommendation, it was at that point 
that advice came from the Department of Justice that in 
preparation for that response the names had to be given to the 
counsel to the deputy chair so that he could fairly and 
appropriately respond. At the very same time when that advice 
came in and was followed those members of the IRB were 
advised that this action was to take place.
<P>
	The government has followed the process flawlessly. There 
has been no attempt to hide or hijack anything. In fact it is clear 
that the minister in asking the chair to look into it does not want 
anything hidden.
<P>
	We followed the process appropriately. We will be rendering a 
decision based on the recommendation of the chair very soon. To 
speculate needlessly on other elements would not help the 
judicial process that we are following.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my supplemental is also for the Minister of Citizenship 
and Immigration.
<P>
	When the Al Mashat affair took place three years ago, it was 
clearly stated by the current Minister of Human Resources 
Development in the House on June 12, 1991 that a government 
minister is required to protect the anonymity of individuals and 
to decline to publicly identify them.
<P>
	What is offensive is that members of the IRB have been 
brought to light in a way that they should not have been. The 
Minister of Citizenship and Immigration has not only broken 
section 29(a)-

<P>
	<B>Mr. Mayfield:</B> Mr. Speaker, will the minister now concede 
that he is responsible for this gross injustice and for further 
compromising the integrity of his department? Will he take 
charge to remedy the serious damage that he has caused within 
his department?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I repeat once again that no 
one is undermining any process. In fact I was given the names by 
a media outlet. I have not made any names public. It was on the 
advice of the Department of Justice counsel that for the deputy 
chair to appropriately and fairly respond to those allegations 
contained in the report that his counsel disclose the names of 
those individuals who made those allegations.
<P>
	Therefore it was the counsel in the Department of Justice in 
connection with the counsel to the deputy chair that those names 
were disclosed. The process has been followed.

	<B>Mr. Bernard Deshaies (Abitibi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is directed to the Minister of Foreign Affairs.
<P>
	During his trip to China, the Prime Minister avoided any 
public reference to the question of human rights violations in 
that country. He said he raised the matter privately. However, 
the Chinese Prime Minister said that the Prime Minister of 
Canada made no reference to human rights.
<P>
	How does the Minister of Foreign Affairs account for this 
obvious contradiction between what was said by the Prime 
Minister of Canada and by his Chinese counterpart?
<P>
	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.): 
</B>Mr. Speaker, I think that everyone who attended these 
discussions in China can testify that the Prime Minister raised 
the matter with his counterpart. He took a very practical 
approach, considering the situation in that country.
<P>
	We were very pleased that the Chinese authorities accepted a 
number of suggestions by the Prime Minister of Canada for 
exchanges of judges, lawyers and judicial representatives, to 
give the Chinese authorities a chance to become better 
acquainted with the Canadian system, use it as an example and, 
in the process, advance the cause of human rights in their 
country, over time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernard Deshaies (Abitibi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, would 
the Minister of Foreign Affairs agree that this excuse of 
allegedly raising the matter of human rights in private will cause 
Canada to lose all international credibility in this respect?
<P>
	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.): 
</B>Mr. Speaker, on the contrary, I think that the way Canada 
approached the matter could well be used as an example by a 
number of other countries who have to deal with China, 
especially since the results are very encouraging. In this respect, 
I believe the dialogue that was engaged is a respectful dialogue, 
but it is nevertheless a dialogue that may lead to some major 
results.

for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	Considering the problems the Minister of Canadian Heritage 
has had recently and considering these new problems of the 
Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, it would appear the 
Prime Minister needs to assure Canadians that these serious 
allegations against his ministers are unfounded. The Prime 
Minister or the ministers saying that they did nothing wrong is 
not reassuring.

what appears to be a breach of the insider information section of 
the conflict of interest code by the Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration has given 
a full and complete answer. It is very clear the hon. member has 
forgotten one of the basic principles of Canadian and British 
justice, that someone who has been accused has a right to know 
his accusers and what they say in order to make an answer to 
those charges.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it appears this 
minister has contravened the Privacy Act and he has also 
contravened the conflict of interest code. He claims now that he 
was advised to break the law by the justice department. We need 
some clarification. Canadians need clarification.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister direct both the privacy commissioner

investigations into the action of this minister and make those 
findings public immediately?

	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House

	While more and more workers are being laid off, MIL Davie is 
waiting to be awarded this vital contract so it can ensure its 
short-term survival and undertake its conversion program.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Industry, who is 
responsible for this matter. Does the minister confirm that his 
government is about to buy a used ferry rather than have a new 
one built in Lauzon, thus making it impossible for the MIL 
Davie shipyard to restructure and ensure its survival?

<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr.

founded assumption.
<P>
	If the member were to review the proposed business plan, 
which I must say has yet to be approved by the principal 
shareholder of MIL Davie, the Government of Quebec, that

the government realize that by buying a used ferry, it will 
deliberately bring about the final closing of MIL Davie, thus 
eliminating a competitor of Saint John Shipbuilding in New 
Brunswick, the home province of the Minister of Transport?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am reminded again that sound and fury often signify 
nothing. I think that is within the rules.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> It reminds me of the Wallendas sometimes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manley:</B> Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Transport has 
stated repeatedly in the House that no decision has been taken on 
any possible replacement for the <I>Lucy Maud Montgomery</I>. A 
number of alternatives are being considered. Taken into account 
in making that decision will be the needs and the interests of the 
residents of Îles-de-la-Madeleine who, after all, are ultimately 
the ones who will be using the service.
<P>
	With respect to MIL Davie, of course we are very concerned 
with the future of that shipyard as should be the shareholder, the 
Government of Quebec.

	<B>Mrs. Sue Barnes (London West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Justice.
<P>
	The Department of Justice released a discussion paper on the 
weekend raising the possibility that cultural defences might be 
permitted to criminal charges. Will the minister clarify just what 
this might mean if introduced?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, may I begin by 
emphasizing what this discussion paper was about. We are 
engaged in a process for the first time in 100 years of reviewing 
the general part of the Criminal Code to determine whether it 
should be changed or modernized. In the course of that, this 
discussion paper raises questions, not public policy but just 
questions, that are worthy of examination. It does not reflect 
government policy.
<P>
	I had hoped that the paper would be drafted to reflect my own 
perspective. My own personal view is that I am very much 
opposed to any general defence based on culture. However, it is 
important, if we are going to have a discussion, that we at least 
identify a list of questions that have been raised by law reform 
commissions and by legal journals in the past.
<P>
	I am especially troubled at the suggestion on the weekend that 
just raising these questions might create the spectre of 
justification for female genital mutilation. We have been at 
pains over the past six months to emphasize that this practice is 
criminal, will be investigated and will be prosecuted to the full 
extent of the law where it is detected.
<P>
	I hope what we have launched on the weekend is an open 
discussion about fundamental principles of criminal justice. In 
closing, I say that every reform we have put forward in the 
House to the criminal law has been to make people more 
accountable not less accountable.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul E. Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, over the weekend the Minister of Justice released a 
discussion paper that outlined possible amendments to the 
Criminal Code, one being a defence based on cultural or 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7732"> 7732 </A></B>
<P>
religious practices. It would mean that if it was the practice of a 
religious group to use prohibited drugs, weapons or ritual abuse 
it could be exempted from the Criminal Code. The minister is  
definitely flirting with these ideas, or else they would not be 
contained in his paper.
<P>
<B>(1450) </B>
<P>
	Is the minister prepared to implement such amendments to the 
Criminal Code that possibly could put Canadians at risk and 
bring to even further disrepute the criminal justice system?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as I mentioned in 
response to the question from my colleague, this discussion 
paper does not reflect government policy. It is intended only to 
stimulate a consultation about the fundamental principles of the 
criminal law.
<P>
	We hope through this process of reform to put in place a 
general part of the code that will last another 100 years. 
However we cannot do that without examining the issues that 
arise. We have listed this among others. However I want to 
assure the hon. member that I oppose a general defence based on 
culture and I will never introduce it so long as I am minister.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul E. Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the minister is consulting and delaying. He 
obviously does not know what to do.
<P>
	His trial balloon on criminal intoxication would mean that 
intoxication could be used as a defence because there would be a 
separate punishment for voluntary intoxication, with 
consequences of half or less the maximum of the main offence; 
in other words a drunkenness discount.
<P>
	Is the minister suggesting that even for something as serious 
as murder, if someone is intoxicated they could receive only half 
or less of the regular sentence? Or, will he toughen the Criminal 
Code rather than opening more escape hatches?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I know of the hon. 
member's interest in this subject. We have discussed it. He is as 
concerned as I am that there be accountability in the criminal 
law.
<P>
	I assure the hon. member that the options we are looking at are 
intended to achieve just that. I am concerned about the way the 
recent decisions will be interpreted and applied.
<P>
	When I spoke on Saturday to the criminal lawyers I 
emphasized that a discount for drunkenness is not acceptable as 
a matter of principle. We have to find a way to change the law 
that is constitutional and that gets the job done. That is what we 
are doing through this discussion process.

	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ): </B>Mr. Speaker, my question is 
for the Minister of Human Resources Development. Among the 
series of cuts planned as part of the social programs reform, 
Ottawa wants to discontinue transfers to the provinces for 
post-secondary education. The rector of McGill recently 
announced that, as a result of this reform, the university's 
tuition fees would climb to $8,000 a year.
<P>
	Does the minister agree that his proposal, which will increase 
student debt substantially, is unacceptable, and will he agree, in 
the interests of common sense, to go back to the drawing board?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if I may be allowed to 
make two corrections to the hon. member's assertions to begin 
with.
<P>
	First, the green paper is only a series of options for 
discussion. There is no government policy at this point in time.
<P>
	Second, the assertion that the government is withdrawing 
funding from higher education is totally false. At the present 
time the federal government provides over 50 per cent of the 
funding of higher education. We intend to maintain our 
commitment. What we have pointed out is that the provinces 
will receive the same amount, $6.2 billion, except more will 
come from tax revenues.
<P>
	If you can get the provinces to start living up to their 
responsibilities to ensure that the transfer of money totally goes 
to higher education, then there would be no problem with 
tuitions or funding.
<P>
	In fact what we are proposing is to find ways of adding more 
money, upward of $12 billion over the next 10 years, to higher 
education. That is the truth. Not a reduction but an addition.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ): </B>Mr. Speaker, does the 
minister realize that his stubbornness is confirmation that the 
Liberals are in the process of denying a university education to 
thousands of young people?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am just trying to explain 
to the hon. member that the proposal in the green paper is 
designed to provide substantial new funding for higher 
education. In this way we can broaden accessibility for another 
quarter of a million people to go to college and university. That 
is the fact.

the deposition and discovery stages of an investigation are

<P>
	Does the justice minister not agree that the names of accusers 
should never be released until the accused has actually been 
charged? This has not occurred in the Schelew case. Why?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Department of 
Justice was called on to give legal advice to my colleague, the 
Minister of Citizenship and Immigration. I can tell the House 
that the advice we gave was entirely in accordance with the law. 
Beyond that we are satisfied that the minister acted in

his department give to the minister of immigration, and why did 
they sanction this contravention of section 29 of the Privacy

	<B>Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Middlesex, Lib.):</B> Mr.

Agri-Food.
<P>
	Ontario pork producers recently stated they could support a 
freer trade policy provided that Washington's countervailing 
duty on live Canadian hogs is dropped and a tough and effective 
mechanism is put in place to halt incoming U.S. hogs possibly 
carrying the pseudorabies virus.
<P>
	Will the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food inform the 
House what measures his department is taking to address the 
concerns of Ontario pork producers?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member has raised two 
issues in her question, one having to do with the U.S. 
countervailing duty on live Canadian hogs exported to the 
United States, and the other relating to the risk of pseudorabies 
in U.S. hogs imported into Canada.
<P>
	It is important to note that one is a very serious trade issue and 
the other is a very serious health of animals issue. Both are 
important but they should not be linked together.
<P>
	On the countervailing duty issue the government has worked 
very closely with the Canada Pork Council and Canada Pork 
International on a variety of market access and trade issues. We 
will continue to do so, especially with respect to our fight 
against that U.S. countervailing duty on Canadian live hogs.
<P>
	The pseudorabies issue, which I emphasize is a separate issue, 
is a complex health of animals concern. Evaluation of the 
information on the potential consequences of imports from the 
United States is what our department is engaged in at the present 
time.
<P>
	We would consider permitting imports only when we can be 
totally satisfied that our stringent health and safety standards 
will not in any way be compromised.

the statements made by some members of her caucus who want 
to change the regulations pertaining to Bill C-91 at the expense 
of brand name pharmaceutical companies.

	Can the minister tell us whether she is in favour of the existing 
legislation remaining unchanged or whether she advocates a 
change in regulations along the lines of what her Liberal 
colleagues are calling for?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member will be aware that the legislation 
contains a parliamentary review provision which will come into 
effect at a stated period of time after the proclamation of the 
legislation. Undoubtedly the appropriate parliamentary 
committee will wish to review it at that time.

	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, our 
federal debt is $535 billion and growing. Our total debt, federal 
and provincial, now exceeds 90 per cent of our gross domestic 
product and our foreign debt is 44 per cent of our gross domestic 
product. That is worse than any other leading industrialized 
country.
<P>
	Yet we find that the supplementary estimates will show that 
we are going to spend $527 million to help other countries 
reduce their debts. My question to the Minister of Finance is: 
Can he please justify this expenditure to Canadians when he is 
telling them they must accept cuts or tax increases because we 
are so heavily in debt?

sites that have toxic and non-toxic waste that need to be cleaned 
up.
<P>
	The federal government-I would like to know the minister's 
position on this-has said that it will bury the debris, which is in 
contravention of the 1984 Inuvialuit land claims agreement and 
other land claims agreements with the Inuit. Would the minister 
please tell the House what his position is on this and whether he 
supports the appeal of this arbitration decision which has 
ordered the government to respect these agreements?

many troubling aspects about the leaving of armed forces bases

<P>
	I certainly am troubled by the response that I am getting in 
terms of it being cheaper to bury this kind of waste in this one 
instance rather than transport it. I have asked my officials to 
reconsider the option.
<P>
	More important, we will be entering into discussions with the 
United States, with my American counterpart, about DEW Line 
cleanups, the compensation arising from DEW Line cleanup and

	Subsequently each invoice, claim or financial report received 
is verified against the contract or the contribution to ensure it is 
in compliance with the terms and conditions and is then certified 
by the manager responsible for the project. In some instances

this special budget.
<P>
	In the 1994 federal budget $800 million was provided over 
1995-96 and 1996-97 so that innovative approaches to training 
and getting people back to work could be tried in co-operation 
with the provinces and territories. This government is 
committed to improving the job opportunities for Canadians and 
has, in partnership with  the provinces and territories, developed 
strategic initiatives projects which are ready for implementation 
this fiscal year. This is why funds from existing budgets have 
been redirected to support the advancement of these important 
projects.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> I ask that the remaining questions be allowed 
to stand.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Shall the remaining questions stand?

	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for 
Richmond-Wolfe has about five minutes left to conclude his 
remarks.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, BQ):</B> Including the 
minutes taken up by the hon. member for 
Broadview-Greenwood, Mr. Speaker?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> We will give Mr. Leroux one minute 
more, naturally.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> Mr. Speaker, as we resume 
this debate, I would like to recap briefly what was said in the 
first part, which is extremely important and deals with the 
impact of regional development, and federal involvement in 
regional development in particular. Let me remind this House, 
first of all, that, between 1974 and 1984, both sets of economic 
and regional development agreements commonly called ERDAs 
have had an extremely negative impact on peripheral regions, 
that is to say regions outside of major centers that monopolized 
46 per cent of the total budget in terms of investments.
<P>
	I would like to push on a little further with this demonstration, 
my ultimate goal being to bring the federal government to 
understand that it must withdraw completely from regional 
development in Quebec and recognize the province as prime 
mover with respect to development. To continue with my 
demonstration, by integrating the regional offices known as 
FORD-Q with the Department of Industry and turning them into 
business service centres, the Liberal government is creating a 
single window for information on federal, provincial and 
municipal programs and services in Quebec, the sole purpose of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7737"> 7737 </A></B>
<P>
which, in our view, is to emphasize Canadian regional 
development policies with the catastrophic results that we know, 
results noted in several studies.
<P>
	So, as a member of the industry committee, it is my duty to 
denounce this contempt displayed by the federal government for 
Quebec's regional development policies. Quebec, the State of 
Quebec, has had a regional development process for over 40 
years, across that is far more effective and better adapted to the 
needs of fringe regions.
<P>
	I repeat that today, we have a series of general agreements 
involving 95 regional municipalities that have done their own 
strategic development studies in terms of the development of 
SMEs and industry. These general agreements reflect how 
important it is to be close to the fringe areas, as opposed to 
following federal imperatives based on a mythical vision of 
what industrial development ought to be in Canada.
<P>
	Speaking as a member of Industry Committee, I support the 
dissenting opinion of my Bloc colleagues, which includes 
recommendation No. 20. I support the dissenting opinion, 
including recommendation No. 20 of this committee which is 
intended to enable the federal government to interfere with the 
definition of the objectives and portfolio structure of the assets 
of the QFL Solidarity Fund. It is entirely unacceptable that the 
committee should recommend that the federal government 
interfere with the definition of the objectives and orientation of 
labour-sponsored venture capital corporations established 
under provincial legislation.
<P>
	More about duplication and overlap. The new mission of the 
Federal Office of Regional Development, which has now been 
merged with the Department of Industry, is to all intents and 
purposes that of a service centre for business.
<P>
<B>(1515) </B>
<P>
	However, this is what the Department of Industry has to say 
about the purpose of the FORD: Taking into account its limited 
financial resources, it plays a major role by offering SMEs 
services including information, analyses and strategic 
assistance. In Quebec we already have the wherewithal to 
provide such services to SMEs, including exporter SMEs, 
through the General Secretariat for Foreign Affairs of Quebec, 
which provides entrepreneurs with information and a very 
detailed guide that has an excellent reputation among 
entrepreneurs active on international markets.
<P>
	In fact, legislation passed in Quebec in 1979, the Act 
respecting land use planning and development, which created 
regional municipalities, the so-called MRCs, provided the 
structure for such services. With a council in each of the 95 
MRCs, economic development corporations and industrial 
commissioners, it was possible to start a development process 
involving interaction between the SMEs and all the various 
regions and microregions.
<P>
	According to a study by Marc-Urbain Proulx, an expert on 
economic development in Quebec, in a market economy whose 
many weaknesses are compensated for by more concerted action 
by authorities at all three levels of government, development 
plans for MRCs in Quebec are mainly aimed at integrating a 
variety of activities.
<P>
	What causes duplication, overlap and poor management of 
funds is the failure to recognize existing structures. In this 
context, a parallel network of 13 regional offices, or FORD-Qs, 
in Quebec is unjustified, constitutes duplication of services and 
is basically squandering public funds. This is an example, 
among existing direct assistance to small business and direct 
funding support to small and medium-sized businesses. Liberal 
members from Quebec should advise their colleagues of the 
existence of such a major development and financial assistance 
structure for small and medium-sized businesses at the regional 
level, and I am coming to this.
<P>
	Quebec has its own regional development secretariat under 
the responsibility of a minister of state for regional 
development. This House must realize that there is no reason for 
federal involvement in regional development. Federal 
involvement complicates greatly government intervention to 
help small and medium-sized businesses. Regional 
development boards have been in existence for over 30 years 
and, with tools such as regional initiatives funds and business 
assistance funds-our suggestion is not off the wall; it is the 
same kind of instrument-these boards provide direct assistance 
to small business.
<P>
	The development secretariats I referred to earlier can also 
assist small business with tools such as local initiatives funds 
and decentralized job creation funds. In the field, other 
stakeholders actively support small and medium-sized 
businesses. Take the Solidarity Fund, the industrial 
development corporation and the regional investment 
corporation for example. Note the smooth industrial 
development in the Sherbrooke area, where small and 
medium-sized businesses from nine municipalities have trade 
relations and agreements with the United States, particularly the 
northeastern states, including the city of Hartford, have access 
to markets and prosper.
<P>
	To conclude, out of solidarity with the Quebec government 
and state and in support of the initiative of the Quebec minister 
of state for regional development, the Bloc Quebecois asks that 
the Liberal government withdraw from regional development 
and transfer to Quebec the federal regional development 
envelope.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, again, they would have 
us believe that the federal government is doing absolutely 
nothing in the regions. When I hear the opposition's demagogy, I 
find that it hurts our ears to hear the member opposite say that 
the Federal Office of Regional Development has done nothing, 
the Federal Business Development Bank has done nothing, the 
Prime  Minister of Canada, who is now in China, has done 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7738"> 7738 </A></B>
<P>
nothing for regional economic development and especially to 
advance social and economic development in Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1520) </B>
<P>
	As a member from the rural hinterland of Quebec, I can tell 
you, Mr. Speaker, and I find it regrettable that the opposition 
fails to mention it in their propaganda, that there is a serious lack 
of co-ordination and co-operation among various provincial 
bodies involved in small-business development.
<P>
	People in Quebec, and especially in the regions, have 
denounced the Caisse populaire Desjardins, which has over 
$500 million, for not lending enough to small-business people 
in the regions. One would say that the opposition is taking an 
urban point of view which does not reflect the socio-economic 
reality of the regions. For example, they do not realize the major 
investments we have made in important enterprises in the 
regions, including in forestry. Take the Eastern Quebec 
Development Plan, for example.
<P>
	Six thousand small businesses and workers commended the 
Government of Canada for what it is doing, its serious approach 
and business plan, and that is no joke. If there is a lesson to be 
learned from this, it is that the Government of Canada is 
welcome because it is a good manager. Unfortunately, all we 
hear from the opposition is that there are too many players and 
unfortunately the provincial level is not well co-ordinated.
<P>
	Our area does not even have someone to go to foreign 
countries to promote the regions, because Quebec is doing a bad 
job and they should admit it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is obvious 
that the hon. member for Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine 
does not know his region at all, since what he is demanding is, in 
fact, a settlement. I urge him to tell me if the Eastern Plan has 
indeed been renewed. They have been fussing with this plan for 
several months. Of course, the government did not see fit to 
respond to the first invitation last summer. It then kept putting 
off the meeting with Eastern producers. The last I heard, nothing 
has been settled regarding the Eastern Plan. The agreement has 
not even been renewed at this time.
<P>
	In any case, for a member coming from Quebec and very 
familiar with regional tools like regional development councils, 
industrial associations, the general secretariat of foreign affairs, 
which make loans to businesses and work on domestic and 
international market development and prospecting with them- 
he knows full well that there is increasing co-operation in 
integrating structures, precisely because they decided that there 
were too many structures and players.
<P>
	The underlying reason why the regions decided to analyze 
their economic development strengths and weaknesses was to 
come up with strategic development plans to be shared through 
an integrated forum called the  regional economic development 
council. The purpose of this was to reduce the number of steps 
required, to make business and socio-economic development 
more efficient, to avoid overlap-within their own territory, to 
say nothing of federal involvement-to rationalize their own 
actions and structures.
<P>
	The hon. member should know that these integration efforts 
will soon be stepped up in his own region. We do not need to 
create anew, as with the 13 FORD-Q information offices. 
Quebec already has integrated offices providing information, 
including export information, to small businesses and all 
stakeholders.
<P>
	The Minister of Regional Development in Hull specifically 
said that this program would be helpful to small exporters. 
Quebec already has a recognized and appreciated organization 
which supports small exporters and gives them a complete kit on 
how to develop their own markets and foreign business plans.
<P>
	That is duplication. People in Quebec, to convey to the federal 
government that if its goal is indeed to maximize the funds 
invested and provide real and effective support to small 
businesses, are sending the following message.
<P>
<B>(1525) </B>
<P>
	Why does the government not admit that the experience of the 
past 40 years in regional development-again, the development 
of all regions and not major centres-Forty-seven per cent of 
the amounts under recent agreements were invested in central 
regions. Why not admit that Quebec is the primary force in 
regional development and that its experience-and that of all its 
people-is concentrated at the regional development level, as 
the hon. member for Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine 
should know? Who are the people working together at the 
regional development level? The same people he mentioned 
earlier: regional county municipality officials, mayors, 
socio-economic businesses, entrepreneurs, unions. This full 
integration of economic development players only makes them 
more efficient while reducing the number of action structures.
<P>
	What is being proposed here? To create other action structures 
without integrating into existing structures. We cannot accept in 
good faith-
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manley:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I know it 
was previously raised that in his first remarks the member was 
not on topic. He is likewise off topic now. If there is any time for 
further-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I think the minister will be well aware 
that was not a point of order.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7739"> 7739 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> Mr. Speaker, I explain 
these things because they are reluctant to see them. They are 
upset by my comments. Regional development is a 
responsibility of the Minister of Industry and, by order in 
council, the minister himself is responsible for a region. The 
Minister of Human Resources Development is responsible for 
the West. The Minister of Supply and Services is responsible for 
the East, while the Minister of Finance is responsible for 
Quebec.
<P>
	If this is not about regional development, what is it? This is 
about helping small and medium-sized businesses; it is about 
development and access to credit for those businesses. These 
aspects are all relevant. The government simply does not want to 
face the issue squarely and with a structured approach.
<P>
	It is because it does not look at the basic question in a 
structured fashion that duplication and all these structures are 
maintained, with the result that the ultimate objective-
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. This 
is question and comment period and there are others who would 
like to get a question in. Perhaps he could be-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> And it is irrelevant.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> And it is irrelevant.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The member will also know that was 
not a point of order. There remain two minutes in the period for 
questions and comments. Perhaps there will be unanimous 
consent to extend the period. In the meantime, the hon. member 
has a minute and a half left.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> Mr. Speaker, clearly this 
government has to understand that, given the exceptional and 
enormous work undertaken by Quebec regions to promote their 
economic development through framework agreements, through 
RCM's and through regional development councils, it is 
absolutely essential that Quebec be the only one responsible for 
its development. The federal government must negotiate with 
Quebec and transfer to it the whole responsibility of that sector, 
as well as the necessary funds which are, in all fairness, owed to 
that province for regional development purposes.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> There remain 20 seconds in the period. 
I assume there is not unanimous consent to continue the question 
period.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Mr. Speaker, on a 
point of order, I would like to ask you for clarification on the 
process we will follow for the rest of the afternoon.
<P>
	My understanding is that today's debate is on Motion No. 16. 
We are debating the report on access to capital for small 
business that the industry committee members put together over 
the last several months. The previous speaker chose not to deal 
with the report not only during his main address but also during 
the eight minutes of the ten he took up during the question and 
answer period. Is it your position, Mr. Speaker, that members 
can speak on whatever they want for the rest of the afternoon or 
are we going to deal with Motion No. 16?
<P>
<B>(1530) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Colleagues, the member and all 
members will know that there is a relevance rule in our standing 
orders that is observed mostly in being ignored in the House. 
This Chair at least would be delighted if members would respect 
the rule of relevance but in the time I have been here that rule is 
ignored more than any other in the standing orders.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> I rise on a point of order, Mr. Speaker. It has 
been my experience, limited as it has been in terms of the House 
and in comparison with other members, that when the Speaker's 
attention is drawn to the fact that a member is addressing the 
House in a manner that is irrelevant to the subject under 
discussion the Speaker then directs the person speaking to make 
his remarks relevant.
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary was suggesting that perhaps it 
would be appropriate that when members rise on a point of order 
to point out the irrelevance that Your Honour would take note of 
it and direct the member to make his remarks relevant or face the 
consequence in Standing Order 11 which says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Speaker or the Chairman, after having called the attention of the House, 
or of the Committee, to the conduct of a Member who persists in irrelevance, or 
repetition, may direct the Member to discontinue his or her speech, and if then 
the Member still continues to speak, the Speaker shall name the Member or, if 
in Committee, the Chairman shall report the Member to the House.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Thank you to the hon. parliamentary 
secretary. As I say I think all the Chairs would be delighted to 
see the relevance rule respected. If members in the House are 
indicating they wish to see it pursued vigorously, I suppose all of 
us will take careful note of that.
<P>
	In the meantime it is the Secretary of State for International 
Financial Institutions who has the floor on debate.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am still 
referring to the point of order. I think that the members are 
trying to raise an issue by claiming that my speech was not 
relevant. Yet, they know perfectly well that my speech was 
directly related to the development of  small businesses and to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7740"> 7740 </A></B>
<P>
access to financing, that it suggested a much wider and 
structured approach, and that it was right on target.
<P>
	It may hurt them, but my comments were really relevant and 
related to the issue being discussed here today.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. minister has the floor. We 
trust his remarks will be relevant.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am extremely 
pleased to have this opportunity and to congratulate the industry 
committee for the work it has done on the issue of financing 
small business. I intend to keep my topic to that item.
<P>
	Our government clearly recognizes that small business is a 
vital sector of Canada's economy. The report of the industry 
committee makes a valuable contribution to public debate and 
understanding of the needs of that sector.
<P>
	It is worth emphasizing and it is worth emphasizing again and 
again just how important small business is by beginning with a 
few facts.
<P>
	Small business accounts for nearly 40 per cent of our national 
economy, a third of corporate profits. More than half of all 
Canadians working in the private sector are either 
self-employed or work in businesses with fewer than 100 
employees. Even more important, in just a decade this same 
sector of companies with fewer than 100 employees created 
more than eight out of ten of the new jobs in Canada.
<P>
	This is not a passing trend. Small business is clearly the 
engine of growth in the new economy and the policies of this 
government recognize that fact. As you know, Mr. Speaker, we 
campaigned on this issue. For example, the Prime Minister and I 
held a small business forum in my riding in Scarborough East 
during the election campaign. As the Prime Minister pointed 
out, if only a third of small businesses in Canada each hired one 
additional employee fully 300,000 new jobs would be created.
<P>
	To realize their full potential as creators of new jobs small 
businesses need the right environment, one that allows them to 
prosper and expand. Canadians are tired of governments that 
pursue quick fixes or jump on the latest fad but have no 
fundamental vision of what government should and should not 
do in the economic arena. That is why our government set out a 
new comprehensive vision in its recent paper ``A new 
framework for economic policy''.
<P>
	That paper sets out five key areas on which we must focus. 
The first is helping Canadians acquire skills; the skills to get 
jobs, the skills to keep jobs, and the skills to find better jobs.
<P>
<B>(1535 ) </B>
<P>
	The second part of our economic framework is encouraging 
Canadians to adjust to change. That will require changes in the 
government's approach to subsidies as well as to unemployment 
insurance and high payroll taxes, which are a detriment to small 
business.
<P>
	The third element in our framework is getting government 
right. That means targeting scarce resources on the highest 
priority programs and reducing or eliminating lower priority 
activities. It also means draining the swamp of federal 
regulations.
<P>
	Providing leadership in the economy is our fourth objective. 
The private sector creates jobs, especially the small business 
sector. The government has a role in fostering economic growth. 
It can do this for example by gathering and sharing information 
about technology and information about new markets.
<P>
	It can help bring businesses together with other businesses 
and together with the new technology. It can facilitate trade by 
ensuring access to markets and to adequate export financing.
<P>
	The fifth and final objective is absolutely essential to 
fulfilling the other objectives. We must create a healthy fiscal 
and monetary climate in Canada. Canadians are paying a painful 
price for decades of deficit and debt. It is measured in high 
taxes, high interest rates, too few jobs and too little growth. 
Higher interest rates have imposed a heavy burden on all 
Canadians and few understand that burden better than the men 
and women who operate small businesses.
<P>
	The matter of interest rates brings me back to the central issue 
here today, access to financing. While know-how and 
entrepreneurship are the engines of small business success they 
are not always enough. Access to financing can be a critical 
issue for small businesses, particularly during their early years. 
The importance of bank financing to this sector would be 
difficult to overstate. Indeed, bank financing accounts for about 
90 per cent of the external financing of small businesses.
<P>
	Recognizing this our government met with the CEOs of 
Canada's major banks shortly after taking office. We urged them 
to re-examine their approaches to small business lending and 
challenged them to be more innovative and responsive. The 
Minister of Finance and I have been very clear in our 
discussions. The government expects improvement in banking 
practices. In no small measure Canada's economic prospects 
hinge upon the banking community, recognizing that small 
business has specific needs. To meet these needs banking 
practices must change.
<P>
	I believe that the banking community is listening and that we 
are seeing some results. The banks have been taking initiatives 
to help their small business clients. These include such things as 
increases in funds set aside for conventional loans to small 
businesses. One bank introduced a program to provide financial 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7741"> 7741 </A></B>
<P>
assistance to viable small businesses that are experiencing 
temporary  cash flow problems. Another created a $125 million 
venture capital fund to invest in small and medium size 
companies.
<P>
	Several banks have introduced programs to enhance the 
accessibility of knowledge based firms to financing and other 
banking services. Others have introduced new procedures to 
handle complaints. One bank has appointed an internal 
ombudsman reporting directly to the chairman to ensure that a 
proper level of service has been provided to small business 
clients. Another bank has established a panel to review 
complaints, a panel that includes a representative from small 
business.
<P>
	The list goes on. Two banks have established regional 
business centres to provide specialized services to small 
business clients. Another has introduced a program to provide 
overdraft protection to SBLA customers that do not have 
operating credit.
<P>
	I recently issued a letter to all hon. members outlining these 
and other bank actions to help meet the needs of small 
businesses. I sought members' assistance in monitoring the 
results of these initiatives. Specifically, I asked members to let 
me know if the banks were fulfilling those commitments and if 
their initiatives were helping to reduce the credit difficulties of 
small businesses in their constituencies.
<P>
	In addition, the government has been working with the banks 
on a number of important areas related to bank financing. These 
include several major areas in which the committee reports 
make some substantial recommendations.
<P>
<B>(1540 ) </B>
<P>
	For example, senior representatives of the Department of 
Finance and Industry have been encouraging the banks to move 
ahead on a number of issues, including a code of conduct for 
small business lending.
<P>
	This code should help place the relationship between banks 
and small business on a sounder footing by making the 
borrowing process more transparent and providing a simple, 
timely and effective mechanism to resolve disputes.
<P>
	The government has also been reviewing a number of other 
areas with the banks; export financing, the improvement of 
banking statistics and the question of personal guarantees for 
loans under the Small Businesses Loans Act. All these are areas 
that are being examined.
<P>
	Against that backdrop I would welcome the industry 
committee's report with enthusiasm. Many of the committee's 
recommendations touch on areas where, as I indicated earlier, 
work is already under way.
<P>
	I understand that the code of conduct for small business 
lending will be released shortly. It will establish minimum 
industry wide guidelines. Individual banks will also be able to 
develop their own codes which will be released soon after.
<P>
	The best method of dispute resolution remains to be 
determined. There are a number of options that will need to be 
reviewed and the committee's proposals are a useful addition to 
this discussion.
<P>
	The committee has also recommended that government 
departments and agencies work with the banks to improve 
statistics on lending to small business. Work to improve data in 
this area is already under way. It involves officials from the 
Bank of Canada as well as those from the Department of 
Finance.
<P>
	In addition to proposals related directly to the bank, the 
committee has made a number of recommendations pertaining 
to government programs and agencies. It has, for example, 
recommended that the Small Businesses Loans Act be revised. 
We must ensure that this program is run on a cost efficient basis 
with minimal risk shifting to the government and without 
preference to bank financing.
<P>
	The committee is correct to point out that there are concerns 
about future program costs as well as the extent to which the 
program adds to the total supply of financing. A successful 
SBLA program will remain a critical element of the 
government's small business agenda.
<P>
	We are reviewing the program with an eye to improving its 
incremental nature. We are also reviewing it with addressing the 
fiscal concerns through increased cost for coverage. We will 
also continue to ensure that qualified private sector lenders 
other than the banks remain eligible to participate in that 
program.
<P>
	Among the committee's other major recommendations was 
the establishment of a limited working capital guarantee 
program for small and medium sized exporters. This too is an 
area in which work is already under way. The Export 
Development Corporation is currently working with financial 
institutions on a new insurance product. This product will 
facilitate the use of foreign accounts receivable by small and 
medium sized exporters to secure working capital lines of 
credit. As recommended by the committee, this program will be 
self-financing and the premiums will be commensurate with the 
risk.
<P>
	I focused on the committee's proposals in areas where work 
has already started. The committee has, of course, made other 
<P>

recommendations that touch on areas where further study is 
needed.
<P>
	For example, the committee has made several proposals, 
particularly in the area of venture capital which have a 
significant tax dimension. Clearly these proposals must be 
examined further to ensure that their full fiscal ramifications 
and possible side effects are taken into account. Alternative 
approaches must also be duly considered.
<P>
	One recommendation in this area is a reduction in the capital 
gains tax rate on so-called patient capital, that is capital 
investments with a five-year term or longer. As many hon. 
members are aware, a task force has been consulting with 
business and farm groups on the $500,000 lifetime capital gains 
exemption.
<P>
	In the course of this review, a number of proposals for 
reforming capital gains treatment of small businesses have been 
received including proposals for reducing the capital gains rate 
on longer term investment. These proposals will of course be 
examined closely.
<P>
	I should also point out that a few of the committee's 
recommendations appear to suggest an easing of prudential 
standards for financial institutions. These, like all the 
recommendations, will be carefully considered. Let me 
emphasize that the government will not pursue any measure that 
could weaken the financial system in any way. A strong and 
reliable financial system is central to Canada's economic health. 
We will certainly not jeopardize it.
<P>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
	In closing, I once again would like to express my appreciation 
for the opportunity to participate in today's discussion and to 
congratulate the committee on its report. It is also my intention 
to state my conviction that Canada's small business sector will 
become even stronger and more competitive.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I listened with great interest to the hon. member's 
presentation.
<P>
	I purchased my first business when I was 18 years old. 
Throughout all of my life save for about five years I have been in 
and out of small business and consider myself somewhat of an 
entrepreneur. The definition of that as an entrepreneur through 
your life you have some winners and some losers but at the end 
of the day you hope you have more winners than losers. 
Fortunately I lucked out from hard work, but through all those 
years my biggest competitors were the bankers.
<P>
	I listened to the hon. member talk about proposals and that the 
banks are going to do studies and they are going to talk about 
this and talk about that. They have been doing that for years.
<P>
	I particularly remember the period of the great recession in 
early 1982 when the Bank of Commerce had a multimillion 
dollar television campaign with Anne Murray telling all small 
businesses in Canada that the Bank of Commerce was their 
friend. I was operating a business then and fortunately I was not 
really caught in  the recession. One day I got a call from my 
banker who said: ``Dick, we are going to cut your credit line in 
half''. When I asked why, he said: ``We have just been advised 
we have to raise some capital''.
<P>
	The banks can talk all they want about programs and plans. 
The government can talk all it wants about how much it is 
talking to the banks, but nothing is going to happen to help small 
business until the monopoly of the big five bankers in this 
country is threatened or broken up.
<P>
	The hon. member said that the government has met with the 
CEOs of the major banks and they have promised to look at 
improving banking practices in relation to small business. That 
is fine, but my question is, improving banking practices or 
what? What kind of hammer is the government going to hold 
over these bankers to make sure they do?
<P>
	If the government would dare to suggest to the big five who 
have this country in a monopolistic grip when it comes to 
finance, if it would threaten to open up the banking industry to 
private enterprise, to competition, to regional banks that would 
specialize in small business financing, that would be the biggest 
incentive for the banks to start looking seriously at small 
business. As long as the banks hold all the cards, as long as they 
are contributing millions of dollars to the two old line parties to 
help them with their election costs, they are never going to give 
up their monopoly and small business is never ever going to get 
any benefit or relief from the banking industry in this country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peters:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member raises several very 
interesting points. First, there are more than five banks in this 
country. There are over sixty banks. All of the world's largest 
banks are here. They are quite free to lend to small business if 
they wish. One or two of them do lend to small business. The rest 
of them do not.
<P>
	Opening up the banking business to what? The charters of 
trust companies, loan companies and the banks are all the same. 
Any one can get a charter if they want to. If they want to open a 
regional business, some have been successful, others have been 
less than successful. The member should look at the number of 
financial institutions that OSFI and CDIC insure and inspect. 
There are several hundred financial institutions. The options are 
there.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	I would also point out that the member is correct in that small 
business indeed deals with the six large chartered banks. I do not 
know why. Would it be because for the most part small busi-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7743"> 7743 </A></B>
<P>
nesses get the financing they want from them? It is probably 
because they provide service to most small businesses.
<P>
	I do not think all small businesses have problems with the 
banks. There are far too many. I hope the hon. member will 
review the list of initiatives I sent to each member of this House. 
I ask members to go over the list and tell me where these things 
have not been done. If there are failures in them, if the initiatives 
are not being pursued, then I would like to know because I will 
bring those up with the banks that have proposed them.
<P>
	I presume the banks are serious about those initiatives. They 
would not have announced them if they were not. They were 
announced after we had pursued them. If they are not serious, 
then I hope hon. members will let me know. Some have. Several 
members have written to me. I hope the hon. member will take 
the opportunity and tell me of specific instances where these 
initiatives have not happened in his riding or elsewhere.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> I rise on a point of order, Mr. Speaker. Pursuant 
to Standing Order 43(2) I wish to indicate to the House that 
Liberal members of Parliament for the rest of this sitting day 
will be sharing their time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harris:</B> Mr. Speaker, I assure the hon. member that I will 
be monitoring the promises-if we can call them that-of the 
banking industry to see whether they are actually following 
through on them. I am not going to cross my fingers because I 
have heard this rhetoric from the banking industry for a number 
of years. It is always the small businessmen. When the sun is 
shining the banks will hand them an umbrella but when it starts 
to rain they are the first ones to take it away.
<P>
	The hon. member knows very well that the big six do in fact 
control virtually all the business in the country. The hon. 
member also knows that the big six have the resources to get 
involved in a little bit of risk financing. I am sure they consider 
small businesses as high risk, otherwise they would not treat 
them as they do.
<P>
	The hon. member also knows that the smaller banks do not 
have the kind of capital to get involved in the more risky loan 
portfolios like small business. That is why all the small 
businesses are pretty much obliged to deal with the big banking 
institutions, the big six. They really do not have too many 
choices.
<P>
	The government should tell the banking industry: ``Now 
listen. You folks are talking about rearranging your priorities 
when it comes to small business, rearranging the conditions 
under which you lend. You are doing these studies and you are 
going to come up with some good programs. You have admitted 
it has to be done, now what are you going to do about it? Are you 
really going to do something? Because if you do not we as a 
government are going to impose a few restrictions on you. You 
will not have such a monopoly in dealing with business in this 
country''.
<P>
	Clearly the government is going to have to hold some sort of a 
hammer over these guys in the banking industry. If not, they are 
simply not going to do anything no matter how much the 
government talks to them, no matter how many times their CEOs 
meet and say that  yes, they have to be a little more gentle toward 
the small business interests. They are simply not going to 
change their practices they have followed since day one until the 
government holds a hammer over their heads to change their 
lending practices.
<P>
<B>(1555 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peters:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is nice to know the hon. member is 
an expert on how the CEOs of the banks react to the admonitions 
of government. Unfortunately he is not an expert. Let me tell 
him that the CEOs of the banks have taken the admonitions of 
the Minister of Finance and myself seriously. That is exactly 
what we told them. We told them that they have to change. We 
told them that shortly after we were elected and we told them at 
meetings again and again.
<P>
	Let me assure the hon. member that there have been far more 
initiatives put out by the banking industry since this Liberal 
government was elected than have been put out by that same 
industry-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order, the time has expired. The hon. 
member for Edmonton Southwest on debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I take great pleasure in participating in this debate 
today. It is interesting. You can certainly identify those of us in 
this House who have signed a cheque in our lives because we 
certainly have a lot more interest and a lot more fire in our 
bellies when we get to talking about the banks and the banking 
institutions in Canada.
<P>
	The relationship with the big sisters, the big banks in Canada, 
was very well summarized in the title of a book that was 
published about 10 years ago: <I>Towers of Gold, Feet of Clay</I>. 
When you think about that for a second it really brings into focus 
the reason for this debate in the first place and why the industry 
committee worked so hard on its report on small business 
financing.
<P>
	It was interesting to me coming from western Canada that this 
country did not really have a recession until the late 1980s and 
closer to 1990 when it really hit southern Ontario. That is when 
we had a recession. But for business people in the west the 
recession started much earlier than that and it started overnight. 
It was exacerbated by the national energy plan but made much 
worse by the fact that during that time the big banks had loaned 
vast amounts of money all over the world and then were drawing 
in the loans all over Canada from the small business sector.
<P>
	That was one interesting time to be in business. Banks were 
lending money and had loaned money and taken huge losses all 
over the world but they were putting the screws to small 
business people because they were the only ones they could put 
the screws to.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7744"> 7744 </A></B>
<P>
	There is a saying in the banking business that when you are 
not a lender, you are a receiver, and if you owe the bank a 
thousand dollars you have a problem, but if you owe it a million 
dollars it has a problem. That is absolutely true.
<P>
	Both sides of this story have learned a little over the 
intervening years and as in everything in life when there is 
competition in any industry it is good for the business. It is good 
for the industry. I think we are getting more competition in the 
banking business and that competition is good.
<P>
	This report put together by the industry committee has 24 
recommendations. They run the gamut of just about everything 
you can imagine: monitoring and approving statistics, 
regulating bank behaviour, leasing, federal programs to assist 
small and medium business, stimulating competition, using 
RRSPs, provincial security regulations, taxation and capital 
gains, labour sponsored venture capital corporations and mutual 
guarantee co-operatives.
<P>
	I would like to restrict my comments to four separate issues: 
the role of the Small Businesses Loans Act; the role of the 
Federal Business Development Bank; whether or not to speak 
more generally to the role of business and government and the 
relationship and how much government money should be 
involved in business; and just a few minutes to speak about the 
legitimate role of an entrepreneur and just who should have the 
risk.
<P>
<B>(1600 ) </B>
<P>
	Let us start with the Small Businesses Loans Act. For the 
benefit of those who may not be aware of it, when an 
entrepreneur gets an idea they go into the bank and say they have 
an idea, they want to start a business. The Small Businesses 
Loans Act will lend government guaranteed money up to 90 per 
cent of the value of the loan and it is guaranteed by the 
government. It is set and established at a rate of 1.75 per cent 
over prime.
<P>
	A few years ago the amount was increased dramatically. I 
think it went to $200,000 from $50,000. At the same time the 
economy was going down the tubes in Ontario.
<P>
	As Don Cherry says, you don't have to be a rocket surgeon to 
figure it out. If the economy is going down the tube-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Calder:</B> A rocket scientist.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> A rocket surgeon, a brain scientist. This is 
Don Cherry.
<P>
	You do not have to be a rocket surgeon to know that if we have 
an economy that has gone down the tube like the economy in 
Ontario we increase the amount of money that is available under 
the Small Businesses Loans Act that is guaranteed 90 per cent by 
the Government of Canada; that is taxpayers at 10 bucks a pop. 
What is going to happen? The banks are going to roll all of their 
questionable loans into the small business loans. They are  all 
going to be guaranteed by the taxpayer-guess what, at 1.75 per 
cent above prime.
<P>
	What entrepreneur would go into a bank and say: ``I would 
like to borrow some money but I'm prepared to pay 2 or 2.75 or 
2.5 above prime and use my own money and by the way I don't 
want the government to backstop it so you use your money 
because that is why you're in a risk business''. They go in there 
and say: ``I want a Small Businesses Loans Act loan'' and the 
bank is quite happy to have its risk guaranteed by the 
government.
<P>
	Is it any wonder that the use of small businesses loans 
skyrockets? This is not rocket science here. This is fairly basic.
<P>
	Then what do we do? We say we are going to try to increase 
the amount of money that is made available under the Small 
Businesses Loans Act to small business. What is that going to 
do? That is going to give the banks that much more freedom to 
get all of their small business loan accounts guaranteed by the 
taxpayer.
<P>
	That distorts the banking business and it distorts the 
responsibility of the entrepreneur going into business. When 
someone goes into business, it is not the responsibility of the 
taxpayers to hold them harmless from risk because with risk 
comes reward.
<P>
	In the report there is one particularly good recommendation 
that I would hope the government would take to heart and 
incorporate: ``The program should increase the availability of 
credit rather than allowing lenders to reduce the risk on loans 
that would be made without the guarantee''.
<P>
	That means the banks should be making loans to small 
business and the loan rate should be commensurate with risk. If 
the Government of Canada, that means the taxpayers of Canada, 
is going to be guaranteeing loans to businesses, small or 
medium, those loans should carry a rate of interest 
commensurate with the risk so that in the long term small 
business loans would be self-financing or self-liquidating. The 
losses of some would be offset by the profits of others.
<P>
<B>(1605 ) </B>
<P>
	Surely if a loan is going to be guaranteed by the Government 
of Canada, the taxpayers of Canada, that should carry a cost to 
the user that it would ensure that the citizens of Canada are held 
harmless from any risk. That rate should also be high enough 
that the loans may be determined and may be provided by the 
bank without having to go to the well of the taxpayer.
<P>
	If for instance the small business loans were at a rate of 2.5 
per cent and the average small business could get a loan at prime 
plus two or prime plus one and a half, there would be some 
impetus on the part of the banks and the borrower to borrow 
money without having to go to the public trough. That is the way 
it should be.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7745"> 7745 </A></B>
<P>
	That is a particularly good recommendation in the report and I 
would certainly suggest that the government should take it to 
heart. It is not so much a question of how much within reason a 
small business or an entrepreneur pays for the use of someone 
else's money, it is whether that money is available at all.
<P>
	Another consideration in the small business loans came up in 
discussion of just what part of the loan should be guaranteed. 
Should it be the first 90 per cent or the last 90 per cent? Should 
any loan be guaranteed the first half of it or the last? In my view 
it should always be, if the Government of Canada is 
guaranteeing anything, the last portion of the loan, not the first 
portion.
<P>
	If I am lending money to someone, I want that person to be 
lying awake at night trying to figure out how they are going to 
pay it back. I want to make darn sure that if I lend someone 
money their number one objective in life is repaying that money, 
not repaying the last half of it. It is pretty basic but it is real.
<P>
	A change in the Small Businesses Loans Act which is perhaps 
the most important is it should be available for working capital, 
not just for bricks and mortar, not just for equipment, not just for 
inventory.
<P>
	If a venture has the strength, and now we are talking about 
businesses that as a nation we are going to need more of as we 
get into the knowledge based economy, we are going to be 
making decisions on working capital which will allow 
entrepreneurs to develop knowledge based material such as 
computer programs, CD-ROMs, things that require virtually no 
inventory, very little bricks and mortar but without working 
capital would never get off the ground.
<P>
	The consideration of making working capital requirements of 
business available under the Small Businesses Loans Act is 
another very worthwhile objective. I would caution that we are 
going to have to be very vigilant to ensure that there is oversight 
on these loans.
<P>
	We are not doing anyone a favour if we ask them to put their 
house up, put all of their possessions up and then do not 
vigorously give an objective analysis to the new venture, to say: 
``Wait a minute. Make sure you have all your bases covered 
before you risk everything you have in life''.
<P>
	The next subject I would like to speak about is role of the 
Federal Business Development Bank. I must admit that I have 
mixed emotions about the FBDB because it is a lender of last 
resort. Its purpose is to lend money when chartered banks will 
not lend money and my feeling is that if a chartered bank will not 
lend the money or the treasury branch in Alberta, we really have 
to wonder why on earth the taxpayers of Canada should be 
taking the risk.
<P>
	I know that the banks in Canada have not over the last 50 years 
or so been particularly venturesome. There is a need for longer 
term patient capital. is possible that the  Federal Business 
Development Bank may be able to fill a legitimate role in this. 
Frankly, I just do not know.
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	I would caution that if a bank using taxpayers' money is going 
to get into the business of lending money on a long term basis to 
high risk businesses, we had better make sure that it does so in 
an extremely prudent manner. This cannot be a shotgun 
approach where we are going to throw enough money at it and 
hope we will have enough spectacular winners that they will 
offset the losers.
<P>
	That brings me to the next part of what I would like to speak 
about. It is the whole notion of governments at all levels, 
including the governments in the great province of Quebec that 
somehow consider their function, their legitimate purpose is to 
tax money from individuals, take it into the government and 
then lend it out to other people to go into business against 
businesses or individuals who paid the taxes in the first place.
<P>
	What is it about us as politicians that when we get elected we 
somehow think we have the knowledge or the ability to tell the 
private sector what it should do? How is it that we think we 
somehow have the right or even the responsibility to manage an 
economy? Our country did not get into the hole by $535 billion 
federally because we in this House have proven to be such great 
stewards of the taxpayers' wealth.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> What are you doing 
here?
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> My hon. colleague across asks what I am 
doing here. I am here to try and stop this foolishness. I am here 
to try to put an end to this.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> My hon. colleagues across the way laugh, 
but the fact of the matter is that 25 years ago the Liberal Party 
started us on this slippery slope, thinking it is somebody else's 
money.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Here it comes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> It is giggle time over there. I thought that 
might happen. I just happen to have a list of financial 
institutions that have gone down the tube since 1970 for which 
the taxpayers of Canada have picked up the pieces. There are 32 
of them, $9,392,000,000. Of that, there is $5,189,000,000 in 
recoveries. Somehow there is $4 billion of taxpayers' money, 
people who are struggling to get by earning $8 to $10 an hour, 
going to the government and all of a sudden we are backstopping 
huge businesses. There are a few more here, another three pages.
<P>
	I do want to compliment the government on one of these. This 
is through western economic diversification. This was federal 
funding to Consumers' Paper Corporation and SHOTCO 
Ammunition Corporation. They were cancelled by the minister 
in charge of western economic development. One was labelled 
as a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7746"> 7746 </A></B>
<P>
political handout and the other 30 per cent owned by the  
Venezuelan military. At least it is looking at it. I give the 
government credit for that.
<P>
	Meanwhile we have Bell Helicopter, $165 million; Algoma 
Steel, $15 million-pages and pages of money that has been lent 
by governments to small and medium size business that has been 
written off. It is not our responsibility as elected members of 
Parliament to-
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> What do you mean 
written off?
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> What do I mean by written off? From the 
Department of Industry; International Tin Council, $4.6 
million. From FORD-Q; Nambera Studio, $63,000, a grant to a 
company that went bankrupt. From ACOA; Preston &amp; Area 
Development Fund, $144,000, $570,000 write-off, 
uncollectable. There are zillions of them. Maybe not zillions, 
there are some success stories.
<P>
	Would we have had the same successes whether or not 
taxpayers' money was involved in underwriting these 
businesses? That is the question.
<P>
	There are some instances where taxpayers' money has proven 
to be beneficial. For instance, the hon. member opposite has 
brought to my attention time and time again the auto pact and 
what a great benefit it has been to the country. However, when 
we are talking about these things, we are talking about huge 
sectoral vision things. We are not talking about the little 
industry or a little micro thing. We are talking about vision and 
the broad picture.
<P>
	We did not get into this mess by accident. We got into it 
because we thought we could make investment decisions on 
behalf of individual taxpayers. We cannot do that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I continue to marvel at the 
member's remarks because I never realized he was such a 
defender of the banking institutions in our country. I thought 
that essentially he agreed with most of his colleagues' 
recommendations, that this was an opportunity and a time in our 
history when all members of Parliament could get together and 
challenge the financial institutions to change their attitude and 
banking practices toward small and medium sized businesses. 
That of course was the essence and the purpose of this debate 
today.
<P>
	I will get right to the question and I will take less than two 
minutes. The question goes back to the the member's 
recognition of the auto pact and the fact that this is an area where 
legislators made a decision that the automobile industry was an 
industry that we would support.
<P>
	We have also made similar decisions in the House of 
Commons for the oil and gas sector. Is the member suggesting 
that legislators should have nothing to do in trying to assist the 
oil and gas sectors of the country?
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Mr. Speaker, I point out to the hon. member 
opposite that he must have been working on that question for me 
during the first 15 minutes of my presentation. At that time I 
spent a fair amount of time talking about the towers of gold and 
feet of clay and what led to it and how that came about.
<P>
	Certainly no one would ever see me standing and defending 
the banks. The banks certainly do not need any defence by me 
nor would they be likely to get it.
<P>
	The second question had to do with the role of government in 
regulation in the oil and gas industry and in particular the auto 
pact. Government has a legitimate role to play in the financial 
affairs of the country. However, the legitimate role should be to 
ensure that the marketplace is fair, to ensure that competition 
exists, to ensure that consumers are not taken advantage of by 
any industry that has an oligopoly or a monopoly. We are talking 
about the banking industry as an oligopoly.
<P>
<B>(1620 ) </B>
<P>
	The government has a role to play in water resources, in 
resources like oil and gas. We have to ensure that we have a 
competitive marketplace, that we have a tax structure for 
instance that encourages people to invest their money in the oil 
and gas industry.
<P>
	The government does not have a role to play in picking 
winners and losers in the marketplace. It does not have a role to 
play in taking money from me and giving it to somebody else 
and saying: ``You are the business that we want''.
<P>
	Hon. members opposite pointed out the role of government in 
their science and technology review. Some of the most esteemed 
people in the country came together under the auspices of the 
Department of Industry to discuss science and technology in 
Canada. They said it is not the role of the government to pick 
winners and losers but to assist winners that have been decided 
by the marketplace.
<P>
	I realize that it is very difficult to make the distinction but 
there is a distinction. The marketplace decides who the winners 
are and what has to be done to support them. The way we can 
support winners in industry is by making sure that we have a 
steady supply of educated and trained people as a workforce for 
them. That is one of the things that we can do.
<P>
	The member opposite asks: ``What about Bell helicopters?'' 
What about Bell helicopters? We throw all that money at Bell 
helicopters. What about Boeing? It is talking about picking up 
its toys and going home because we ended up buying some air 
buses.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7747"> 7747 </A></B>
<P>
	We get involved in deciding who are going to be winners and 
who are going to be losers. I am trying desperately not to bring 
up the names of Lavelin-Bombardier and that whole group in 
the aerospace industry. How much of what that company has 
done would have been done had we not gone to them with a 
public purse and they had had to do it themselves.
<P>
	The shareholders of Bombardier-Lavelin are the ones that get 
the benefits. Joe Taxpayer earning $10 an hour is not getting a 
nickel from them.

	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to ask my colleague from Edmonton Southwest what 
he thinks of the recommendations made by the Standing 
Committee on Industry in its report concerning the efforts the 
government must make to support the new economy based on 
high technology, patents, research and development, technology 
transfers, with very little concrete guarantees compared to what 
is provided to lending banks. We know this is a problem for 
those who deal with creative people, but then it is tomorrow's 
economy.
<P>
	I want to know if my colleague thinks that the report does not 
go far enough in this area?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Mr. Speaker, the report is the first tentative 
step in that direction. The fact that nobody quite knows how to 
address this is reflected in the report. The possibility of the 
Small Businesses Loans Act being amended to include working 
capital will go a long way to solving that problem.
<P>
	Therefore this has been addressed tentatively in the report. I 
say tentatively because I am sure that most people share a little 
indecision on just where we should go.
<P>
	If I may in 10 seconds, I would like to sum up where the 
Department of Industry should focus. We should try to establish 
and to maintain a culture that rewards entrepreneurship, 
innovation and research and ensures a level, competitive, honest 
marketplace.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Guelph-Wellington, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise to participate in this debate 
concentrating on one of the most important aspects of Canadian 
society. The government has recognized that small business is 
our future.
<P>
	Small business creates many of our new jobs, stimulates our 
economy and provides employment for millions of Canadians. 
In Guelph-Wellington and elsewhere when small business 
succeeds, Canada succeeds.
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	I was a small business owner. I am excited about what the 
government is doing to assist small and medium sized business 
in my riding of Guelph-Wellington and across Canada. I can 
tell you, Mr. Speaker, that many of my constituents are excited 
about it too.
<P>
	I would like to spend some time concentrating on labour skills 
and the importance of further enhancing the competitiveness 
and growth of our small and medium sized businesses. I have 
had the opportunity to meet with many small business owners 
and managers throughout Guelph-Wellington. They are 
excited about their future. They believe they have one. They 
weathered the recession and they weathered the GST. They want 
government help in order to succeed. They need government, 
though, to get out of the way where it creates unnecessary 
bureaucracy and red tape.
<P>
	I have been told over and over again: ``Please, get this red tape 
away from us''. Single shop people cannot handle it and the 
government is going to address some of those needs.
<P>
	They want government to initiate incentives which will 
encourage their success. They count on us to do that. We can 
assist the small and medium sized business owner who wants to 
expand through providing Canadian workers with the skills to 
compete in this highly competitive and rapidly changing 
environment.
<P>
	Guelph-Wellington has one of the finest skilled worker 
forces in Canada with one of the lowest unemployment rates in 
the country. However there are still some who are unemployed. 
They want to work. There are still some in Guelph-Wellington 
receiving social assistance. They also want to work. There are 
also thousands of unskilled or underskilled workers who can 
contribute if given the skills. They have to have those skills.
<P>
	Business leaders in Guelph-Wellington know what they 
need to succeed. Our economy depends on small business; 69.7 
per cent of businesses in Ontario have less than five employees. 
The needs of each one of those businesses are unique but 
government can help.
<P>
	In the past we have spent too much time training people for 
skills that are not required. What is required now is flexible 
training programs that provide on the job training, training for 
which the employer provides time off or tuition assistance, or 
classroom training at educational institutions. Business people 
in my community will help to train workers because they want to 
ensure that our community and, more important, all of Canada 
have the best skilled labour force so that we can compete in this 
world.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7748"> 7748 </A></B>
<P>
	We must train people for jobs that do exist or will exist and 
business must play a role in both identifying these positions as 
well as helping in the training process. This is a win-win 
situation.
<P>
	Guelph-Wellington business people want better 
information. They want to share that information with other 
business leaders across Canada. Our knowledge based economy 
means that we must work together to make it work. Eighty-five 
per cent of new employment is being created today in small and 
medium sized businesses.
<P>
	Our businesses will need child care workers, veterinarians, 
dental hygienists and psychotherapists in the near future. If we 
are going to prepare for the future we must invest in people 
today.
<P>
	The social security review process will assist us in identifying 
priorities and overcome the obstacles to successful skills 
development in Canada. We must decide how basic skills 
training can best be improved and what priority this training 
should receive.
<P>
	Employers in my riding want to be given a better role in 
training. They want to be consulted and informed and they want 
to participate in all facets of skills training. Already employers 
and employees are working together to shape this kind of 
training. The reason for quality skills training is obvious: 
Well-trained workers are more employable and can adapt more 
easily if they must change jobs.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	The enthusiasm is there. Guelph-Wellington workers want 
the skills necessary to compete. They want to be able to adjust to 
marketplace changes and they do want to work. The employers 
in my riding are asking for new and innovative ways to provide 
training. They want tax credits, direct government assistance, 
educational leave and work sharing agreements. Like their 
workers, they are not looking for handouts. They want the tools 
which will enable them to invest in developing employee skills. 
Investing in the workforce of Guelph-Wellington means 
investing in our future.
<P>
	The workplace is changing. Canada is looking to expand into 
an ever competitive global market. As the Prime Minister and 
Team Canada have shown us over the past few days, we are not 
afraid of competing with the world's best. We are the world's 
best. Business people in Guelph-Wellington and elsewhere in 
Canada know they can do business anywhere in the world. They 
need workers who are adaptable, flexible and willing to learn 
new job skills.
<P>
	We are talking about investment. Business leaders know that 
smart investment leads to success. We must invest in our people 
in order to compete, to expand, to grow, to be healthy. We must 
encourage lifelong learning. Gone are the days where a worker 
can be trained for a position of 30 or 40 years. We must build on 
providing literacy training, encourage our young people to stay 
in school and to prepare for the jobs that are  available and 
provide incentives for individuals and employers to invest in 
continuous skills upgrading. Learning is a lifelong adventure.
<P>
	Responding to the demands of the global marketplace means 
keeping pace with changes in today's workplace. The 
progressive business person in Guelph-Wellington knows that 
for every dollar spent on training by Canadian businesses 
American businesses spend twice as much. Japanese business 
spends five times that and German business spends eight times 
that. Without ongoing skills training we cannot survive.
<P>
	This government is forging partnerships. Team Canada has 
shown what working together can do for Canada. 
Guelph-Wellington business people want to be partners with 
their employees. Workers want their employers to be successful. 
All want government to work. We know that investing in people 
will result in a highly skilled and competitive workforce in 
Canada. I am proud of the optimism of businesses in 
Guelph-Wellington. They are looking ahead. They have 
weathered a terrible storm.
<P>
	Our workers do not want unemployment insurance or social 
welfare. They want to work. They want to contribute in a 
successful and expanding society. They want to give their 
children and they want for themselves the skills necessary to 
ensure economic prosperity. They are tired of facing layoffs and 
work slowdowns. They want sustainable employment. They 
want to be the best that they can be.
<P>
	The United Nations has stated that Canada is the best place in 
the world in which to live. Through continued partnerships 
while fostering training, Canada will continue to be the best 
place in the world to live.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I want to touch on a couple of points the hon. 
member mentioned. I acknowledge that certainly people in 
Canada want to work and people in Guelph-Wellington indeed 
want to work. They want jobs. No one wants to be on welfare, 
although that seems to be somewhat of an industry in the country 
these days.
<P>
<B>(1635 ) </B>
<P>
	The hon. member touched on the fact that the United States, 
Japan, Germany and one other country spend many more times 
on worker training than does business in Canada. I do not doubt 
that statistic for a moment but the fact is that by comparison the 
cost of doing business in those countries is many times less than 
it is in Canada.
<P>
	The fact that probably our businesses are not spending an 
equal amount of money on training programs is that they cannot 
afford it. The taxation levels for small and medium sized 
business in this country are many times higher than what it is in 
the four countries the hon. member mentioned. The cost of 
doing business in this country with taxation in all its forms, 
property taxes, payroll taxes, is many times more than in other 
countries.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7749"> 7749 </A></B>
<P>
	The fact is the other countries simply have more money to 
spend on training programs. They do not have a $40 billion 
deficit ratio to GDP that we have in Canada. They do not have a 
$535 billion debt which when ratioed out to the GDP is almost 
uncontrollable or we are going to have a terrible time making a 
dent in it. They do not have the financial problems Canada has.
<P>
	The problems that Canada has with its financial house is a 
direct factor in the cost of doing business in this country 
particularly for small and medium sized business which 
invariably do not have the advantages the large 
mega-businesses do. They struggle to a far greater extent. They 
do not have the money to put into training programs.
<P>
	There was a time in this country prior to a Liberal government 
which started this deficit and debt spiral some 25 years ago, 
when the cost of doing business made Canadian business 
extremely competitive in the world market. Canadian business 
was very profitable because we did not have these extreme 
taxation levels and cost of doing business. Those times are long 
gone.
<P>
	Right now the biggest deterrent to training programs in this 
country is that the businesses simply cannot afford it. If we did 
not have the deficit and the debt, this country would be in fine 
shape.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Chamberlain:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member 
mentioned that we cannot afford to spend money on training 
programs. I would submit that we cannot afford not to spend 
money on training programs. If we do not we will not have a 
future in this country, quite clearly. There is no question about 
that.
<P>
	There is an issue on partnerships. He raised from my speech 
the issue that other countries do develop and put far more into 
their training than Canada does. Those are true statistics but 
Canadian companies are now finally realizing that this is a very 
important part of their survival too.
<P>
	I spent this summer visiting the CEOs at many factories in 
Guelph-Wellington. They realize they have made an error in 
not bringing people along and not always at a great cost. Many 
times they could have people on the floor doing things halfway 
through a shift that they have not been thinking about doing. 
They have not necessarily seen the new technology coming 
down the pipe. I submit to the hon. member there are a lot of 
things we can do better in that area. Our industries know that. I 
encourage the hon. member to take some time to see this for 
himself.
<P>
	The member is quite right. Our businesses have a real problem 
with some of the wages, CPP and other programs they have to 
pay into. Our finance minister has continually said that one of 
the things this government is committed to doing is that we will 
meet our 3 per cent target. That will help us a lot.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="STANDINGCOMMITTEEONINDUSTRY">STANDING COMMITTEE ON INDUSTRY</A></H3>
	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it gives 
me great pleasure to involve myself in the debate on the industry 
committee report ``Taking Care of Small Business''. Indeed, I 
worked many, many hours on that committee. I thank colleagues 
from all parties for their co-operation.
<P>
	One of the basics of that report was the examination of some 
of this country's banking structures. I was pleased to take this a 
bit further this week by accepting the invitation of the Royal 
Bank to go through its executive headquarters in Toronto and 
speak with the executive staff on how they are administering 
their loan portfolios for small and medium size business. I think 
we are getting a little better understanding of where the 
problems lie but there is still much to be done.
<P>
	A mere six years before the turn of the century is an ideal time 
to consider whether we should reinvent a new industrial strategy 
for Canada. The problem with Canada and Canadians is that we 
are not aware of our own greatness. Biomedical research, 
software development, telecommunications, and geomatic 
engineering are only some of the areas in which Canada is a 
recognized world leader.
<P>
	The new economy will not be based on brawn but rather 
brains. Also, small and efficient will be the watchwords as big 
industrial structures come apart crumbling into decay. The 
smokestacks will be silenced as Canada moves from infancy to 
adulthood.
<P>
	Nuala Beck in the recent book <I>Shifting Gears: Thriving in the 
New Economy</I> refers to some of these changes. In British 
Columbia more people are engaged in telecommunications than 
in forestry. In Nova Scotia there are more people engaged in the 
workforce in education than in the fishery, forestry and 
construction industries put together.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7750"> 7750 </A></B>
<P>
	Small and medium sized businesses will be the engine of the 
future economy. This engine will be fueled by knowledge and 
driven by a new breed of entrepreneurs. They will be the 
employers and the wealth creators of the 21st century. It is by 
them that employment will be created and they will deliver new 
consumer goods.
<P>
	As a government we must redefine ourselves in light of these 
new changes. We must get out of the way of this new engine lest 
we be run over by it. But more important, we must restructure 
government so that it can assist this emerging economy, so that 
Canada's small and medium sized businesses can dare to be the 
very best in the world.
<P>
	How can this relationship between government and small and 
medium sized business be strengthened to ensure Canada 
reaches its full potential in the next century? I am pleased to see 
that our government has undertaken a number of initiatives in 
support of small and medium sized businesses. Over 30 per cent 
of our gross domestic product is accounted for by trade. 
Currently almost all of this is done by a mere handful of 
companies. Clearly this is not good enough.
<P>
	The Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade 
has undertaken along with our banks a robust venture to redefine 
what skills our business people will need to attack foreign 
markets. It ranges from aggressive training sessions, more 
intuitive financing devices for export trade through the Export 
Development Corporation and the Canadian Commercial 
Corporation to development of a data bank of contracts and 
highlights of emerging markets.
<P>
	In addition we will have to restructure our foreign trade 
missions. I have had some experience with this having been in 
Beijing in the spring. I can say that some of the people in our 
trade missions are not cognizant of some of the needs of small 
business in an international environment. These people must 
work hand in hand with business to ensure that Canadian 
companies can make the leap to international traders.
<P>
<B>(1645 ) </B>
<P>
	I need only remind my colleagues of the great successes we 
are hearing from the Team Canada mission now travelling in 
Southeast Asia. As I mentioned, I had the opportunity of visiting 
Beijing on a trade mission along with some of my parliamentary 
colleagues in the spring. Unfortunately some of my Reform 
colleagues did not bother to come along, but it was a very big 
success. It was a trade mission of a lot of small and medium size 
businesses basically from the Ontario area. We went to Beijing 
and created new alliances.
<P>
	I am happy to say that due to that process, their mayors and a 
number of people from Weifang in China, with over 85 million 
people, have signed an economic alliance agreement with the 
township of Whitby in my riding. Many of our small and 
medium size business today are trading with China. Some of our 
small  businesses have opened branches in Beijing. These are 
the things we have to do.
<P>
	The change is happening now. More employment has now 
reached my riding of Durham. I can only say that we must 
encourage more of this sort of development. I believe the 
initiatives of the Department of Foreign Affairs and 
International Trade will do just that.
<P>
	I have spoken about the area of trade. We must also address 
some of the needs of small and medium sized businesses as they 
attempt to establish themselves in the domestic market. Often 
government practices are a hindrance to them. High commercial 
and business tax assessments, meddlesome provincial standards 
and regulations, our own dreaded GST, as well as an 
inordinately high level of taxation are only some of the 
overwhelming obstacles faced by our business community.
<P>
	The deficit hems us in as a government and does not give us 
the affordability to pursue more aggressive policy. Indeed, by 
being a heavy borrower governments have crowded out the 
capital requirements of small business. In a way our best 
commitment to small and medium size business will be deficit 
control and reduction.
<P>
	Current high interest rates and high taxation are choking off 
business formation. To arrest this problem is a major 
commitment to small and medium size business.
<P>
	Having said this, I believe that there are things that 
government can do better to achieve a greater degree of business 
confidence. We should seriously consider bringing back a form 
of income tax moratorium on capital invested in small and 
medium size business. In other words, encourage capital 
retention within the business sector by deferring capital gains 
recognition to that date when the investor wants to enjoy the 
fruits of his or her labour. This would allow more aggressive 
capitalization of small and medium size businesses.
<P>
	I have mentioned how we could change the taxation system. 
We also need to reform how small and medium size businesses 
get access to new capital. I note this was the basis of a report. 
However, I think there are some other things that we could do. 
Most small businesses will fail in the first few years of 
operation. Often this is not because their product was faulty or 
poorly marketed but because of insufficient capital.
<P>
	The government has done much in this area. The Small 
Businesses Loans Act, venture programs administered by the 
Federal Business Development Bank, working ventures, and 
even section 25 of the Unemployment Insurance Act are all good 
initiatives to help small and medium size businesses but still 
there is something missing.
<P>
	What we need in this country is an aggressive, over the 
counter equity market, one which provides relatively cheap 
access to capital markets but also has the regulatory regime 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7751"> 7751 </A></B>
<P>
which can earn the respect of the general public. This is the focal 
point of investing in ourselves. Canadians have all too often 
avoided  investment risk. This has worked against our potential 
as a nation. This new and improved market would provide a 
relatively easy trading system. I note in fact that something of 
this nature already exists. It is called the Canadian dealer 
network and is part of the Toronto Stock Exchange. Still, it is too 
expensive to access and it must be made easier to access.
<P>
	Finally, we need to believe in ourselves and our great 
abilities. We need to see beyond tomorrow to what we could be. 
Business itself will have to be more effective in networking, 
seeking out solutions of excellence in everything we do. We 
need to end some of our parochial attitudes which are holding us 
back from being the best. We must learn to share with each other 
so that Canadian products will be the best there is and so that the 
21st century will truly be Canada's century.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernard Deshaies (Abitibi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to rise in the House today to speak to motion No. 16 
standing in the name of the Secretary of State for Parliamentary 
Affairs, and I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House take note of the Second Report of the Standing Committee 
on Industry (``Taking Care of Small Business'').</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I should point out that an analysis of the recommendations of 
this report and the dissenting report of the Bloc Quebecois to 
this committee provided an opportunity to ask some important 
questions about SMEs in general and SME funding in particular 
which is largely the key to economic development in Quebec 
and Canada.
<P>
	I agree the report contains some much needed changes in the 
way SMEs are financed, to raise them to the level of 
productivity and competitiveness required as a result of 
globalization. In my opinion, the number of SMEs should 
continue to rise, and their production capacity and ability to 
diversify should be improved, all of which will not be possible 
unless SME financing helps them expand from a small to a 
medium sized business and, if possible, to a very big company.
<P>
	Unfortunately, according to the statistics, between 1978 and 
1986 only 1 per cent of Canadian small businesses graduated to 
the rank of medium-sized businesses, compared with 15 per 
cent, over the same period, in the United States.
<P>
	It is very important to find an explanation for the 
unsatisfactory growth of our businesses, but in the short term, 
for many regional businesses, financing is often the problem.
<P>
	This report contains some positive reports concerning SMEs 
and SME financing, but I feel that some recommendations lack 
real substance and innovative spirit.
<P>
	I would support the committee's recommendation that the 
Federal Development Bank be confirmed in its role as 
complementary lender to small and medium-sized businesses. 
However, it must be understood that this role should be 
redefined so as to avoid duplication and overlap, since all 
provincial governments have their own government policies. 
The Government of Quebec is no exception, with its new policy 
for regionalizing development programs.
<P>
	Instead of changing the name of the Federal Development 
Bank, which would mean spending a lot of money with no direct 
benefit, the federal government would be better advised to give 
this agency a new philosophy, that is, let it act as a 
complementary lender of venture capital to businesses, the role 
formerly played by the Federal Office of Regional 
Development, which has seen its mandate crumble as a result of 
the absence of budget allocations.
<P>
	While on the subject of funding and risk capital, I would like 
to say a few words about the Small Business Loans Act my Bloc 
Quebecois colleagues referred to in their dissenting report. I 
would have liked the committee to show more vision, more 
understanding in its consideration of small and medium sized 
business funding. Small business loans are very popular tools 
among small and medium sized businesses and essential ones 
too, resolving a number of problems in terms of productivity, 
market strategy, job creation, by making the necessary funds 
available.
<P>
	To be eligible to funds under the Small Businesses Loans Act, 
SMEs must perform well in management and other areas 
considered important. These are the conditions essential to their 
success.
<P>
	In the committee proceedings, we note that the Liberal 
members of the committee completely disregard or do not 
understand the first thing about the basic needs of Quebec and 
Canadian entrepreneurs desperately seeking a way out of the 
slump.
<P>
	This government is proposing that small business groups be 
divided up in categories based on economic priorities. The 
Liberals want a new short range program to be put in place to 
support small business working capital financing just for export 
businesses.
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
	We can see once again that Liberal lobbyists have 
successfully looked after their own interests at the expense of 
other SMEs who also need financial assistance to increase their 
productivity 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7752"> 7752 </A></B>
<P>
in order to become more competitive, and they too are 
exporting.
<P>
	Innovative ideas are often required. To boost the economic 
growth in regions such as Abitibi-Témiscamingue, in my 
riding like every other riding in the region, small businessmen 
have to be able to rely on regional development funds created by 
local investors, for local investments, with the input and/or 
assistance of both levels of government naturally.
<P>
	The report deals with similar ideas and I hope that they will be 
considered by the ministers.
<P>
	By establishing a regional fund, we could avoid unfortunate 
situations like that of a woman who came to see me in my office 
after she was refused a $15,000 bank loan for working capital 
under the SBLA to start her business. The reasons given for the 
refusal were her lack of experience and the risky nature of the 
business, when she herself had already invested nearly $45,000 
in equipment. This money had come from her family to help her 
start her business and create jobs.
<P>
	By cutting funds for small businesses, the banks prevent them 
from investing and facing the globalization of the economy. One 
may wonder whether the small-business programs benefit only 
the banks, because they have rigid discretionary criteria for 
funding small businesses, as in the case I just mentioned. They 
only lend to low risk enterprises, although their mission should 
be much broader. If these banks cannot do the job, then we 
should find a government agency such as the Federal Business 
Development Bank which could do it.
<P>
	We should all know that if some of the committee's policies 
were reflected in the government's next budget, small 
businesses would unfortunately decline considerably, especially 
in Quebec but also in the rest of Canada. Testimony heard by this 
committee would seem to justify the Bloc Quebecois's 
apprehensions.
<P>
	It is harder and harder for some small businesses to obtain 
loans because the present government favours those that export. 
This shows beyond any doubt that the government has no 
job-creation policy that applies to all small and medium-sized 
businesses. It has not kept the promise that it made in its red 
book to help all small and medium-sized businesses. It was 
supposed to promote employment and its slogan was ``jobs, 
jobs, jobs'', but the reality for many small businesses now 
sounds more like ``bankruptcy, bankruptcy, bankruptcy''.
<P>
	The policies of this government are disgusting. The Liberals 
have the nerve to tell us they will create jobs when in fact they 
provoke the closure of businesses which did not get the 
financing they desperately needed, this after being told they 
would get it. Without access to adequate capital, even the most 
gifted managers and the best commercial strategies can fail.
<P>
	I want to give an example, from my riding, where federal 
support helped promote the development of a business. If the 
government would only continue to provide this kind of support, 
we would be in a position to create jobs instead of changing 
policies. The company I am referring to is called Préci-Bois, in 
the small village of  Barraute. New technology would allow the 
use of trees with a diameter of less than four inches to make 
small wooden blades, which are sold and exported to the United 
States.
<P>
	The owner personally invested over $500,000, was able to 
borrow one million dollars from a chartered bank but still had to 
find $500,000 in risk capital, for a total of $2 million. The 
Federal Office of Regional Development took eight months, 
almost a year, to make a favourable decision, but after a lot of 
representations and explanations federal officials probably 
realized this was an excellent project. Consequently, more than 
30 jobs will be created, which means that the same number of 
people will leave the welfare or unemployment rolls.
<P>
	This is a good example where, instead of having the 
government spending money, jobs are being created for the 
benefit of the whole country.
<P>
	Unfortunately, many other projects did not get sufficient 
funding. This government had promised financing sources to the 
residents of these communities-I named one village, but 
representatives from many other ones came to see me because 
they have developed projects but will not have the necessary 
funds to complete them-so that they would be able to 
implement projects which enjoyed unanimous support in their 
communities and which would have created new jobs.
<P>
<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
	These people were willing to take the risk and to create 
companies to diversify local economies. By changing its 
policies, the government broke its promises without offering 
any alternative financing. For its part, the Bloc Quebecois 
wishes to broaden the application of the Small Business Loans 
Act to include businesses' working capital for all SMEs, 
because this often makes the difference between success and 
failure for a given project, whether for export or for the local 
market.
<P>
	To implement this financing of SMEs' working capital, the 
Bloc proposes concrete and realistic solutions in its dissenting 
report, Appendix F of the report. I agree, of course, that the 
government should gauge all suggestions in the context of fiscal 
responsibility, and weigh the costs and benefits of all loan 
applications. SMEs must assume part of the technical 
responsibilities, that is to say they should have well structured, 
profitable and sustainable plans.
<P>
	Clearly, if the government accepts the suggestion of the Bloc 
Quebecois or any other positive suggestion on small business 
capital financing, there will be social and economic benefits, in 
particular in remote areas like my riding of Abitibi, in Quebec.
<P>
	In 1988, the FBDB, a major agent of development in our 
regions, gave more than $8.9 million to 86 manufacturing 
projects in Abitibi-Témiscamingue. The money was allocated 
under the Enterprise Development Program-Industrial, the 
EDP-I. This program allowed a number of businesses to acquire 
equipment and to  upgrade their facilities, thereby improving 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7753"> 7753 </A></B>
<P>
their productivity and preparing themselves for an economic 
recovery.
<P>
	I could mention a number of examples of companies who 
benefited from this financing and have, today, the means to 
export wood byproducts from our area. Presently, with a budget 
of $ 1.5 million last year instead of eight million which could 
drop to zero, FORD-Q is targetting small and medium-sized 
businesses with, as I mentioned before, a strong export 
potential, which is not bad per se, but other small and 
medium-sized businesses in the tourism industry, for instance, 
should not be neglected. More importantly, new services 
provided by FORD-Q will no longer be in terms of investment 
but in terms of technical support, that is to say feasibility studies 
review and so on.
<P>
	With such a small budget, it is going to be difficult for small 
and medium sized businesses in the Abitibi area to find funding 
in order to diversify their production since they depend mainly 
on mining and forestry as a source of funds for regional 
development. It is urgent to establish secondary industries in the 
region, which will result in more jobs, lower unemployment 
insurance expenses and, therefore, lower government 
expenditures and higher revenues.
<P>
	The facts speak for themselves. Given the new orientation, the 
$1.6 million investment by FORD-Q in a tourism project in 
Val-d'Or will be the last one of this size. I do hope that with 
respect to the recommendations of the Standing Committee on 
Industry, budgets will be sufficient to stimulate all small and 
medium-sized businesses, without any discrimination.
<P>
	To conclude, I would like to quote Mr. Alain Garneau, 
president of the Northwest Quebec prospectors association, 
Val-d'Or sector. It should be noted that, in our community, 
mining is one of the most important economic sectors. He said: 
``-most jobs are created by small and medium-sized 
businesses. They train most of the people employed in their own 
sector. They are economically and socially extremely important, 
a fact which is unfortunately too often forgotten by our 
governments-''.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It is my duty, pursuant to Standing 
Order 38, to inform the House that the questions to be raised 
tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows: the hon. 
member for Gaspé-Fisheries; the hon. member for Calgary 
Southeast-CRTC; the hon. member for Davenport-Law of the 
Sea.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Terrana:</B> Mr. Speaker, apparently one of my colleagues 
in the opposition would like to speak first. He has an emergency. 
I would not mind letting him go first.
<P>
<B>(1705 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> A most courteous act by one of our 
members in favour of the hon. member for Prince 
George-Bulkley Valley. Then we will switch back.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I do wish to extend my appreciation to the hon. 
member for letting me speak. I am going to split my time with 
the hon. member for Fraser Valley West. I will take 10 minutes.
<P>
	We are talking about small business today. That is something 
that I am not totally unfamiliar with, having spent a number of 
years in small business, most of my life actually. I have come 
face to face with almost every single problem that small 
business today and over the last 25 or 30 years could ever face. I 
am happy to say that I was able to meet those challenges in most 
cases.
<P>
	Although I agree with the report from the committee in many 
respects, I think it is important today that I spend some time 
talking about the difficulties and the attitudes of small business 
if for no other reason than to try and put it again in front of the 
government and again in front of the banking industry, if it 
happens to be listening today, so that some of the challenges that 
small businesses face is driven home to them as well the 
important role that small business plays in the economy of 
Canada.
<P>
	Most people probably believe that it is Esso, IBM, General 
Motors and the other mega companies that we all so familiar 
with that are the engine that drives the economy in this country. 
These same people would probably be of the opinion that it is 
these large corporations, these mega companies, that employ the 
majority of the people in this country. This is truly not the case. 
In fact the opinion that these mega companies drive the 
economy and hire the most people in the country is very far 
removed from reality.
<P>
	The truth is that the economic health of this country depends 
on small business. It is the small businesses with less than 20 
employees that create new jobs, create new growth in the 
country, and create growth in the economy and opportunities for 
Canadian workers.
<P>
	Given the importance of the role that small business plays in 
the economy of this country it is surprising, as highlighted in the 
report from the Standing Committee on Industry, to see again 
the numerous obstacles and challenges that small business must 
continue to deal with in order to simply do business in this 
country, obstacles established by government and by the 
banking industry in this country.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7754"> 7754 </A></B>
<P>
	I hope today that the banking community and the government 
will take note of what is being said here today as well as the 
contents of the report in the interest of the health and welfare of 
the country, the survival and growth of small business in this 
country, and the future well-being of Canada.
<P>
	In 1990 small business employed some 4.2 million people in 
Canada. That is out of a total of 12 million people who are 
working in this country. Small business was responsible for 80 
per cent of all new jobs created between 1977 and 1987 and it 
continues. Small business continues to be the lifeblood of the 
Canadian economy.
<P>
	The government is truly aware of these numbers. It has 
displayed its understanding of the importance of the role that 
small business plays in the country. As a matter of fact, the red 
ink book devotes quite a few pages to extolling the virtues of 
small business in Canada and some of the challenges and 
impediments that small business faces.
<P>
<B>(1710 ) </B>
<P>
	The budget promised a small business review, the purpose of 
which would be to determine how government can help these 
smaller firms succeed. It recognized in the budget that the tax 
burden, paper burden, lack of financing and lack of access to 
government information and programs were all issues that 
needed to be addressed by this government in relation to small 
business.
<P>
	During the G-7 in Naples on July 9 all countries agreed that it 
was important to focus on removing the challenges and the 
impediments to small and medium sized business. It was 
important to the lifeblood of the economies of all the countries 
that participated in that conference.
<P>
	In short, the government is certainly well aware of the 
importance of small business and the various difficulties it 
encounters. The government knows about small business 
according to the report from the industry committee. It is 
reminded of it every night as well during the required reading of 
the red ink book and is reminded of small business importance 
when attending international economic conferences.
<P>
	Beyond trips to Naples, beyond the red ink book rhetoric, 
beyond the issuance of this report, what has the government 
done to assist this vital sector of the economy? We have had lots 
of talk, lots of words and lots of promises. In fact, what has been 
accomplished in the year since this government took office to 
help small business is almost absolutely nothing.
<P>
	I spoke earlier about some of the things the government could 
do to encourage the banking industry, the big six that controls 
the banking community in this country. They control all the 
financing for small business. I spoke of some things they can do. 
Make no mistake about it, until the government puts a hammer 
to the heads of the big six that control all the money and tells 
them they are going to have to start paying attention to  small 
business in a real way, nothing is going to happen in the area of 
financing for small business.
<P>
	That is one thing the government can do. It does not have to 
wait for two or three years. It can do it almost immediately. It is 
the government. It controls the regulations that govern the 
banking industry in Canada. That is something it can do right 
away.
<P>
	In the government's last budget it created another impediment 
when it increased the taxes on all medium sized business that 
had at least $15 million in capital. We are not talking about 
small business in this group, but there are many small 
businesses that benefit from medium sized businesses having 
this kind of capital and this kind of revenue. It increased the 
taxes on that particular sector of medium sized business.
<P>
	Now the Minister of Finance in his new work entitled ``A new 
framework for economic policy'' is of the opinion, and this is 
surprising, that income taxes and payroll taxes distort economic 
behaviour and stunt economic growth.
<P>
	All he had to do was walk downtown and talk to a few small 
businesses and he would have got this in a moment without 
having to spend a lot of time pondering it. It is not a trade secret 
in the small business community that taxes hurt.
<P>
	Nowhere are taxes more abundant than on small and medium 
sized businesses. This is the major deterrent to economic growth 
of small businesses and expansion and job creation. They have 
income tax, payroll tax, capital tax, sales tax, property tax, and 
who knows what other taxes.
<P>
	If we take the ratio of taxes levied on a business in relation to 
the income of the business we find that small businesses are 
saddled with 30 per cent more taxes in comparison with larger 
firms. Payroll and local taxes hit small businesses particularly 
hard. They carry up to 44 per cent of the tax burden in this area 
while the megafirms carry some 28 per cent or less.
<P>
<B>(1715 ) </B>
<P>
	I just want to sum up now by saying that I stated in this House 
before that the biggest thing this government can do to help 
private sector job creation, to help private sector growth in the 
economy is get out of the pockets of business. In particular, that 
applies to small and medium size business. They are the 
lifeblood of the Canadian economy.
<P>
	That is the area that the Minister of Finance and the Minister 
of Industry can look at if they want the economy to grow. That is 
the area they should be looking at if they want to reach that 
magical 3 per cent deficit to GDP. That is the area they can look 
at to help small and medium size businesses. One place they 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7755"> 7755 </A></B>
<P>
have to concentrate is lowering the tax levels and getting on the 
backs of the big financial institutions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Iftody (Provencher, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise in the House today to debate and discuss the 
report of the Standing Committee on Industry on small business, 
taking care of business.
<P>
	All members on that committee worked very hard to produce 
what has been called by the <I>Financial Post</I> a mini task force 
report because of its depth. Considerable thought was given to 
the precise nature of the recommendations. It is heartening to 
hear helpful suggestions from members on the other side of the 
House with respect to the contents of the report.
<P>
	I would like to mention a couple of things with respect to what 
is happening in this country in terms of job growth and 
economic growth, let us say since January. We can use that as a 
timeframe. There were 327,000 new jobs created, most of those 
in the manufacturing sector which, as the House will know, are 
long term jobs. Only 11,000 of those are considered part time 
jobs.
<P>
	I would like to share with members on the other side of the 
House that the most recent economic indicators on a number of 
different fronts suggest that business confidence is at a record 
high, profits are up, expectations for hiring are also on the rise. 
The retail industry in this country is expecting the greatest 
volume of retail sales this Christmas. The reason is that 
consumers are now buying cars, microwaves and refrigerators 
and so on, what are considered the soft market items or the 
confidence items in the economy.
<P>
	This government has set a framework to give confidence to 
small businesses that are now producing the jobs, a confidence 
that we need in this country.
<P>
	I would like to speak briefly about my riding in Manitoba, the 
rural riding of Provencher, and the importance of small business 
to rural Manitobans and to rural people across Canada. Because 
of the farming communities I represent which provide the 
lifeblood of small business and economic activity in rural areas, 
a number of small businesses have sprung up around those. One 
of the larger communities I represent, Steinbach, has done 
tremendous things working closely with the farm community 
and has developed a number of leading Canadian companies, 
taking off from basic family businesses. Small business is an 
important element in rural Canada and something we ought to 
continue to support.
<P>
	Earlier a member from the Reform Party mentioned his 
concerns about the use by small business of the instrument 
called western economic development. I believe it was a 
member from Edmonton. I would remind him and the House 
about a number of projects that were funded in Alberta, almost 
800 since 1988 until 1992 or thereabouts. In Alberta 800 
projects in Alberta were funded under the western economic 
development program, a number of them in Edmonton.
<P>
<B>(1720 ) </B>
<P>
	I noticed one recently with great interest with the Edmonton 
Chamber of Commerce where it received about $17,500 under 
western economic diversification to undertake a symposium 
with business people in Alberta to seek ways it might access 
Asian Pacific markets and assist its small businesses. I do 
believe that we are making a contribution, a very valuable one, 
even in Alberta.
<P>
	Let me speak briefly about one of the other questions that was 
raised here earlier with respect to women in small business. In 
my riding of Provencher I have had a great number of calls and 
interest by women starting small businesses. We have to give 
this idea considerable thought.
<P>
	Between 1990 and 1994 during the recession the majority of 
companies that were created were what we call 
micro-businesses. In other words, they are not really small 
businesses defined as less than 50 employees but those creating 
two, three, or maybe five or six jobs in a small community. We 
found that women, working usually out of their homes, joining 
with some other partners, are starting these small cottage 
industries that are moving toward greater possibilities in terms 
of growth.
<P>
	We have seen in the most difficult times the contribution that 
they have made to the Canadian economy. I was very pleased 
therefore when my colleague, the hon. Minister of Human 
Resources Development, announced through western 
diversification the women's business network instrument which 
we believe is going to be very helpful in terms of assisting 
women, and I hope rural women in western Canada, to access 
and network resources.
<P>
	I say this because it comes back to one of the principal 
elements of this report. Canadians, small business people in 
particular and I believe even more so women, having faced these 
difficulties are having difficulty getting access to capital. We 
believe that through a number of these government programs, 
through the implementation of the recommendations in this 
report, we are going to be able to provide those kinds of 
financial tools to individuals and small business people so that 
they can get these companies up and running.
<P>
	With respect to the banks I know it has been debated 
extensively here today. The media has given this topic a great 
deal of coverage over the last few months. This is not an exercise 
in bank bashing. I believe all members of Parliament who were 
sitting on the committee approached it with integrity and good 
faith and were honestly seeking solutions. We took it with great 
interest and respect when the banks said to us that they did not 
want to be regulated. They wanted competition and they were 
not afraid of competition.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7756"> 7756 </A></B>
<P>
	I found it quite surprising that when we announced the 
suggestion of a schedule III bank to provide more competition 
outside of the larger cities in the rural areas the Canadian 
Banker's Association said that it would vigorously oppose these 
kinds of measures, and its concern about depositors' 
investments.
<P>
	I hasten to remind those who perhaps do not know when we 
are talking about small businesses that they create 85 per cent or 
90 per cent of the jobs in the country. If the banks are concerned 
about depositors' money, who is it on the 15th and 30th of every 
month who go to the bank with they pay cheques? Who are the 
depositors? It does not take a lot of thinking to quickly conclude 
that those depositors the banks are trying to protect are people 
working for small businesses in this country.
<P>
	We have to have a closer look at that. We are willing to work 
with the banks in a very constructive way to address the needs of 
small business. It is very disconcerting to hear that they are 
criticizing some of the elements of the report.
<P>
	One of the things that I wanted to mention in my final minute 
is the most recent deal in China with the CANDU reactors 
involving some $3.6 billion and the export of high tech and 
value added jobs in this country. I wish to advise the House that 
the majority of those contracts once successful are going to go to 
hundreds of high tech companies that will export in terms of 
services and direct sales their capabilities to this China deal.
<P>
	I thank the government and the Prime Minister for taking 
leadership in that role, for undertaking those memorandums of 
understanding on those deals. I believe it is going to help small 
business all over Canada.
<P>
<B>(1725 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it is a pleasure to talk about taking care of small business.
<P>
	One of the things I want to concentrate on here in my 10 
minutes in speaking about what I think small business needs in 
this country is government involvement in small business. I am 
going to select for my example ACOA, the Atlantic Canada 
Opportunities Agency, which the government is up to its arm 
pits in donations, grants and subsidies on.
<P>
	We all know there has been a shift in political ideals in recent 
years. The government now talks about a fiscally responsible 
way of operating business, how to cut dollars and how to operate 
efficiently which is a good change for this government. 
However, I think when you look at where this government has 
come from from a sociological point of view, you only have to 
look at what Michael Thomas once said, just because you have 
been bad at socialism doesn't mean you will be good at 
capitalism. That fits well in my mind with this particular 
government because I do not think this government has a real 
good idea of what capitalism really is. I am going to demonstrate 
that by talking about ACOA.
<P>
	The Business Council of British Columbia has recently issued 
a report on cutting the deficit. The business council gave all 
kinds of suggestions on how the government might be able to do 
that. One of the suggestions it made was to phase out all three 
regional development agencies.
<P>
	I know there was some talk here earlier about regional 
economic development programs but it is relative today to talk 
about that in the line with small business. The relevance is we 
have our hands into small business in two ways. We tax them to 
death and we create a terrible inequity between small business. 
Why do we do that? On the one hand we give some grants and 
subsidies. Note that it is non-taxable, just a gift. It is like 
winning the Lotto 6/49. The competitor down the street has to 
borrow money to try to get some kind of capital back into his 
business or if they want expansion they have to borrow money. 
ACOA comes along in many cases in Atlantic Canada and just 
issues a cheque.
<P>
	I have done a lot of talking to some of the recipients of ACOA 
grants in Atlantic Canada. We have also had some discussions 
with ACOA. I want to give members an idea of some of the 
grants that come out of this operation, not to mention the fact 
that the management of ACOA is well known for its spending 
habits. I really do not have to get into that because that is known 
all across Canada.
<P>
	Let us just take a look at some of the grants that are given to 
small business in Atlantic Canada. For instance, Cynthia Billard 
in Newfoundland received $37,105 to construct two 
housekeeping units. That is a gift from the taxpayers of this 
country. I somehow think that if somebody came knocking at my 
door in Fraser Valley West, British Columbia and asked if I 
would like to give Cynthia Billard some money toward building 
two housekeeping units out of my taxes, my answer would be no. 
You do what the other people do when they want to expand on 
their housekeeping units. They borrow money or they save their 
money through profits from using their other units and they 
allow the expansion that way. We do not give money to some and 
not to others. It creates a terrible imbalance in small business.
<P>
	I will run through a lot more of these grants. This government 
is quite well known for giving grants around the country.
<P>
<B>(1730 ) </B>
<P>
	Let's take Mr. Stedman Brophy. He advertised in hunting 
magazines and attended trade shows. He was given $5,000. 
Congratulations. They have given $5,000 of taxpayers' money 
away. How did that benefit the other people in the same line of 
business? It does not.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Did the hon. member 
ask him?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7757"> 7757 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> The question I am asked by 
one of the Liberal members is: did I ask him. I really do not have 
to ask him. He is not going to complain. This individual is not 
going to complain. He got $5,000 tax free from this generous 
Liberal government.
<P>
	What about the people in similar industries down the street 
who did not get any of that money? They went to the bank and 
borrowed money, or saved money to produce a similar exercise. 
Is it the idea of this Liberal government to perhaps try to cover 
everybody in Atlantic Canada that is in business and try to get 
everybody at the trough all the way along the line.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mifflin:</B> Did you tell them that when you were 
campaigning in St. John's West?
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, let us look at a 
couple more. I invite the Liberal members here and all the 
people watching and listening to see if they would spend their 
tax money this way.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Irrelevant.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Let's talk about Ducky's 
Homebrew in Newfoundland that got $15,816 tax free, I might 
add with no pay back, risk free, to establish a facility to produce 
home brew beer kits.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> What is wrong with 
that?
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Again, one of the Liberal 
members asks: ``What is wrong?'' What is wrong is this. In my 
community one of these home brew small businesses just started 
up as a matter of fact. The fellow saved his money, he was telling 
me, for something like 10 years in another business. He sold that 
one off. Now he is trying to establish another one. He did not get 
Lotto 649-type grants from the government. He did not get 
money from the taxpayer. He saved his money and he borrowed 
some more money. What is wrong with that?
<P>
	Let's go to some more. Gerald's Machine Shop Limited, to 
purchase a computerized milling machine received $70,552. 
What about the other machine shops? What will be done for the 
other machine shops? How does small business get competitive 
in this world when one machine shop gets a grant, not repayable, 
and not the other? How does small business survive doing that? 
How does it stay competitive? The government has to get out of 
the business of handing those cash cows out to some and not 
others.
<P>
	Let's talk about some other folks who want to establish a 
restaurant and bakery that got $48,000. Another person in 
Newfoundland got $63,560 to upgrade hotel rooms and 
housekeeping units
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Why is the member 
picking on Newfoundland?
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> The question was: why am 
I picking on Newfoundland. I am not. I am going to go through 
all of the provinces of Atlantic Canada. I am going to go through 
all of them.
<P>
	Why would we upgrade hotel rooms and housekeeping units 
for one person and not all the others?
<P>
	Let's talk about some bigger bucks, about Maynard Limited in 
Newfoundland. They received $363,000 to expand existing 
facilities by adding a dining room. Is that the right thing to do? 
Is it fair to all the other organizations in the province, in the 
country for that matter, who want to expand their dining rooms? 
What kind of mentality is this? How much money did we give to 
Newfoundlanders? There were 344 contracts in Newfoundland. 
We gave $19,906,166 taxpayer dollars to some and not to others. 
Justify to me the logic in that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> They are all 
businesses.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Calgary West):</B> Check what party they donated 
to.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> The suggestion is to check 
the party to which they donated. I am sure there are a lot of 
political hacks because we know this party likes their patronage 
so that would be obvious.
<P>
	Let's skip Newfoundland then and go to P.E.I. In P.E.I. 
Broadview Properties Incorporated got to modernize their motel 
by upgrading furniture and equipment, et cetera, for $74,000.
<P>
<B>(1735) </B>
<P>
	Members opposite do not like what they hear. They do not like 
the fact that we are talking about taking care of business. The 
way the government takes care of business and creates equality 
in business is to give tax free money to some and not to others. 
The government's problem is that it has no idea how to be 
competitive. Competition to this government means giving to 
some and not to others. It is who you know.
<P>
	In Nova Scotia 559 contracts were issued since November 4, 
1993 for $27,721,000 to some and not to others. In New 
Brunswick, 617 contracts for $35 million were issued.
<P>
	How is equity created between competing small businesses by 
giving to some and not to others? Your book may say a lot. It 
does say a lot. There are positive things in the book but you do 
not have what it takes to be capitalists.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fred Mifflin (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I was listening very intently to the debate on this 
excellent report. Being on House duty I was listening in the 
lobby with great interest. I was very impressed with the quality 
of the speeches and decided to come into the House and hear 
them firsthand.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7758"> 7758 </A></B>
<P>
	I must say I felt a certain amount of disappointment when I 
arrived because all of a sudden the presentations stopped being 
about this excellent report. I am sitting here in my seat and I 
cannot really believe what I am hearing. A responsible member 
of Parliament is getting up and complaining about a system that 
supports Atlantic Canada and he states that the people from his 
area would not support it.
<P>
	I have a comment and a question. I am very seldom partisan 
but I have to say I find it very difficult to understand how the 
hon. member intends to go to Newfoundland after that speech to 
campaign on his support for ACOA and for regional 
development in Newfoundland. I suggest he frame this speech 
and turn around in reverse and never show it to anybody when he 
goes down looking for votes in Newfoundland.
<P>
	He is suggesting that ACOA is made up of a group of 
imbeciles that just willy-nilly give out money to some 
businesses and not to others. He is totally wrong. I am telling 
him that the vice-president of ACOA, Gordon Slade, happens to 
be one of the finest civil servants in the country. He is a very 
responsible person. He is very selective in what he does. When 
there is competition the ACOA grant is not given.
<P>
	My comment to the individual is that ACOA management 
does not work that way. It is much more responsible, much more 
selective.
<P>
	My question to him is: What is his alternative? What would he 
rather do?
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> I just love it when they 
sanctimoniously get up on the other side, Mr. Speaker. They do 
not like to hear the truth.
<P>
	The comment was that Gordon Slade is selective-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mifflin:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, is 
sanctimonious a parliamentary word?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> With respect, there is a dictionary on 
the table. I think if that word is not a parliamentary word then I 
do not know what word would be parliamentary.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Yes, I think it has more 
than eight characters in it, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	The comment was that Gordon Slade is selective in the grants 
that come out of ACOA. I would suggest that is very likely the 
truth of the matter. That is the problem.
<P>
<B>(1740 ) </B>
<P>
	It does not take a brain surgeon to go through any list to see 
that the selection of the grants in ACOA are made on an 
inequitable basis. There are all kinds of similar industries in 
Atlantic Canada. And not just in Atlantic Canada, but in 
Ontario, in western Canada. They do not get money although 
taxpayers right across the country pays into it.
<P>
	Where does the government get the right to select the 
taxpayers' money and pay it to whomever it wants on its basis? 
It is selective all right. It is a selective procedure but it is unfair 
to all those who do not get it. The answer is to get out of regional 
development grants, get out of ACOA.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Anna Terrana (Vancouver East, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
first of all I would like to say that the Liberal Party was voted 
into government. That is where we get our strength to do what 
we are doing and also get back to being a little more positive.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I am pleased to rise in this House today to speak to the motion 
on small business. My riding of Vancouver East contains many 
small businesses. Our proximity to the Asia-Pacific region 
makes us major players in negotiations with Asia and South 
America.
<P>
	Team Canada's trip to the Orient led by the Right Hon. Prime 
Minister generated a great deal of interest and enthusiasm. 
Small businesses do not have the resources required to negotiate 
directly with China but, with governmental assistance, they can 
create many jobs for Canada, as they have done for several 
years.
<P>
	Last May, I had the privilege of participating in a trade 
mission to Beijing together with over 100 small and 
medium-sized business owners. I learned a lot during this trip; I 
realized in particular that small and medium sized businesses 
cannot operate alone. They need help. Canada has much to offer 
to the world in terms of skills and resources, but we must sell our 
potential. Trips to foreign countries are extremely important to 
ensure our country's well-being and to let the world know all 
that Canada has to offer, including solid, honest and capable 
business people. In short, we must learn to become more 
aggressive.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Canada is a trading nation. The challenge is to transfer 
Canada from a nation dependent on trade into a true trading 
nation with a much larger role being played by small business.
<P>
	Having said that, I would like to discuss the export sector of 
our country. Facing global competition has become the sine qua 
non of any serious business plan. The best way to find out if your 
company is truly competitive is to tackle the export challenge.
<P>
	The arithmetic is simple. In the global market for many niche 
products and services, Canada often accounts for only 1 per cent 
or so of global consumption. Companies that do not export are 
often ignoring literally 99 per cent of their potential customers.
<P>
	The process of exporting successfully though is somewhat 
difficult, particularly for small companies who have never even 
dreamed they would have to enter global markets. The vast 
majority of companies has to take to exporting one step at a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7759"> 7759 </A></B>
<P>
time, pausing at each step to seek advice and information about 
what lies ahead.
<P>
	The owners of small businesses always emphasize that they 
are in the market for information about market opportunities and 
how to exploit them. Canada's trade commissioners can help to 
achieve this goal. The trade commissioner service has 100 years 
of experience in opening doors to foreign markets. It knows the 
ropes and can help exporters deal with the challenges of 
complex foreign environments.
<P>
	The government is in the business of offering all kinds of 
guidance to exporters, particularly to the small and medium 
sized companies that need help most.
<P>
	For example, the focus of Canada's program in support of 
fairs and missions has shifted to smaller businesses. Then there 
are the programs to provide hands-on training to new exporters 
to the United States border states, Mexico and Europe.
<P>
<B>(1745 ) </B>
<P>
	WIN Exports, the Department of Foreign Affairs and 
International Trade's electronic databank of Canadian firms 
capable of taking on export challenges, as well as its market 
intelligence and information program, is also being enhanced to 
better meet the needs of small businesses seeking niche markets 
worldwide.
<P>
	The efforts of the Department of Foreign Affairs and 
International Trade are to assist exporters start right at the 
beginning, when the decision to export is first being examined 
by entrepreneurs.
<P>
	To that end government officials work closely with the Forum 
for International Trade Training. The Forum for International 
Trade Training philosophy is that to compete successfully in 
world markets, a company that wants to export has to act like a 
long distance runner who trains for a marathon. To help out, the 
Forum for International Trade Training provides a wide range of 
services which can be customized to the skill and experience 
levels of participants. This year the program is operating in 30 
community colleges across Canada with some 1,000 students 
registered.
<P>
	FITT is a major undertaking, patterned after the 
government-business training vehicles that have long been in 
operation in Germany and Japan. As such, FITT has received 
federal and provincial government funding along with the 
support of business associations, including the Canadian 
Chamber of Commerce, the Canadian Exporters Association 
and the Canadian Manufacturers' Association.
<P>
	As significant as these developments are, we can still do 
better. We cannot rest on our laurels.
<P>
	Over the last months the Minister for International Trade has 
been listening to what Canadians have had to say through 
meetings with small and medium enterprises across Canada as 
well as a number of other venues. The message conveyed was 
consistent and clear; do less but do what you already do better. 
Government is being told that there are too many programs 
being run by too many players.
<P>
	In response to demands by the private sector, our government 
has already taken some preliminary steps which will benefit the 
business community as a whole but, more important, will also 
benefit small business.
<P>
	For example, because of their size, small businesses often do 
not have the resources to find international trade leads. 
Accordingly, we are undertaking a number of improvements to 
the way we collect and disseminate market intelligence and 
market information. We have put into place an electronic 
bulletin board service that allows exporters access to the latest 
international market information by a personal computer and a 
modem.
<P>
	We are also developing a market intelligence messaging 
system for broadcast faxing of trade opportunities. 
Furthermore, small businesses often complain about the 
plethora of government programs and are confused by what 
different levels of government are responsible for when it comes 
to international trade. This government is therefore undertaking 
a second set of measures to provide greater cohesion and focus 
to the support role played by governments.
<P>
	There is a need for better co-ordination of international 
business development activity among both federal departments 
and the provinces.
<P>
	Accordingly, this year's International Trade Business Plan 
will include the input and international business activities of all 
provinces, as well as 18 federal departments and agencies that 
are already part of the process.
<P>
	In addition, in conjunction with the provinces and a number of 
federal government departments, this government is 
undertaking a new initiative called Trade Team Canada. We are 
looking to optimize services to clients by co-ordinating the 
delivery of international business development activities among 
various levels of government. We intend to move ahead 
promptly by setting up pilot projects in co-operation with those 
provinces that have already shown an interest in the idea.
<P>
	In conclusion, the initiatives that I have been describing are 
based on a co-operative approach of the kind we need to 
mobilize Canada's export potential and in particular the 
potential of our small and medium sized businesses.
<P>
	Our government is making a conscious effort to consult 
extensively with our clients. We promised that and we are doing 
that. I do not think we should just go to our next door neighbours 
to consult but we should call all of Canada to consult with us and 
tell us what they want.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7760"> 7760 </A></B>
<P>
	Our government is making a conscious effort to consult 
extensively with our clients, the people of Canada who run our 
small businesses. I wish to assure the House that we will 
continue to seek ways to work together with the business 
community so it can meet the challenges and opportunities of an 
expanding world market. We will not stop trying until the world 
beats a path to the door of Canadian small and medium sized 
businesses.
<P>
<B>(1750) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
intently to the previous speaker's great commendations about 
the government's role in helping small business. One thing that 
strikes me as being rather opposite to the whole idea of 
government trying to help small business is the fact that the 
national debt accounts for over $38,000 for every taxpayer in 
this country. Of course small business people are taxpayers. Not 
only are they taxpayers for themselves but they create 
employment that generates all other kinds of taxpayers as well.
<P>
	I think about how small business has to labour under the heavy 
taxation caused by the national debt. This government has 
continued to increase the national debt, to increase the amount 
of burden that is being put on every taxpayer, including small 
business. How would the member expect these business people 
to compete in the international marketplace as she is saying they 
should, could and will when in fact the best thing that could 
happen to small business would be if the federal government 
were to reduce or eliminate the deficit and take the cost of this 
overburdening national debt off the backs of small business?
<P>
	What better place could the member suggest that we start after 
listening to the member for Fraser Valley West who said that this 
government seems to not just pick winners and losers but to pick 
individual people and say: ``Here is some money that is tax 
free''. He quoted all kinds of statistics and actual numbers about 
individual people or businesses getting specific amounts of 
money, $300,000 here, $75,000 there and so on.
<P>
	If the previous speaker is serious about this government 
helping all small businesses, would she recommend that her 
party and the government that she supports get out of this 
selective subsidization and grants to small businesses in various 
parts of the country in order to reduce the overburden on small 
businesses and allow them to complete?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Terrana:</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all I want to remind my 
hon. colleague that we were elected to do what we are doing, to 
create an atmosphere, and not to cut our deficit in three years or 
our debt in five. We were elected to do what we are doing.
<P>
	Second, the approach is very simplistic. We have been in 
government for one year. We have done a lot of things. We listen 
to people. They tell us what we should do. We have been hearing 
them. We listened and we heard.
<P>
	We are trying to put into place what we have heard. In the 
meantime we are taking care of the deficit as we promised.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Okanagan Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to ask the hon. member who just spoke just 
exactly what would be the manner in which business could 
actually get into a true competitive environment without 
government interference so that we would not have all this 
subsidization, so that indeed business could compete in its own 
right and so that it could do the kinds of things that business was 
intended to do without subsidization and interference by 
government to give advantage to some business over and against 
another business.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Terrana:</B> Mr. Speaker, I went to some of the hearings. 
Of course, there are those people who say: ``Don't give any 
subsidies''. Some people say: ``We need the subsidies''.
<P>
	We will slowly get there. Canada is a big country with a few 
people and a lot of regional disparities. We eventually will get 
there. We will eventually find a way to let businesses prosper on 
their own. There are more and more doing that. I am hopeful. I 
am a positive person.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
member in answering a question by my colleague commented 
that what he is suggesting, that government not subsidize 
business, is simplistic. If indeed government or civil servants 
are trying to pick winners, trying to determine how they are 
going to direct subsidies when there are many people competing 
in the same business, how are they going to wisely choose the 
businesses to give money to, if that is not being simplistic?
<P>
<B>(1755) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Terrana:</B> Mr. Speaker, this has been the system until 
now. Of course, as I said, we are looking into it and we are trying 
to get rid of it.
<P>
	We have to remember the disparities in this country. We have 
to create some kind of an atmosphere all over Canada that brings 
in the money and the jobs that are necessary to survive. This has 
been there all along and it is something that we have to cure.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Prince Albert-Churchill River, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to address this motion to take 
note of the second report of the Standing Committee on Industry 
entitled ``Taking Care of Small Business''.
<P>
	The committee report contains a thoughtful analysis of the 
financing problems small businesses face and provides a series 
of extensive and helpful recommendations on the financing 
issue. The committee is to be congratulated for its hard work and 
its excellent report.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7761"> 7761 </A></B>
<P>
	In a similar vein, I would like to formally acknowledge the 
work of the federal Ontario Liberal caucus task force which has 
also made valuable recommendations on financing for small 
businesses.
<P>
	All members of this House are aware of the great importance 
of small business to the Canadian economy. In fact the 
government is carrying out a wide ranging small business policy 
review of which the report will form a very important and 
integral part.
<P>
	However, I am particularly interested in the recommendations 
as they relate to the growth of knowledge based, high tech firms. 
Both these reports have suggested ways in which the banks 
could better respond to the financing needs of small and medium 
size businesses. It is encouraging, as both reports have pointed 
out. Canada's banks themselves are also aware of the need to do 
more to assist in the development, growth and stability of 
Canada's small businesses.
<P>
	In today's business climate, banking needs are evolving 
rapidly as are the demands on business itself. The pace of 
technological change is accelerating while the product cycles 
are shortening. Flexibility and capacity to adapt and respond 
quickly to changing market conditions are more important than 
ever before. These are some of the things that small businesses 
tend to do best.
<P>
	It is encouraging to see the beginnings of change in the 
banking culture. As important as it is to match banking practices 
with the demands of today's marketplace, that is only one piece 
of the puzzle. If any one single area is critical to the success of 
Canadian business in general and small and medium size 
businesses in particular, it is technology.
<P>
	In one sense, technology is an investment issue for many 
small firms since access to financing is often required to be able 
to utilize technology. Over and above financing considerations 
however, technology itself is key to the ability of small 
businesses to compete and thrive in the global marketplace. The 
whole area of technology presents a critical challenge to 
Canadian small businesses. For the Canadian economy to 
prosper this is a challenge we must meet.
<P>
	Small businesses created 87 per cent of all new jobs in the 
decade from 1979 to 1989. In the first six months of this year 
small businesses have created over 80 per cent of the net new 
jobs created in Canada. Since last year's election this 
government has presided over an economy that has created in 
excess of 320,000 new jobs. This is good news for all Canadians.
<P>
	Yet, there are specific areas where the performance of 
Canadian small business could improve and innovation, 
research and development and the use of technology are among 
them. Canadian companies, especially smaller firms, fall behind 
their foreign counterparts in a wide range of industries when it 
comes to protecting advancements in a number of technologies 
important to Canada. Among the OECD countries, Canada's 
share of international patents is lower than the population would  
warrant. Many small businesses are slow to innovate or to apply 
technology to improve competitiveness. Small businesses may 
lack the time or resources to become well informed about 
technological change or its implications for what they do.
<P>
<B>(1800) </B>
<P>
	They might not even recognize that solving a particular 
problem or taking the advantage of a market opportunity might 
depend on technology. Too few small businesses have the 
expertise or the capacity to absorb the ideas in technology that 
can mean success if adopted or failure if neglected.
<P>
	Businesses increasingly compete on their abilities to innovate 
in product development, marketing production, distribution, 
after sales service and internal administration. A rapidly 
changing innovative business environment helps create jobs by 
attracting and retaining international investment.
<P>
	The government is well aware of the special problems that 
small businesses face when it comes to technology and is 
committed to helping business resolve them. One of the most 
interesting and revealing approaches we have taken was a study 
designed to find out what makes growing small businesses 
successful. The strategies for success report is a joint product of 
Industry Canada and Statistics Canada. It provides an analysis 
of growing small and medium size enterprises in Canada. It 
examines the reason for the success of groups of firms that grew 
rapidly in the 1980s and provides entrepreneurs with the clues 
they need to see how they can do the same.
<P>
	The report focuses on the tactics used by small firms to make 
themselves successful and how to implement these strategies. 
For example, the more successful firms place greater emphasis 
on their ability to adopt technology and research and develop 
capabilities.
<P>
	These companies focus on developing new technology, 
refining the technology of others and improving their own 
technology. Successful firms were generally more innovative. A 
large proportion of them, 30 per cent, attributed success to an R 
and D based innovation strategy. An even larger proportion, 55 
per cent, reported having successfully introduced innovation.
<P>
	The lessons of the strategies for success report are clear but 
those lessons will remain theoretical unless they can actually be 
put into practice on the shop floor or during a service call or in 
the laboratory. That is why the government is implementing a 
number of important practical programs to help small business 
take advantage of the technology it needs to succeed.
<P>
	In August, for example, the government announced the 
Canadian technology network to deliver solutions to 
technological problems through an integrated package of 
business services. The Canadian technology network will help 
small and medium size businesses acquire, adapt, 
commercialize and manage new 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7762"> 7762 </A></B>
<P>
and complex technologies in partnership with the Canadian 
research community.
<P>
	The CTN is in effect a major consulting service which will be 
available to businesses of every size. It will provide firms with 
rapid and effective access to data, intelligence and services from 
across Canada and from foreign sources. It will build upon the 
current network of the National Research Council's industrial 
research assistance program, IRAP. The program's 260 
industrial technology advisers draw upon the work of a host of 
organizations across Canada, including provincial research 
organizations, universities and colleges, industrial associations 
and other professional bodies.
<P>
	The CTN will give the small business community easy access 
to the broad array of technology, services, skills and expertise 
offered by IRAP, together with other business related services 
through an integrated electronic network.
<P>
	The work of the CTN is nicely complemented by the activities 
of another partnership in which the federal government is 
playing a leading role. This is the Canadian network for the 
advancement of research industry and education, CANARIE.
<P>
	CANARIE is a joint project by the government and over 140 
private and public participants. CANARIE is a cost sharing 
research and development program to develop the next 
generation of networking technologies, products and 
applications. It will also help create a network to test and 
showcase advanced technology.
<P>
	CANARIE will facilitate access to and use of the information 
highway by Canadian business. It is working to upgrade 
CA*net, the Canadian branch of Internet. Essentially the 
information highway is going to be a private sector project. 
Business is doing most of the building and most of the investing 
but government has a part to play as well.
<P>
<B>(1805 ) </B>
<P>
	It must help to write the highway traffic code. In other words, 
make sure the highway develops to meet the needs of all 
Canadians in all regions and in all sectors. This is why the 
government has set up the information highway advisory 
council comprised of 30 Canadians. The members of this 
council have been given a year to set up a fairly broad set of 
questions to answer, all aimed at recommending how the 
government can speed up the development of information 
highway services.
<P>
	As Canadian businesses strive to innovate and make the best 
use of technology that can help to compete, a very important 
resource it can use is the Canadian intellectual property office. 
Within CIPO one can find a gold mine of innovation. For 
example, in the patents office there are 1.3 million Canadian 
patents. In addition, the patents office contains millions of 
foreign patent documents including 5.5 million U.S. patents.
<P>
	Small businesses can use the information available through 
the patent office to keep abreast of technological innovations 
and to avoid investing R and D dollars in projects that have 
already been explored. Patents can provide state of the art 
information on particular technologies. They can indicate which 
technologies are ready for development or which ones are viable 
but unprotected. They can help business anticipate, identify and 
respond to foreign competition or to launch a new product.
<P>
	The practical value of this information is directly related to 
the ease with which it can be accessed. The patent information 
exploration program can provide research for the information 
and patent documents about technologies, about competitors, 
about patents which have expired and can now be exploited.
<P>
	Eventually in the not too distant future information from the 
trademark office as well will soon be available from electronic 
databases using vehicles such as the information highway.
<P>
	Small businesses and individual innovators will be able to do 
so from their own stations. The automation of CIPO databases 
will contribute to developing and marketing new products and 
technologies.
<P>
	In my remarks today I have covered a wide range of topics 
relevant to small business from financing to technology, from 
the information highway to the use of patents. In all of these 
areas the federal government is doing things that are important, 
that will help small and medium size firms to take advantage of 
new and emerging technologies that are so essential to business 
growth.
<P>
	The work of the standing committee and of the Ontario caucus 
will undoubtedly help to shape and improve the course of these 
future policies. So too will the report of the small business 
working committee which will report soon.
<P>
	Technology and financing are ultimately linked, intimately 
linked and are key to the growth of an innovative small business 
sector in Canada. The small business community is central to 
our jobs and growth strategy. Helping it optimize the flexibility 
that its size gives it is a key element to our agenda for small 
business.
<P>
	With the support of this House and the other governments 
across this country small and innovative firms will continue to 
create the highly skilled jobs Canadians all across this country 
need.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
with interest to the previous member's speech. Unfortunately I 
find it is full of the same general platitudes of how well small 
business can do and how competitive it is. I asked the same 
question of the previous speaker as I did once before. How do we 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7763"> 7763 </A></B>
<P>
expect small business to be competitive in this international 
environment when it is loaded down with $38,000, each and 
every one of them, of federal debt that has to be paid through 
higher taxes and so on?
<P>
	The member for Fraser Valley East talked about the fact that 
this government is picking individual people and handing them 
all kinds of tax dollars, tax free at the same time. Everybody else 
has to pick up the cost for these things. How does he justify these 
two items when he is saying that small business is so 
competitive and should get on with the business of creating 
jobs?
<P>
	Would it not be far better to stop this nonsense of being 
selective and giving money to individual firms and individual 
people? Would it not be better also that we get rid of this deficit 
and this burgeoning national debt that is dragging small 
business down under the water?
<P>
<B>(1810 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kirkby:</B> Mr. Speaker, one thing this government has 
done very successfully is adopt its election platform, carry it 
through and do what it said it was going to do.
<P>
	I recall in the red book it indicated that we would be reducing 
our annual deficit as a percentage of the GDP to 3 per cent. Mark 
my words, this government through program review and through 
a number of initiatives has gone a long way in doing what it said 
it would do.
<P>
	I think in the budget over the next few years when we are 
dealing with our expenditure problems we will be moving in that 
direction. We are going to meet that target. We will be dealing 
with the deficit. I hope when people react to the types of budgets 
we will be bringing forward the Reform Party will be proud to 
say it did it twice as fast as we did.
<P>
	With respect to the success of western diversification and 
ACOA, I know these have been picked on mercilessly today by 
members of the Reform Party. We were also elected to enhance 
and encourage regional development right across this country. 
We have to utilize the wealth of this nation to make sure people 
all across this country have access to economic opportunity.
<P>
	We will do likewise with the deficit. We will do what we said 
we would do by utilizing these agencies to properly and 
intelligently promote regional and economic development. I 
know the Reform Party would like to leave the impression that 
somehow money is handed out willy-nilly. Such is not the case. 
The people who manage these, whether it is western 
diversification or ACOA in the Atlantic provinces, are 
extremely capable, qualified individuals who select business 
propositions on grounds of merit. Over the years we have seen a 
tremendous number of successes come out of these types of 
operations.
<P>
	As I have indicated, this government will do what it said it 
would do. We are going to reduce the deficit and we are going to 
enhance our regional economies by the sensible spending of the 
taxpayers' dollars.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member opposite talked about how the people who manage the 
regional diversification programs such as western economic 
diversification are very good at choosing businesses based on 
merit.
<P>
	I would just like to ask the hon. member specifically what 
merit. If they are choosing businesses based on merit, why do 
these businesses need special treatment compared with their 
competitors?
<P>
	I would like the hon. member opposite to give me some 
examples of businesses that have received money under these 
programs and demonstrate clearly to me first that it was fair to 
give them money when not giving competitors money. Second, 
how is merit determined?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kirkby:</B> Mr. Speaker, I noticed the members of the party 
opposite are not keen on questions about merit. I can see why.
<P>
	With respect to the issue of merit, obviously these projects are 
chosen on the basis of those which are likely to succeed as in the 
case of western diversification. They are not picked when there 
are competitors in the marketplace. They are picked when there 
is innovation or something new which is not done in the region 
in which it is proposed. This is the type of thing that I know 
western diversification picks. Probably ACOA has the same 
rules, to pick subjects and projects which are meritorious, which 
have an excellent chance of success, which will aid the 
diversification of an economy that too often has been based on a 
single or a narrow group of industries.
<P>
<B>(1815) </B>
<P>
	This is the type of progress our country needs. We are doing it 
and we are making things happen. I know that the hon. member 
will be grateful when he looks at the job statistics and sees how 
many new jobs are created all across the country by a 
government that is doing what it said it was going to do.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to participate in the debate today on taking care of 
small business.
<P>
	A few years ago the previous government loaded on small 
business one of the biggest paper burdens we have seen in many 
a long year, which was the introduction of the goods and services 
tax. It turned every small business person into a tax collector.
<P>
	The government said it was going to get rid of the GST and 
now a year later we are still waiting. Last February the Minister 
of Finance introduced his budget and took away the capital gains 
exemption. I wonder what that is doing for small business. He 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7764"> 7764 </A></B>
<P>
reduced the small business tax exemption, which caused good 
and prosperous small  businesses to pay more taxes. I wonder if 
that is what they mean by taking care of business.
<P>
	The first responsibility of government to small business and 
the millions it employs is to create an economic climate that is 
conducive to economic growth and expansion. This growth and 
expansion will lead to prosperity for the risk takers, jobs for the 
employees, create new opportunities for the unemployed, 
provide economic stability for Canadians and their families, and 
create new and novel businesses and economic opportunities.
<P>
	We have to get the government off the people's backs. We 
have to give incentive and opportunity for small businesses to 
see opportunities, take advantage of these opportunities where 
they can go forward, put their money where their mouths are, 
take the risk, take the gamble, go forward and win without the 
federal government either taxing them to death or providing tax 
free money to the competition and shooting them down at every 
opportunity.
<P>
	What are the ingredients for this economic climate? Surely it 
is a federal government that both preaches and practises fiscal 
responsibility. We expect small business to practise and preach 
fiscal responsibility, look after its credit and be able to repay its 
loans, otherwise we are not going to give them money.
<P>
	The federal government talks about fiscal responsibility but 
has yet to deliver on anything regarding fiscal responsibility. It 
had a very weak and timid objective to reduce the deficit to $25 
billion per annum. By the Minister of Finance's own admission 
he is going to miss that target, yet he has done nothing to bring 
the government back into line with its own estimates and targets. 
Government spending must be significantly reduced to restore 
order to our fiscal house and to provide some confidence to 
small business.
<P>
	Once government spending is brought under control and the 
budget is balanced, the benefits for Canadians, including small 
business people, will be a stable fiscal environment in which 
they can plan for the future, grow, develop, create employment 
and reduce the unemployment costs to the country. We could 
also then look forward to a reduction in the exorbitant levels of 
taxation that funds the voracious and excessive appetite of 
government spending.
<P>
	When the Auditor General tabled his report earlier this year, 
he said that hard choices lie ahead.
<P>
<B>(1820 ) </B>
<P>
	The federal portion of the national debt today is 
$538,000,181,919.99 according to the number I have. The debt, 
as I mentioned before, per taxpayer which includes every small 
business person who is also a taxpayer, is $38,287. The federal 
debt per capita is $18,920. As small business people go around 
the world trying to compete, to sell their product, they have to 
build into the price of that product the cost of the high taxes that 
pay for the interest on the debt.
<P>
	The Auditor General stated in his 1993 report that hard 
choices have to be made to deal with the problem of the debt. 
The hard choice is between the continued growth of the debt or 
stop digging a bigger debt hole, as we said during the last 
election. The hard choice is between continued excessive 
overspending or practising fiscal responsibility and prudence. 
The hard choice is between continued high levels of taxation, 
with the possibility of even higher taxes and new taxes to fund 
the debt or hopefully the prospect of tax relief by restoring order 
to the federal government's fiscal house.
<P>
	If we do not make these hard choices and go with what we 
have been doing before, we can guarantee that taxes will 
continue to go up. We can guarantee that our interest rates will 
remain high as we try and bring in more and more money every 
month to just pay the groceries, so to speak, of the federal 
government. The dollar will have to be maintained up so that 
foreign lenders to us will continue to lend money to Canada.
<P>
	Therefore, we expect small business and business in general 
to compete around the world as it worries about high taxes 
because of the national debt, high interest rates because of the 
current fiscal situation, a high dollar on the international money 
markets because of our situation. We still expect them to 
compete.
<P>
	Is that what we call taking care of business? I hope not. I hope 
that the federal government would see its way to changing the 
policies and dramatically reducing the spending. In that way we 
can expect small businesses to play their part, create the jobs, 
create the environment where there are more people paying 
taxes and collecting taxes and bring our whole fiscal situation 
under control.
<P>
	Unfortunately we have had nothing but paper from the 
government. A year ago it introduced a red book which stated 
that the GST would go. The finance committee sat for months 
and months and produced a report that is now on the shelf. The 
government cannot move from the report to action. We are still 
waiting for any kind of action on a report that was tabled months 
ago and promised a year ago. There has been no action.
<P>
	The Minister of Human Resources Development tabled a 
paper several weeks ago. He now says we have a problem but 
that he does not have any plan whatsoever to try and fix it.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance tabled a couple of papers recently in 
which he stated: ``We have a problem in this country but I don't 
have any idea how we were going to fix it. Let's go out there and 
see if somebody else has an idea''. Now we have a report titled 
``Taking Care of Small Business'' from the Standing Committee 
on Industry. I sincerely hope that this is not another one that is 
just going to go on the shelf and that is the end of it.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="7765"> 7765 </A></B>
<P>
	The time has come to act. Let us take a look at some of the 
statistics. In 1990, 97.2 per cent of all registered businesses in 
Canada had fewer than 50 employees; 52 per cent of Canadians 
employed in the private sector are employed by businesses with 
fewer than 100 employees; and 45 per cent of Canadians are 
employed in businesses with fewer than 50 employees. 
Therefore, there is no question whatsoever that small business is 
the engine that drives the Canadian economy. It has to be 
protected, encouraged, enhanced. It has to be competitive. They 
are the ones we depend upon to generate the taxes that we spend 
on our social programs.
<P>
<B>(1825) </B>
<P>
	I urge the government to stop the endless production of paper 
and let us see some action. Let us see it create a climate that 
fosters economic growth and prosperity rather than just picking 
a few winners and handing them all kinds of cash. Let us see a 
climate of reduced government spending, a balanced budget and 
tax relief. These are concrete suggestions. Good government 
solutions must be found and implemented to address the long 
term concerns and issues facing the small business community 
rather than giving them short term, quick fix and politically 
expedient measures.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have a question for the hon. member. I found it quite 
extraordinary that in his speech he listed a series of things the 
government had done which he claimed hurt small business. 
Some of them may have; some of them may not have. Some of 
them may in fact help small business. He listed all these as 
arising out of the last budget.
<P>
	Then he made the most extraordinary statement, having gone 
through a fairly comprehensive list that the government had 
done nothing during its term of office to do anything about 
anything and that all it had done was study. If it has done 
nothing, why did he come up with a list at the beginning of 
things the government had done?
<P>
	The inconsistency was quite extraordinary. I do not know 
whether the hon. member reviewed the remarks he was going to 
make in advance and picked up this illogical inconsistency or 
not. But it was quite obvious to those of us sitting here that he 
was talking through his hat for the second half of his speech at 
least. It cast serious doubt on the statements he made in the first 
half of his speech when he listed the government's many 
accomplishments and then decided the government had done 
nothing and that all we were doing were studies.
<P>
	He knows perfectly well the government has done a lot more 
than study. He knows the government has produced these studies 
with a view to taking action. Part of the study process involves 
consultation with Canadians which he knows the government 
believes is in the best interests of the country so the views of 
Canadians can be solicited before the government takes 
decisions that sometimes are going to be painful or unpleasant.
<P>
	Surely he agrees that is the right approach. Surely he agrees 
that the speech he just made is utter nonsense.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do take exception to the hon. 
member's remarks. The point is that this government has yet to 
prove it can move beyond taking reports and put them into 
action. That was the whole point of my speech.
<P>
	We have had the GST study. My goodness, my colleagues on 
the finance committee were meeting for months, sometimes 
three times a day. They produced a big report months ago and we 
have not seen anything. That was the end of it. I mentioned that 
the Minister of Human Resources Development produced a 
report which said: ``We have a problem in this country but do not 
ask me for solutions. What do you think?'' The Minister of 
Finance tabled two reports in two consecutive days which 
basically said the same thing: ``We have a problem in this 
country but I am not offering any solutions''.
<P>
	Surely the government's job is to offer solutions. The solution 
we are offering is less taxation and less government. Stop 
picking winners and giving them all kinds of cash and expecting 
small business and business in general to try and compete under 
the heavy load of high taxes, a high dollar and high interest 
rates. They are trying to compete in the international 
marketplace to create jobs and some employment here, to create 
some wealth in this country yet we continue to tax them as if 
they were sponges with endless amounts of cash.
<P>
	That whole idea is past. The day has come when there is no 
more money for small business to pay. Therefore before small 
business goes bankrupt we now find that this government is 
bankrupt of ideas. For the past number of months we have done 
nothing except some house cleaning from the previous 
government: the restructuring of this department, the 
restructuring of that department and the amalgamation of some 
other departments. These things were produced by the previous 
Prime Minister. This government has been in power for more 
than a year now and we are still doing house cleaning from the 
previous government. When are we going to get some serious 
action and decisions?
<P>
<B>(1830) </B>

	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé, BQ):</B> The issue I wish to bring to 
the attention of this House this evening, Mr. Speaker, is one I 
raised three weeks ago regarding the Gaspé Cure Inc. 
consortium and the problem it is faced with.
<P>
	I would like to inform this House of what Gaspé Cure is and 
what problem it is faced with. Gaspé Cure is a grouping, as the 
name consortium indicates, of five processing operations 
dealing in salted dried codfish. This consortium employs 
approximately 250 people.
<P>
	Last spring, in a contest sponsored by the Quebec agri-food 
export club and Soquia, Gaspé Cure won the highest award of 
excellence. With respect to what Gaspé Cure is, I wanted to add 
that this consortium used to include at least eight processing 
operations four or five years ago. but following some form of 
industrial rationalization, there are only five remaining today.
<P>
	I want to emphasize that these people are trying to maintain 
their trademark, as well as working on improving their visibility 
world-wide and their efficiency in terms of production. The 
problem now, and it has grown in the last two years, is that other 
companies in other regions of Canada, in the Maritimes, have 
started to produce what we in the Gaspé call an imitation 
product.
<P>
	There is a difference between the two products. Why? 
Because the process in the Gaspé takes into account our 
humidity, our climate, the number of days of sunshine, which 
give us a particular micro-climate for the type of production 
that we want to have.
<P>
	The dried salted product may be less well known in Canada 
and to Canadian consumers. Nevertheless, you should know that 
it is highly prized in some countries and eaten in ceremonies or 
at big festivals, as in Portugal or Spain, for example.
<P>
	For this reason, the market and image of the Gaspé Cure 
consortium are very important for them.
<P>
	I am being signaled to speed up a little; indeed, I am not really 
used to speaking under Standing Order 38. What I am asking the 
government, because I know that it is supposed to have done 
studies to come to a conclusion, is that it recognize right away 
that after all the studies are done, the Gaspé Cure consortium 
will have its own restricted trade name for the region.
<P>
	It is very important for them. In the past, they showed that 
there was a glaring difference between their product and the one 
made elsewhere, so we want this issue to be cleared up as soon as 
possible.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the designation of Gaspé cured 
has appeared in the federal fish inspection regulations for many 
years.
<P>
	The current regulations permit the labelling of any saltfish as 
Gaspé cured provided that the fish meet the specific quality 
characteristics of Gaspé cured, light salted fish. It is recognized 
that there is a long tradition in the Gaspé region associated with 
the production of this unique type of salted fish.
<P>
<B>(1835 ) </B>
<P>
	In an effort to address the concerns of the Gaspé saltfish 
producers, the inspection branch of the Department of Fisheries 
and Oceans has consulted with the saltfish industry and has 
made considerable effort over the past few months to develop 
both sensory and chemical criteria which will more precisely 
define Gaspé cured. It is expected that this work will be 
completed by December 1.
<P>
	The Department of Fisheries and Oceans will then meet again 
with the saltfish industry to review this issue and finalize the 
standard for Canadian saltfish products by early 1995.
<P>
	Once the standard has been completed, the Department of 
Fisheries and Oceans will implement a comprehensive training 
program for all inspectors involved in the inspection of saltfish 
in Atlantic Canada. The combination of a finalized, written 
product standard, specific chemical and sensory criteria and 
uniform application of the standard by inspectors will create a 
regulatory environment which will be fair for all producers of 
saltfish cod in Canada.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CRTC">CRTC</A></H4>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the Minister of Canadian Heritage made an error. He regrets his 
intervention to the CRTC on behalf of one of his constituents. He 
admits that his decision to write this letter was imprudent.
<P>
	My question to the Minister of Canadian Heritage on October 
28 raised a number of issues I wanted to clarify as they related to 
the minister's mistake. I wanted to clarify how the mistake 
occurred, how to prevent such an event from reoccurring, how to 
address the damage done and how to restore the lost credibility 
of the CRTC.
<P>
	In his response, the minister suggested that I did not 
understand. He stated that his letter was not an intervention. 
This is not true. The facts are clear and simple.
<P>
	On March 15 the minister wrote a letter to the CRTC on behalf 
of a constituent. On March 29 the minister received a response 
from the CRTC. Its response made it unequivocally clear that 
the minister's letter was received by the CRTC, stamped as an 
intervention and included in the Daniilidis application as a letter 
of intervention. The secretary general of the CRTC has 
concurred with these facts as they have been presented thus far. 
They are indisputable.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="7767"> 7767 </A></B>
<P>
	Further, the Prime Minister stated that the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage had made an error in judgment, that the letter 
was an intervention and he too wished the minister had not 
written the letter.
<P>
	The sad fact is it is not I who is confused but the minister 
himself. Mr. Daniilidis, the CRTC, the Prime Minister, the 
cabinet ministers also named, the opposition and the Canadian 
public all know the minister intervened. The question is not if he 
intervened but why and how does he plan to clean up the mess he 
created.
<P>
	When the CRTC wrote back to the minister on March 29 it was 
clear that the letter was understood to be an intervention. The 
minister stated that he moved quickly to remove this 
understanding.
<P>
	The minister took no action for 199 days. Is this what he calls 
quick action? This complacency and inaction is exactly why 
Canadians have lost faith in politicians. Only when this issue 
became news was the minister stirred to react. The facts are that 
his actions belie his rhetoric.
<P>
	This scandal has served as a lightning rod for all Canadians 
tired of lying politicians, tired of coverups and tired of 
repressive rhetoric. Errors like this one should not be tolerated.
<P>
	As my questions to the minister continued, I focused on the 
issue of influence peddling. I asked about the influence of the 
letter of intervention on the application process. The minister, 
contrary to fact, denied that his letter was an intervention. As 
well, he chose not to address the issue of the damage he had 
caused to the credibility of the CRTC.
<P>
	My office has been in contact with Mr. Daniilidis and some of 
the interveners in the process and everyone is concerned with 
the negative influence brought about by the minister's 
meddling. The minister's letter of intervention was received by 
the subcommittee prior to its rejection of the CHOM 
application. The subcommittee membership for the CHOM and 
the Daniilidis applications had overlapping membership. Given 
that the minister's letter supported the Daniilidis application 
prior to the CHOM rejection and given that the committee 
membership was the same, it is clear that the minister's letter 
had some influence.
<P>
	However, once this whole affair became public, once the 
question of potential influence was posed, the CRTC had no 
choice but to reject the Daniilidis application.
<P>
	The minister has an obligation to rebuild the credibility of the 
application process. He has an obligation to rebuild the 
credibility of the CRTC. He has an obligation to remove the 
blemish on his ministry. It is a long, long climb especially for a 
ministry weakened by such gross incompetence.
<P>
<B>(1840 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Susan Whelan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of National Revenue, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was informed that 
the question the member for Calgary Southeast wanted to refer 
to was the one she brought up  on October 24th. My response is 
with regard to that question.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The note for today, if it will be of 
assistance to both hon. members, reads October 28, 1994, which 
is the list that I was given. There may have been a 
miscommunication. Do the members wish to put this off to 
another day? This will not count on anybody's time.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, it was 
addressed to the issue of the question raised on October 28. 
However, if the hon. member would be prepared to give a 
response in general to the action of the minister, I would be 
satisfied with that.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Whelan:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am not prepared to respond to the 
question of October 28. I am prepared to respond to the question 
of October 24. I apologize but that is the information I was 
given. If the hon. member would like, I can talk in general about 
October 24.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> We can put the matter over to deal with 
on another occasion or have the parliamentary secretary speak to 
it. As the hon. parliamentary secretary has indicated, she can 
reply in very general terms to the specific remarks of the hon. 
member. I think it is up to the hon. member for Calgary 
Southeast as to which she prefers.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
prefer a response this evening.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Whelan:</B> Mr. Speaker, my response is with regard to the 
CRTC and with regard to the fact that the Government of Canada 
did not intervene in the activities regarding RDI. That is what I 
am prepared to respond to tonight, that the CBC's application to 
authorize a specialized Canadian-
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, this is 
clearly way off base. It has had nothing to do with RDI. In 
deference to this confusion and to the hon. member, we will put 
it off for this evening.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am reminded that there are no points 
of order to be raised during this period. In any event that is 
agreeable to both members.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="LAWOFTHESEA">LAW OF THE SEA</A></H4>
	<B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, some 
12 days ago I asked the Minister of Foreign Affairs for the date 
when Canada will ratify the law of the sea. It is most important 
that Canada take steps to ratify this comprehensive and overdue 
piece of international law.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="7768"> 7768 </A></B>
<P>
	The law of the sea is designed to protect the world's fisheries 
and to stop the pollution of the oceans. It contains the idea that 
ocean resources belong to humanity and that all of humanity is 
entitled to share in their benefits and use.
<P>
	Canada signed this law some 12 years ago. It was one of the 
first nations to sign it. However, it has yet to ratify it, which is 
the second step required. The law of the sea will come into 
effect, into force so to say, in two days, on November 16, 1994. 
Sixty countries have now ratified it and that is the number 
required to get the convention working.
<P>
	Of the 60 nations that have ratified it all but two, Iceland and 
Malta, are developing countries. It is therefore necessary to 
make the point that to be truly effective this legislation or this 
law should have universal support, including that of the major 
developed countries and marine powers. There is no doubt about 
that.
<P>
	Being one of the first countries which signed the law of the 
sea, it puts Canada in an advantageous position because it could 
play a role in setting up the institutions which will enforce this 
particular convention. It is our hope therefore that Canada will 
have the possibility to appoint a Canadian judge to the law of the 
sea tribunal and also have a seat on the council of this decision 
making international body.
<P>
	Apparently the reason Canada is so late is that there were 
concerns about some particular provisions including deep 
seabed mining which somehow echo the policies we also heard 
in Washington. It is my understanding these issues have now 
been resolved, including the main concerns to ensure that 
Canadian law is compatible with the convention.
<P>
	In conclusion, as I said Canada was one of the most ardent 
promoters of the law of the sea convention. It is a great pity to 
see Canada somehow reluctantly joining the world community 
instead of being among the 60 signatories required to get the 
convention going. It seems to me that Canada would be very 
well served by ratifying this convention. This is a landmark 
piece of international negotiation in international law.
<P>
	Tonight I am asking our distinguished parliamentary 
secretary to confirm that Canada will ratify the law of the sea 
convention before the end of the year.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jesse Flis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I compliment the hon. 
member for Davenport on being such a strong advocate of the 
need to achieve universal convention to govern all uses of the 
sea.
<P>
	Canada participated actively in the negotiation of the law of 
the sea convention and signed it in December 1982. Our 
involvement in the convention stems from three basic 
principles: our general support for rule of law and multilateral 
processes; our extensive coastline and substantial continental 
shelf; and a desire for stable ocean law and additional rights for 
coastal states concerning fisheries, navigation, pollution 
prevention and the mineral resources of the continental shelf.
<P>
	Along with other industrialized states Canada did not ratify 
the convention due to concerns, as the hon. member said, 
regarding its provisions on deep seabed mining. After four years 
of negotiations these concerns were resolved. An agreement was 
adopted by the United Nations on July 28 and signed by Canada 
the very next day.
<P>
	Canada has already been applying most of the provisions of 
the convention in practice as along with other countries we 
believe they reflect the customary law of the sea. We are now 
reviewing our domestic legislation to make certain it is in 
conformity with the provisions of the convention. This must be 
done before ratification to avoid any inconsistency with the 
convention.
<P>
	We hope the hon. member's support for ratification of the 
convention will aid in the rapid passage of any amending 
legislation that may be brought forward.
<P>
	I want to assure the hon. member for Davenport who has taken 
such a leadership role in this issue that the government intends 
to ratify the law of the sea as soon as possible.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Pursuant to Standing Order 38(5), the 
motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been 
adopted. Accordingly, the House stands adjourned until 
tomorrow at 10 a.m. pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 6.48 p.m.)
