	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the Standing Committee on Environment and Sustainable Development 
be designated as the committee referred to in section 139 of the Canadian 
Environment Protection Act.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	She said: Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to lead off this 
debate in Environment Week on the referral of the Canadian 
Environmental Protection Act to the Standing Committee on 
Environment and Sustainable Development.
<P>
	The review itself is required by provisions of the act passed by 
Parliament in 1988. By moving this motion today our 
government is meeting our legislative duty, but we are also 
meeting another duty with this motion. We are keeping a 
promise we made to Canadians in the red book to give 
parliamentary committees more power in policy development 
and to allow members of Parliament more say in the 
development of laws that affect their constituents.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This motion makes no reference to the mandate, the reason 
being that we have decided to let the parliamentary committee 
draft its own mandate. The committee will have the latitude to 
decide on its own the scope of its review of the Canadian 
Environmental Protection Act. The government will not be 
recommending an approach. This will be for the committee to 
decide.
<P>
<B>(1005) </B>
<P>
	We will not force the committee to choose from a series of 
options. We want members from all political parties to play a 
legitimate role in protecting our country's environment.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The review of the Canadian Environmental Protection Act is 
the first statutory review of an act undertaken by a 
parliamentary committee since the election. The Minister of 
Health and I who have joint responsibility for this legislation 
believe this is an excellent opportunity to provide individual 
members of the House of Commons with a greater voice in 
drafting our laws. This is an innovative approach, an experiment 
which we are confident will bear positive results.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The Minister of Health has occasionally had some differences 
of opinion with Bloc and Reform members, just as I have had, 
although I must admit that I have been impressed with the keen 
interest of the committee members, regardless of their political 
affiliation, in environmental protection. I know that the 
committee's contribution to the process will be quite 
significant.
<P>
	I cannot begin to count the members of our Liberal caucus 
who have shown tremendous enthusiasm for, and extensive 
knowledge of, the issues.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The Canadian Environmental Protection Act was passed six 
years ago to respond to a number of concerns: the need to control 
toxic substances; the need to prevent environmental harm; the 
lack of coherence among federal laws; and the inadequacy of 
enforcement.
<P>
	Since the passing of the act six years ago our understanding of 
the importance of sustainable development and biodiversity has 
increased dramatically. Throughout Canada and indeed the 
world there is an increasing desire to move from merely 
controlling or cleaning up pollution to preventing it in the first 
place.
<P>
	Just as there is a heightened awareness that economic and 
environmental policies must be integrated, so there is a new 
appreciation that we must take an ecosystem approach to issues 
of air, land, water and living organisms. There is a widely held 
commitment to link issues of environmental health with issues 
of human health. There is a range of new international 
agreements to take this into account, agreements which affect 
the environmental health of our planet and more particularly the 
health of human beings. They must be considered when we 
review national legislation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5142"> 5142 </A></B>
<P>
	I believe there is a new-found willingness among all levels of 
government in Canada to get our own act together through 
proper environmental practices and elimination of duplication 
and waste.
<P>
	The Canadian public, the people of Canada, are demanding 
more information and more say on environmental protection. 
Green consumers are prompting the development of green 
technologies and green services, and those technologies and 
services are leading to exciting new possibilities for Canada in 
the realm of sustainable development.
<P>
	The review of the Canadian Environmental Protection Act 
will allow a great opportunity to consider all these important 
new developments, in particular pollution prevention.
<P>
[Translation] 
<P>
	The parliamentary committee will give the provinces and 
territories, ecology groups, industry, labour unions, workers, 
natives and all Canadian citizens an excellent forum in which to 
voice their opinions of the handling of current environmental 
protection issues.
<P>
	With this goal in mind, the committee will hear from 
Canadians, who will also have the opportunity to submit their 
views directly to their members of Parliament. You are 
undoubtedly aware, Mr. Speaker, that the Canadian Council of 
Ministers of the Environment has made remarkable progress in 
harmonizing environmental management practices in our 
country.
<P>
	This work is the final stage in the parliamentary review 
process. Through the invaluable cooperation of provincial 
environment ministers, we have eliminated some instances of 
duplication which are costly to the taxpayers, which drive 
responsible companies crazy and which make it virtually 
impossible to penalize polluters.
<P>
	The success of the CCME will be a great inspiration to the 
parliamentary committee as it goes about its work. However, I 
want to make myself very clear. This parliamentary review will 
not stop the government from following up its red book 
commitments.
<P>
	In our view, these commitments lend support to the work of 
the committees and reflect the desire of all Canadians to enjoy a 
prosperous economy and a healthy environment.
<P>
<B>(1010) </B>
<P>
	In fact, only yesterday we announced an expanded plan to 
protect North America's wetlands that will benefit wetlands 
species as well as the communities depending on wetlands for 
their livelihood.
<P>
	The Minister of Industry and I are now working on an 
environmental industries strategy. The Minister of Finance has 
also undertaken with me a full review of obstacles to sustainable 
development and a study of new economic tools likely to 
promote good environmental practices.
<P>
	The Minister of Foreign Affairs has already announced major 
Canadian contributions to environmental initiatives around the 
world.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	All of these actions and others we have taken and will take are 
a sincere effort to make sure that we promote the twin goals of 
improving our environment and our economy. The government 
is acting quickly in areas where we believe action must be taken, 
but none of our actions should preclude the parliamentary 
committee from suggesting realistic improvements. All 
members of Parliament clearly want the government to take 
measures which safeguard the environment, create new jobs and 
encourage national and international co-operation.
<P>
	In that spirit of co-operation, this summer I will be seriously 
reviewing the recommendations of the parliamentary committee 
for the federal commissioner of the environment and sustainable 
development. I have already had some preliminary discussions 
with the chair of the committee on that particular issue and we 
are encouraged that we will move quickly on a number of the 
recommendations.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Today, I am also pleased to table an outline of the issues to be 
considered by the committee. This document sets out in simple 
and objective language a rather exhaustive list of the concerns 
expressed about our Environmental Protection Act. It also 
summarizes a number of major developments that occurred in 
this country and abroad since our current law was adopted.
<P>
	This document should give interested members and other 
Canadians a general idea of the range of problems to be taken 
into account if and when we decide to amend the Environmental 
Protection Act. It should not restrict in any way the issues that 
the members will want to examine. In fact, officials from the 
Environment and Health departments will be on hand to provide 
the committee with documentation on any other subject it deems 
important. Environment Canada and Health Canada employees 
will be there to help the committee as it sees fit.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	To be a further help to the committee, the government will 
provide members with an independent assessment of the 
administration of the act. The committee will have an 
opportunity to consider a variety of mechanisms to advance 
pollution prevention, from voluntary actions to market based 
concepts, to mandatory rules.
<P>
	There have been important international changes since the act 
was first introduced, from the climate change convention to the 
convention on biological diversity, to a number of other 
international agreements. Members of Parliament will have the 
opportunity to examine the scope and complexity of these recent 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5143"> 5143 </A></B>
<P>
international agreements and how they should influence 
changes within Canada.
<P>
	The committee will be free to examine whether there are 
alternatives to court action in order to obtain speedy and 
effective results for obeying the law.
<P>
	I know members of Parliament will not shy away from the 
thorny issues. From coastal zone management to environmental 
protection on reserve lands, in tackling these issues I know 
members of Parliament will listen first and foremost to the 
people who are affected by those difficult issues, be they 
representatives of First Nations, representatives of resource 
management, or others.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The government sincerely wants to hear the committee's 
advice on major pollution prevention issues, from prevention 
plans to the right of citizens to be informed, to technical 
assistance.
<P>
	The parliamentary committee will probably want to consider 
seriously whether we can do better in preparing for and 
preventing environmental disasters.
<P>
	Members have good ideas, and so do other Canadians. We 
want to listen to them. We want the parliamentary committee to 
make recommendations to strengthen the Canadian 
Environmental Protection Act, and recommendations are more 
than welcome.
<P>
<B>(1015) </B>
<P>
	Pollution prevention and sustainable development must 
remain national objectives. Our standards must be fair, firm and 
enforceable. The review of our environmental legislation must 
be an open and transparent process. We must find ways to give 
the public better opportunities to be heard and to hold 
governments accountable for their environmental decisions. We 
must also find ways to move from an approach based on reaction 
and restoration to one focused on the prevention of 
environmental problems.
<P>
	The committee will be free to tell the government how it 
thinks we can encourage people to make responsible 
environmental decisions, thus protecting us for generations to 
come.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The government's only requirement is that the committee 
report back to Parliament within the next 12 months so we may 
have an opportunity to respond to its report and to act on it 
forthwith.
<P>
	Members of Parliament are of course free to criticize the 
government and I know they will at any time. However I am sure 
that when we launch this initiative with the committee of the 
environment on sustainable development, the committee 
members will take this initiative to work together to produce a 
world class review of the Canadian Environmental Protection 
Act. It is an issue on which we have a real chance at winning a 
better future for our children.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> Mr. Speaker, at the 
request of the Minister of Environment, the Standing 
Committee on Environment and Sustainable Development will 
review the Canadian Environmental Protection Act.
<P>
	Having considered creating an environment commissioner 
position and having examined the Wildlife Act as well as the 
legislation concerning migratory birds at length, the committee 
will now devote itself to reviewing this extremely complex act 
over the coming year.
<P>
	When the CEPA was passed, it stirred up passionate debates, 
and it is to be expected that they will be every bit as heated 
during this first review which, by reason of its scope, includes 
many aspects which are not regulated and emphasizes structural 
problems within the Department of Environment.
<P>
	Initially, this act was intended to fill regulatory gaps in 
certain environmental matters, particularly with regard to toxic 
substances, the consolidation of federal environmental statutes 
and performance improvement of the federal government in the 
area of environment.
<P>
	The act is also aimed at enabling Canada to fulfil international 
commitments. This review following the first five years of 
operation of the act is automatic and mandatory. Pursuant to 
section 139 of the Act, its administration must be reviewed by 
Parliament within five years after enactment.
<P>
	The CEPA came into force in 1988. The primary objective of 
this act is of course to protect the environment, but also to 
protect human health. That is why both Environment Canada 
and Health Canada are involved. Given the diversity of aspects 
to be reviewed, Environment Canada's evaluation directorate 
commissioned a study by Resource Futures International for this 
first review. The firm presented its report to the department's 
audit and evaluation committee on December 17, 1993, as well 
as at the January meeting of Environment Canada's 
Management Board.
<P>
<B>(1020) </B>
<P>
	According to Environment Canada officials, this impartial 
report will give us a better idea of many aspects of the 
application of the Act. For those not familiar with the Canadian 
Environmental Protection Act, such a report shows us the 
shortcomings in this law. It examines, among other things, the 
effectiveness of the particular management mechanisms and 
provisions for implementing CEPA.
<P>
	I noted the points in this report which I think give us a clear 
idea of possible problems. It is important to begin by noting a 
particular feature of this law. Despite what one might think at 
first, CEPA cannot be called an anti-pollution law, even though 
it brings together previous federal laws on dumping waste at sea 
and air and water pollution. Let me explain that many federal  
and provincial laws already regulate polluting activities. CEPA's 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5144"> 5144 </A></B>
<P>
scope is thus limited since it cannot deal with these activities 
that are already regulated.
<P>
	You may suppose that this overlapping regulation by the 
provinces and the federal government concerns me as a member 
of the Bloc Quebecois. I therefore read with interest the report's 
analysis of federal-provincial relations. Since environmental 
jurisdiction is not clearly defined in the Constitution, I am not 
telling you anything new when I say that the expanded 
environmental activities of both levels of government since the 
1980s have created some tension.
<P>
	In the beginning, the Canadian Environmental Protection Act 
contributed to this tension by increasing the federal presence in 
a field that was largely a provincial responsibility. Nevertheless, 
it seems that the disruptive intrusion feared by the provinces has 
not occurred. CEPA provides three mechanisms to harmonize 
federal and provincial responsibilities for environmental 
protection, but we are told that two of them are not yet in effect, 
so it is hard to assess how effective they will be.
<P>
	Nevertheless, the report maintains that the many difficulties 
faced in negotiating equivalency agreements suggest that the 
mechanism is not effective in its present form. The report says 
that even if the law has already been harmonized with respect to 
the regulatory approach for certain matters, difficulties in 
co-ordinating federal departments, as well as the federal and 
provincial governments, still persist.
<P>
	However, one body seems to be making quiet progress. It is 
the federal-provincial advisory committee whose members say 
that they are satisfied with the way it operates. Nevertheless, we 
must be careful not to mistake this attitude for provincial 
agreement with the status quo. Some provinces wonder if it 
would not be appropriate to merge this committee with the 
environmental protection committee.
<P>
<B>(1025) </B>
<P>
	While we are on the subject of provincial jurisdiction, I 
should mention that the uncertainty about the future scope of 
federal jurisdiction in the field of environmental protection will 
probably have an impact on the implementation of the Act.
<P>
	In recent years, the political climate has undoubtedly had the 
effect of slowing things down in terms of implementing 
regulations whose scope is close to that of the provinces' 
jurisdiction.
<P>
	However, provinces must be involved in the process, since in 
these times of budget cuts, Environment Canada does not have 
sufficient resources to take full responsibility for the 
implementation of the Act, as pointed out in the same report. 
Needless to say that separating these regulations is like walking 
on eggs.
<P>
	A thorough review of this issue by the committee is absolutely 
essential. It is true that environmental issues transcend 
boundaries, but this is no reason for the federal government to 
interfere in provincial affairs.
<P>
	Each province can define its own policies and then conclude 
agreements with its neighbours. I want to point out another 
aspect of the report which is very interesting, namely the 
ambiguity of Environment Canada's mandate. On the one hand, 
this department must promote sound environmental practices 
and encourage businesses to implement them, while on the other 
hand, it must take action against offenders.
<P>
	In other words, Environment Canada must say what should be 
done, but it must also take action if it is not already done. In the 
end, the department finds itself sitting on the fence. Generally 
speaking, the evaluation report contains the following 
conclusions.
<P>
	The first one is that since the Canadian Environmental 
Protection Act does not cover all environmental aspects, its 
impact is limited. The second conclusion is that the government 
has not yet looked at all the problems targeted in the Act because 
of administrative decisions made concerning priorities. Third, it 
is too early to tell whether initiatives taken under this legislation 
have been directly responsible for improving health or the 
environment, except in a very limited number of cases. 
However, although we do not have extensive knowledge of the 
many aspects of the question, we could at least consider these 
three observations and try to find effective solutions to correct 
these problems.
<P>
	Another point is that, apparently, it was not easy to evaluate 
how well the legislation functioned during the first six years it 
was in effect. The firm that conducted the study maintained it 
was very difficult to evaluate results, because the information 
required to evaluate the impact of this legislation was not 
already assembled with a view to establishing a connection 
between cause and effect.
<P>
	However, the real problem is the absence of specific 
objectives in the legislation. Many were of course formulated 
during the past five years, but they were not regrouped to reflect 
specific priorities. We must not fall into the trap of evaluating 
the success of the CEPA on the basis of the number of activities 
it has generated rather than the results obtained. In that case, our 
conclusions and recommendations would be superficial.
<P>
<B>(1030) </B>
<P>
	Another interesting point raised in the report was the public's 
perception of this legislation. It seems there is a substantial gap 
between the actual impact of the legislation and the way its 
benefits were extolled to the public.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5145"> 5145 </A></B>
<P>
	Expectations were very high because the powers provided 
under this legislation were not clearly explained to the public. It 
will be difficult to establish the level of satisfaction from 
statements that are made before the committee.
<P>
	The report says that many environmental groups were very 
disappointed in the federal government's efforts to pass strict 
environmental legislation through the CEPA. They may be right 
or perhaps they overestimated the powers provided under this 
Act. However, the crux of the problem is quite straightforward, 
as presented in two fundamental questions put in the report.
<P>
	The first question: Does the Canadian Environmental 
Protection Act allow the federal government to do what must be 
done about the environment? The second question: Does the 
federal government administer the Canadian Environmental 
Protection Act in an effective way?
<P>
	As soon as we can answer both questions in the affirmative, 
we will have done our job. I intend to concentrate on the second 
question, because in my opinion, it is crucial. We can revamp 
legislation as much as we like, but if Environment Canada does 
not have the human and financial resources to implement the 
legislation, we are no further ahead.
<P>
	According to an historian who has looked at how the 
Department of the Environment has progressed over the years, 
progress and effectiveness are limited by four factors.
<P>
	First, the department's inability to establish and implement 
strict observation procedures; second, cuts in staff responsible 
for research and investigations and an increase in their 
workload; third, the element of uncertainty in 
federal-provincial and interdepartmental relations; and fourth 
and last, insufficient knowledge of the economic and legal 
aspects.
<P>
	I am therefore doubtful as to the real impact of any 
recommendations or changes we might make with respect to the 
Canadian Environmental Protection Act. It is all very well to 
have plans, but if you cannot implement them they are not going 
to help the environment very much.
<P>
	My point is that it seems, from the information I got from 
various sources, that the Department of the Environment is 
poorly equipped to enforce the legislation. I will repeat that: It 
seems to me that the Department of the Environment is poorly 
equipped to enforce the legislation.
<P>
	I will give you a very concrete example which supports these 
allegations. During a sitting of the Standing Committee on the 
Environment and Sustainable Development, my friend and 
colleague, the hon. member for Terrebonne, questioned the 
deputy minister on the ability of Environment Canada to 
adequately enforce the legislation.
<P>
<B>(1035) </B>
<P>
	The senior official explained to us that the department does 
not have the resources to fully enforce all the provisions 
contained in the legislation, that resource allocation to 
departments is done by the cabinet and Parliament. Therefore, 
technically, the minister, despite all her goodwill, cannot fully 
enforce the Canadian Environment Protection Act. The same 
senior official also said that the Act is rather soft.
<P>
	The logical conclusion is that we do what is specifically 
required by the legislation and we neglect the rest. The question 
I ask myself is this: To what extent can we make this evaluation 
effective? There are two alternatives. Either we relax the 
legislation, keeping only what the department can do, to have a 
real idea of the impact of the legislation, or we provide the 
department with legislation so good that cabinet will have no 
choice but to give Environment Canada what it needs to act.
<P>
	This last alternative is by far the preferred one. The only way 
to adequately protect our environment is to put pressure on the 
mandarins in the finance department. However, with the 
creation of the job of environment commissioner, I fear that we 
might be told to limit the scope of the CEPA since some of its 
provisions will likely be in the environment commissioner act. 
However, the CEPA is probably the fundamental instrument of 
environmental protection and it is crucial to evaluate its first six 
years to be able to refine it.
<P>
	It is very difficult to assess the results since the necessary data 
to evaluate the impact of this Act are gathered in such a way that 
it is impossible to link cause to effect. This review and the 
approach taken prove that it is essential to take all the time 
needed to make the legislation efficient. All I can do this 
morning is ponder over the themes which will lead our 
committee's reflection.
<P>
	I hope that when I come back here next year to present our 
comments, I will be thoroughly convinced that I have 
contributed to advance the cause of environmental protection. In 
conclusion, I must say that I am pleased to see that the Minister 
of the Environment seems to be willing to let the committee on 
the environment and sustainable development play a greater 
role. I see that most committee members are in the House today. 
I recognize our chairman, the member for Davenport, and as the 
Official Opposition, we can already assure the standing 
committee of our complete co-operation in this review of the 
legislation which is the cornerstone of the Department of the 
Environment.
<P>
<B>(1040) </B>
<P>
	My colleague, the member for Brome-Missisquoi, was 
telling me last night that he went to the Imax theatre to see ``The 
Blue Planet'' and that it gave him a lot of food for thought. When 
we watch programs of that kind and read about this issue, we 
realize that on this blue planet of ours, we are all in the same 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5146"> 5146 </A></B>
<P>
boat, we breathe the  same air, we drink the same water. Since 
the creation of earth, the quantity of water has not changed.
<P>
	As the great scientist Lavoisier said, matter is neither lost nor 
created. Of course, there is the natural cycle, like the cycle by 
which water purifies itself. Yesterday, all newspapers carried a 
Canadian Press report which said that Canadians were the 
fifth-largest consumers in the world and thus Canada is the 
fifth-largest producer of waste per capita. Canada is tied with 
the United States as the largest producer per capita of carbon 
dioxide, CO2, a polluting gas which causes the greenhouse 
effect and global warming.
<P>
	As the member for Lachine-Lac-Saint-Louis said in a 
speech, the greenhouse effect and global warming could wipe 
out some countries because it will melt glaciers and cause the 
sea level to rise. Low lying countries and islands could 
eventually disappear.
<P>
	We are all together on this planet and we must pull together. 
We must reach out to one another. I would remind the Minister 
of the Environment that we must reach out to one another but 
that she must still be careful to respect others' jurisdiction. We 
as members of the Bloc will always make sure that Quebec's 
jurisdiction is respected. There can be agreements similar to 
those we have signed with the United States like the 
International Joint Commission for the Great Lakes. That can be 
done with Quebec, of course. It can be done now, as equal 
partners.
<P>
	I encourage the environment committee, especially its 
chairman, to assess the Canadian Environmental Protection Act 
with all the wisdom for which he and his committee are known.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I remind the House that as 
we pursue this debate, members who will now participate will be 
limited to 20 minute interventions, of course subject to a 
10-minute question and comment period.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Comox-Alberni):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to have this opportunity to speak on this motion before 
the House. I was particularly pleased to see the minister respond 
personally to this bill.
<P>
	Canada's environment and natural heritage give Canadians a 
sense of pride and ownership. With that comes the responsibility 
to protect our environment for future generations as well as the 
obligation to clean up the ills that we have done in the past.
<P>
	Protection of the environment in human life and health is 
clearly the top priority of any government. The relationship 
between the environment and the quality of Canadian life and 
the economy is integral and inseparable. The Canadian 
Environmental Protection Act is Canada's act respecting the 
protection of the environment and human life and health. It was 
proclaimed in 1988.
<P>
<B>(1045) </B>
<P>
	CEPA replaces and incorporates several previously existing 
acts such as the Environmental Contaminants Act, the Ocean 
Dumping Control Act and the Clean Air Act. To summarize, 
CEPA gives the federal government authority to regulate toxic 
substances throughout their life cycle; establish environmental 
quality objectives, guidelines and codes of practice; regulate 
cleaning agents, nutrients and water conditioners; regulate 
waste handling and disposal practises, emissions and effluents 
for federal departments, crown corporations and federal 
agencies; and control of ocean dumping.
<P>
	The main purpose of CEPA is to keep toxic substances out of 
the air, water and soil. For example, the law makes it illegal to 
dump anything into federally regulated waters that could harm 
fish. The act also regulates a list of toxic substances. Included 
are provisions for penalties and enforcement. Currently the 
maximum fine is $200,000 and a six-month jail term.
<P>
	When it was proclaimed six years ago the Conservative 
government bragged that it was the toughest environmental law 
in the western hemisphere. Yet according to several sources, 
including the final report on CEPA of December 1993, this has 
proven to be quite an exaggeration. I will address some of the 
concerns raised in the final report a bit later.
<P>
	Included in its provisions was a section stating, as the 
minister has noted, that the act must be reviewed every five 
years. In fact that is why we are here today. Given the 
significance of the act this clause is crucial as it allows the 
government the opportunity to examine, evaluate, critique and 
amend where necessary sections of the act which hinder its 
successful implementation.
<P>
	The question which now needs to be asked is how are the 
various activities under the act contributing to achieving the 
protection of the environment and human life and health? We 
need to examine whether the act is fulfilling its original 
intentions. Is the act being administered effectively? What is 
working and what is not working? This is what has to be looked 
at in committee.
<P>
	I would like to take the opportunity to look at some of the 
criticisms of the act which I hope will be brought forward during 
committee and seriously addressed if necessary in the revisions 
to the act. Uncertain areas of federal and provincial jurisdiction 
with environmental issues remain one of the biggest challenges 
in regulating and enforcing environmental laws. This seems to 
have played a role in CEPA's performance over the past six 
years.
<P>
	Environmental problems rarely respect geographic or 
jurisdictional boundaries. Environmental problems are never 
just regional concerns as what impacts one end of the country 
may affect us all. However the division of powers when dealing 
with environmental concerns is not always clear. Federal and 
provincial areas of jurisdiction have remained a complicating 
issue with the legislation.  There is no explicit mention of 
environment in the division of powers laid out in the 
Constitution 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5147"> 5147 </A></B>
<P>
Act, 1867. In practice jurisdiction has been shared among the 
various levels of government. This partnership in responsibility 
is vital to the successful implementation of national 
environmental policies and objectives.
<P>
	While the final CEPA report addresses this concern, the report 
points out that the lack of enforcement of this act may be due to 
uncertain constitutional grounds for federal action in this area.
<P>
	One of the basic concepts behind CEPA was the promotion of 
federal-provincial harmonization. One way of promoting this 
was the development of working agreements among the federal 
and provincial governments. Equivalency agreements were to 
maximize efforts while minimizing overlap and duplication. 
This would allow both parties to achieve the desired results, 
protection of the environment and human health most 
effectively, while at the same time saving money.
<P>
	Yet after six years only recently has the first agreement been 
signed with the province of Ontario. It has been suggested that 
perhaps equivalency agreements should focus more on 
equivalent efforts rather than on equivalent results. This is 
another area of the act which needs to be scrutinized. The 
development of working agreements with provincial 
environmental enforcement officials needs to be pursued more 
fully and more effectively. Federal-provincial overlap concerns 
must be addressed in this review and resolved as it is one of the 
recommendations in the final CEPA report.
<P>
<B>(1050) </B>
<P>
	Another area of federal-provincial overlap which needs to be 
addressed is that of regulations and policies and the provinces. 
The preliminary findings of the regulatory review noted overlap 
with the provincial regulations concerning asbestos mills and 
mines, release regulations, secondary lead smelter release 
regulations, storage of PCB materials and ozone depleting 
substance regulations.
<P>
	There are two sets of regulations which is one set too many. 
We must work toward one clear set of regulations as a second set 
not only complicates matters but weakens the efficiency of both 
the federal and provincial regulations. Both parties have the 
same common goal and as such the two levels of government 
must co-ordinate their efforts and work together.
<P>
	It appears that the implementation of the act has also been 
slow at the start with the priority substances list. Back in 1988 
the act provided for the compilation of the list. The priority 
substance list was intended to identify chemicals and other 
materials that required urgent assessment and evaluation in 
order to determine their toxicities. Once the toxicity was 
determined regulations were then to be recommended. 
Forty-four chemicals were identified as priorities for 
assessment on the priority substances list. Yet three years after 
the act was passed only two had been fully identified. Even as 
recent as this  February it was reported that the list of 44 
chemicals was still awaiting assessment.
<P>
	This week I learned from the environment department that of 
the 44 chemical substances approximately 33 had been assessed 
and reported. Yet information to properly assess the 11 
remaining substances was still inadequate. This delay in 
chemical assessment and reporting needs to be evaluated as it is 
critical to the development of regulations and recommendations 
that guide the implementation of the act.
<P>
	Toxic substances must be identified before they can be 
regulated. It is hoped that 100 chemical substances will be 
evaluated by the year 2000. That is 56 substances in six years or 
almost double the number which the department has barely 
managed to assess in an equivalent time. This is an issue which 
the committee will need to address carefully to get at the roots of 
this matter.
<P>
	Not only the assessment of toxic substances but also the 
definition of toxic appear to be areas which may warrant further 
examination. Critics have noted that toxics are defined too 
narrowly in the act. One problem with this narrow definition has 
been its failure to deal with environmental emergencies. 
Perhaps an expanded definition may allow for greater 
application of the act. As a result this is certainly an area for 
discussion.
<P>
	Another area of CEPA which needs to be addressed is that of 
its ability to address the harm that toxics cause to the 
environment and human health. CEPA needs to move forward to 
a more proactive position. Policies to date have been largely 
reactive.
<P>
	One aspect of the act which I have mentioned is the regulation 
of the discharge of toxic substances. The act needs to take the 
next step forward and focus on discouraging the manufacture 
and use of these toxic substances. Rather than constantly 
cleaning up our mess afterward, we should stop making it in the 
first place. This will be an area on which the review should 
concentrate.
<P>
	One of the main criticisms of the administration of CEPA has 
been the enforcement of its regulations. Out of more than 5,800 
inspections carried out from June 1988 to March 1990, 300 
violations were found. Of these only five companies or 
individuals were successfully prosecuted on nine charges. The 
average fine was less than $3,000.
<P>
	Following this track record, the auditor general made 
recommendations in his 1991 report that Environment Canada 
needed to make enforcement and compliance with its 
regulations top priorities. The report also noted that clear levels 
of compliance needed to be established. Yet a year later the 
auditor general in his 1992 report noted that the previous year's 
recommendations had not been carried out. The 1992 report 
emphasized that standards of environmental quality were still 
lacking. There was still a lack of knowledge surrounding the 
whole issue of compliance and enforcement. The department 
seemed unable to provide the facts on how  well the act was 
being implemented, how many businesses and individuals were 
complying with the laws, where enforcement was necessary and 
who needed to be prosecuted. Four years after its enactment it 
was not possible to assess the effectiveness of these existing 
regulations.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>

<B><A NAME="5148"> 5148 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1055) </B>
<P>
	In 1992 the department investigated 103 cases of polluting in 
the 12 months ending March 31, 1992 but only prosecuted 20 
cases. A recent report notes that Environment Canada lays fewer 
than 30 pollution charges a year in the entire country. Most 
polluters are let off with warnings.
<P>
	The auditor general's report of April 1990 to March 1991 
stated that legislation and regulation were only as good as their 
enforcement. However when examining the act I should 
emphasize that this may not be the direction we would 
necessarily take.
<P>
	Enforcement is not the key word here; it is compliance. A law 
may only be good if it successfully punishes the individual. 
However it is better if it deters the individual from breaking the 
law or, even better yet, if it encourages the individual to follow 
the law. The effectiveness of CEPA must be measured in its level 
of compliance.
<P>
	This is the old carrot and stick principle. It is much better to 
lead the donkey with the carrot than to beat it with a stick. Not to 
confuse people with donkeys, people should be much more 
willing to comply with incentive than to be focusing their efforts 
on not getting caught.
<P>
	What needs to be looked at here is how we can build 
incentives around the act as with all environmental legislation 
and principles. The December 1993 CEPA report makes many 
excuses for the lack of enforcement of CEPA. This says to me 
that something is drastically wrong. The difficulty is targeting 
what it is so that we can fix it.
<P>
	Some environmental groups have complained that this law is 
not tough enough and needs a major overhaul. CEPA has been 
called toothless because it is so seldom enforced. Even a former 
policy adviser with the department called the approach wimpy 
as it allows industrial polluters to continue contaminating 
places such as the St. Lawrence River.
<P>
	As we look at the bill we need to ask the question is the act not 
stiff enough or is the act not being enforced? There are three 
possibilities: first, that the penalties are too lenient; second, that 
the enforcement is inadequate; or, third, that there is not too 
much wrong out there at all, which I rather doubt. This 
enforcement dilemma should be examined in detail and I look 
forward to doing that in committee. The final report includes 
many excuses for its lack of implementation. Some of these 
excuses contain some valid concerns.
<P>
	In conclusion, I would like to say that environmental laws can 
no longer be just reactive; they must be  proactive. This 
philosophy must be applied to all our environmental legislation 
if we are to achieve our goal of sustainable development. We 
must leave this planet to future generations in better condition 
than we inherited.
<P>
	There are many concerns with CEPA that will be addressed. 
Some of the concerns I have mentioned, and it is not a 
comprehensive list, included federal-provincial overlaps, the 
priority substances list, and issues concerning enforcement and 
compliance of the act.
<P>
	Over the next year as a member of the Standing Committee on 
Environment and Sustainable Development I look forward to 
participating in the task before us. We will take the act apart, 
examine it and look at it carefully. We will need a balanced 
perspective from both industry and environmental groups to 
help us with the task. In the end I hope we will put together a 
more efficient and effective act that does the job of cleaning up 
the environment which each and every one of us so much enjoys.

economic consequences of Quebec separation arises has taught 
Mr. Parizeau and the Bloc Quebecois a lesson in economics and 
given them a reality check.
<P>
	Mr. Raymond Théoret, an economics professor at UQAM, is 
quoted as saying the following: ``Obviously the climate of 
political uncertainty in Quebec will push up the high cost of 
borrowing on international markets. This will translate into 
higher costs for people taking out mortgages or bank loans. 
Anyone who says otherwise is trying to delude the public''.
<P>
	Furthermore, he had this to say about the statements made by 
the president of the Bank of Montreal: ``The banks are not 
wrong''. He concluded with the following remarks: ``Quebec 
sovereignty is the worst-case scenario. Unfortunately, it could 
prove to be the straw that breaks the camel's back''.
<P>
	In light of these statements, is Mr. Parizeau planning to 
retaliate in some way against Mr. Théoret? Will he threaten to 
fire him should he become the Premier of Quebec?

democracy.

	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East):</B> Mr. Speaker, there 
seems to be confusion about defining the family.
<P>
	Yet for a millennia the term has been understood worldwide. 
Ancient Assyrian, Babylonian, Hebrew, Hittite and Roman law 
refer often to the family and assume the common understanding. 
Current legal definitions also support what the vast majority of 
Canadians believe. From the Income Tax Act to the Oxford 
English Dictionary the definition is clear and I do not think we 
can improve on it.
<P>
	The Dictionary of Canadian Law states: ``Family includes a 
man and a woman living together as husband and wife, whether 
or not married in a permanent relationship, or the survivor of 
either, and includes the children of both or either, natural or 
adopted-and any person lawfully related to any of the 
aforementioned persons''.

jurisprudence. We hope he will take into account historic, global

for regional economic development. The same clause applies to 
all the governments that will sign the agreement, including the 
federal government and all the provinces.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister may have read or heard the opposition 
leader's comments but I do not know whether he has read or 
heard that Quebec's Minister of Industry, who, like himself, is a 
federalist and a Liberal, said yesterday: ``It is unacceptable''. It 
was not the Leader of the Opposition but the Liberal minister 
who made those comments. I imagine the minister must have 
read that too, as it is a large headline in the newspaper.
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
	I ask the minister whether he specifically promises to review 
his position so that the Quebec government can preserve all the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5153"> 5153 </A></B>
<P>
powers it needs to help businesses and promote regional 
development, as not only the Leader of the Opposition but also 
Quebec's Liberal government have asked him.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
regret to inform the hon. member that the negotiations are not 
yet completed with respect to an internal trade agreement.
<P>
	As I always understood the position of the Bloc Quebecois, it 
favoured trade liberalizing agreements. Apparently it favours 
them with other countries but not with other provinces. This is a 
difficult thing for me to comprehend.
<P>
	With respect to the specific question on regional economic 
development, let me say that we have conducted discussions 
throughout the process as a multilateral negotiation. The federal 
government is at the table with a position. Provincial 
governments of various political colours are at the table and 
they have different positions.
<P>
	Our position from the point of view of the federal government 
is we want the maximum possible trade liberalizing measures 
within the internal trade agreement. We believe that is essential 
in order to enable Canadian firms to develop the domestic 
market to make them competitive in the international trading 
arenas in which they find themselves, whether we talk of 
NAFTA or whether we talk of the General Agreement on Tariffs 
and Trade, the Uruguay round which was concluded recently. 
That is our objective.
<P>
	At the end of the day, the provinces and the federal 
government are going to have to look at the deal that has been 
negotiated. The provinces are entitled to put forward what they 
want. Collectively we will have to decide whether we have an 
agreement which makes a measurable improvement both in 
economic terms as well as in the structured terms over the 
existing conditions.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I understand that the minister has trouble conceiving 
that the Bloc Quebecois could be against the abolition of 
provincial trade barriers because the Bloc Quebecois never said 
that and has always favoured expanded trade. Of course, he 
cannot comprehend that we never said that. It is rather easy to 
understand.
<P>
	I would also remind the minister that Quebec approved the 
free trade agreement while the people opposite were always 
against it. I ask him for a little more transparency from someone 
claiming that the federal government and the provinces are 
about to reach an agreement when Quebec's Minister of 
Industry, I remind you, finds it unacceptable that Ottawa should 
impose its will in matters of interprovincial trade. Is he willing 
to make the proposed agreement public to ensure transparency 
and enlighten the debate, so that Quebecers and Canadians can 
judge what is in the agreement?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
can understand that perhaps the hon. member does not 
understand that much about interprovincial trade. The point I 
was trying to make was that clearly if the Bloc Quebecois 
favours international trading agreements then it must be 
prepared to see a liberalization of trade within Canada. If that is 
not the case then perhaps the Bloc should make that clear.
<P>
	With respect to the specific response that was given, I 
understand the question that is being put. I will try to put this as 
clearly and as simply as possible. The federal government is not 
endeavouring to dictate measures to anybody. The federal 
government is approaching this internal trade agreement from 
the point of view that we wish to find a negotiated agreement 
among all parties voluntarily.
<P>
	The federal government is quite entitled to take a position at 
the bargaining table, as are other parties to the discussion. That, 
in simple terms, is what a negotiation is all about. We are trying 
to facilitate, but we are also there with a negotiating position 
which is that we want the most trade liberalizing agreement that 
we can get.
<P>
	The measures which the hon. member first raised-and I take 
time because I believe this is very important-we have agreed 
on an exception for regional economic development. It will 
apply to the federal government and to the provincial 
governments.
<P>
<B>(1125) </B>
<P>
	Mr. Tremblay of Quebec asked for the time and is assuring 
himself that the measures he takes by way of industrial policy 
within his province will not be unduly hampered by the internal 
trade agreement based on reliance upon this exception.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I can understand that some questions take 
longer answers and I can understand that some questions have to 
be long. However I would ask all hon. members to please curtail 
their questions and answers so that we might get more 
questioners on and more questions answered.

	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
documents tabled at Geneva, Canada identified the Crows Nest 
as both a subsidy for export and a domestic support measure. 
Accordingly, this subsidy is subject to reductions.
<P>
	However, in respect to domestic support, Canada has already 
fulfilled its obligations toward GATT. Furthermore, it is wrong 
to maintain, as did the Minister of Transport, that Canada must 
abolish these agricultural subsidies in order to meet GATT 
requirements.

recognize that he is misleading grain producers by stating that 
Canada is obliged to abolish Crows Nest subsidies in order to 
meet GATT requirements?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the last thing the Minister of Transport would want to do is to 
mislead the western grain farmers. We understand the 
importance of programs that assist western farmers in the 
production and the transportation of grain.
<P>
	What I did say is that we are also aware of the changes that 
will have to be implemented with respect to the role that 
Transport Canada plays in the payment of direct subsidies to 
railroads. That is what we said and that is what we are going to 
have to address.
<P>
	I do want to say, with all respect to my hon. colleague, that in 
the area of providing support and being very sensitive to the 
needs of the western grain farmers, the Minister of Transport 
always gives way to the very capable Minister of Agriculture 
and Agri-Food.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est):</B> Mr. Speaker, does 
the Minister of Transport admit that any solution concerning the 
Crow's Nest subsidy must respect east-west equity among 
producers and avoid exposing eastern producers to unfair 
competition from western producers as a result of alternative 
federal subsidies?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is at least in part because of the 
great complexity of this issue that we intend to take the 
necessary time in order to consider all points of view and arrive 
at a very considered judgment as to what any future reform 
measures ought to be.
<P>
	The hon. member has touched upon some of the complexities. 
There are many others. That is why the Minister of Transport 
and I have repeatedly said that we have processes under way 
already. There will be additional processes started later this year 
and continued through the fall and winter to hear all of the 
stakeholders who are involved in this very complicated and 
difficult matter. We will make sure that all points of view are 
taken into account. When the Government of Canada makes a 
decision with respect to transportation reform, it will make sure 
all of the issues are appropriately and fully addressed.

	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
according to an Angus Reid and Southam News poll on criminal 
justice released yesterday, 82 per cent of Canadians say the 
justice system is too soft on crime, while only one per cent think 
it is too harsh.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This is the case in all regions of the country. For example, in 
Quebec, 74 per cent say that the system is too permissive and 
only 2 per cent say that it is too strict.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Justice. What concrete 
measures will the minister be introducing to address these very 
clear concerns of Canadians about the criminal justice system?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, in short, this government 
will be following through on its commitments made during last 
year's election campaign in which we dealt at length with steps 
we intend to take to achieve safe homes and safe streets, as we 
put it. The changes that were introduced last week with respect 
to the Young Offenders Act are the first example that I would 
proffer to the hon. member.
<P>
<B>(1130) </B>
<P>
	I may mention as well that in the days ahead we intend to table 
legislation that will significantly reform the sentencing 
provisions in the Criminal Code. We intend to bring forward a 
variety of other amendments to the code to make it more 
effective in terms of prescribing and enforcing the criminal law.
<P>
	May I emphasize perhaps most of all the initiative that I 
expect the Solicitor General and I will be announcing in the 
coming weeks concerning the forging of a national strategy for 
crime prevention and the creation of a national crime prevention 
council, which I think is the most constructive response to the 
concern in the community to which the hon. member has 
referred.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Canadians are clear in their belief that the number one solution 
to these problems is in the criminal justice system.
<P>
	One in four Canadians reports having been the victim of crime 
in the past two years; 44 per cent of Canadians have taken 
measures to protect themselves including the purchasing of 
weapons, 73 per cent want the death penalty restored for the 
killing of police officers and 86 per cent want laws to make it 
more difficult to get parole.
<P>
	Are these some of the concerns that the minister plans to bring 
forward in his criminal justice reforms?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, very much so. May I say that 
it will also be part of our response to emphasize that the criminal 
justice system, while it has an important part in all of this, 
cannot by itself resolve the question of crime or respond to the 
concern of Canadians.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5155"> 5155 </A></B>
<P>
	Ultimately this government recognizes that to meet those 
concerns to improve the quality of life in this country, to achieve 
the safe homes and safe streets of which we spoke last year, we 
must come to grips with the underlying causes of crime. We 
must have both an effective justice system that is enforced 
properly and a comprehensive strategy for crime prevention. 
That is the agenda of this government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Canadians are clear that one of the, if not the root cause of crime 
is the criminal himself. We expect to see that addressed.

Mr. Speaker, my question is for the solicitor general.
<P>
	On New Year's Day 1981, serial killer Clifford Olson picked 
up a 16-year old female hitchhiker, pulled out a gun and then 
proceeded to repeatedly rape her over a 12-hour period. This 
incident took place two weeks after the first of 11 murders Olson 
committed.
<P>
	The victim reported the incident to the Squamish RCMP 
detachment and Olson was arrested. When it was learned that 
the victim was a prostitute there were no further proceedings. As 
the RCMP were the police force involved in this incident, is the 
minister prepared to tell Canadians why this case did not 
proceed?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have read the news report 
which has been summarized by the hon. member in her question 
but I know nothing more about it than was reported in the press.
<P>
	The press report does raise troubling questions and I am 
certain that the solicitor general will want to consider the matter 
and inquire to determine the facts. I do not know that the 
premise upon which the question is based is factually correct, 
that is to say that the investigation was dropped because the 
victim was a prostitute. I know that was the suggestion in the 
news story.
<P>
	I am sure the solicitor general will want to look into the facts 
and respond when they are known.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, one of the underlying causes of crime is that the 
justice system does not work.
<P>
	I would like to ask the Minister of Justice if he is prepared to 
ensure Canadians that a victim's lifestyle will not be considered 
a determining factor of whether criminal charges should be laid.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney

question, let me respond to the hon. member's assertion with

be a fundamental part of the justice system that it responds 
equally regardless of the lifestyle of the victim. I would

victim, allegations of crime are investigated and prosecuted and 
punished without reference to such a consideration.

western Canada.
<P>
	Farmers all across Canada are asking themselves a question 
and they want and need to know the answer. I would ask the

believe him when he says that the WGTA of some $600 million 
will be cut by July 1, 1995 or should they believe the minister of 
agriculture who says that this has not yet been decided? This is 
not the kind of double talk that farmers want or need to hear.

	Will the Minister of Transport stand in this House today and 
clearly explain what his plans are for the WGTA?
<P>

Department of Transport in the budget document and elsewhere 
has indicated that we have to change the way we subsidize

	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
yes, indeed it is.
<P>
	The Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council 
appeared before the industry committee on May 24. There was 
an opportunity at that time for members of all parties to ask 
questions. Certainly the member for Okanagan Centre, who is 
on that committee, asked among other things: ``Why is the 
SSHRC funded so much less than the other councils?''. He also 
said: ``I am not debating the merits of your research. All of you 
have made an excellent case for the humanities and social 
sciences. I would not debate that the need is there. There is 
absolutely no question about that''.
<P>
	I am very pleased to note that the Reform Party supports the 
work that is being done by this granting council.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
nobody denies that research into the social sciences is a good 
thing. The people that are represented at that meeting perhaps 
are doing a good job as far as questioning social science issues.
<P>
<B>(1150) </B>
<P>
	However, when we see examples like $33,700 to study 
parades and demonstrations in 19th century Toronto, or $21,000 
to study communication among English country workers in the 
use of rural song, perhaps the minister would answer the 
question.
<P>
	Somebody must be questioning the use of Canadian 
taxpayers' funds. If he is not going to do it, who is?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, as I 
say, it is indeed open to all members of the House, particularly 
members of that committee, to raise questions such as those the 
member has raised with the council when they come before the 
committee.
<P>
	I think that would be well worthwhile. It is unfortunate 
Reform Party members perhaps did not do their research before 
the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council appeared 
before them. That was their chance. Perhaps they will do it next 
year.

	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday Mr. Win, democratically elected Prime 
Minister of the provisional government of the Union of Burma, 
which is prevented from taking office by a military junta, was 
the guest of the human rights committee. The committee 
members learned that Burma has one of the worst human rights 
records in Asia, and holds hundreds of people prisoner for 
political reasons, including a Nobel peace prize winner.
<P>
	My question is for the Deputy Prime Minister. Could she tell 
us whether the Canadian government intends to agree to the 
main request of the National Democracy League and oppose any 
form of financial support to the military junta through various 
UN agencies?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment): </B>Mr. Speaker, if I understand the first part 
of his question, the member is making a request on behalf of 
democratic peoples who are fighting for the return of democracy 
in Burma? Do I understand him correctly?
<P>
	I met their leaders yesterday, and they asked me just about the 
opposite of what the member is asking today. They asked that 
financial support be granted not to the government but to 
non-governmental agencies. The Canadian government offered 
the democracy movement the resources of the Human Rights 
Commission, here in Montreal. We are, of course, aware of their 
request and are taking it into consideration.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve):</B> Through 
you, Mr. Speaker, I must tell the Deputy Prime Minister that she 
did not understand. There is a military junta in power in Burma, 
and the league is asking that UN agencies not give it any 
support. My first question dealt with that request, and we are 
counting on the Deputy Prime Minister to agree to it.
<P>
	My supplementary is this: We are told by the Department of 
International Trade that, in view of Burma's human rights abuse 
record, Canadian corporations are encouraged not to do business 
with that country. However, its neighbour, China, which is 
supplying the junta with arms, is not subject to any trade 
restriction. How can the Deputy Prime Minister justify her 
government's ambiguous position? I can say it again if it is not 
clear enough.

	According to a confidential report leaked from the minister's

<P>
	On the basis of this increase in the acceptance rate for inland 
refugee applications, Canada will surpass its stated annual

<P>
	Yesterday in the House we heard that the policy of the Reform 
Party was based on the premise that First Nations' members are 
lazy children. The speaker from Capilano-Howe Sound also 
said that this might be against conventional wisdom. I would 
suggest it is unconventional ignorance.
<P>
	The New Democratic Party's position is that the Government 
of Canada has a longstanding historic obligation, shared by 
provinces and territories, to negotiate land claims in good faith 
with aboriginal people.

<P>
	[<I>Editor's Note: Member spoke in Inuktitut.</I>]
<P>
[<I>English</I>]
<P>
	I rise today on a point of privilege stemming from remarks 
made yesterday in the House by the member for 
Capilano-Howe Sound. The member's comments about 
aboriginal people have denigrated me, my work and my value to 
the House. As an aboriginal person, my character, my 
background, my credibility, my values, my motivations and my 
capabilities have been questioned.
<P>
	Slurs, aspersions and racial stereotypes were tossed out 
yesterday with no regard for the injurious effects upon myself, 
the hon. member for Western Arctic and the hon. member for 
Churchill. I and they have been discredited and dishonoured 
because of our racial background.
<P>
	As a consequence, the House has also been brought into 
disrepute. The member should have kept the people of Canada 
thinking that maybe he is merely ignorant of aboriginal issues, 
instead of proving it.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. member surely has a grievance. I do 
not think it is a point of privilege.
<P>
	I would remind all hon. members that one of our most 
treasured privileges and rights is the freedom of speech. I would 
rule that there would be no point of privilege in this particular 
case. However I would advise that perhaps the hon. member, in 
view of the fact that debate is not finished, could make his point 
of view known in future debate.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
on a point of order, as a matter of clarification.
<P>
	Am I to understand that when one raises a point of privilege in

privilege can be fully made? I think it would be instructive for

<P>
	The Chair is guided of course by the fact that privilege is very 
narrow. Far be it from me to lecture this honourable House but I 
would like to point out that privilege has to do with the 
impediment of a member of Parliament carrying out his or her 
responsibilities and duties.
<P>
	Among these duties is for all hon. members to be able to speak 
freely, to be able to come to the House and to committees and to 
vote. As the hon. member is present, as the hon. member is 
speaking, I do not see any question of privilege. That is why I 
interceded as quickly as I did.

	<B>Hon. Audrey McLaughlin (Yukon):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today on a point of order.
<P>
	Yesterday in the House, the member for Capilano-Howe 
Sound used what I consider to be language of profound 
disrespect and fundamental bias against the First Nations of this 
country, in particular the people of Yukon. I advised the member 
for Capilano-Howe Sound that I would be raising this point of 
order today.
<P>
	In particular, I refer to the phase that First Nations people are 
to be seen as ``lazy children''. I would ask whether the member 
was referring, by using that phrase, to the late Elijah Smith who 
fought in World War II for this country and who came back to 
fight the struggle within for his people in Yukon; whether he was 
referring to the aboriginal members of the Legislature of the 
Yukon Assembly, Speaker Johnny Abel, Danny Joe, Margaret 
Commodore, the first Indian Speaker in Canada, Sam Johnston, 
and Norma Kassi who fights for the environment.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Ms. McLaughlin:</B> I am concluding but I would ask if he was 
referring Skookum Jim, one of the discoverers of gold. Perhaps 
he was referring to the Yukon chiefs, the aboriginal lawyers, 
aboriginal nurses, miners, truckers, farmers, teachers, board 
members, clerks, secretaries, businessmen, businesswomen, 
writers, artists, trappers, mothers, fathers, grandmothers and 
grandfathers.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The Chair is very much aware that in the 
process of debate very strong positions are put forward. What 
the Chair must ensure is that there is a chance for all hon. 
members to speak in the House. The hon. member brings up her 
point of order. Perhaps the hon. member could defer until the 
hon. member who made the statements is in the House.
<P>
	The hon. member indicated that she was concluding. I will 
permit her to conclude and we will go from there.
<P>
	<B>Ms. McLaughlin:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate that very much.
<P>
	Members will understand that as the member of Parliament 
for Yukon, I feel very strongly about this. I will be very brief.
<P>
	It is clear to the House, it is certainly clear to me as the 
member for the Yukon and to the people of Yukon, aboriginal 
and non-aboriginal, that the Reform Party will come to a 
discussion of this issue with a prior prejudice against First 
Nations' people as lazy children.
<P>
	Therefore, as the member for Yukon, I ask the House to 
remove the Reform Party members from the committee struck-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order. When these statements were made in the 
House, as far as I can ascertain they caused no disorder. A few 
remarks were made. I would encourage all hon. members, in 
view of the fact that the debate on this bill is ongoing for the next 
little while, that they can make their views known there.
<P>
<B>(1210 ) </B>
<P>
	As a ruling, I find there is no point of order in this particular 
case. Again I would encourage all hon. members to be very 
judicious in their remarks as some remarks made in the heat of 
debate can be very hurtful to different groups.
<P>
	I would again encourage all hon. members to be very 
judicious in all of the remarks they make in the House.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise on a point of order.
<P>
	I accept the advice and accept fully the caution of the Chair 
for all members to keep the tone and level of discussion on this 
matter at a level where it is productive and constructive. Mr. 
Speaker, let me begin by saying that because it is hurtful to all 
members of the House in every party, including the Reform 
Party I hope and believe.
<P>
	When one member speaks in such a manner about an entire 
group of people, it casts aspersions on the whole House. It calls 
into question the character, integrity and dignity of the whole 
House. I hope that all members, without exception, from every 
party will dissociate themselves from the words of this one 
member who has clearly lost any connection to decency and to 
intelligence and the dignity of this debate.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleagues, I guess it proves a point. I know 
that we want to get into this debate because it is really debate 
now. That is what has opened up.

becoming debate. We are beyond the points of order. That is 
clearly not a point of order. It is a point of debate.
<P>
	I would again caution all members to be very judicious in 
their remarks.
<P>
	Is this the same point of order? I have heard quite a bit. This is 
not a point of order. We are into debate now.

majority of Canadians respect the sanctity of human life. The 
majority of Canadians believe that physicians in Canada should 
be working to save lives not to end them.
<P>
	The petitioners therefore pray that Parliament will ensure that 
the present provisions of the Criminal Code of Canada 
prohibiting assisted suicide be enforced rigorously, and that 
Parliament makes no changes to the law which would sanction 
or allow the abiding or abetting of suicide or active or passive 
euthanasia.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I do not want to delay 
debate but I want to remind all members that it being Friday and 
under normal circumstances the debate will conclude at 1.30 
p.m. I would therefore ask members who are participating that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5164"> 5164 </A></B>
<P>
their questions and answers be as brief as possible so that I 
might allow on your behalf as many of you to participate in the 
debate as possible.
<P>
	The clock will start on the 10-minute question and comment 
period to the member for Comox-Alberni and I will recognize 
first the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Industry.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, I take your remarks under 
advisement.
<P>
	The question has to do with national standards in the area of 
the environment. There have been times in the last week during 
the unity debate, et cetera, where we as members of Parliament 
were getting mixed signals from the Reform Party as to its 
commitment for national standards.
<P>
	Quite simply, would the member tell this House if he shares 
the view of this side of the House? We believe in the area of the 
environment that we should commit to national standards and 
this House of Commons, the Government of Canada, is the best 
place to make sure those national standards are maintained.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilmour:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for the 
opportunity to respond because the Reform Party does indeed 
believe in national standards.
<P>
	Part of the problem with the Canadian Environmental 
Protection Act has been the overlap between provincial and 
federal government regulations. There is one party in this House 
which would choose to have it all in the provinces, but we do not 
take that position. We feel strongly that the role of the federal 
government is to provide the umbrella for overseeing 
documents.
<P>
	I look forward to looking at this area of overlap in the standing 
committee. Clearly over the last six years it has been an area of 
disagreement in CEPA. The overlap has not in my view been to 
the benefit of the implementation of the act because it is 
grinding things down rather than helping to get the work done.
<P>
	I hope I have answered the member's question. If not, we can 
deal with it further in the lobby.
<P>
<B>(1225 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
ask that if I do not take up all my time I be allowed to share it 
with the member for York-Simcoe.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I support the motion put forward by my colleague, the 
Minister of the Environment, to refer the Canadian 
Environmental Protection Act to the Standing Committee on 
Environment and Sustainable Development for review.
<P>
	One of my responsibilities as Minister of Health consist in 
protecting the health of Canadians against hazards posed by 
environmental contaminants. As part of my mandate, I share 
responsibility with the Minister of the Environment for the 
administration of the Canadian Environmental Protection Act.
<P>
	Health Canada looks after protecting the health and 
well-being of Canadians against any adverse effect of pollution. 
I believe that the Canadian Environmental Protection Act is and 
will continue to be a major legislative tool when it comes to 
protecting public health.
<P>
	Canadians are concerned about adverse effects the 
environment may have on their health. Such concerns were 
clearly expressed during the 1990 consultations on the green 
plan.
<P>
	At that time, Canadians were invited to express their views on 
the subject in public fora. They suggested that certain priorities 
be recognized with respect to actions to be taken to deal with 
environmental problems and their health implications.
<P>
	Canadians stated unequivocally that they wanted the 
government not only to clean up the environment, but also to 
protect human health. They also told us they wanted to have the 
information and knowledge required to take action, individually 
and collectively, regarding the environment.
<P>
	Canadians have realized that their health and well-being 
depend not only on the environment, but on environmentally 
sustainable development. Canadians count on the leadership the 
government can provide in that area by developing appropriate 
protection mechanisms.
<P>
	Every Canadian is at risk in his or her daily life. Some risks 
are related to behaviour while others are related to the social or 
physical environment in which we live and work.
<P>
	Health Canada is responsible for informing the public as to 
the risks over which each of us can, to a certain extent, have 
direct control.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	CEPA is an important tool for protection against the health 
risks of environmental contamination. Individuals have little 
direct control over some of these. Clean air and water and a safe 
and nutritious food supply are the basic requirements for health. 
Without them how can we have sustainable development?
<P>
	During the green plan consultation chemical contamination of 
air, water and food was high on the list of concerns of Canadians. 
The resulting green plan program made clear the connection 
between the environment and health. It embodied an action plan 
on health and the environment for which I am responsible. A 
number of activities under the action plan address the issue of 
environmental contaminants and health.
<P>
	For example, in the latest phase of the Great Lakes program, 
Great Lakes 2000, $25.5 million is allotted for addressing health 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5165"> 5165 </A></B>
<P>
concerns. The goal is to reduce human exposure and risk to 
pollution by 30 per cent by the year 2000.
<P>
	Another program under the action plan concerns drinking 
water. I would like to bring to Parliament Canada's first federal 
legislation covering drinking water safety. The act would 
legislate drinking water quality in the federal domain, for 
example on reserves. It would also establish standards for 
materials and chemicals used in water and water treatment 
devices.
<P>
	The action plan also gave additional support to CEPA in order 
to accelerate the risk assessment of high priority environmental 
contaminants. These examples show clearly that the primary 
concern of my department in all of these activities is the threat 
posed to the health and well-being of Canadians by exposure to 
environmental contaminants.
<P>
	On the issue of chemicals they can bestow enormous benefits, 
indeed a host of substances enhance our standard of living. 
However some chemicals may pose risks to health. In our 
pursuit of progress we must ensure that human health is not 
compromised. Such protection is part of the essential fabric of 
CEPA, particularly in part II of the act where, in concert with the 
Minister of the Environment, we have responsibilities for the 
assessment and management of toxic substances.
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
	We need to seek new ways to deal with these increasingly 
complex problems. Hence the timeliness of the parliamentary 
review which provides an opportunity to examine ways to better 
deal with these chemicals.
<P>
	For many Canadians environmental quality is seen largely 
from a health perspective. Public opinion polls conducted over 
the past few years have found that a large majority were very 
concerned about toxic chemicals for health reasons.
<P>
	Canadians are living longer, healthier lives than ever before. 
We are already among the healthiest people in the world. We 
enjoy a high standard of living in a beautiful country, blessed 
with abundant natural resources. In order to sustain and further 
improve our health and well-being we must never let down our 
guard and become complacent about the risks posed by 
environmental pollution.
<P>
	I believe that CEPA has been an important step in addressing 
these concerns. CEPA deals with the issue of toxic substances in 
the environment through a powerful framework for identifying, 
assessing and managing toxic substances.
<P>
	Prevention has a long history in public health where a basic 
tenet has been the need for measures to prevent illness and 
disease. Our concepts of health and environment are broadening 
and expanding.
<P>
	As recently as half a century ago health meant simply not 
being ill. Health is now seen as a resource for everyday living, 
an essential part of the quality of life. Good health is no longer 
simply the responsibility of the individual. It has come to 
involve the interaction between individuals, their communities 
and the environment.
<P>
	Our concept of the environment has also expanded and 
includes not only our natural surroundings but also our homes, 
our work places and our communities.
<P>
	These broadened concepts of health and environment need to 
be considered in the renewal of CEPA. Over the years the federal 
government has enacted a number of statutes which exercise 
some form of control over toxic substances. My department 
carries out its health promotion role primarily by enforcing 
various federal laws and regulations. Some are our sole 
responsibility, for example the Food and Drugs Act, the 
Hazardous Products Act, and of course the Tobacco Products 
Control Act.
<P>
	I would be remiss if I did not mention some of the 
achievements to date: The development of regulations in 
partnership with Environment Canada for ozone depleting 
substances, PCBs, vinyl chloride, dioxins and furans from pulp 
and paper mills, the notification regulations for new chemicals 
and polymers and, last, gasoline regulations which required the 
accelerated phase-out of leaded fuel which has a significant 
impact in reducing human exposure to lead.
<P>
	As well, earlier this year with Environment Canada we 
released the remaining assessments of the original 44 
substances on the first priority substances list to meet the 
five-year deadline imposed by the act. I understand that no other 
jurisdiction in the world has completed a comparable task in so 
short a time.
<P>
	In closing, let me reaffirm my support for the referral of 
CEPA to the parliamentary committee. I recognize the 
importance and magnitude of the task before it and I look 
forward to contributing the knowledge and expertise of my 
department to its work.
<P>
	I look forward to supporting the committee as it looks at how a 
renewed Canadian Environmental Protection Act may 
contribute to creating and sustaining an environment that will 
not only maintain but enhance our health.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (York-Simcoe):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
pollution has been a prominent threat to Canada's environment 
for many decades. Since 1988 the Canadian Environmental 
Protection Act has enabled the federal Minister of the 
Environment to regulate environmental pollution at the national 
level. Through an ecosystem approach it addresses pollution 
problems on land, in water and in all layers of the atmosphere.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5166"> 5166 </A></B>
<P>
	CEPA was designed to improve the government's 
environment record and standards on federal lands as well as 
First Nations lands and to enable Canada to fulfil its 
international environmental protection obligations.
<P>
<B>(1235 ) </B>
<P>
	The act covers a number of regulations ranging from controls 
on CFCs through pulp and paper effluence to PCB storage. In the 
red book a Liberal government pledged to use the five-year 
review of the Canadian Environmental Protection Act to make 
pollution prevention a national goal and to strengthen the 
enforcement of federal pollution standards. This is exactly what 
this government intends to do.
<P>
	The Standing Committee on the Environment and Sustainable 
Development is an excellent choice to undertake this review. 
The committee will be able to assess the effects of toxic 
substances on the health of entire ecosystems. We must take 
advantage of this opportunity to review CEPA and learn more 
about the effects of toxic substances on the environment.
<P>
	We must identify and improve our understanding of 
atmospheric pollutants. The health of our ecosystems ultimately 
affects human health. Although the link between ecosystem 
health and human health is complex, we cannot ignore an 
ecosystem which is ailing. We cannot ignore fish with tumours 
caused by toxins, birds with crossed bills caused by eating 
contaminated fish and reproductive problems in wildlife that eat 
fish.
<P>
	We cannot help but fear that human health is also in jeopardy 
since they are so inextricably linked. Fortunately Canada still 
has a number of rivers and lakes which can be considered clean. 
Yet we also have ecosystems that have been contaminated by 
industrial effluence, agricultural and urban run-off. There has 
been some progress made in slowing the degradation of 
Canada's ecosystems.
<P>
	In order to ensure a healthy environment for future 
generations, we must develop new ways to protect our 
resources. I believe we must review CEPA as one part of our 
strategy to create a sustainable environment. We must make 
appropriate amendments in order to meet the environmental 
challenges of the 21st century.
<P>
	In the past, Canada has concentrated on regulating the release 
of pollutants. This approach has had success. However I also 
feel that we must develop new approaches that target pollution 
prevention at the source to complement CEPA. Manufacturing 
innovations and other environmental technologies are needed to 
correct the problem where it is created.
<P>
	Currently Canada has about 4,500 environmental firms 
employing 150,000 people with combined revenues in excess of 
$11 billion. By the year 2000 the International Monetary Fund 
has forecasted that the environmental technology market is 
anticipated to reach $600 billion.
<P>
	I believe that this government should support Canadian 
entrepreneurs and their endeavours to seize opportunities in this 
industry. Canada has developed a global reputation as an 
environmental leader and we must continue to build on this role. 
New environmental technologies and services will promote 
economic growth in Canada. New technologies will also enable 
us to clean up and prevent environmental problems.
<P>
	In the pulp and paper industry, new technology has reduced 
the quantity of suspended solids and oxygen depleting material 
in mill effluent. Just a few weeks ago I had the wonderful 
opportunity to tour a pulp and paper mill which is committed to 
cleaner production technologies and improved waste treatment.
<P>
	The hon. member for Thunder Bay-Atikokan was kind 
enough to extend an invitation to Avenor mill in his riding. I was 
very impressed by its water treatment system and recycling 
efforts. This plant has significantly reduced the concentration of 
toxic substances in mill effluents.
<P>
	Representatives from across the country have come to see the 
remarkable technological innovations this company has 
undertaken. We must applaud its effort and support future 
endeavours like this. I believe that CEPA has played a major role 
in identifying problems and forcing companies to realize that 
old environmentally harmful practices are not acceptable. 
However it is environmental technologies that have enabled 
companies to remedy the problem and promote more sustainable 
futures.
<P>
	In the review of CEPA we must ensure that the federal 
government does not overlap and duplicate provincial 
regulations. We must work with the provinces to streamline and 
harmonize our efforts in order to cut costs and reduce confusion 
and frustration for environmentalists and industrialists.
<P>
	Currently the Canadian Council of Environmental Ministers 
is in the process of working toward this end. Government and 
regulation are not just top down policies. I firmly believe that 
action at the community level is where real change occurs.
<P>
<B>(1240 ) </B>
<P>
	In the riding of York-Simcoe which I represent, the SOS 
Alliance has launched a public awareness of Lake Simcoe's 
serious phosphorous pollution problem in order to save Lake 
Simcoe.
<P>
	Currently thousands of tonnes of sediment and phosphorous 
are being dumped into the lake every year from urban and rural 
sources, twice the amount that the lake requires to evolve 
naturally. Evidence proves that the water quality has 
deteriorated.
<P>
	The SOS Alliance realizes that protecting Lake Simcoe 
ultimately protects our way of life and the entire ecosystem in 
the Lake Simcoe basin. In addition, by saving Lake Simcoe, a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5167"> 5167 </A></B>
<P>
natural resource worth $500  million annually to the economy of 
the Lake Simcoe watershed will also be saved.
<P>
	A healthy economy and standard of living are dependent upon 
a healthy environment. The public has shared an interest and a 
responsibility in the environment. Therefore, the public should 
be able to access information easily and should also play a role 
in the shaping of new laws and policies as well as becoming 
involved in community based environmental projects.
<P>
	Once the Standing Committee on the Environment and 
Sustainable Development is given the task to review CEPA, I, as 
vice-chair of this committee, will work with my colleagues to 
ensure that all sectors are consulted in our review process. I 
firmly believe that a review of CEPA with extensive 
consultation is a step in the right direction to ensure that Canada 
as a nation will be able to meet the environmental challenges of 
the 21st century.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Terrebonne):</B> Mr. Speaker, as a 
member of the Committee on Environment and Sustainable 
development, I think it is essential and very appropriate to make 
a comprehensive review of the Canadian Environmental 
Protection Act. Our future depends on the measures taken today. 
This is why it is vital to review the effectiveness of the act and, 
consequently, the effectiveness of the departments concerned by 
this legislation.
<P>
	The location of my beautiful riding of Terrebonne, which is 
bordered by the Prairies River, the Mille-Îles River and the 
majestic St. Lawrence River, and which is close to the island of 
Montreal, leads me to give particular attention to the 
management of our environment.
<P>
	My constituents are directly affected by the environmental 
decisions and policies implemented here. It is therefore 
essential for them, and for me, that we take a close look at how 
the act has evolved and how it has been managed. As I said 
earlier, given its location, my riding would be an appropriate 
place for the establishment of institutions dedicated to the 
environment and environmental technologies. This would make 
of one of the most populated ridings in the country a leader in the 
field of environment.
<P>
	Environmental protection depends on the sound management 
of allocated budgets. The idea is not to pass a law and then vote a 
budget to ensure its efficiency. Rather, we must closely monitor 
the implementation of the act, as well as the activities of the 
various organizations, and the departmental policies. Since the 
environment and health departments are the two responsible for 
the implementation of the act, it is essential that they both send 
experts to testify before the committee. This will enable us to 
better check and monitor how the act is being implemented.
<P>
	The Canadian Environmental Protection Act provides the 
necessary tools to protect the environment. It includes both 
preventive and corrective measures. We, members of the 
Standing Committee on Environment and Sustainable 
Development, must see to what extent these tools are being 
used. It should be remembered that the Department of the 
Environment has a budget of close to three quarters of a billion 
dollars. With that kind of money, some great things can surely be 
achieved.
<P>
	Our review of the Canadian Environmental Protection Act 
will certainly give us an opportunity to determine whether these 
goals and objectives have been achieved after five years of 
implementation. This act was sanctioned on June 28, 1988. Its 
ultimate goal was to help Canadians enjoy a healthy 
environment. It replaced and broadened the Environmental 
Contaminants Act. The new act has led to uniform guidelines, 
standards and regulations across the country.
<P>
	I should explain some of its provisions to help people better 
understand what the Environmental Protection Act stands for.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	When it came into effect five years ago, the Canadian 
Environmental Protection Act was aimed chiefly at regulating 
toxic products. It listed the products that were considered to be 
harmful to the environment, as well as the implementing 
regulations and standards designed to ensure that these products 
are used wisely.
<P>
	Another part of the act banned other toxic products that were 
not listed so that any product entering or made in Canada had to 
undergo a review to determine whether it should be included in 
the list of toxic products.
<P>
	The act emphasizes what we call toxic products. One of the 
deficiencies we will have to address is that the act does not 
contain any reference to the concept of sustainable 
development.
<P>
	The people who introduced the Canadian Environmental 
Protection Act in 1988 were certainly full of good intentions, 
but the concept of sustainable development was not yet in force. 
In reviewing the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, the 
Committee on Environment and Sustainable Development will 
surely give the principle of sustainable development all the 
importance it deserves.
<P>
	In explaining this to you, I will avoid explaining the whole 
Act, and I will conclude right away, because we have a little 
agreement with my friends opposite so that they too can 
conclude on this. That is why I would like to say that it is rather 
strange that under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 
the minister is supposed to make an annual report on how it was 
applied and on the state of the environment.
<P>
	This was probably the favourite argument trotted out by 
Liberal members of the environment committee when we talked 
about the environment commissioner. The Liberals then put 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5168"> 5168 </A></B>
<P>
forward their argument that an  environment commissioner 
would issue an annual report on the environment, which is 
already being done.
<P>
	But we will surely be able to discuss it when the Act is 
reviewed. I now want to particularly emphasize the importance 
of working non-stop for the environment. A report published a 
few days ago by Statistics Canada, on Human Activities and the 
Environment, 1994, which we had a chance to read this week, 
leaves me and, I am sure, other hon. members uncertain as to 
whether the money invested in the environment is well spent.
<P>
	It says that Canada is among the top seven producers of waste 
per capita. With nearly $2 billion spent on the environment by 
all federal departments, Canada should do better in this regard.
<P>
	In the review of the Act which the committee is about to 
undertake, we absolutely must consider the many international 
conventions signed by Canada. A reform is already required to 
avoid overlapping among the various agencies of the 
Department of the Environment. These overlaps often cost 
taxpayers too much.
<P>
	To conclude, as I said before, this review must absolutely not 
overlook the concept of sustainable development adopted by 
Canada since the Canadian Environmental Protection Act took 
effect. This law is the key to environmental protection and it is 
essential that it achieve the objectives set by Quebecers and 
Canadians.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure once again to speak to such an act. In fact it is one of the 
few times times since coming to the House of Commons that I 
have been able to congratulate the government for at least 
initiating a process that should do Canada so well. In my role I 
end up critiquing a lot of things that happen in the government 
and I do not have a lot of good things to say at times. But this 
time I do.
<P>
<B>(1250 ) </B>
<P>
	It is really time to amend the Canadian Environmental 
Protection Act. Many of the things I am going to speak about 
today will exemplify just what I am talking about.
<P>
	In looking yesterday at a report from StatsCanada about 
Canada's environment, which I want to quote from, I would 
emphasize what the changes to this act could do to help 
Canadians.
<P>
	Some of the comments that I get from the StatsCanada report 
are as follows: Canada is among the top five producers per 
capita in the world of industrial and household garbage, and 
among the highest in the production of hazardous waste. That 
comment speaks for itself. It is so very important that we deal 
with the issues at hand such as the Environmental Protection 
Act, and that is what this does in fact.
<P>
	In 1991 each Canadian generated about 360 kilograms of 
urban solid waste. That is one heck of a lot of solid waste. This is 
not just disposed of ad hoc, it has to be controlled, monitored, 
legislated.
<P>
	Ontario leads in the production of hazardous waste in Canada. 
Its total output ranks far above and ahead of some other 
industrialized nations such as Japan. I believe British Columbia 
is well up there as well, but Ontario with its large population 
looks at hazardous waste in a way that must be examined by the 
Environmental Protection Act.
<P>
	Canada, Australia and the United States generate between 360 
and 828 kilograms of urban solid waste per person each year. 
That is just astonishing. Much of the waste in Canada consists of 
plastics, packaging and newspapers, which must be collected 
and disposed of at municipal facilities. It is just not the 
Canadian act that is at stake here, there are other environmental 
agencies in different levels of government that must be 
examined as well. This emphasizes the importance of the 
committee discussing, relating and working with all these 
different layers of government when it examines this act.
<P>
	Canada is also a major producer of hazardous wastes, which 
are substances posing a risk to human health or the environment, 
and requiring special disposal techniques to make them 
harmless or less dangerous. In 1991 Canada generated about 
5,770 kilograms of hazardous waste for each million U.S. of 
gross domestic product. That again is just an astonishing 
number when you think about what kind of hazardous waste is 
coming from our country.
<P>
	I have a few other comments and then I will get on to my local 
area in Fraser Valley West. In 1991, about one-half of Canadian 
households had access to curbside or depot recycling services. 
This access varied greatly across the country; access to 
recycling was highest in Ontario, which it should be 
congratulated for. British Columbia ranked second in paper 
recycling which is available at 64 per cent of households.
<P>
	We are doing what we can but there is a lot more to do. I 
sincerely hope that when the environmental committee meets, 
as the minister said a little while ago, that she is going to give 
authority to this committee to investigate, look and discuss all 
of these issues and report back.
<P>
	It is important to remember that when this committee reports 
back to the House and to the minister that the minister take 
positive action. I could stand here and complain about the input 
that we have received across the country relative to the Young 
Offenders Act where we see an act that was designed and is 
weak, to say the least-I used the word flaccid. I sincerely hope 
when we get into this act and these changes that we do not cop 
out like we did in the Young Offenders Act.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5169"> 5169 </A></B>
<P>
	We have talked about what the act covered, the regulation of 
toxic substances, priority substances. My colleague who spoke 
earlier this morning discussed those in some detail and I do not 
plan to do that here. Substances new to Canada, export-import 
toxic substances and waste, regulation, cleaning agents, water 
conditioners, nutrients, international air pollution, ocean 
dumping; this is a very sweeping act indeed and it is incumbent 
upon us to give it very detailed study.
<P>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
	I want to take this opportunity to spend a few minutes and 
discuss a serious environmental problem in Fraser Valley West. 
Fraser Valley West is an area nestled against the mountains in 
British Columbia. It encompasses the communities of Langley, 
Aldergrove, and Matsqui.
<P>
	We are also the home of the Abbotsford International Air 
Show. I can remember in the early eighties standing on the 
tarmac in Abbotsford and looking up at Mount Baker which is 
just a pristine beautiful mountain, snow capped all year round. 
You could see it as clearly as any clear day on the ocean. Today 
there is this brown haze over our community that is not just 
disgusting but it is scary. It is scary for most people in our 
community. We are fearful for our young. We are fearful for 
those who have asthma, bronchitis and other respiratory 
diseases.
<P>
	It is nothing in my community to walk outside after two or 
three days of not cleaning off your patio furniture, for instance, 
and getting this black scourge that comes from the air. Washing 
homes is a common reality in the Fraser Valley. Air pollution is a 
serious concern there.
<P>
	If there is any one thing we will be watching from my 
perspective from the Fraser Valley it will be this air pollution 
that is a serious problem.
<P>
	The cause is by and large the air drifting from the ocean over 
Vancouver and the clouds in the air nestling up against the 
mountains, dropping back, and dropping the contents in our 
community. A lot of it is a result of vehicle emissions.
<P>
	Although the provincial government has done its best to look 
at vehicle emissions it still remains a significant problem. 
Therefore on behalf of the parents, the children and everybody 
else in our community I will be watchdogging this aspect of the 
environmental act very carefully.
<P>
	The other thing in our community that is very much a concern 
is water quality. We have many farms in our beautiful riding. 
The water quality has been proven in some cases and some areas 
to be quite deficient and people have been unable to drink it.
<P>
	What do we want to see out of this? Our vision for the future is 
inspired by the importance to our well-being of exploring, 
developing, renewing and conserving-
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. I would like to 
remind members that-
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I just want to remind members that the microphones on our 
desks are very sensitive and when people close by the person 
who has the floor speaks, it does sometimes get picked up on the 
microphones. It certainly blurs my capacity and possibly the 
capacity of other members to hear correctly and clearly.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I would ask those members seated near the Chair to remember 
that the microphones are very sensitive. Therefore, if they wish 
to carry on a conversation, perhaps they should-
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West)</B> Mr. Speaker, I am sure that 
was not intentional. These gentlemen were listening so intently 
to what I had to say which I think I just excited them a little bit.
<P>
	The Reform Party strongly supports ensuring that all 
Canadians and their descendants live in a clean and healthy 
environment. We are working on environmental policies that go 
much more in depth than what many may think and understand.
<P>
	The environment is a national concern. I am sure it is a 
concern of the parties in the House today.
<P>
<B>(1300 ) </B>
<P>
	We support the concept of a public education program of 
environmentally conscious purchasing. In fact we believe the 
federal government should take a leadership role in that 
environmentally conscious purchasing while encouraging the 
private sector to follow. That is absolutely necessary. So often 
today we talk, talk, talk and we legislate from a government 
perspective but we do not lead by example.
<P>
	We have to meet the needs of the present without 
compromising our ability to meet the needs of the future. In 
other words, we are looking for some action now and we cannot 
compromise the legislative things we are doing for the future. 
We need a long term perspective on this environmental program.
<P>
	We believe environmental considerations must carry equal 
weight with the economic, social and technical considerations 
of any project that is put into place. It is a major step forward if 
we can finally judge things not just on the economics and the 
social viability but on the environmental viability as well. All 
programs, whether government or private industry, should make 
that assessment.
<P>
	I have some other things to say, but before my time runs out I 
want to read something that I read in the House not too long ago 
in statements. I think it bears repeating. It was given to me by a 
young lady who very much believes in the improvement and the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5170"> 5170 </A></B>
<P>
quality of her  environment. I read it several times and it touched 
me so much that I think it should be repeated again.
<P>
	The words on this document are actually printed in a circle as 
though they were a small ball. It states: ``If the earth were only a 
few feet in diameter, floating a few feet above a field 
somewhere, people would come from everywhere to marvel at 
it. People would walk around it, marvelling at its big pools of 
water, its little pools of water flowing between the pools. People 
would marvel at the bumps on it, at the holes in it, and they 
would marvel at the very thin layer of gas surrounding it and the 
water suspended in the gas. People would marvel at all the 
creatures walking around the surface of the ball and at the 
creatures in the water. People would declare it as sacred because 
it was the only one and they would protect it so that it would not 
be hurt. The ball would be the greatest wonder known and people 
would come to pray to it, to be healed, to gain knowledge, to 
know beauty and to wonder how it could be. People would love it 
and defend it with their lives because they would somehow 
know that their lives, their own roundness, could be nothing 
without. If the earth were only a few feet in diameter''.
<P>
	I think that says it all about environmental legislation. What 
we have here is only one precious resource in the universal 
globe. It is somewhat like a ball. We would cherish it so much if 
it were that size, but today to some extent we do not cherish it 
enough.
<P>
	Finally there are several other items I want to talk about on 
where the Reform Party comes from in establishing some policy. 
We support the establishment of clear federal-provincial 
jurisdiction over environmental matters to reduce duplication, 
confusion and unnecessary regulation. We know this exists 
today. I sincerely hope the committee addresses that major 
important point.
<P>
	The Reform Party supports promoting partnerships with 
provincial governments, private industry, our educational 
institutions and the public to promote environmental protection. 
The Reform Party supports the development of environmental 
regulations through consultation with industry and the public.
<P>
	There is another item and that is ozone depletion. Much has 
been said about ozone depletion. In fact there are those who say 
it is not a problem at all. There are still no accurate 
measurements available today to determine whether or not 
ozone depletion is a fact or a myth. Conclusions that have been 
drawn about ozone depletion are based upon inaccurate 
computer models. Whether or not one believes the ozone layer is 
depleted, it is conclusive the items we use in society today do 
nothing but harm to our environment. Another issue is that of 
hazardous materials, whether they are considered commercially 
hazardous or industrially hazardous materials. It is another issue 
the committee should give great consideration to.
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	I would congratulate the government this one time for at least 
initiating something that will be very positive to communities 
throughout the country. I look forward to some action being 
taken that is positive, and if it is not many of us from the Reform 
Party in particular will be watchdogging it very closely.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Parliamentary Secretary to Deputy 
Prime Minister and Minister of the Environment):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, before I start my address to the House I want to thank 
my colleagues from Terrebonne and Fraser Valley for having 
graciously accepted to cut their time so that some of us on the 
Liberal side could speak at least 10 minutes.
<P>
	I notice that it is 1.05 p.m. Would I be able to ask for the 
consent of the House to extend the debate by just a few minutes 
after 1.30 p.m. so that the three of us could have 10 minutes 
each?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> In the spirit of the 
suggestion by the parliamentary secretary-I do not want to put 
words in anyone's mouth; correct me if I stray too far-my 
understanding would be that the parliamentary secretary, the 
member for Cumberland-Colchester and the member for 
Davenport would each speak for 10 minutes without questions 
or comments and we would conclude at 1.35 p.m. Is that agreed?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lincoln:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my 
colleagues.
<P>
	In the last 50 years since the end of the war, that is, in the latter 
part of this century, man has conquered space, broken the sound 
barrier, walked on the moon and plumbed the depths of the 
oceans. In a few brief seconds, we can send documents around 
the world. In our homes, our televisions give us a front row seat 
to global events.
<P>
	Truly remarkable, even extraordinary, technological 
advances have taken place during the second half of this century.
<P>
	And yet, according to an eminent scientist from Harvard 
University by the name of Edward Wilson, during this same time 
span, the earth's environment has suffered the most damage 
since the dinosaur age.
<P>
	Each year, 27 million acres of forests, an area twice the size of 
Nova Scotia, are devastated. Desertification swallows up 15 
million acres each year, an area slightly larger the Nova Scotia. 
Some three billion inhabitants of this planet do not have 
adequate sanitation facilities. More than one billion people do 
not have clean drinking water.

<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In 1930 the world was producing 7 million tonnes of 
chemicals; in 1950 just after the war, 7 million tonnes of 
chemicals; in 1970, 63 million tonnes of chemicals; and in 1985, 
250 million tonnes of chemicals. In this decade of the 1990s the 
world will be producing 500 million tonnes of chemicals. 
According to UNEP statistics this figure is likely to double 
every decade from now on.
<P>
	All of us enjoy the benefits of the use of chemicals. Our 
telephones, our appliances and our homes contain all sorts of 
products derived from chemicals. What we failed to do as a 
people, as a society, as all societies around the world, was to 
assess the impact of the use of chemicals before we started to 
produce them. The objective of CEPA, the Canadian 
Environmental Protection Act, is to control the management of 
toxic substances from their creation right through to 
elimination. The act is now five years old.
<P>
<B>(1310 ) </B>
<P>
	After five years we must address the following questions. Is 
the act as effective as it could be? What must members of the 
House and of the Standing Committee on the Environment and 
Sustainable Development recommend and do to eliminate the 11 
critical toxic substances flagged by the International Joint 
Commission as the most harmful and hazardous to human 
health? What must we do to deal with the hundreds and 
thousands of other toxic substances that bioaccumulate every 
day in our streams and ecosystems and that destroy our 
environment?
<P>
	I would suggest that we need a two tier approach. First we 
need to control and to eliminate gradually and as soon as 
possible existing toxic substances that have accumulated and 
continue to fester our lakes, our streams, our air and our land. At 
the same time as these exist, all over our countryside there lies 
toxic waste at the bottom of our streams and on our land. We 
have to prevent disasters from arising.
<P>
	Sadly enough I experienced a disaster in 
Saint-Basile-le-Grand a few years ago. For three weeks 
thousands of people had to be moved from their homes because 
of a PCB fire. We have to make sure that environmental 
catastrophes arising from toxic substances already produced are 
controlled and that disasters are avoided.
<P>
	We must make sure above all not to add to what is already in 
our ecosystems and in the atmosphere. We must use all our laws 
in an intelligent way through co-ordinated action. We must use 
impact assessment clauses intelligently enough to assess our 
programs, our policies, our activities and our advance planning 
to arrive together at prevention because prevention is the cure.
<P>
	We must use the act intelligently so that a national prevention 
policy takes place that ensures our industries use clean 
technologies and closed loop technologies in manufacturing 
processes to prevent toxic substances from reaching the 
atmosphere and the ecosystems.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Above all, we must have an integrated approach and muster 
all resources in the system. We must realize that we cannot do 
anything about the environment without talking about health, 
we cannot do anything about the economy without talking about 
the environment and we can do nothing at all without talking 
about education, since education forms the very basis of any 
action in our society. All the elements of a societal policy are 
tied together, and the environment, the functioning of the 
ecosystems, is at the root of all this. We must therefore have an 
ecosystemic approach and involve all those concerned, not only 
the federal, provincial and municipal levels of government but 
all stakeholders in our society, including industry, academics, 
environmental groups and the public.
<P>
	That is why I want to strongly support this initiative of the 
hon. ministers of health and the environment who are giving us, 
in the Standing Committee on Environment and Sustainable 
Development, considerable leeway to consult all Canadian 
stakeholders to upgrade this act which is the basis of our 
environmental policy regarding toxic substances.
<P>
	Together, we must work relentlessly to successfully eliminate 
toxic substances from our environment because the environment 
knows no political boundaries. This is a golden opportunity for 
all of us, from the various political parties, to co-operate to 
achieve a common goal.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The environment after all is a matter of equity.
<P>
<B>(1315 ) </B>
<P>
	In closing, I would like to quote the great British theologist, 
David Attenborough: ``As far as we are aware we are the only 
human beings in the black immensities of the universe. We are 
alone in space. And the fate of our planet and indeed of all of us 
is in our own hands''.
<P>
	I suggest that these hands must be caring hands, must be 
helping hands, must be hands that work very hard to build a 
society where equity and environmental justice are 
synonymous, where we build, we conserve, we preserve, we 
enhance nature, the ecosystems that provide life and living and 
not destroy them because the environment from start to finish is 
a matter of living and of quality of life.
<P>
	We owe it not only to ourselves but especially to generations 
to follow that we do a very, very positive, concerted job among 
all of us to reform CEPA in the most effective way possible.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport):</B> Mr. Speaker, the debate 
today starts from the premise that the health condition of air, 
water, soil and atmosphere as we all agree is an indispensable 
precondition for a sustained economy and a healthy nation. The 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5172"> 5172 </A></B>
<P>
question that arises is whether federal policies are helping in 
this respect and whether our values in society do so.
<P>
	Today's debate on this environmental protection act is 
intended to come to grips with this question and to lay the 
foundation for our work in the months ahead.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The hon. member for Frontenac referred to the blue planet 
which we share. He said that we are all in the same boat, and I 
fully agree with him. However, I wonder how he can, in the same 
breath, allude to federal intrusions and accuse Ottawa of 
interfering in provincial affairs. When it comes to the 
environment, we cannot stoop to politicking.
<P>
	I also want to say that I really appreciated the comments made 
by the hon. member for Terrebonne, as well as the feelings he 
expressed. I want to thank him for his co-operation and his ideas 
in committee.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I would also congratulate the member for Comox-Alberni 
for his helpful and constructive analysis of the legislation and 
for his concluding remarks which will certainly guide us in our 
deliberations in committee.
<P>
	As to the act, if we are to put our economic activities on the 
right track so as not to damage health, natural resources and our 
long term economic prospects, I suggest that we must make this 
legislation work for the benefit of Canadians.
<P>
	There are a number of points which must be noted with regard 
to this legislation. First, that it allow the ministers of the 
environment and health and welfare broad powers to gather 
detailed information about toxic substances from 
manufacturers, importers, transporters, distributors and users.
<P>
	Second, this legislation requires the compilation of a priority 
substance list of suspect toxins for which assessment priority 
must be given and assessment reports prepared with intent of 
control by national regulation.
<P>
	Third, if the government adds the names of toxic substances 
to the list then the government has broad regulatory powers to 
control all aspects including manufacturing, importing, 
exporting, packaging, labelling, transportation and storage. 
Persons who fail to give the required information or to comply 
with this regulation are liable to conviction of up to a $1 million 
fine or up to three years in prison and or both.
<P>
	Fourth, a limitation in the legislation is the broad ministerial 
discretion to name substances to the priority list and to 
recommend regulatory action. There are an estimated 30,000 to 
40,000 chemicals manufactured or imported into Canada. What 
constitutes a manageable number of chemicals for assessment 
priority is in itself a big challenge.
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
	Fifth, where a substance has been on the priority substance 
list for five years and not yet assessed, any person may request a 
board of review but the resultant report would be 
recommendatory only. Only 44 substances have been listed over 
the past six years under the appropriate schedule of this act and 
subject to very limited regulations.
<P>
	In March a number of organizations filed notices of 
objections because of 44 substances assessed under the priority 
substance list. Eleven were deemed neither toxic nor non-toxic 
because of the lack of data. These organizations argue that this 
unproven status violates section 14 of the act which states that 
within five years all substances on the priority substance list 
must be assessed and that the ministers have not fulfilled their 
statutory duty. These organizations can expect a board of review 
to investigate these 11 specific cases.
<P>
	Then there is the international joint commission concerning 
the Great Lakes. It recommends: one, the virtual elimination of 
persistent toxic substances from the Great Lakes, including the 
use of chlorine and chlorine containing compounds as chemical 
feed stocks in industry; two, the elimination of other chlorine 
uses or at least their reduction and, three, a shift in the onus of 
proof. Instead of government or the public having to prove that a 
product is dangerous, why not have the manufacturers prove that 
the product or substance is not harmful? In addition the 
commission is urging industry to re-evaluate both the material 
and processes it uses.
<P>
	At this stage the precautionary principle comes to mind as 
adopted in Rio 1992 in the declaration which reads: ``When 
there are threats of serious or irreversible damage, lack of full 
scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for postponing 
cost effective measures to prevent environmental degradation. 
The question is: Should this principle be included in the 
environment protection legislation?
<P>
	There are in this legislation a number of hurdles to speedy 
action. Before regulations for toxic substances are imposed by 
cabinet a federal-provincial advisory committee must have an 
opportunity to tender its advice. If the Minister of the 
Environment and a provincial government agree that the 
province and the federal government regulations for a toxic 
substance are equivalent and both governments have similar 
investigative provisions, cabinet may declare that the federal 
regulations are non-applicable in that province. The application 
of this concept of equivalency continues to be controversial.
<P>
	No wonder, I repeat no wonder, that as of today over the last 
six years not one such agreement has been entered into. A 
number of reasons account for the delay in implementation and 
provincial reticence among them to admit to any federal 
authority coupled with an overriding concern with a capacity for 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5173"> 5173 </A></B>
<P>
control through  the powers flowing from the constitutional 
concepts and precepts of peace, order and good government.
<P>
	Next is the international scene. Where there is a reason to 
believe that an air contaminant in Canada is creating pollution in 
another country or violating an international agreement, the 
Minister of the Environment can recommend prohibitions or 
controls by way of regulations. However except for federal 
works or undertakings the minister is not allowed to make a 
recommendation unless consultations occur with the province 
where pollution is occurring as to whether regulatory steps may 
be taken under provincial laws.
<P>
	The minister must endeavour to bring about provincial 
prevention or control if possible. Any federal regulation passed 
to control international air pollution may be made inapplicable 
to a province where equivalent provisions and investigative 
provisions and procedures are in place.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, this is quite a jungle to walk your way through, 
you will admit.
<P>
<B>(1325 ) </B>
<P>
	To conclude, this legislation of course is part of a broader 
picture. The parliamentary secretary has just given us a terrific 
framework against which we ought to approach this legislation. 
It is just one instrument in which we placed a lot of faith when 
producing it in 1987 and 1988.
<P>
	Today we have to ask ourselves some tough questions, 
whether it can work, whether the idea of equivalency can be 
made to work, whether in the experience gathered so far it is 
sufficient to enable us and the legislators of today to conclude 
that CEPA can be improved by way of amendments or whether 
we need to start thinking of an alternative piece of legislation 
that would achieve the goal of environmental sustainability but 
through different means.
<P>
	We are all aware of the significance of the assignment that the 
government has given to the committee. I am sure that the 
collective wisdom of all members of all parties in this House 
will help us to come back eventually with a report that will be for 
the benefit of Canadians from coast to coast.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dianne Brushett (Cumberland-Colchester):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, maintaining a healthy environment is as sacred a duty 
as maintaining the health of our bodies.
<P>
	The 18th century poets continually wrote about man and 
nature, the harmony that must exist between the two to find 
inner peace. As a girl growing up in Atlantic Canada in the 
1950s, we were very much aware, very directly involved in 
nature: today, the environment.
<P>
	As I so fondly remember, nearly every Sunday afternoon was 
spent cruising timber lands hand selecting each tree that was 
ready for harvest based on size, age, disease, overgrowth or 
whatever else of this evidence there was to the eyes and to the 
touch of the experienced lumbermen, the experienced logger.
<P>
	My father was a lumberman in rural New Brunswick. My 
brother carries on the lumbering business today as his sons will 
in decades to come when he is gone. This is the saga of 
sustainability, taking enough natural resource today to meet 
one's needs but leaving enough for the next generation to sustain 
its needs.
<P>
	Although it was never called sustainable development, that is 
exactly what it was and it was practised best by the aboriginal 
people, the First Nations people of this country. In rural Canada, 
many lumbermen, many fishermen and farmers did the same 
thing.
<P>
	The saying went among the older people: ``If you look after 
the earth, the earth will look after you''. Mother nature has paid 
the bills for Canadians, in particular Atlantic Canadians, for 
centuries and today we have fished the seas dry. We have cut the 
forests. It is mother earth that has sustained this Canadian 
lifestyle through need and then through a period of greed we lost 
sight of our real basic resource.
<P>
	Through greed and desire for economic growth we lost the 
balance, the harmony between man and his environment. Yet 
those committed environmentalists who have badgered the 
society for the last two decades are the ones whom we have to 
thank for creating the public awareness and sensitizing us to the 
urgency of maintaining the health of the environment. They 
have urged us to solve the problems through policies and 
regulations that achieve sustainable resources and sustainable 
environment. That is the implementation of conservation.
<P>
	In many instances, we do not agree completely with the purist 
environmentalists. However we must acknowledge that it was 
they who through their persistent determination that caused 
legislatures to focus on a sustainable economy within a 
sustainable environment.
<P>
	In the forest sector Canada is a leading example of applying 
the challenge of sustainable development, of balancing the 
environment and the economy. We must through this legislation 
today study the bill and take on the process of doing business 
and cost of maintaining the environment and the cost of the 
economy.
<P>
	Through our national focus, forest strategy and model forests 
and through research we will demonstrate international 
leadership.
<P>
<B>(1330 ) </B>
<P>
	I do not claim to speak on behalf of the Minister of Natural 
Resources, but I do believe it is her intent to let the world know 
that Canada's forestry industry is working in partnership with 
the environment and that we will be the leaders in sustainable 
forestry.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5174"> 5174 </A></B>
<P>
	We will work through new federal and provincial pulp and 
paper regulations. There are mills, such as the Scott paper mill 
in Nova Scotia, that discharge effluent into the waterways. Scott 
Maritime Limited has been one of those mills. It has been 
discharging effluent into Boat Harbour.
<P>
	Stakeholders meetings are scheduled for June. Fishermen, 
aboriginal representatives and environmental groups will meet 
to identify and resolve these problems.
<P>
	We will establish leadership through land use and through 
resource conflicts, through utilization of technology and 
research to manage these forests. Through increased demands 
and through the U.S. legislation of recycled products we are 
meeting the demands of using recycled paper. We will 
harmonize legislation to the federal government and the 
provinces in environmental acts.
<P>
	Above all we will deal with public concern over the impact of 
forest practices. For example, clear cutting is not always as bad 
as it may appear. Cosmetically it does not look good and we are 
appalled at what we see. But depending on the growth stand, the 
species diversity, the slope and other variables, it may be the 
best choice for the ecosystem involved and environmental 
protection.
<P>
	Forests are increasingly seen as a global resource. Given time, 
I personally believe we will have international legislation on 
global resources such as forestry to protect the global society. 
Canada can lead the global debate on sustainable development 
and global resources. Being the sensible nation we are, 
Canadians are well positioned to emerge as world leaders with 
environmental technology phasing in sustainable development.
<P>
	The Canadian forest sector employs more than 730,000. We 
are the world's largest exporter of forest products and the 
Canadian forest is a backdrop for more than a $26 billion 
tourism and recreation industry.
<P>
	Not only is the forest the key to Canada's economy and trade, 
it is vital to our health by cleaning the air, specifically by 
combating global warming. Did you know that use of fossil fuels 
to power cars, heat homes and produce electricity contributes to 
global warming? Few Canadians are aware that burning one 
gallon of gasoline, eight pounds, sucks 12 pounds of oxygen 
from the air. Then it releases 20 pounds of carbon dioxide back 
into the atmosphere and we depend on our green plants and our 
trees to absorb this carbon dioxide and fix it into the woody 
tissue.
<P>
	We appreciate the value of our trees. That is why today in 
Nova Scotia we still practise Arbour Day in the month of May 
having every elementary school child go out and plant a tree. 
Sustainability begins with one single person planting one single 
tree in one single community.
<P>
	We look at renewable resources such as tidal power in Nova 
Scotia. The Bay of Fundy has the highest tides in the world in 
which technology is present whereby we can take those tides and 
turn turbines as the water churns through and generate 
electricity. This is a natural phenomena. This puts out no 
pollution and it costs no money to harness the tide. There is a 
large capital cost and it will not be done in the immediate future 
as we have a surplus of energy at the present time. However I 
look forward in the future to bringing tidal power into the debate 
of this House as a renewable source of energy.
<P>
	This government has just introduced an infrastructure 
program of some $2 billion throughout the provinces. In my 
riding of Cumberland-Colchester we set up 10 projects 
through our municipalities. Each and every one of these projects 
was a pollution abatement project, or a sewage treatment plant, 
or fresh water.
<P>
	When we developed a clean water system in the town of 
Truro, we also made donations from our construction people and 
our municipal government to CUSO and Watercan to set up a 
fresh supply of water in a third world country. This was 
co-operation. This is sustainability for a global society.
<P>
	In closing, it is the policy of this government coming from the 
throne speech of January 18 to promote sustainable 
development as an integral component of decision making at all 
levels of society. Special emphasis will be placed on pollution 
prevention and the development of green infrastructures and 
industries and their associated high technology jobs.
<P>
	The Canadian environmental assessment act will be 
proclaimed. We must be vigilant caretakers of this earth to 
protect the future of our youth. It is their inheritance. The 
challenge belongs to all of us in this House and as legislators we 
must be held responsible for our future.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I would like to pick up on 
the theme of co-operation and thank all members this afternoon 
for the co-operation demonstrated to one another so that as 
many of you as possible could speak on this important debate in 
the limited time we had.
<P>
	I have barely a minute before I have to close the debate. I 
would simply like to ask: Is the House ready for the question?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Question.

	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley)</B> 
moved that Bill C-240, an act to amend the Corrections and 
Conditional Release Act and the Criminal Code, be read the 
second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	She said: Mr. Speaker, I want to impress upon this House why 
I believe this private member's Bill C-240 must be supported by 
all members of this House. I will start by relating one offender's 
history as outlined by Ian MacLeod of the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I>.
<P>
	On the night of June 17, 1988, 11-year old Christopher 
Stephenson was kidnapped from a Brampton shopping mall. His 
kidnapper was 45-year old Joseph Fredericks. Fredericks took 
Christopher to his nearby rented room, walking right by 
Christopher's house. Once in the room Fredericks proceeded to 
torture and rape Christopher over the next 24 hours. The next 
evening Fredericks took Christopher into a wooded area where 
he choked him into unconsciousness and then stabbed him in the 
neck. Christopher bled to death.
<P>
	As terrifying as this story is, it is made doubly worse by the 
fact that Fredericks was a known and convicted pedophile. Prior 
to his murdering Christopher Stephenson, many psychiatric and 
corrections officials believed it was only a matter of time before 
Fredericks struck again. Despite this belief, officials felt that 
there was little they could do and there was little that they could 
do, until he killed Christopher Stephenson. With the crime 
committed, Fredericks was quickly arrested, convicted of 
first-degree murder and received a life sentence without parole 
for 25 years.
<P>
	Today society can rest somewhat easier knowing that Joseph 
Fredericks will never pose a threat to any more children. 
However, this assurance is not due to any law or court decision 
or efforts by Correctional Services Canada or by the National 
Parole Board. No, the threat posed by Joseph Fredericks was 
removed in January 1992 by another inmate at Kingston 
Penitentiary who stabbed Fredericks to death.
<P>
	The death of Christopher Stephenson could have ended there 
like so many unfortunate murders of other children. But due to 
pressure by Christopher's parents, Jim and Anna Stephenson, a 
coroner's inquest was called to examine how Fredericks could 
have been walking the streets of their community and in a 
position to kidnap their son. For five months in 1992 the inquest 
heard testimony about Joseph Roger Fredericks.
<P>
<B>(1340) </B>
<P>
	Fredericks' background is not a pretty one. Born in Ottawa in 
1943 Fredericks was handed to the Children's Aid Society nine 
months after his birth. For the next nine years he bounced from 
one Ottawa area foster home to another. By the summer of 1953 
after a brief stint at St. Joseph's Training School for Boys the 
10-year old Fredericks was a constant runaway and in trouble 
with the police.
<P>
	By the time he was 11, Fredericks had committed his first 
sexual assault. Between 1954 and 1959 Fredericks committed 
several sexual misdemeanours with younger children at the 
Ontario hospital school in Smiths Falls. In addition to the sexual 
misdemeanours, Fredericks also escaped and sexually assaulted 
an 11-year old girl. On another occasion he threatened a 9-year 
old boy at gunpoint.
<P>
	In April 1959 Fredericks was shipped to the maximum 
security Oak Ridge unit at the Penetanguishene mental health 
centre after being diagnosed as a psychopathic homosexual 
pedophile. He would spend most of the next 24 years there.
<P>
	When he turned 20 Fredericks was transferred to a minimum 
security facility, but he escaped within a month. While on the 
loose he sexually assaulted a 6-year old girl at knifepoint and 
committed buggery on a 15-year old at gunpoint. Since he was 
already incarcerated under the Mental Health Act Fredericks 
was not criminally charged for these acts.
<P>
	After being transferred back to the maximum security facility 
at Oak Ridge he told a doctor he wished he had killed that little 
girl. For the next 16 years Fredericks remained at Oak Ridge 
undergoing drug therapy. For 18 months beginning in late 1979 
he received heavy doses of a tranquillizer to control his sex 
drive. However doctors believe he was taking the drug only to 
appear well enough to be transferred to a lower security 
institution.
<P>
	In September 1980 Fredericks was transferred to a more open 
psychiatric hospital in St. Thomas. While there he sexually 
assaulted a mentally handicapped childlike female patient. This 
attack got Fredericks sent back to Oak Ridge. Diagnosed as a 
sociopath and a violent homosexual pedophile Fredericks was 
certified as an involuntary patient under Ontario's Mental 
Health Act. However, since psychopathy is not considered a 
mental disorder it became more and more difficult to keep him 
certified.
<P>
	There were only two ways that Fredericks could have been 
confined indefinitely: by being unfit to stand trial, or found not 
guilty by reason of insanity. For that he could have been kept 
indefinitely at a psychiatric hospital, or he could have been 
declared to have been a dangerous offender under the Criminal 
Code. Either way Fredericks would first have to commit another 
criminal offence.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5176"> 5176 </A></B>
<P>
	Well, it did not take him long. Within days of leaving the Oak 
Ridge facility in 1983, Fredericks sexually assaulted a 10-year 
old boy and a 15-year old girl at knifepoint. Despite all his 
previous sexual assaults he had no official criminal record. 
Therefore, he only received a 22-month sentence and was sent 
to a minimum security provincial jail in Brampton. Within a 
year he was sent to the maximum security Millbrook 
Correctional Centre near Peterborough because of behavioural 
problems.
<P>
	In August 1984 Fredericks was granted day parole and sent to 
an Ottawa halfway house. For the first time in 30 years he was 
living outside an institution. Even though a condition of his 
parole was to receive treatment for pedophilia at the Royal 
Ottawa Hospital arrangements were never made at that hospital. 
Despite warnings that Fredericks would continue attacking 
children, parole officers were never told of the dangers he 
presented.
<P>
	Only 10 days after arriving in Ottawa Fredericks came across 
an 11-year old boy and sodomized him. After his arrest the 
crown attorney wanted to have Fredericks declared a dangerous 
offender. He certainly had the evidence. Dr. John Bradford from 
the Royal Ottawa Hospital and one of the country's leading 
experts on sexual offenders called Fredericks the worst and most 
sadistic and most impulsive pedophile he had seen. But the 
sexual assault victim's parents did not want their son to go 
through the ordeal of testifying, so the crown accepted a plea 
bargain from Fredericks lawyer for a 5-year sentence. The 
dangerous offender application was abandoned. Three years into 
a sentence Fredericks was transferred to a halfway house in 
Toronto. Once again, none of the sexual assaults that occurred 
while he was a psychiatric patient appeared on his criminal 
record.
<P>
<B>(1345) </B>
<P>
	Part of Fredericks' release plan included his participation in a 
hospital sex therapy program, the taking of a sex drive 
suppressant drug and an order to stay away from children. His 
parole officer was unaware that Fredericks was trying to coach a 
children's sports team at a nearby security centre. However 
before anything could happen another parolee at a different 
halfway house raped and murdered a Toronto woman.
<P>
	In response to public outrage the federal Solicitor General 
ordered that all violent and sexual offenders on parole in 
Toronto halfway houses were to be removed. Three weeks later 
Fredericks was released again, this time on mandatory 
supervision and he chose to move to the Brampton area.
<P>
	Prior to his release all four members of the case management 
team believed there was a high probability that Fredericks 
would commit another crime. Three months later Fredericks 
picked up a knife, headed for the local mall and spotted 
Christopher Stephenson.
<P>
	In January 1993 the coroner's jury made 71 recommendations 
to help prevent such tragic deaths as Christopher's. Chief among 
the recommendations was a call for a new law to keep violent 
predators behind bars  after their prison terms expired if they 
still pose a public risk. Then Solicitor General Doug Lewis 
announced that he hoped to have such a law in Canada by the end 
of June 1993. The legislation was never introduced by the 
Conservative government as its leadership convention disrupted 
the legislative agenda.
<P>
	One year later the need for this legislation has not decreased. 
The recent release of Larry Fisher from a British Columbia 
prison is another example of the need for such legislation. Here 
we have an individual who was sentenced to a total of 23 years 
for raping seven women.
<P>
	While incarcerated he refused to participate in any treatment 
programs. The National Parole Board considered him to be such 
a threat to society that they denied him statutory release.
<P>
	Larry Fisher served every single day of his 23-year sentence. 
Two weeks ago his sentence was over. Larry Fisher walked out 
of a prison a free man, a completely free man. He is not under 
any form of community supervision. He does not report to a 
parole officer or the police. He does not have to inform anyone 
where he is living or travelling to.
<P>
	He is creating a lot of frightened people. This past weekend he 
was spotted in Dawson Creek, British Columbia, and very 
quickly citizens' groups sprang up to get him out of their town. 
Four thousand homemade posters with Fisher's picture, 
criminal record and a description of his vehicle were displayed 
at grocery stores, gas stations, convenience stores and 
restaurants. Schools were asked to make the students aware of 
Fisher's presence. On Sunday Fisher was on his way out of town 
apparently on his way to Edmonton.
<P>
	These are just two examples of individuals who should have 
been designated dangerous offenders, but since it was not done 
at the time of the original conviction it could not be done later. 
In one instance they had to wait for Fredericks to commit 
another crime and it was a fatal one. With Fisher only time will 
tell.
<P>
	Some may ask how widespread will this legislation be. Not 
very. This legislation is designed only for the most dangerous 
inmates in our system. There are currently about 13,000 federal 
inmates incarcerated in Canada and another 9,500 on some form 
of community release programs.
<P>
	According to the correctional service only 111 are classified 
as dangerous offenders. In addition there are currently 115 
offenders who are being detained; that is, they have been denied 
statutory release. It is these individuals who this legislation is 
targeting, individuals who are not designated as dangerous 
offenders at the time of their original sentence, but their 
behaviour subsequent to incarceration coupled with their 
criminal record has led the Correctional Service Canada and the 
National Parole Board to deem them too dangerous to be 
released into society.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5177"> 5177 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1350 ) </B>
<P>
	In essence, this legislation is designed for only the most 
dangerous 1 per cent of the current federal inmate population. 
What will this legislation do with these individuals? It gives us 
an opportunity to prevent further tragedies. It gives us the 
ability to obtain post sentence detention orders.
<P>
	The process uses every conceivable check and balance. First, 
as an offender nears the end of his sentence, the correctional 
service shall refer the case of an individual it deems to be 
dangerous to the National Parole Board.
<P>
	Second, after reviewing the case and if in agreement with the 
referral from the correctional service, the National Parole Board 
may in turn refer the case to the attorney general of the province 
in which the offender was most recently sentenced for a serious 
personal injury offence. This referral cannot take place more 
than one year prior to the expiration of the offender's sentence.
<P>
	Third, if the attorney general is in agreement, then a 
dangerous offender application can be made. The requirements 
for an application will be the same as they are for current 
dangerous offender legislation under section 753 of the 
Criminal Code.
<P>
	Fourth, on hearing the application the court may find an 
offender to be a dangerous offender.
<P>
	Under this legislation before an individual is deemed to be a 
dangerous offender, one needs the unanimous agreement of the 
Correctional Service Canada, the National Parole Board, the 
provincial attorney general and the court. I suggest that if all 
these four bodies together come to the conclusion that an 
offender is a dangerous offender the individual should be 
declared one.
<P>
	Members may be asking what happens to an offender once he 
has been labelled a dangerous offender. The court may make one 
of the following orders; first, that the offender be detained in a 
penitentiary for an indeterminate period, second, that at the 
expiration of the offender's current sentence, he may be 
detained for a determinant period and then may subsequently be 
released under community supervision for a period of not more 
than 10 years, subject to any conditions that the court may 
prescribe.
<P>
	Third, he may be released under community supervision for a 
period of 10 years and subject to any conditions that the court 
may prescribe. Thus there is a great deal of judicial discretion on 
how the offender is dealt with. What we would avoid happening 
is what occurred in the Fisher case where he was kept until the 
end of his sentence and then released with absolutely no 
supervision.
<P>
	There is one other major aspect to this bill. For an individual 
to be declared a dangerous offender today, the crown must show 
that the offender is likely to commit an offence causing the death 
or serious bodily harm to  another person. Bill C-240 would 
remove this necessity in those cases that involve sexual offences 
against children.
<P>
	The reason for this change is twofold. First, the actual harm to 
child victims of sexual assault may not be apparent for several 
years and second, given a child's limited ability to clearly 
communicate the effects of a sexual crime, serious harm is very 
difficult to detect.
<P>
	I have outlined the problem and in true Reform fashion I have 
provided the House with an alternative. I believe this bill is fair 
and balanced. It cannot be used in a haphazard manner or on a 
whim. While some may argue that it infringes on the offender's 
charter of rights, I respond that this bill does not create new 
dangerous offender legislation. It only changes the timing when 
it can be applied.
<P>
	The change as it applies to pedophiles where there is no longer 
a need to prove serious harm I believe is long overdue and is a 
significant step in protecting our children. For those who argue 
that this is just another Reform Party attempt to lock them up 
and throw away the key I remind them that the indeterminate 
sentence is only one of three options. Quite frankly, there are 
people in our prisons who deserve to have the key thrown away 
on them. But most important, I believe that this bill adds to the 
level of protection of society. It corrects what has been a flaw in 
the system and unfortunately it has been a fatal flaw.
<P>
<B>(1355) </B>
<P>
	I believe that if this bill can save even one life then it is worth 
it.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Serré (Timiskaming-French River):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to say first of all that although I support the 
objectives of Bill C-240, I strongly object to its approach, since 
it has a number of deficiencies and is a contradiction of the 
terms of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
<P>
	The present government is committed to making public safety 
one of its priorities, and an important part of this commitment 
consists in taking steps to respond to the concerns raised by high 
risk violent offenders.
<P>
	The bill would allow post-sentence detention of such 
criminals, based on current provisions in the Criminal Code for 
dangerous offenders serving the last year of their sentence.
<P>
	Some of you may recall that the provisions of Bill C-240 on 
post-sentence detention were among the proposals tabled by the 
previous government in this House in May 1993. The proposals 
were given thorough consideration by a wide range of groups 
and individuals and were carefully examined by a 
federal-provincial-territorial task force, created specifically to 
find ways 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5178"> 5178 </A></B>
<P>
to improve the protection of the public against high-risk violent 
offenders.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Consultations were conducted in August and September 1993 
and ministry officials met with more than 200 groups in 44 
separate consultative sessions. Included in those sessions were 
representatives of the judiciary, defence counsel, crown 
prosecutors, provincial and territorial corrections and justice 
officials, police, victims, voluntary agencies, municipal 
agencies, women's groups, aboriginal groups, inmate 
committees, mental health professionals and academics.
<P>
	While there was a general consensus on the need to do 
something about a small group of dangerous offenders, there 
was no agreement that the post-sentence proposal would right 
some things. There was significant support for an examination 
of the current dangerous offender provisions, strengthening 
their applicability and ensuring appropriate use of these 
provisions at the time of sentencing.
<P>
	The vast majority of those consulted, including members of 
the task force on high risk violent offenders, had serious 
concerns about the charter implications and potential 
ineffectiveness of the post-sentence detention proposals.
<P>
	The main concern with these proposals, Mr. Speaker, can be 
summarized. The proposals permit what amounts to a 
re-sentencing of someone who has already served his or her 
sentence, contrary to section 11(8) of the Canadian Charter of 
Rights and Freedoms. That section states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If finally acquitted of the offence, not to be tried for it again, and if finally 
found guilty and punished for the offence not to be tried or punished for it again.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	There is concern that a prediction of future dangerousness 
would result in a violation of a person's charter rights.
<P>
	There remains doubt that the proposed scheme would capture 
the target group of federal offenders who are identified as posing 
a significant risk upon release.
<P>
	The requirement for new evidence of dangerousness is 
thought likely to have a negative impact on treatment 
participation. Since offenders' disclosures to treatment 
professionals could be used to substantiate a dangerous offender 
application under the post-detention sentence scheme, 
offenders may be reluctant to participate in treatment programs.
<P>
	The expense of such proceedings is of concern to the 
provinces, particularly because of the requirement to link the 
application to the original offence, which may have occurred 
many years ago.
<P>
	As you can see, Mr. Speaker, the concept of post-sentence 
detention has raised numerous concerns. The government 
recognizes that controlling high risk violent offenders is a 
complex problem. This requires us to look not for a single 
solution that will address all cases but to take a broader view of 
all aspects of the criminal justice process and the links between 
the criminal justice and mental health systems.
<P>
<B>(1400) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, as you know, the federal government and the 
provinces share responsibility for Canada's criminal justice 
system, while mental health comes under provincial 
jurisdiction. Since the problems caused by high-risk violent 
offenders are a shared responsibility, it was decided to establish 
the federal-provincial-territorial task force on high-risk 
violent offenders, which I mentioned earlier.
<P>
	The task force is looking into a range of legal solutions and 
policies for treating, managing and supervising high-risk 
violent offenders. We admit there is no single solution to the 
complex and difficult problem of violent repeat offenders and 
that there must be co-operation between the federal government 
and the provinces, especially between our criminal justice and 
mental health systems. That is why the task force has looked into 
a number of measures that would protect the public more 
adequately against repeat offenders who commit acts of 
violence and sexual assault.
<P>
	I agree with the task force that even if the proposed legislation 
were found to be constitutional, something I do not expect 
because of the problems raised by dual punishment and other 
measures in terms of the charter, these proposals create a 
problem that is even worse: they would apply to a relatively 
limited number of the repeat offenders in question. In order to 
treat high risk violent offenders as effectively as possible, we 
must reinforce our present system for treating dangerous 
offenders.
<P>
	It is a fact that the provinces are increasingly using the 
provisions of the Criminal Code concerning dangerous 
offenders, hence the increase in indeterminate sentencing. The 
provisions regarding dangerous offenders allow a judge to 
sentence, for an indeterminate period, an offender believed to be 
likely to commit other violent offences. At a March meeting of 
federal-provincial justice ministers, it was agreed to continue to 
make every effort so that such requests be presented whenever 
appropriate.
<P>
	Moreover, the provinces are in the process of establishing a 
system to identify high risk violent offenders and monitor them. 
This information will be made available to crown prosecutors, 
even if offenders move to another province; this will ensure that 
repeat offenders do not fall through the cracks and that they will 
be prosecuted as dangerous offenders.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5179"> 5179 </A></B>
<P>
	We believe that, instead of detaining offenders at the end of 
their sentence, as proposed in this bill, when an offender has 
finished serving a sentence of determinate imprisonment and is 
believed to be still dangerous when released, he might be 
committed under provincial mental health legislation. Even if 
the situation varies widely between provinces, they all permit 
mandatory confinement of persons considered a threat to 
themselves or others, because of mental illness.
<P>
	The mental health of prisoners who are detained until the end 
of their sentence because the National Parole Board believes 
that they are too dangerous to be released, is carefully assessed 
to determine whether they should be committed to a psychiatric 
institution. If they meet the criteria, they are transferred to a 
provincial psychiatric hospital.
<P>
[English] 
<P>
	The federal-provincial task force on high risk violent 
offenders is looking to see if changes to provincial mental health 
legislation could be recommended to improve the system's 
ability to commit and hold mentally disordered dangerous 
people.
<P>
	In addition it is studying the extent to which other factors such 
as the lack of appropriate secure facilities play a role in 
preventing mentally disordered dangerous people from being 
civilly committed. I would like to mention another initiative in 
this area. A federal-provincial joint action committee on 
corrections and mental health is reviewing operational issues 
related to the management of mentally disordered and sex 
offenders.
<P>
<B>(1405) </B>
<P>
	The mandate of the action committee is to examine 
alternative methods to manage, treat, and supervise offenders 
with a disorder be it mental, sexual or behavioural. The aim is to 
find solutions that bridge the correctional and mental health 
fields and aid in the co-ordination of effort.
<P>
	In conclusion, the post sentence detention provision of Bill 
C-240 does not present a realistic option for our federal 
structure. Detaining offenders in penitentiaries after they have 
served their court imposed sentences raises serious charter 
concerns. Solutions to this problem lie with the link between the 
criminal justice and mental health systems.
<P>
	In Canada, mental health legislation is the constitutional 
responsibility of the provinces and therefore the federal 
government cannot act alone in this area. That is why the 
government is committed to working closely with the provinces 
to find real solutions. In order to bring about meaningful, 
effective reform in protecting the public from the threat of high 
risk violent offenders, the federal and provincial governments 
are working together to advance solutions that tackle the 
problem in a comprehensive fashion.
<P>
	This government is committed to the work currently under 
way which brings the federal and provincial governments and 
the criminal justice and mental health systems together to 
ensure the best protection for all Canadians.

	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to talk to this bill presented by my 
colleague, the member for Surrey-White Rock-South 
Langley. First, I listened carefully to her presentation and I 
would like to briefly comment on it.
<P>
	She spent a good three quarters of her time describing fully, 
some details being more lurid than others, events which 
occurred during the last few years in Canada, and she 
particularly brought back to mind the tragic case of the young 
Stephenson boy; finally, during five minutes, at the very end of 
her speech, she talked about her bill.
<P>
	I mention this because I personally wonder what kind of 
consequences might result from this constant rehashing, day 
after day, of such sordid cases which, in my view, give rise to 
heated debates and appeal to our most primal instincts. I respect 
my colleague's opinion of course, but I wonder. As a member of 
Parliament, I think it is quite proper to question our method of 
debating such important subjects which have an impact on the 
daily life of our fellow Canadians.
<P>
	I want to stress that the Official Opposition believes that we 
must send a clear message to all Canadians saying that it is 
absolutely necessary for the government and Parliament to 
ensure the security of our children and our families and, of 
course, the protection of society as a whole. All necessary 
measures must be taken in order to reach that goal.
<P>
	I also want to stress that the Official Opposition certainly 
does not want to leave itself open to criticism that its attitude 
towards cases like the one mentioned by our colleague from the 
Reform Party is too lenient.
<P>
<B>(1410) </B>
<P>
	No parliamentarian in this House would ever endorse such 
actions. The bill before us is identical to a bill introduced last 
year by the solicitor general of the previous government, Doug 
Lewis, the first objective of which was to permit the revision of 
the sentence, while it was being served, imposed on an 
individual found guilty of a violent crime, to allow for an 
indeterminate period of imprisonment.
<P>
	Such a provision already exists in our Criminal Code, as 
mentioned by the hon. member for Témiscamingue a short while 
ago. There is, in the Criminal Code, a provision that allows the 
court to find an offender to be a dangerous offender and 
thereupon impose a sentence of imprisonment for an indetermi-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5180"> 5180 </A></B>
<P>
nate period, which means until we are convinced that the person 
is no longer a threat to society.
<P>
	The difference is that the individual must be found to be a 
dangerous offender at the time of sentencing, whereas the bill 
before us would permit that at any time, even a few days before 
the end of the sentence, so that the individual could stay in jail 
all his life.
<P>
	It seems to me that such a provision is contrary to 
fundamental principles of Canadian law, in particular the one 
according to which you cannot be tried twice for the same 
offence. In other words, case heard case tried, meaning that once 
you have been brought before the court for a given offence, 
found guilty and sentenced, you cannot be charged again with 
the same offence.
<P>
	To act in accordance with this bill would depart from this 
principle. Moreover, clause 26 of the bill provides, and I quote: 
``The evidence relied on by the court in making a finding under 
subsection (2) must include evidence that could not reasonably 
have been presented to the court that sentenced the offender for 
the serious personal injury offence''.
<P>
	In my view, this provision departs from another principle, 
namely that of reasonable doubt, which is fundamental, 
especially in criminal law. In every court case, to be on the safe 
side, the judge reminds the jury that a decision must be rendered 
based on the fact that, if there is any doubt left in their minds, 
they must let the accused go free.
<P>
	What this means is that, if years down the road it turns out that 
some evidence had not been presented to the court because the 
Crown had not done its job or had botched it, it would be 
possible to reopen the case to have the sentence extended and the 
offender retried on the same charges.
<P>
	The Parole Board would also be given powers of investigation 
in that respect. The bill's sponsor would want the Parole Board 
not only to be permitted but required to investigate to find out if, 
in fact, there are further developments that warrant reopening 
the case.
<P>
<B>(1415) </B>
<P>
	We already know the huge workload of the parole board. I 
think that adding this mandate would further hinder or impede 
the work of the parole board and, besides, the parole board is not 
an investigating body. Its mandate is to rehabilitate people, 
criminals who for one reason or another are behind bars.
<P>
	I think that this provision significantly changes the Parole 
Board's responsibilities.
<P>
	I conclude by repeating-and this is the crux of my 
remarks-that we must question the approach we are now 
taking. It is not that the goal in itself is unacceptable or 
unworthy of our support. We fully agree that criminals who 
commit such heinous crimes should remain behind bars as long 
as possible or until society is assured that these people will not 
commit such crimes again. But I think that the current laws can 
now provide such assurances and properly protect society.
<P>
	One final comment, Mr. Speaker, if you allow me. Such an 
approach must be part of a total strategy and not just an attempt 
to give the impression that we parliamentarians or members of 
this House want to act out of vengeance. It must be part of an 
overall strategy. That is what the former Solicitor General 
wanted to do when he put forward a series of measures. During 
these debates, I would like us to refer to this total strategy as 
well.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
privileged and proud to be asked to speak to private member's 
Bill C-240 put forth by my colleague from Surrey-White 
Rock-South Langley.
<P>
	My colleague previously spoke briefly about stirring up 
passions and primal instincts when talking about such a subject. 
I guess my colleague would do well to live in a community like 
mine, surrounded by seven prisons and correctional institutes. 
He would know what passions would be in a community that has 
many offenders wandering the streets on day parole.
<P>
	My colleague has given a picture of what ails the criminal 
justice system specifically in the area of detaining dangerous 
offenders. I would like to tell a story that illustrates just how bad 
things have become. Bureaucratic mismanagement in itself is 
not much of a story. Unfortunately people are killed in these 
stories, innocent people who leave behind families filled with 
rage and sorrow. Let me be absolutely clear that although these 
tales read like detective novels, the real reason we in the Reform 
Party are focusing on them is the human suffering caused by the 
criminal justice system that we feel has fallen apart. I was quite 
incensed today to see the justice minister stand in question 
period and suggest that the system is working well. It is not 
working well.
<P>
	My first story is this one. In a basement apartment in Seattle at 
the end of a hallway, out of sight of windows and doorways, rests 
a chair. At the base of the chair is a pool of blood three inches in 
diameter. The trail leads upward to a stab wound in the chest of a 
57-year old man slumped slightly to the right and forward. A 
large band of masking tape covers his mouth and the rope used to 
strangle him dangles loosely around his neck.
<P>
<B>(1420 ) </B>
<P>
	Although this may sound like fiction it is not. This is fact. It is 
a description taken directly from the police report and 
documents I have received from prosecuting attorney Norm 
Maleng of King County, Washington.
<P>
	Why Washington? The two men charged with the first degree 
murder of Elijio Cantu on June 5 were escapees from a minimum 
security facility in the Fraser Valley where my home is. The 
corrections system classified these men as low risk offenders yet 
one of them had been convicted of attempted murder of a police 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5181"> 5181 </A></B>
<P>
officer and had killed another inmate. The story we get from the 
government is that these escapes are rare and not statistically 
significant. I would challenge any member of the government to 
tell that to the family of the victim.
<P>
	I have another story that comes from a woman in the same 
town the prison is in. Two young men walk into a pizza place in 
Abbotsford, British Columbia, where I live. One of them is 
armed with a sawed off shotgun. No one is shot during the 
robbery but the restaurant employee who had to stare down the 
business end of a sawed off shotgun testified he will never be the 
same. However the story does not end there.
<P>
	Rosalie Turcotte's son was 19 years old when he was savagely 
beaten to death with a baseball bat and buried in a shallow grave 
near Mill Pond in Mission, British Columbia, just a few miles 
from my house. The young man who was recently convicted of 
the murder is the one who wielded the sawed off shotgun in the 
pizza place robbery. He was trying to silence his accomplice, 
Ken Turcotte, who had told his friends he wanted to confess to 
his mother about the robbery.
<P>
	Zachary Finley who killed Rosalie Turcotte's son, Ken, will 
be eligible to apply for temporary absences immediately. He 
will be eligible to apply for day parole three full years before the 
date set by the judge for parole.
<P>
	Zachary Finley killed Rosalie Turcotte's son, Ken, and was 
convicted of second degree murder which carries a maximum 
sentence of life with parole eligibility set at a minimum of 10 
years. When the crown's request to increase that to 15 years was 
denied, a member of the victim's family became distraught. The 
convicted criminal who committed the brutal act laughed.
<P>
	What does Rosalie Turcotte have to say about our criminal 
justice system after her ordeal? Let me quote, and I have talked 
to Rosalie a number of times: ``This is supposed to be our 
system, paid for and accountable to us. How has it eroded to 
such a sorry state of affairs? The only ones being served by the 
system as it stands now are the offenders and their lawyers who 
are laughing all the way to the bank''.
<P>
	I find this funny. No, let me rephrase that. I find it ironic. It is 
really the criminals who find it funny. Last week I was asked to 
debate the head of the John Howard Society over the rights of 
prisoners to receive old age security, GST rebates, Canada 
pension plan and other payments. During that interview he was 
adamant, and I quote: ``The prisoners are not laughing at the 
system''. I said it then and, just in case the John Howard Society 
or any other prisoners rights groups are listening, I will say it 
again. Listen closely. They are laughing at us.
<P>
	There is another story that my colleague spoke about 
previously but I want to indicate some more details that I have 
been given from certain sources. The House may have heard a 
bit about the saga of Larry Fisher from my colleague and in the 
newspapers. He has been released recently after serving his full 
sentence. Mr. Fisher who has reportedly been sighted in the 
riding of another one of my colleagues this week has a history 
familiar to anyone not living in a cave.
<P>
	Mr. Fisher was released from his latest prison term two weeks 
ago. It was a 10-year sentence for the rape, stabbing and 
attempted strangulation of a Saskatchewan woman. Mr. Fisher 
has been behind bars for 23 years except for a brief taste of 
freedom on 1980 when he was granted escorted parole. He 
grabbed a 56-year old woman, dragged her into an abandoned 
house, raped her, stabbed her three times, slit her throat, tried to 
suffocate her and left her for dead. He was convicted of six 
previous rapes.
<P>
<B>(1425 ) </B>
<P>
	Let me quote from yet another significant document I have 
received on the parole board's official reasons for denying Mr. 
Fisher's parole on April 1, 1993. Mr. Speaker, note the date, 
April 1, 1993, April Fool's Day, and ask yourself, when I am 
finished with the story who is fooling whom.
<P>
	At the time the board said of Mr. Fisher: ``There are no 
significant changes to demonstrate that your release can be 
managed in the community on any form of conditional release or 
that your likelihood of reoffending and causing serious harm has 
been lessened in any way. Therefore detention is confirmed''.
<P>
	Let us jump ahead in the story to February 1994, not too long 
after that, the next time the board ruled on his case: ``There is no 
new information on file to suggest that your risk of reoffending 
in a violent manner has been mitigated or reduced since your last 
review and the detention order is confirmed''.
<P>
	Just a few weeks later this man was released into the 
community because his sentence had expired. Let us think about 
this for a moment. After issuing two clear statements about the 
dangers this man would pose to society if released, the system is 
forced to release him anyway.
<P>
	Our question is simple: Why? Why can the system not take its 
own advice and keep high risk offenders like this where they 
belong, behind bars? The criminals are laughing at the 
government whose members day after day stand in the House to 
tell a story. Their story is that the system works, everything is 
okay, and the Reform Party is playing politics. Our story is that 
the system is laughable. It is beneath contempt.
<P>
	More important, I want to stress before closing that our story 
is not really our story. It is the story of Rosalie Turcotte who lost 
her son. It is the story of a man in Seattle who lost his life. It is 
<P>

<B><A NAME="5182"> 5182 </A></B>
<P>
the story of Larry Fisher and all the people living in fear in the 
communities where he  is sighted. Increasingly it is becoming 
the story of a government that has not only lost touch with 
reality but has lost the courage to act responsibly and to make 
the necessary corrections.
<P>
	My colleague's bill is an excellent one. We need the courage 
to stand up to the naysayers, those who will do nothing, and send 
a clear message to the justice system that these dangerous 
offenders must not and cannot be allowed back on the streets 
until they have proven they are ready.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robert Bertrand (Pontiac-Gatineau-Labelle):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am glad that the bill tabled by the hon. member gives 
us an opportunity to address important issues central to the 
efforts to make Canadians safer.
<P>
	We clearly need effective measures to reduce the crime rate, 
especially violent crime. The government is moving in that 
direction, as its recent legislative initiatives demonstrate. Its 
actions in other areas are just as important.
<P>
	Today I would like to go over the progress the government has 
been making on the important issues of risk assessment and the 
treatment of offenders to better protect people in the long term.
<P>
	But first I would like to consider for a few moments the 
situation now prevailing in federal penitentiaries, particularly 
the effectiveness of imprisonment as punishment. As we all 
know, Canada has one of the highest incarceration rates in the 
world, around 130 per 100,000 people on average. The number 
of offenders under federal responsibility has risen rapidly in the 
last five years. The annual increase jumped from 1.6 per cent in 
1989-90 to 4 per cent in 1993-94. A 5.1 per cent increase is 
forecast for next year. Keep in mind that this increase is 
occurring at a time when federal correctional services face 
substantial budget cuts.
<P>
	In this era of fiscal restraint, we must remember that 
incarceration is extremely expensive, much more in fact than 
the supervision of offenders in the community. It costs Canadian 
taxpayers $47,760 a year on average to keep an offender in jail 
compared with only $9,400 to keep him under supervision in 
society for the same period of time.
<P>
<B>(1430) </B>
<P>
	We must therefore resort to incarceration only to the extent 
necessary to protect the public. While it is true that some 
offenders must be jailed for a long time in the interest of the 
public, the fact remains that the vast majority of criminals serve 
definite sentences and that most of them can be released without 
danger to society, provided they receive appropriate treatment 
and are under adequate supervision.
<P>
	Parliament recognized this reality when it passed the 
Corrections and Conditional Release Act, which favours using 
the least restrictive measures without jeopardizing public 
safety.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Conditional release under the Corrections and Conditional 
Release Act is effective in protecting the public. While I do not 
desire to minimize certain tragic incidents, released offenders 
are not becoming more dangerous.
<P>
	Although this perception may result from media reports on 
crime, statistics simply do not support this position. For 
example, in 1991 only 1 per cent of admissions to federal 
custody were the result of a new violent offence committed 
while on release. Indeed, keeping offenders in prison longer 
instead of gradually integrating them into the community may in 
fact increase public risk over the long term.
<P>
	Research evidence shows that strictly punitive measures 
which result in longer terms of incarceration have little 
deterrent effect on serious offenders and do not lead to a 
reduction in reoffending.
<P>
	I believe that the key to improving public protection lies in 
our ability to develop effective treatment programs and to 
effectively assess offenders in their ability to benefit from 
treatment and the level of risk they present to the community.
<P>
	The research strongly supports this approach. Risk which one 
could define as a likelihood that an offender will engage in 
dangerous behaviour upon release is the overriding 
consideration of correctional authorities and parole board 
members.
<P>
	Because of its central importance to the correctional process 
risk is managed and assessed throughout an offender's sentence. 
In brief, risk is managed by identifying factors that contribute to 
an offender's criminal behaviour, determining an offender's 
treatment and program needs, developing correctional plans that 
address these needs, matching treatment programs and services 
to the needs and risk level of the offender, and providing the 
necessary level of custody.
<P>
	It is on the basis of risk assessment that offenders are moved 
from higher security to lower security and eventually 
considered for conditional release on the basis of their changing 
level of risk.
<P>
	Prediction of human behaviour is not a perfect science nor 
will it ever be. However, the effectiveness of the tools that have 
been developed to assist professionals in assessing offenders 
have improved dramatically over the past few years.
<P>
	Efforts continue to be made to improve the system's capacity 
to monitor changes in an offender's behaviour, situation, and 
circumstances which are clearly related to the likelihood of 
further criminal behaviour. Today we have a much better 
understanding of what factors may be valid risk predictors. Over 
time our capacity to better  distinguish between high and low 
risk offenders will continue to improve.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="5183"> 5183 </A></B>
<P>
	I would also like to bring to the attention of hon. members that 
individual offenders who at one time represented a high public 
risk can with appropriate treatment both in an institution and in 
the community be safely released to the community.
<P>
	There is a growing body of research pointing to the 
rehabilitative potential of well formulated research based 
treatment programming. Some things do work.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Correctional Service Canada has invested a lot of time and 
money to develop programs with a proven record as regards 
their usefulness to help reduce the number of repeat offenders. 
Based on these data, the service designed and implemented a 
number of programs to meet the various needs of the federal 
inmate population. Here are some of them.
<P>
	An education program has been established. According to a 
classification test, about 80 per cent of offenders under federal 
jurisdiction have less than a grade 10 level of education when 
they are admitted. This low level is a major obstacle in their 
rehabilitation, because it greatly affects their chances of finding 
work.
<P>
	A treatment program was instituted for sex offenders. At the 
end of last year, 17 per cent of the inmates in federal 
penitentiaries were classified as sex offenders. The correctional 
service now has more ways of meeting their needs and can offer 
treatment to nearly 1,800 such offenders every year, compared 
to 200 in 1988.
<P>
	A program aimed at developing cognitive abilities was 
created in 1989 to help offenders alter their modes of thought 
which lead to criminal behaviour. The program is offered in 71 
locations and the number of participants has increased from 50 
to over 3,000.
<P>
	The correctional service also offers a drug treatment program 
to nearly 5,000 inmates and to roughly 1,800 people in the 
community. It endeavours to ensure that programs are geared to 
the different needs of offenders.
<P>
	Another initiative is the program for native offenders. While 
natives account for only 3 per cent of Canada's population, they 
represent up to 12 per cent of the federal inmate population. 
Studies have shown that native inmates are more receptive to 
programs that are specifically designed for them and the 
Correctional Service is working to increase the number of such 
programs.
<P>
	A program aimed at helping offenders with mental disorders 
has also been established. According to a survey of the federal 
inmate population covering the past four years, a significant 
proportion of inmates suffer from acute psychosis, depression or 
anxiety. Since there is a definite need, in the years to come it will 
be vital to establish appropriate evaluation services, various 
types of specialized care in institutions and support programs in 
the community.
<P>
	A family violence initiative has been taken. Research has 
shown that federal offenders are very likely to commit acts of 
violence within their family, especially those who abuse or have 
previously abused family members, who have committed 
assault in the past or are judged to be very likely to commit 
abuse. Community pilot projects for the evaluation and 
treatment of these offenders have already been set up in a 
number of cities, the necessary resources are being assembled to 
be able to treat 300 offenders, compared with 100 in 1992-93.
<P>
	In concluding, I want to emphasize the importance of risk 
evaluation methods and therapy programs in achieving our main 
objective, which is to protect the public.
