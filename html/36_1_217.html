</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Guelph—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, today is the National Day of Mourning and I would like 
to remind my colleagues and Canadians everywhere of the role we 
can play in preventing work related accidents and occupational 
illnesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a reminder of and in tribute to those who have lost their 
lives, the Canadian flag will be flown at half-mast today on 
Parliament Hill.  The importance of protecting the health and 
safety of all Canadian workers must never be forgotten, 
especially given the recent tragedy that occurred at VIA Rail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the federal government I extend my deepest 
sympathies to the victims and to the families of those injured 
and killed in work related accidents.  Together we can work to 
prevent future tragedies through increased awareness of the need 
for accident prevention measures.  After all, occupational health 
and safety is everybody's business.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster—Coquitlam—Burnaby, 
Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the Royal City Musical Theatre Company is 
alive and well in my riding of New 
Westminster—Coquitlam—Burnaby. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unlike the big production theatres, the Royal City Musical 
Theatre Company is primarily made up of volunteer talent.  The 
theatre is celebrating its 10th anniversary with a lavish 
production of Rogers and Hammerstein's classic <I>The King and I</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My wife and I had the privilege to see this production.  I can 
say that it is visually stunning, with colourful costumes, 
exquisite dancing and wonderful music with singing to match. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The spin-off to businesses that the Royal City Musical Theatre 
Company brings to New Westminster is worthy of accolades, but it 
is the quality and professionalism of the productions which have 
earned this amateur group the respect of patrons from all over 
British Columbia and the United States.  It is estimated that 
over 19,000 patrons will see <I>The King and I</I> this year in 
New Westminster between now and May 2. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The theatre is certainly fit for a king and is testimony of what 
a community can do without much government help.  Congratulations 
to director Ed Harrington, choreographer Dolores Kirkwood and 
musical directors James Bryson and Lloyd Nicholson for giving 
opportunity for Canadian talent and for New Westminster to shine.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This event will create the opportunity for citizens within the 
prairies and beyond to travel together the beauty of Canada's 
western landscape, thereby enhancing the RCMP's tradition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The positive influence of the RCMP officers on the Canadian west 
has truly extended to include the whole nation.  By their 
commitment to serve and protect they provide a symbol of pride

Speaker, the new guru of the Bloc Quebecois, Jacques Parizeau, 
continues to discredit himself and to blow with the wind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few years ago, this wise economist swore only by a Quebec 
currency.  During the last referendum, he placed all his faith 
in the Canadian dollar.  Now, or the past two weeks, he has been 
proclaiming his faith in the U.S. dollar.  He said “When one has 
set an objective one wants to attain, one pushes any obstacles 
out of the way.  I will become an advocate of the U.S. dollar 
just as I was before of the Canadian dollar”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seeing the flip-flops he is capable of, I would recommend he join 
the Cirque du Soleil. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This same man claims that Canada is becoming centralist and 
refuses to allow Quebec to be part of Canadian delegations. 
Nothing could be more incorrect, as the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage has shown with her invitation to the Quebec Minister of 
Culture to join in the Canadian delegation for the next meeting 
in Mexico, and to speak there.

today as we observe a day of mourning for workers killed or

die each year because of their workplaces.  Another million are 
injured or acquire an occupational illness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On this day of mourning I would like to pay tribute to all those 
who attempt to build safer and healthier workplaces.  In my 
riding of Sault St. Marie, employers and employees of many

of co-operation and mutual responsibility they can help to 
prevent workplace injury and deaths and that they can together 
make healthier workplaces.

down that same road.  Over 60% of the victims of hepatitis C in 
this country will therefore receive some sort of compensation.

progress that has been made in recent decades in work accident

occur often.  These accidents are always dramatic.

across the world, including Canada, should give us cause for 
concern.

that the federal government has yet to adopt a fairer universal 
system, like the one adopted by Quebec a long time ago.  An

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, yesterday 
the transport minister stated that of the 27 million shipments of 
hazardous goods travelling through Canada annually, less than 1% 
is a problem.  That would mean that approximately 270,000 
shipments are dangerous to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Firefighters who saw MPs on the Hill this week, who visited me 
yesterday, stated that to implement Operation Respond across 
Canada, the cost would only be $236,000.  I believe that the

men and women need to have information before going into 
situations that can jeopardize their lives, as well as the lives 
of other Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Operation Respond will get that information to them quicker and, 
in conjunction with CANUTEC, will give our firefighters the 
necessary data to do their jobs.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>HEPATITIS C 
</H3><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK36"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, one year ago today the Prime Minister crushed the hopes 
of thousands of hepatitis C victims.  He did this by forcing his 
members to vote against a motion calling for compensation for all 
victims of the tainted blood scandal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been one year.  What does the Prime Minister have to say 
to the families of the 800 hepatitis C victims who have died 
during the year without any financial help? 
<P><A NAME="LINK37"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the court will shortly have before it for approval an agreement 
reached by representatives of those with hepatitis C and the 
governments, all governments, which will provide payments to 
those persons over many years to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, of course, last September I proposed to my 
provincial colleagues that the Government of Canada share half 
the costs of medical expenses beyond what are provided by 
insurance over the lifetime of those with hepatitis C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has responded in a way that is important.  We 
have offered care to those who are ill. 
<P><A NAME="LINK38"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, after that vote a year ago the Prime Minister fell back 
on the two tier approach to caring for hepatitis C victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He promised financial compensation for those who got sick from 
tainted blood between 1986 and 1991, and he ruled out 
compensation for anyone outside those years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why has the Prime Minister broken even his limited promise and 
failed to pay out a single cent in compensation to any hepatitis 
C victim? 
<P><A NAME="LINK39"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
those who will receive payments will receive payments over their 
lifetime if the court approves the agreement, depending on their 
level of sickness, which is exactly what they should receive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cornerstone of our approach to this tragic and difficult 
issue has been to respond to the medical needs of those who were 
infected, to make sure that everybody infected by hepatitis C as 
a result of the blood system will have access to the medical 
services and the care they need without making payments from 
their own pocket. 
<P><A NAME="LINK40"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we do not want to hear from the government's lawyer on 
this case.  We want to hear from the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the last year the Ontario government set up a program and 
started compensating victims of hepatitis C.  The Government of 
Quebec is contemplating the same thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How much longer will victims of hepatitis C have to wait before 
the government calls off the bureaucrats, calls off the lawyers, 
and does something to compensate these hepatitis C victims? 
<P><A NAME="LINK41"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
this is an example of why our caring approach is far better than 
the political approach taken in Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ontario offers $10,000 per person once in their lifetime.  Ten 
thousand dollars is the approximate cost, if they are not covered 
by insurance, of one regimen of Interferon which the victims 
sometimes take for their treatment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have offered to provide care for their lifetime, for their 
whole lifetime.  That is the approach Canadians want to see us 
take. 
<P><A NAME="LINK42"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, behind 
closed doors here is the Prime Minister's response to the 
hepatitis C anniversary.  He told Liberal MPs that they should be 
grateful to him for imposing the party line, because after one 
year nobody remembers what is going on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Joey Haché remembers what went on.  The victims of hepatitis C 
whom I met in Montreal on Monday know what is going on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the Prime Minister not just admit that he hopes 
everybody will forget what happened one year ago on hepatitis C? 
<P><A NAME="LINK43"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
let us put aside the political approach to these victims and let 
us look at the care that those who are sick really need.  Let us 
focus on the medical care and attention those who are ill will 
need.  That has been our focus.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We have offered the provinces a way to ensure for all the years

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister 
is proud of having denied compensation to all the victims of 
hepatitis C.  He boasts that, after a year, no one remembers 
this tragedy.  The victims and their families remember. 
Canadians remember.  And we remember. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the Prime Minister proud that 800 victims have died, 
abandoned by his government? Is he proud of that?

<P><A NAME="LINK45"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Yes, Mr. 
Speaker.  The point is that if those who are infected with 
hepatitis C need care they ought not pay out of their own pockets 
for that care, for the cost of drugs that are not within 
insurance or for nursing services that they may need as their 
lives go on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have proposed to the provinces a way to pay these expenses so 
those who are ill need not pay from their own pockets.  We 
believe that is the right approach to this issue.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, after 
36 days of air strikes, newspapers are carrying photographs of 
mass graves on their front pages.  Eight hundred thousand 
Albanians are facing famine.  Refugee camps are overflowing. 
This conflict must end as soon as possible and perhaps the most 
effective way of achieving that is to deprive Milosevic's war 
machine of oil. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With Canada increasing the number of diplomatic missions, has 
the Prime Minister been assured that all NATO countries are not 
at present supplying oil in a roundabout way to Milosevic's regime? 
<P><A NAME="LINK48"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
that was the decision taken by government representatives in 
Washington on the weekend.  They decided to ensure that, while 
the refineries are being bombed, oil is not shipped through 
other provinces of Yugoslavia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was the decision taken and Canada intends to participate 
fully in this embargo. 
<P><A NAME="LINK49"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Canada's position is clear and is to its credit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we have learned that Texaco supplied 65,000 barrels of 
oil on April 10, two weeks after air strikes began, at the very 
time the refineries were being bombed and our planes were in the 
area.  Such an attitude is wrong and, to date, only Texaco has 
said that it will not supply any more oil. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it not time the Prime Minister called President Clinton and 
made sure that no American oil company supplies Milosevic's 
regime?  Unless he does, we are shooting ourselves in the foot 
and endangering the lives of troops, in addition to completely 
missing the boat. 
<P><A NAME="LINK50"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the decision was taken by Canada, as well as by the U.S. 
government.  American companies have been accused of not 
respecting the embargo.  If this is true, it is deplorable, 
because President Clinton gave an undertaking to the 18 other 
heads of state present in Washington that the U.S. would fully 
support the oil embargo. 
<P><A NAME="LINK51"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in addition to the 
diplomatic measures that must be intensified, one way to put a 
quick stop to the conflict is to paralyze the Serb war machine 
by depriving it of oil.  Without oil, even the best tank is 
worthless.  It is easy to understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its diplomatic efforts, has the government taken steps with 
the leaders in Montenegro to discuss ways of cutting supplies to 
Serbia without paralyzing Montenegro? 
<P><A NAME="LINK52"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the way to go about it is to not let oil into Montenegro.  It is 
part of Yugoslavia, not a foreign country.  It is a province of 
Yugoslavia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope we will take steps to prevent oil from entering through 
Montenegro.  One way to do so would be to cut the roads or the 
railroads that might be used to carry oil from Montenegro to 
Serbia.  I think this is part of future military plans.

months approximately and that he would fight to defend them, 
should Belgrade try to get around a blockade by raiding 
Montenegro's oil supply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As NATO made a commitment on the weekend to protect all the 
countries around Yugoslavia in the event of Serb aggression, 
what has the Prime Minister to say to the Government of 
Montenegro, which is saying it is prepared to take up arms 
against Milosevic to protect its oil reserves? 
<P><A NAME="LINK54"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
if the Deputy Prime Minister of Montenegro said that, so much 
the better.  However, Serbian soldiers are in Montenegro.  It is 
a province of Yugoslavia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, it is preferable to prevent oil from entering Montenegro 
than to send it back there.  Part of the population in this

respected Russian envoy, Viktor Chernomyrdin, said “Ending or 
even temporarily suspending NATO's missile and bomb strikes would 
open up a good chance of settlement”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Prime Minister urge our foreign minister to take this 
proposal in the context of a mutual ceasefire to Moscow, to NATO, 
to clear the way for negotiations for peace talks and for an end

Will he put that on the table now? 
<P><A NAME="LINK56"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is very clear the position of NATO is that if Mr. 
Milosevic withdraws his troops we will immediately stop the 
bombing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have clearly put the condition that if he stops and takes 
away his troops, we will be able to move with peacekeepers to 
guarantee the freedoms that are needed for the people in Kosovo 
and we will stop the bombing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is up to Milosevic to take away his troops who are doing the 
cleansing and the murdering and all the atrocities that we still 
hear about every day.  Some new ones were reported today.  If he

Yesterday Canadian General Henault said that the 800 Canadian

identifies as the mission”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Prime Minister now tell Canadians why our forces may be

I am having the matter double checked with our lawyers to make

we treat them in the proper way. 
<P><A NAME="LINK63"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, if

asked to help.  Unfortunately our equipment is limited to

</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general has pointed out that the new Coyote 
reconnaissance vehicles are not able to take enemy fire.  I was 
in a Coyote last week and they still have the old VHF radios. 
That makes them sitting ducks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why will the Prime Minister not just admit that our troops do 
not have the equipment they need to engage in a ground war? 
<P><A NAME="LINK64"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, they are being authorized to go for a 
peacekeeping mission and they are being deployed for that 
purpose.  They are combat capable.  That is part of their general 
training.  The equipment they are taking is among the best. The 
Coyote has in fact state of the art surveillance capability.  It 
is well protected and has all of the things needed.  I think the 
hon. member must have outdated information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, all of the vehicles, the Coyotes, the Bisons and the

each one of them.

the auditor general takes some exception to the minister, and I 
know who I would believe in a pinch. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general has also made comments about the Griffon 
helicopters.  They have a limited reconnaissance capability. Both 
the Coyotes and the Griffons are only suited for peacekeeping 
roles.  It is one thing for the minister to say it is only going 
to be peacekeeping, but once they are on the ground there and if 
it heats up, I think the minister knows that they may be in for a 
bigger battle than they expect.

its fair share of the funds, so that the scholarships could be

</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest before the hon. member asks any more questions about

about their matrimonial rights.  The minister by this agreement 
is slamming the door on the possibility of their ever having 
equal rights that all other Canadian women have.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Earlier this week one of our colleagues in 
the House, the hon. member for Skeena, raised a question of 
privilege wherein he alleged that another of our colleagues whom 
he mentioned in his statement, the hon. member for Provencher, 
evidently made a statement in the House and the information could 
only have been forthcoming, as I understand the allegation, from 
a meeting which was held in camera.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard the hon. member's allegations to the House and I

Provencher.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Iftody (Provencher, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, on 
April 22, 1999, in responding during question period to the hon. 
member for South Surrey—White Rock—Langley, I made reference to 
remarks made by the hon. member for Skeena at the Standing 
Committee on Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In making this reference, without malice to the hon. member for 
Skeena and completely unintentionally, I overlooked the fact that 
the proceedings to which I referred were in fact in camera 
proceedings.  I now of course fully recognize that I absolutely 
should not have made reference to such in camera proceedings.  To 
have done so was a serious error that should not have occurred 
even in passionate debate during question period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the matter was brought to my attention by my House leader, 
I resolved immediately to set the record straight and address the 
matter on my first day back in the House.  I have great personal 
respect for the dignity of the House, its traditions, practices, 
proceedings and, most of all, its members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore offer my apologies to the Chair, to members of the 
House, to members of the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs 
and Northern Development and, most important, I offer my apology 
to the hon. member for Skeena.  Now, Mr. Speaker, I respectfully

one step beyond.

I move that the sixth report of the Standing Committee on 
Canadian Heritage presented on Thursday, December 3, 1998, be 
concurred in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to note that there were some issues from the 
particular report tabled in the House.  One of the issues is 
televised committees, which I want to address through this 
discussion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members will find that the people who were travelling on 
this report need not have done so, had the particular committee 
televised its proceedings.  I do not believe the committee could 
have televised its proceedings because the rules are such that 
they do not permit it, and I will tell hon. members why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have gone through this issue in the House and we will 
continue to go through it in the House until we find some way to 
deal with it properly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had a report come from the Standing Committee on Procedure 
and House Affairs, for instance, that dealt with televised 
committees.  I will read one of the recommendations of that 
committee: “Members feel that it would now be appropriate to 
extend the coverage of committee proceedings.  To permanently 
equip another room for broadcasting committees, however, is not 
feasible or desirable at this time, both because of the cost 
involved and the ongoing renovations on Parliament Hill”.  This 
issue was unanimous in that committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I guess what I want to talk a bit about is what exactly is wrong 
with committees in the House of Commons.  I have my colleagues 
here going from— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I hesitate to interrupt the hon. 
member.  I know that a general discussion on committees might be 
of great interest, but the report that the hon. member is 
debating is one on sport in Canada, and I know he will want to 
bring his remarks within the tenor of the report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I did and I am.  I am 
telling the House— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I tend to do that, I am 
sorry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am trying to express to the House what is in this report on 
sport in Canada.  I am trying to express to the House what the 
problems are with that report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two problems with that report.  One of the problems is 
that members in the House have a great deal of difficulty 
understanding why it is we go into a committee meeting, a report 
comes into the House and it is not dealt with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other difficulty I am having with it is:  Was it necessary 
for the committee on sport in Canada to travel to Toronto when in 
fact if it were televised it need not have made the trip? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, I am trying to express to the Chair how it is that we 
do not have televised committees.  If we had had televised 
committees, we would not have had to travel to Toronto to talk 
about sport.

<A HREF="#LINKT15"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The difficulty the House is having on this side, and I know the 
government has had this difficulty before, is that when members 
of the House of Commons go to a committee, for instance the 
committee on sport in Canada, they expect two things:  first, to 
have good debate on the issue, and second, that something will 
happen on that issue when a report is tabled in the House.  We do 
not expect it to go into the dustbin of the House of Commons, and 
that is what is happening.  The report on sport in Canada has 
gone to the bottom of the hockey bag, as my hon. colleague says. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is much more serious than may be understood by the other 
side.  The problem in the House of Commons is relevance.  We are 
in the House today, and I see five members across the way— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I know that the hon. House leader of 
the official opposition is doing his best to remain in order, but 
he knows it is quite contrary to the rules to refer to the 
presence or absence of members of the House and I invite him to 
refrain from that sort of comment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I apologize.  There are 
six.  I will not do that again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about the relevance of members of parliament.  We 
on this side expect to attend committees, we expect work to get 
done, we expect a report to be produced or legislation to be 
returned to the House, and we expect something to be done with 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is no different than issues like petitions.  Most people in 
this country understand that when a petition comes into the House 
of Commons virtually nothing is done with it.  We have time and 
time again gone across the way and said “Listen, 100,000 people 
the other day signed a petition”, but all they get back is one 
letter.  There is no action.  We have to make changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee process is the same.  We tried to make changes. 
We tried, for instance, to get television coverage of committees. 
That was one example and it could have been done at the 
committee on sport in Canada, but it was not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what we want.  It includes this particular report I am 
talking about.  We want, as does the media, equal access to 
committees; not to show members' faces, but there is more work 
done in committees than all of the work done in the House of 
Commons in a week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Marlene Catterall:</B>  That is why we are not here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  I hear that one member is finally 
backing us up.  It is too bad this would not come to a vote.  We 
could get her to vote for it.  She is saying yes, and that is 
where they are today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is, when members go to committees and get unanimous 
consent on an issue, like this televised issue, they get 
unanimous reports, they get all-party agreement, but it comes 
into the House of Commons and it sits and gathers dust.  That is 
the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How do we rectify it?  There are several things we could do.  We 
could do what the media has asked.  We could stand today to vote 
for that.  If we all agreed we could allow television cameras 
into committees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had a discussion the other day at the committee on procedure 
and House affairs.  We were discussing leaked reports, when a 
report had already been leaked on the leaked report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I hesitate to interrupt the House 
leader again.  I know that whatever discussions happened in the 
procedure and House affairs committee would be of great interest 
to all hon. members, however, I hope it has something to do with 
the sports committee, which is, after all, the subject of this 
report.  I know he will want to draw us back to the report.  I 
steer him in that direction with all enthusiasm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am getting to that, but I 
have to set the stage, lay the foundation, by explaining what is 
wrong with the report on sport in Canada.  What is wrong with the 
report on sport in Canada, in part, is that the report on 
televised committees has been ignored just as much as the report 
on sport in Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happens when the report is tabled in the House on sport in 
Canada?  Where does it go?  Who implements it?  What standing 
order is changed?  What legislation is changed?  What is changed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We discussed leaked reports in committee the other day.  How do 
we get that into the House of Commons so that it means something? 
It is not brain surgery that we are talking about.  The people 
on this side of the House are frustrated that the House does not 
work when it comes to committees.  It does not work when it comes 
to petitions.  It does not work when grassroots Canadians want 
some say in things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Fraser Valley and I spent about a month on one 
report in the procedure and House affairs committee.  It was on 
televised committees.  Nothing happened with the report and we 
are frustrated by that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I put this question to the government, to the one member who is 
here.  Where are these people when we want to talk to them?  The 
lights are out over there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The hon. House leader promised me a 
few minutes ago that he would not do this again.  I hope he will 
refrain from referring to the absence of members of the House. 
He knows it is against the rules.  If we did this all the time 
there would be constant battering and bickering back and forth, 
and that does not lead to good debate.  I know the hon. member 
will want to control his urges in this regard and perhaps refrain 
from that kind of reference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we could call quorum, but 
we do not want to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the minister, who has now come in, is all ears, I am going to 
repeat a couple of things for his information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are members of the House, including backbench members on 
that side, who are very concerned about the output and the 
genuine integrity of committees in terms of whether or not action 
will be taken when a report is developed in committee.  These 
things are getting buried in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not understand whether it is the cabinet saying “Nice 
report, but it is not in our interests, so go away”, or whether 
it is “That is busy work in a committee.  You keep busy there, 
but do not produce anything.  Just stay there and we will ignore 
it”.  That is the concern.  That is what this is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that I have to get to sport.  I am on sport, Mr. Speaker. 
I am telling the government that this report means zero in the 
House of Commons.  It is going nowhere.  I am trying to get 
through to members over there that this cannot continue to occur. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give one example.  There was a report developed on 
televised committees on which all parties were in agreement.  It 
came into the House of Commons— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Marlene Catterall:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I believe the hon. House leader of the opposition may 
have mistaken the day of the week.  I think he is debating the 
motion that he moved yesterday, not the motion he moved today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The Chair has been fearful that this 
appears to be the tenor of the debate.  I have done my best to 
steer the hon. House leader for the opposition to sports and the 
subject of the report by various means.  I know he will want to 
perhaps use as a for instance the sports report and talk about 
that since that is the subject of the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a motion for concurrence before us on that particular 
report and I know he will want to address it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I realize the members 
across do not like the fact that I am trying to give relevance to 
a problem in committees, but you have to be a bit more patient 
with the issue.  I cannot just stand here and talk about sport in 
Canada, everybody's business, leadership, partnership and 
accountability, without telling you what our frustration is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This report hits the House of Commons floor and it collects dust 
until the government leaves office.  Nothing gets done.  All of 
those people who attended as witnesses from across the country on 
sport in Canada, everybody's business, think that something is 
going to get done and it is not.  It is just a report.  These 
folks bury it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our concern is for this report, the report on televised 
committees and the report on leaks in the House of Commons.  All 
of those are serious issues.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government seems to think that it is A-OK to keep our 
members busy in committees and, when all of their productive work 
is done, it can just shove it off, throw it in the garbage and 
say “Let us carry on with something else”.  It will write a 
little press release if it is in its favour and that is it.  It 
is not going to work that way any more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party whip, my colleague from Fraser Valley, and I 
are already looking at possibilities as to what we can do with 
committees to make them relevant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Had the government taken the initiative from one committee, and 
one committee only, where there was unanimous consent on a report 
and done something with it, we might not be here today.  We are 
getting darned sick and tired of busy work going on in the House 
of Commons when Canadian people think there is something going 
on.  We are getting darned sick and tired of it going nowhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are equally sick and tired of petitions coming into the House 
of Commons with 100 to 300,000 names on them and going nowhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This might be a majority government that can pass legislation 
through the House of Commons because it has more members who 
stand to vote, but we want more than that.  We want input.  We 
want input from grassroots Canadians to go somewhere and to be 
meaningful, not to be buried in committees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why can members across the way not get it through their thick 
skulls that there is more to democracy in Canada than the people 
who sit across the way?  Only 38% of the population wants them in 
office and they think they can run the whole darned thing without 
asking anybody for any input. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can only say this, Mr. Speaker.  You can count on this issue 
coming up again.  We are not going to let it go until we can get 
some changes made across the way.  Either this place gets more in 
tune with democracy or there are going to be a lot of debates in 
the House on the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Which is it going to be?  Is it going to be the cabinet running 
everything, while backbenchers do as they are told?  Is it going 
to be the committees, which bring in witnesses from right across 
the country and develop reports, which deal with these things, or 
is the government going to shove them in the garbage like it 
usually does?  Which way is it going to be? 
<P><A NAME="LINK151"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I would like to commend my hon. colleague from 
Langley—Abbotsford for his thoughtful remarks on sport in 
Canada.  This is an important issue to all Canadians.  It really 
brings to mind the question of the function of committees in this 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was once a tradition in this place that committees, such 
as the committee on sport in Canada, were considered to be 
somewhat independent.  They had the ability to operate with some 
degree of independence from the executive, from the cabinet and 
from the Prime Minister's office, which, as Professor Donald 
Savoie recently pointed out in his book on Canadian governance, 
really runs the entire cabinet as though it is just a focus 
group. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the cabinet is merely a focus group, then the committees 
dominated by the government's majority are just pure optics and 
have little or no relevance to the actual policy making function 
of this parliament, as witnessed by this committee decision on 
sport in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask my hon. colleague why he thinks it is that 
committees, such as the one on sport in Canada, have continued to 
see their importance and independence diminished and marginalized 
by a government that centralizes all power in the hands of the 
cabinet and the Prime Minister.

<A HREF="#LINKT18"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does my colleague agree with the famous aphorism of Lord Acton 
that power tends to corrupt and that absolute power tends to 
corrupt absolutely? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that was a good question 
from my colleague.  That is what we are dealing with today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people might ask what televised committees has to do with 
all of this.  Televised committees is just a typical example, 
such as the report on sport in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The power of the House rests with a few people on the front 
benches.  The backbenchers may think they have input, but we know 
full well that is not the case.  The backbenchers go to 
committees and talk a great storm.  They talk a great deal about 
what things have to change.  However, they know as well as we 
know that once their discussions formulate into a report it comes 
into the House of Commons, the minister looks at it and says “I 
do not like this”, and it goes in the garbage and is gone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of these committees work for five and six months on an issue, 
like the committee on drunk driving.  What is the government 
going to do at the end of it?  We have a suspicion that it is 
going to table these reports and leave them there to die, like 
the report on sport.  That is what will happen to this 
report, like the one on televised committees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking about televised committees, we want that report dealt 
with.  If it is a vote in the House and the government says no, 
so be it, but we should not leave it in the dust pile.  That is 
what is wrong here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In answer to my colleague's question, the problem is that this 
is all about democracy.  This is all about Canadians who come 
into the House thinking they are going to have great input and 
change the laws of our lands through reports.  They go home 
thinking that since they were at a committee things are surely 
going to change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had Lee Ellen Carroll and Craig Oliver at a televised 
committee.  They thought something was going to change but it did 
not.  The only thing that happened was that the government House 
leader came into a meeting that I was at and said that he would 
make me a deal.  I asked him what kind of deal he wanted to make. 
He said he knew that the report on televised committees had a 
whole lot of recommendations but that he did not like them.  What 
he wanted to do was make me an offer to set up another room. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When he did that we asked him why would he do it. The committee 
met for six weeks and the first recommendation was not to do 
that.  It states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To permanently equip another room for broadcasting committees, 
however, is not feasible or desirable at this time— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We got that offer for several reasons. I doubt the government 
House leader ever read the report.  He did not attend any 
committee meetings.  He was probably told by a minister to have 
somebody look at the report, even though he did not like it, and 
then threw it in the garbage.  That is where it sits today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can tell the House that there will be a lot of discussions 
on this until we get some action on it.  There will lots of 
discussions on all other reports.  There will be lots of votes 
in the House of Commons on these issues until we get some 
satisfaction.  That is what is going to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Either we get some satisfaction or the government will have to 
live with a lot of discussion on the issue.  What is it going to 
be?  Are we going to listen to Canadians or are we going to 
listen to the cabinet over there?  Instead of sitting on the 
backbench, we should be speaking up for Canadians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK152"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am very pleased to ask the opposition House leader a 
question pertaining to this report that has been tabled by the 
Minister of Industry on the study of sport in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As many people know, the Liberal government has provided huge 
tax breaks in this year's budget to millionaire hockey players. 
For example, an average hockey player in the NHL makes about $1.8 
million Canadian and the recent budget has given these 
individuals a tax cut of over $13,000.  The Reform Party has been 
fighting for tax cuts for these individuals for a long time.

<A HREF="#LINKT19"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other point I would like to make is that this country has a 
significant tax expenditure, that is, a tax supporting system at 
the federal level for our professional sports franchises.  For 
example, a hockey box that a business would buy at a hockey arena 
for the Ottawa Senators, the Montreal Canadians or the Toronto 
Maple Leafs costs a business person about $100,000.  He or she 
gets to write that off against taxable income which costs the 
taxpayers approximately $25,000 to $30,000 per box.  This is not 
for the whole arena but per box per year.  We are looking at 
literally tens of millions of dollars of tax supported sports 
franchises currently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the Reform Party continue to support those great tax breaks 
for the wealthy?  Does the hon. member intend to keep pushing for 
additional tax breaks for the NHL franchise teams which are in 
jeopardy in Canada right now? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is a very good 
question. I think virtually everyone in the country knows where 
the Reform Party stands on taxes.  Lower taxes are an absolute 
must for everyone.  A flatter tax would help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that taxes of all kinds kill jobs.  We have sons and 
daughters today who are waking up to that.  I have two myself. On 
just got a job as a digital animator in Vancouver.  He has had 
the job for nine or ten months.  He phoned me the other day and 
said, “Dad, there is something wrong here.  I make <I>x</I> 
dollars and I am not getting much back in return”.  I said, 
“Welcome to the real world, son”.  He had an offer from Seattle 
for a job, making about the same amount of money with a tax rate 
almost half of ours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is wrong in this country is that the tax rate is too high. 
In particular, we need a flatter tax rate to address that 
particular issue.  What can we say?  The taxes the Liberals have 
put on this country since 1993 are oppressive.  Young people are 
hurting with the tax rates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  They are strangling our economy.

the amendments in Group No. 1 and put a title upon the five 
amendments that have been accepted by the House.  These motions 
come to grips with the role of the Canada Mortgage and Housing 
Corporation as a financial institution.  What the bill does in 
many ways is create a new crown corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know that the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation is 
actually a crown enterprise corporation, which makes it a little 
different from other crown corporations.  One of its mandates is 
to be sure it makes money.  In other words, it is not designed to 
take money from the consolidated revenue of the Government of 
Canada.

<A HREF="#LINKT22"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, through the 
provisions made by Bill C-66, becomes actually a financial 
intermediary in the financial marketplace.  I ask why a crown 
corporation should become a financial intermediary in the 
financial marketplace.  We have such institutions as the banks. 
We have trust companies.  We have credit unions.  We have 
insurance companies.  We have various kinds of mortgage 
companies.  And here we have a crown corporation which is given 
the powers under this legislation to borrow money, to lend money, 
to insure mortgages and things of this sort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This principle of whether the Canada Mortgage and Housing 
Corporation should in fact become an institution that intervenes 
or that it become an intermediary in the financial marketplace is 
a very real question.  I submit that the Canada Mortgage and 
Housing Corporation was set up to perform a function, and that 
was to make housing possible for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the years the purpose of the Canada Mortgage and Housing 
Corporation, which is there to bring into practice and to 
implement the provisions of the National Housing Act, was to make 
housing available to ordinary Canadians who would otherwise not 
be able to afford to do so. Many, many people, and that includes 
myself, were able to purchase their first house because of the 
provisions of the National Housing Act. Millions of Canadians 
have benefited from this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The recent amendments that have come into place allowing people 
to mortgage a house with only a 5% down payment has opened the 
market tremendously to a large number of people.  This is a very 
commendable thing.  Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation 
insures the mortgages for the financial institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can debate for a long time whether in fact the financial 
institution should be protected to the point where it does not 
have to worry about the prudence of a particular mortgage. After 
all, if the mortgage goes down, the bank will never suffer, 
Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation will simply pay it off. 
In one way it is actually a subsidy to the banks and allows them 
to give money away without incurring any risk on their own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I have some difficulty with that, I also know that there 
are some people who would never ever be able to buy a house 
unless the mortgages they sign were supported and insured by 
Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation.  I think that is a 
wonderful move. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some provisions in this bill though that cause me 
severe difficulty.  One of these is the provision that dividends 
are considered for the purposes of this act to be expenses for 
the corporation. Any other corporation that pays dividends to its 
shareholders is not allowed to consider them as expenses.  They 
are indeed a draw on the cash reserves of the company, but they 
are not expenses.  There are other expenses like the payment of 
rent, utilities, salaries and things of this sort, but this bill 
allows the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation to somehow 
consider dividends as an expense.  I think that is fundamentally 
wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the amendments we are proposing is that these payments, 
in this case the dividends, would be paid to none other than the 
consolidated revenue fund, which is really the Government of 
Canada.  Since the Government of Canada is the sole shareholder 
of Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, it in fact is paid 
these dividends.  Those are not expenses.  Those are clear 
outright payments to the Government of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other provisions in this legislation that we have to 
look at in some detail as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation is able to perform 
its functions of a financial nature, insurance, reinsurance, 
borrowing and issuing securities, outside the provisions of the 
Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the purposes behind this legislation, we were told, was 
to make Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation a more commercial 
enterprise.  The suggestion was that it should compete on a more 
or less fair and level playing field with other competitors in 
that particular field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are three things that are complicated by the way in which 
OSFI does not govern or does not in any way have any say about 
what Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation does. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1635"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT24"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT24"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1635
<A HREF="#LINKT25"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT23"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The major competitor to Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation 
is GE Capital which also insures mortgages.  This company with 
which CMHC competes must abide by the rules of the Office of the 
Superintendent of Financial Institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we have two companies, one a crown corporation and one a 
private corporation, both performing a function and a service for 
the people of Canada. The people of Canada can choose one or the 
other.  To that degree it is okay and everything is level, except 
that the operation of the private company is under a different 
set of regulations from those of Canada Mortgage and Housing 
Corporation. It must have certain requirements in terms of 
reserves and certain ways and places where it can invest money 
that the Canada Mortgage and Housing does not have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask is it fair and reasonable to expect an honest competitive 
field to exist between the crown corporation on the one hand and 
the private enterprise on the other?  Both serve the public and 
the public can choose which one they would work with in terms of 
insuring their mortgage, but in fact one is at a clear 
disadvantage to the other one.  That is only one area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other area is the requirement by the financial institutions, 
and I have to go back a little bit here.  Canada Mortgage and 
Housing Corporation has 100% backing of its full mortgage. If it 
issues an insurance policy for a particular mortgage, it is 
totally 100% guaranteed by the Government of Canada or by Canada 
Mortgage and Housing Corporation.  A financial institution runs 
absolutely no risk.  It will always be able to look to the public 
treasury.  If for some reason Canada Mortgage and Housing 
Corporation should have difficulty, the consolidated revenue fund 
is there to back up completely, 100 cents on the dollar, whatever 
shortfall there might be by Canada Mortgage and Housing 
Corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such is not the case with a private insurance company that also 
insures mortgages.  The government as well has an agreement here, 
which is commendable, where it underwrites up to 90% of the 
mortgages that are insured by an organization such as GE Capital 
or any other company that would come on the scene. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That difference of 10% is a pretty significant factor in terms 
of the particular financial institution that wishes to do 
business with a company like GE Capital, for example.  It now 
puts GE Capital in the position of having to deposit additional 
moneys with the financial institution, or the financial 
institution has on its own right to commit a reserve against this 
exposure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I submit that one of the major purposes behind the amendments of 
the bill is defeated by creating Canada Mortgage and Housing 
Corporation into a new creature, a financial institution that 
competes directly in the marketplace and as an intermediary in 
the financial marketplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments that have been proposed by myself in the name of 
the Reform Party in fact come to grips with rectifying that 
situation and making it a better piece of legislation. I humbly 
submit that all members of the House support the amendments that 
have been proposed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK164"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carolyn Parrish (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to address the House and the issues raised by the 
member for Kelowna concerning mortgage insurance in Bill C-66. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to respond at the beginning by asserting that the 
government is against Motions Nos. 1, 2 and 4 to 6 proposed by 
the member opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to stress that Bill C-66 supports the Government of 
Canada's efforts to make government more efficient and provide 
better service to Canadians.  The changes to the mortgage 
insurance and guarantee legislation put forth by the member for 
Kelowna would put at risk the benefits Canadian families gain 
from CMHC's work in housing finance and threaten chances of 
progress. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through CMHC's mortgage insurance and mortgage backed securities 
program, the Government of Canada has important levers to promote 
housing affordability and choice, to ensure access to mortgage 
funds as well as competition and efficiency in housing finance, 
to protect the availability of adequate housing funding at low 
cost, and to contribute to the well-being of the housing sector 
in the national economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mortgage loan insurance and mortgage backed securities have been 
important public policy tools of the Government of Canada, tools 
which have made it possible for millions of Canadians to realize 
their dream of owning a home, and this at no cost to the 
government. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1640"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT24"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Kelowna would have us throw away the 
benefits of bringing in more funds from the capital market by 
limiting mortgage backed securities and proposes uses for 
mortgage insurance that could stifle our country's ability to 
improve the availability and affordability of housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new section 3 of the National Housing Act clearly sets out 
the mandate and limits of CMHC's functions in housing finance: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of this Act, in relation to financing for housing, is 
to promote housing affordability and choice, to facilitate access 
to, and competition and efficiency in the provision of, housing 
finance, to protect the availability of adequate funding for 
housing at low cost, and generally to contribute to the 
well-being of the housing sector in the national economy. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>How much clearer can one get?  Why would this government give 
CMHC the uninspired and limited means proposed by the member for 
Kelowna when its mandate is much more compelling and much more 
clear?  Why would the House regulate CMHC's activities in the 
same way it oversees privately owned financial institutions when 
it can govern more directly with the input of Canadians? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The dream of owning a home is one shared by a great many 
Canadians.  Unfortunately, many are unable to buy a house despite 
the fact they can afford monthly mortgage payments.  The reason 
for this is that many families find it hard to save the money 
required for the down payment on a conventional loan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mortgage loan insurance has provided many Canadians with the 
opportunity to own their own home.  In some cases it allowed them 
to buy sooner due to the lower down payment.  In other cases it 
opened the door for people who would have otherwise never been 
able to buy a home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to give an idea of just how many Canadians depend 
on mortgage loan insurance in order to fulfil their dream of 
owning a home.  In the past year CMHC has helped Canadians gain 
access to over 300,000 homes with the use of mortgage loan 
insurance, and this was done at no cost to the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada is committed to ensuring that mortgage 
insurance is available to homebuyers in all regions of Canada. 
The proposed amendments would allow CMHC to operate its mortgage 
insurance program on a more commercial basis.  This will ensure 
that CMHC is able to compete on an equal footing with any private 
mortgage insurer.  This means that all mortgage insurers, both 
public and private, are subject to the same regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By guaranteeing competition in this sector, we can ensure that 
Canadians are able to have access to the best possible price and 
a greater number of choices in home financing products.  Besides 
helping Canadians to become homeowners, CMHC mortgage insurance 
has also been key to the health of the housing industry in 
Canada.  By fully protecting lenders against default on the part 
of borrowers, mortgage insurance encourages investment in 
residential construction.  As a result, CMHC plays a central role 
in creating numerous jobs in this key sector of our economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recent years CMHC has been approached to support many 
innovative products.  With the new National Housing Act, CMHC 
will be able to bring the benefits of some of these new types of 
home financing products to the marketplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By simplifying the National Housing Act, CMHC would have the 
flexibility to consider products such as insurance for a reverse 
equity mortgage to enable older homeowners to use the equity in 
their home to obtain funds while allowing them to continue to 
live where they have lived for a long time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>CMHC would also be able to consider such ideas as non-mortgage 
financing for remote areas where the land registry system does 
not facilitate mortgages, or financing arrangements on Indian 
reserves where restrictions exist on providing land as security 
for mortgages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any new products to give Canadians increased opportunities for 
housing choice and affordability would be developed after careful 
consideration of their potential success in the marketplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The failure to remain competitive could reduce CMHC to a 
residential insurer with riskier loans.  This would jeopardize 
mortgage insurance, self-financing and create the need for public 
subsidies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Passing this legislation would equip CMHC with the necessary 
financing tools required to continue to provide Canadians with 
the opportunity to own a house.  Bill C-66 will also strengthen 
CMHC's capacity to accomplish its goal of contributing to the 
well-being of the housing sector and our nation's economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, the new National Housing Act will improve the 
service CMHC provides to Canadians and support the housing 
industry.  Why would the hon. member for Kelowna want to 
jeopardize the viability of CMHC's mortgage loan insurance? 
Mortgage loan insurance is a service that has made a difference 
to over three million Canadian families since 1954. 
With Bill C-66, we want to ensure that the benefits governments 
provided to past generations will continue to be available to 
Canada's future generations.

Consumers will benefit in the area of mortgage financing.  The

development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since its creation more than 50 years ago, CMHC has been

house Canadians is unequalled.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak to the proposed amendments.  I would first 
remind those joining us that the subject of the debate is 
housing.  I thank the member for Québec for giving me a hand in 
difficult circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is paradoxical, to say the least, that we have before us a 
bill such as this one, because it has two major flaws.  First, 
it helps to further privatize the Canada Mortgage and Housing 
Corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me make myself clear. 
We do not think privatization should be avoided at all cost. We 
think there is a room in the mortgage market for private 
enterprise. However, we do not understand the government making 
it a priority in the area of housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would have been happier if the government had succeeded in 
the negotiations it began with the provinces.  It made a 
commitment in the throne speech in 1996 to transfer $1.9 billion 
to the provinces.  This is something extremely important to 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of Reform amendments to privatize the 
corporation.  What we would like for Quebec, if we must talk 
privatization, is to have the federal government not run the 
show and not be involved in housing, because the Government of 
Quebec is prepared to assume all responsibilities inherent in 
this area.  This includes public housing, land use and, 
naturally, management of housing inventories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is paradoxical, to say the least, that since 1996, 
negotiations with the Government of Quebec have not been 
entirely successful.  We have introduced more specific 
amendments in this regard. However, members should know that 
federal spending on housing in Quebec for 1996-97 amounted to 
$362 million. 
This corresponds to roughly 18% of the CHMC's spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, both the PQ government and the government led by Robert 
Bourassa have admitted that Quebec was not receiving its fair 
share of housing dollars.  Quebec should receive almost 29% of 
what the CHMC spends on housing, since 29% of those with urgent 
housing needs live in Quebec.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would have liked to see the government tackle this problem 
rather than launch into what is more of an administrative 
reform.  The public should know that the proposed reform is 
essentially administrative in nature.  In fact, its purpose is 
to give the CHMC more powers and to amend the legislation such 
that, in many circumstances, the CHMC will be able to take 
decisions without going through parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the Reform Party, the New Democratic Party and the 
Progressive Conservative Party should know, and the member for 
Chambly will agree with me, that we will support any amendment 
giving parliament a greater decision making role. We feel it is 
important for parliamentarians to play their role of debating 
issues, taking decisions and, of course, understanding the 
decisions made by crown corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the member for Québec, who is the critic for issues related 
to poverty, early childhood and the family, present, I would 
like to take this opportunity to say again that we believe that 
poverty cannot be eliminated without a housing policy. 
This conviction is shared by all Bloc Quebecois members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why?  Because very often the main cause of poverty is, of 
course, the excessive amount that has to be allocated to rent. 
At the present time—one cannot predict the future—I know that 
there is a debate going on, to which the hon. member for Québec 
has referred, which may lead to a redefinition of poverty. 
Nevertheless, as we speak, although there is no official index 
for assessing poverty, the low income cutoff level is one 
indicator which shows us just how much poverty there is in 
Canada and Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservative Party whip, whose sensitivity on 
this issue is well known, shares my conviction that we must do 
something about of poverty.  I imagine that the hon. member for 
Chicoutimi shares my analysis that the government we have in 
Quebec City is working hard every day to do so, but the same 
does not go for the federal government.  The government in 
Ottawa is not one particularly concerned with these matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would even go so far as to call it rather heartless, rather 
indifferent, with a few exceptions.  Some of the ministers are 
less so.  I would acknowledge, at any rate, that the Minister 
responsible for Human Resources Development is sensitive to 
these matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask him to put out a little more effort, because his 
government, it must be admitted, does not have a very good track 
record in the matter.  I think his sensitivity is real, and with 
his great intellectual capacity he will certainly make a 
positive contribution to the debate.  However, the policies of 
his government are pitiful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take, as an example, the UN's evaluation of the 
government's policies.  The UN was concerned, and members will 
recognize that the UN has no representation within the parties 
in this House.  They are people who work for various commissions 
set up under this organization, often they are experts not bound 
by the imperatives of party life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, I have a major grievance against the government on this 
score.  Canada is a signatory to the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, ratified in 1996.  Since 
1994, we have been waiting for Canada's report, which was tabled 
only this year.

<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On a similar matter, when it comes to poverty, we cannot permit 
such inaction.  If parliamentarians had taken the trouble to 
read the report, as did I, the member for Québec, the member for 
Chambly and the member for Tobique—Mactaquac, they would have 
realized that poverty has increased in Canada in the past ten 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The United Nations focused on this.  It appears there is a link 
with the dismantling of the public sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know where the minister was in 1992.  Perhaps he was 
working very successfully with Minister Ryan, perhaps he was an 
international affairs consultant.  The long and the short of it 
is that he was not in this parliament.  The fact is that, since 
1992, the Canadian government has not put one red cent into 
developing social housing.  In fact, the government began 
pulling out of various areas, particularly social housing, under 
the Progressive Conservatives.  Facts are facts.  The government 
began pulling out of such areas as social housing in 1992. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With a few exceptions for RRAP, the Canadian government has not, 
to all intents and purposes, put one red cent into developing 
social housing since 1992.  This is not good enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two provinces are developing social housing: British Columbia 
and Quebec.  Quebec has invested $43 million. 
If Quebec were a sovereign nation, we would be far more likely 
to have a cogent policy specifically directed at housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My time is up, but I will be back, by popular demand, for the 
second group of amendments. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK166"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or—Cape Breton, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I welcome the opportunity to comment on the amendments 
to this legislation, Bill C-66, dealing with the mortgage 
insurance function of the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation 
put forward by my hon. colleague from Kelowna. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we debate the legislation, it is important to remember the 
original reason for CMHC's existence.  It was at the height of 
the depression in 1935 that the federal government got involved 
in housing with the Dominion Housing Act.  This involvement 
continued during the second world war with the Wartime Housing 
Corporation which was set up to address the housing needs of war 
workers.  The CMHC was created in 1946 to address the housing 
needs of returning soldiers.  The CMHC enabled thousands of 
Canadians to live in decent, safe, affordable housing by building 
housing or providing mortgage insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, if one believes the government, CMHC's role in making 
housing affordable for Canadians is no longer required.  The 
Conservatives got CMHC out of building new social housing in 
1991.  More recently, the Liberal government has tried to 
download its responsibilities for social housing to the 
provinces.  Now, with this legislation, the role of CMHC in 
providing mortgage insurance for social housing or to people who 
may not otherwise be able to buy a house is under attack. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past, CMHC has been able to offer insurance on 100% of a 
mortgage loan for co-operative and non-profit housing.  Without 
this support, there would have been very little co-op or 
non-profit housing for low and moderate income Canadians built in 
Canada, according to the Co-operative Housing Federation of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>CMHC programs have also meant that many Canadians who could only 
dream of buying a house have become homeowners.  It has played a 
particularly important role in areas which may be ignored by 
private insurers, remote and rural areas and first nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now with this bill, which we in the New Democratic Party feel 
commercializes CMHC, the role it played in the past, financing 
the construction of social housing and opening up the possibility 
of homeownership to Canadians of modest means, may be lost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past, when CMHC suffered a loss in underwriting a 
mortgage, the federal government absorbed that loss.  Under this 
legislation, CMHC will have to absorb any losses from 
underwriting itself.  Absorbing losses may force CMHC to deny 
mortgage insurance to high risk applicants such as people with 
limited means.

<A HREF="#LINKT28"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the government justify reducing the role of CMHC?  If 
all Canadians had access to decent, safe and affordable housing I 
would see the sense in the bill.  If the provinces had sufficient 
resources to meet the housing needs of Canadians I could accept 
that there were other governments or agencies that could fill the 
gap.  However, that is not the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have recently seen the government give the responsibility to 
the Minister of Labour to look into what we feel in the New 
Democratic Party is a national disaster; that is, homelessness in 
the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The generation entering the workforce today knows it is the 
first one in decades that will have lower real income than the 
generation that came before it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the government trying to tell us that people in their 
twenties will not need the support their parents did?  If members 
of the government are doing that, then I can assure them they 
will not be believed.  Are they telling people trying to find a 
way to afford to buy their own home that there are agencies other 
than the CMHC which will offer service to higher risk customers? 
I would hope the government has more respect for the intelligence 
of Canadians than to try to suggest that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The role of the CMHC as a bulwark against recession is also 
threatened.  Currently, because it can underwrite mortgages in 
poor market conditions without risk, the CMHC can encourage 
housing development at a point in the market cycle when the 
market discourages it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Commercializing CMHC's mortgage insurance will force it to weigh 
risk according to market cycles.  Thus, it will no longer be able 
to play a valuable counter-recessionary role in the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I realize, and this might explain the attitudes of some of my 
colleagues, that in relatively prosperous urban areas the loss of 
the service that the CMHC has been able to provide may not be 
noticed.  However, in many of the communities I represent in Cape 
Breton, and thousands of similar communities across Canada, it 
would be a very serious blow.  That is why I am disappointed to 
see the amendments put forward by the member for Kelowna.  The 
amendments the member has moved do nothing to ensure that the 
CMHC is able to meet the housing needs of all Canadians.  What 
they do is respond to the concerns of GE Capital, a large 
American owned multinational which is in competition with the 
CMHC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we vote on these amendments the decision we have to make 
is who comes first, a foreign owned multinational or Canadian 
families? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My party members know which side they are on.  We will be voting 
against these amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should be ensuring that the CMHC is able to do what it was 
set up to do, that is, to work to improve the availability of 
decent, affordable accommodations for all Canadians.  It is not 
only our responsibility, it is our duty to Canadian families. 
<P><A NAME="LINK167"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique—Mactaquac, PC):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to share a few brief thoughts on the group 
of amendments proposed by the member for Kelowna, for whom I have 
great respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Generally, I do not share the member's concern over the 
expansion of CMHC's insurance products.  As a homeowner I can 
understand and appreciate the value of being able to buy 
insurance to protect my mortgage against any wild fluctuations in 
interest rates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, the financial institutions will benefit because the loan 
will be insured.  More importantly, homeowners who hold mortgages 
will be protected against financial hardship.  This is no 
different than any loan insurance.  Car insurance, for example, 
protects the car owner as much or more than the bank that holds 
the car loan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding this group of amendments, I would specifically like to 
zero in on Motion No. 6, which proposes to amend the new section 
18 of the National Housing Act.  This section authorizes the CMHC 
to pay fees to the federal government in return for the crown 
backing of CMHC's loan insurance and guarantee operations.  The 
principle of this change to the act is simple.  GE Capital and 
any other private sector provider of mortgage insurance which may 
join the industry have to pay fees to have the crown back their 
insurance products, but the CMHC has not been required to do 
that. This meant that the CMHC had an unfair cost advantage to 
provide insurance products over private sector competitors. 
This provision in the bill changes all of that.  Now the CMHC 
will have to pay fees equivalent to those paid by the private 
sector.  That only makes sense and I agree with the intent of the 
bill on this matter.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 6, if I understand the member for Kelowna correctly, 
deals with what we should call this payment; whether it should be 
called a fee or a dividend.  I really do not care what the 
government calls this payment in the end, but I would point out 
that it is the intention to create a new expense for the 
corporation, just as the private sector companies have an expense 
involved in providing their insurance products.  Therefore, the 
payment should be reflected on the government's accounts as such. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Financial Administration Act recognizes payments to the 
government from crown corporations that are fees in exchange for 
services.  To be consistent, these payments should be treated as 
a fee as opposed to a dividend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I may speak to this amendment more broadly, what the member 
is missing in his motion and what the government has missed in 
this section is the effect this change will have on the books of 
the corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the CMHC corporate plan, between 1997 and 2002 the 
Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation will have paid $198 
million to the receiver general in fees under this new section of 
the bill.  This money will be paid out of the mortgage insurance 
fund and put into general government revenues.  In other words, 
this money will be lost to the Canada Mortgage and Housing 
Corporation forever and cannot be used by the corporation to 
increase its investment in the social housing portfolio. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because this money will be dumped into general revenues, it 
could be used for any scheme the government might cook up.  It 
could be used to redecorate the offices of the public works 
minister.  It could be used to fly the finance minister across 
the country so that he can speak at fundraising dinners to pad 
his own leadership campaign fund.  It could be put in some 
government slush fund to dole out grants to companies with 
devious connections to the Liberal Party, based on the flimsiest 
of criteria, not that we have ever seen that happen before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where the government has missed out and where the member for 
Kelowna has missed out with his amendment is that neither has 
addressed the concern about what to do with the money generated 
by this new fee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest to the member that we should take that money and put 
it back into social housing under the minister's account.  This 
money will be generated by the commercial activities of the 
Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation and should remain with 
the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I stated earlier, I agree that there must be a fee paid in 
order to put the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation on a 
level playing field with its private sector competitors. 
However, having said that, there is an opportunity here, which I 
am sure the hon. member will recognize, to put that money to good 
use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member proposed in his amendment that this payment be called 
a dividend.  I say, let us give a dividend to the 1.2 million 
Canadians who lack affordable and adequate housing.  Let us give 
a dividend to the tens of thousands of Canadians who are homeless 
in this country.  To make this happen, all the government has to 
do is make a policy change in cabinet to return this money to the 
minister's account at the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation 
so that we can increase and fund the supply of affordable housing 
for all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that $198 million does not go as far as it used to when 
it comes to housing, but if the government is truly determined to 
make a dent in the problem of homelessness in this country, this 
would be a good place to start.  I am sure the member for Kelowna 
would agree with me.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I listened to

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve has consistently 
demonstrated his concern with poverty, an issue to which 
ministers of the party in power have been completely and totally 
insensitive for a good long while.  One example of this is the 
EI reform, which has left many in abject poverty.  The minister 
responsible for this aspect of the legislation and for 
government management is unbelievably insensitive to the straits 
people are in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of the misery that he is causing, his fellow minister 
sitting just two seats from him has a poverty problem on his 
hands, given that he has to provide housing for these poor 
people. Every human being must, at a minimum, have a roof over 
his head. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister responsible for the National Housing Act and the 
Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation Act is faced with 
responsibilities that he may not have anticipated. He did not 
expect it would turn out this way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Montreal alone, 500,000 people are living below the poverty 
line. The number may actually be higher, because I am quoting a 
figure that is at least a few months old already. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am trying to figure out the Canada Mortgage and Housing 
Corporation. 
I heard the parliamentary secretary praise the CMHC earlier. I 
a, familiar with this corporation, since I used to work in the 
real estate sector. As I mentioned in a previous speech, the 
Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation met the expectations 
that people had when it was first created, at the end of World 
War II, when Canadian troops back from the front were settling 
massively in cities. They settled in cities upon their return 
from Europe. People were leaving rural areas to settle in 
Montreal, Toronto or elsewhere. The CMHC was responding to a 
need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, that need still exists. I am thinking of my young 
daughter who wants to buy a house—in fact she will do so next 
week—and would really have appreciated benefiting from the 
legislation, in the sense that, right now, the initial or 
minimal downpayment to buy a house is 10% of the total price. It 
used to be 5%. 
The minimum down payment has been changed to 10%.  There are 
strings attached; CMHC does no one any favours.  It charges for 
the services it provides and the guarantees it gives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been asked to comment on this matter.  When someone 
borrows $100,000 from a bank, CMHC tells the bank “If the 
borrower does not make his payments to you, then we will”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For this service, a certain amount is charged, according to the 
size of the loan.  Often the amount charged by CMHC for its 
services is greater than the minimum down payment required to 
purchase the property, in absolute terms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is rather odd.  They get involved because the borrower does 
not have a lot of money, and then they hit him with higher 
charges than the amount required for the down payment in order 
to have a secured loan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is something unclear about this, something that is hard to 
understand, a question to which no one has given any answers, 
particularly not the minister sponsoring this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CMHC makes loans.  The risk it assumes is estimated at 5%. 
In the past, I have seen CHMC repossess properties and lose its 
shirt.  Loans have been made on which the payments have not been 
kept up, and then the lending institution, the bank or caisse 
populaire, tells CMHC “Give us our money, and take back the 
house”.  So CMHC repossesses it and sells it for a fraction of 
the value it had guaranteed.

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>All this because the CMHC, for a long time now and for reasons 
of economy, no longer evaluates houses or the risk it is taking. 
It goes by statistics.  They can often be very precise. 
However, it is a good idea to at least superficially look at the 
risk being taken, so that the fees charged those who have no 
other way of obtaining housing are reduced because the CMHC is 
taking fewer risks.  Everyone would be delighted, and those who 
turn to the CMHC would be the first to benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the minister prefers to act on statistics, even if they 
are not always true. 
If we take as an example a country where the population averages 
three feet tall and another where the population averages seven 
feet, I, who make suits for people five feet tall, would have no 
clients.  It is a bit like that.  The statistics and the 
standards sometimes mislead us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wanted to take this opportunity in my speech to remind the 
minister that, even if he is hiding behind statistical 
arguments—a lot of things can be proven with statistics—but in 
truth, he can cause hardship and move the CMHC away from its 
prime objective, which is to provide access to property, but not 
just any property, decent property. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also a danger in this bill, which I cannot let pass, 
and that is regulation. 
The bill says that the governor in council may make, amend, add 
or remove regulations at any time.  It does not say “by order”, 
meaning after consulting with parliament or cabinet.  In other 
words, without consulting anyone about government policy, the 
minister will now be able to publish regulations in Part II of 
the <I>Canada Gazette</I>, obviously in the interests of speed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I co-chaired the Standing Committee on the Scrutiny of 
Regulations, this was the argument used by departments.  They 
thumbed their noses at democracy as it were, but said it was in 
the interests of speed and efficiency.  There is no denying that 
democracy always costs a little bit more. 
It is easier not to have to be accountable, not to have to 
justify an action or a position, and to do as one pleases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But members of the public are already paying so much in taxes 
that, when all is said and done, they are entitled to a minimum 
of respect.  They are entitled to be informed that regulations 
will be amended, that the rules of the game will change and that 
things will be different.  In this case, however, regulations 
will not be published anywhere but in the <I>Canada Gazette</I>. 
Often, they will be published after they have taken effect. 
That is even worse, and often happens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I wish to applaud the efforts of the member for 
Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, and those of the New Democratic Party 
member for Bras d'Or—Cape Breton, who participated in the debate 
on this bill to try and make it more humane and sensitive to 
poverty, unlike the Reform Party members, who saw it as an 
opportunity to reward private enterprise, which is in 
competition with the CHMC, and as a good business opportunity.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta—South Richmond, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to contribute to the debate 
on Bill C-66, an act to amend the National Housing Act and the 
Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The general purpose of the bill appears to be to place the CMHC 
on a more commercial footing, particularly in terms of its 
mortgage insurance business.  That in itself is certainly a 
commendable objective but, as we will see, there are certain 
problems with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As with much that has gone on in the House during the current 
parliamentary session, the significance of the legislation will 
likely be noticed by few in the media or the public.  It so 
happens that the bill involves the most extensive changes in 
nearly 15 years, since 1985, to the National Housing Act and to 
the Canada Mortgage and Housing Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was in the 1980s, as pointed out by my hon. colleague from 
Kelowna during his speech on second reading, that CMHC accorded 
greater priority to social housing needs.  The position of the 
government is that these legislative changes are in keeping with 
the enhanced role of CMHC in facilitating home ownership, even 
though it is a crown corporation as an agent of government with 
respect to social housing concerns.  For example, the government 
has made CMHC a missionary to the homeless through adding $50 
million to the CMHC's home renovation program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some see a contradiction with the federal government bent on 
downloading responsibilities for social housing to the provinces 
at the same time as favouring an enhanced social role for CMHC. 
Others believe that the very existence of the CMHC illustrates an 
all too familiar pattern of federal government encroachment on 
areas of provincial jurisdiction, doing so either directly, under 
the guise of an issue being of national concern, or indirectly 
through the use of federal spending powers, in this case federal 
spending powers to facilitate home ownership with 5% down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to social housing the CMHC has played a pivotal role 
with respect to the expansion of co-operative housing.  It is 
through the CMHC that mortgage interest subsidies are provided to 
these housing co-operatives.  Some people argue that it is not 
equitable to provide mortgage interest subsidies based solely on 
the fact that a building is collectively owned by a non-profit 
corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The profit to those living collectively in a supposed non-profit 
context is the shield from interest rate fluctuations which CMHC 
provides.  In the longer term the profit to those living 
collectively is a mortgage free environment with the mortgage 
having been rapidly paid off due to taxpayer subsidies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People living in non-profit housing co-ops never acquire any 
equity in the property though they acquire equity in other ways, 
some argue, based on taxpayer generosity with respect to the 
co-op mortgages.  Some people question why several individuals 
cannot simply go to a financial institution and ask for financing 
through a collectively signed mortgage or by way of pooled funds 
and individual mortgages.  To what extent should people who wish 
to live collectively be treated any differently in terms of 
government housing assistance than those who purchase homes 
individually? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Much of the debate on the bill has so far concerned whether it 
is appropriate for the CMHC to be competing with other financial 
institutions and whether expanded quasi-privatization of the CMHC 
is of general economic benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding there is a significant co-operative housing 
component.  In addition, with respect to social housing, 
generally my hon. colleague from Kelowna mentioned during his 
second reading speech that as of 1992 an amendment to the British 
Columbia municipal act requires that municipalities include 
housing policies in their official community plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It may be said that in British Columbia social housing issues 
were being addressed far earlier than before they became 
politically fashionable in other provinces or even in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I note that pursuant to the bill CMHC will be able to provide 
interest rate relief.  However, such relief is regarded as only 
applicable to individual borrowers due to the competing 
provisions in the Interest Act.  Many people understand that they 
can generally get out of an onerous mortgage interest rate by 
paying a three month penalty.  These provisions are designed to 
protect consumers who may not appreciate interest rate 
fluctuations to the same extent as corporate borrowers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Corporate borrowers generally are stuck with the mortgage 
interest rates they initially agreed to.  This obviously causes 
problems with long term high interest rate debt in circumstances 
where, as now, mortgage interest rates have been low for quite 
some time.  One sector that is disadvantaged in this respect is 
the co-operative housing sector.  Many housing co-operatives are 
tied to high interest rate, long term mortgage obligations.

<A HREF="#LINKT33"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They would prefer to be able to pay an interest rate penalty and 
to refinance.  Their mortgage lenders would obviously prefer 
otherwise.  The taxpayer through CMHC would appear to end up 
paying a higher interest rate subsidy to housing co-operatives 
than would otherwise be the case if they could refinance their 
mortgages at current rates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the same way people choosing to live collectively perhaps 
should not be accorded greater government housing assistance than 
those who prefer to purchase housing individually.  People who 
choose to live collectively should not be treated any differently 
from individual purchasers in terms of mortgage prepayment 
privileges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My point is that whatever one thinks of financial institutions, 
housing co-operative borrowers are really no different from 
individual borrowers in terms of sophistication and social need. 
Therefore I want to use this opportunity to put on the 
<I>Hansard</I> record my concern that mortgage prepayment 
privileges be made available to housing co-operatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that the government has been lobbied on this issue but 
has yet to see fit to act.  Quite apart from this being the right 
direction to take, it cannot prejudice the government's 
relationship with the financial institution sector any more than 
the government has already managed to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another issue I would like to address has to do with an issue 
that was raised by Ms. Janice O'Brien, executive director of the 
B.C. Association of the Appraisal Institute of Canada, who noted: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These amendments are designed to allow Canada Mortgage and 
Housing Corporation—to operate in a commercial manner.  The 
Appraisal Institute's experience shows that they raise serious 
public policy issues. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In particular, the Appraisal Institute of Canada noted: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-66, amendments to the National Housing Act—is designed 
to allow Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation—to operate its 
mortgage insurance business “on a more commercial basis”. 
However, as long as CMHC is a crown corporation, parliament has 
responsibilities to act as a watchdog. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Appraisal Institute of Canada asks members of parliament to 
examine Bill C-66 to ensure that it doesn't provide CMHC with a 
licence to operate in a more commercial manner by compromising or 
sacrificing its responsibilities for public federal housing 
policy. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The concern is that we do not repeat the mistakes that were made 
in the U.S.  While CMHC moves away from appraisals, federal 
housing officials in the United States are strengthening 
appraisal requirements for all federal mortgage insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Computerized underwriting is not replacing appraisals.  Instead 
aggressive new consumer oriented standards are being prepared for 
all federal mortgage insurance appraisals.  U.S. appraisals would 
be required to provide more detailed disclosures to the consumer 
about the condition of an appraised property.  The U.S. 
experience by itself suggests the need to review CMHC's current 
practices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As with opposition to any legislation, the fact that parts of a 
bill are objected to and the bill voted against does not mean 
that one is opposed to the direction of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition supports the principle that Canadians 
should have access to affordable housing in order to acquire 
housing and recognizes the role that public mortgage insurance 
plays in supporting it.  However, in keeping with the general 
view of the official opposition that private sector options 
should be explored, it is suggested that greater private sector 
competition in the provision of mortgage insurance should be 
encouraged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the legislation does is further entrench government 
intervention in the housing market, an area of provincial and 
municipal jurisdiction.  The prejudicial impact on existing 
financial institutions is largely unknown. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For these reasons, among others, the official opposition will 
oppose the legislation in its current form but nonetheless remain 
pleased to have had an opportunity to place the concerns of 
Canada housing co-operatives, which I fully support, on the 
record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  It being 5.30 p.m.,

</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House,

</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>She said:  Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to rise in the House 
today to debate my private member's Motion No. 454.  I would like 
to spend a few minutes detailing why the issue is very important 
not just to my constituents but to people across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was first elected in the riding of Vancouver East in 
1997, the first event I attended, before I actually arrived in 
the House of Commons, was a very tragic community gathering in 
Oppenheimer Park.  The neighbourhood people, who were very 
concerned about the number of deaths from drug overdoses, had 
gathered to put up 1,000 crosses in the small park in the middle 
of this very low income community on the east side of downtown 
Vancouver.  The 1,000 crosses were put up to represent the very 
tragic lives and deaths of people who had died from drug 
overdoses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have the sad duty to report that in British Columbia the 
leading cause of death now for men and women between the ages of 
30 and 44 is actually from drug overdoses.  In fact, in 1998 the 
number of people who died from drug overdoses was 371, which is 
an astounding number when one thinks about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thought a lot about this issue and about what we needed to do 
to come to grips with a very serious health problem.  Our local 
Vancouver-Richmond Health Board was so concerned about the issue 
of HIV, AIDS and hepatitis C infection among injection drug users 
that in October 1997 it actually declared a state of health 
emergency in the community on the downtown east side.  This has 
caused me to bring the issue forward to the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I met with the Minister of Health on several occasions and have 
raised this previously in the House.  I wanted to bring this 
motion forward to draw attention to the tragedy of what takes 
place in too many communities in Canada where, because we have 
had an emphasis on the criminalization of illicit drug use, we 
have seen many people become further marginalized in society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose in bringing this motion forward today is to have a 
debate in the House of Commons on the importance of what is 
called a harm reduction approach when it comes to drugs.  The 
purpose of Motion No. 454 is to reduce the harm associated with 
obtaining drugs on the street.  The purpose of the motion is to 
look at how we can protect the community, reduce crime and also 
save lives because too many people are dying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In bringing forward this motion, I really wanted to make it 
clear that the motion simply states that a medical approach to 
heroin maintenance is one alternative that should be explored. 
The motion is clearly not about the legalization of drugs or 
heroin.  The motion does not encourage condoning heroin use.  It 
is aimed toward facilitating the research needed to implement an 
effective alternative regulated treatment option for heroin 
addicts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The research I have done has led me to the conclusion that we 
need to have health intervention.  We need to focus on harm 
reduction.  We need to have a medicalization of addiction that 
allows us as a society to say that the answer is not just to 
throw people in jail or to criminalize them.  We need to provide 
support, treatment, education and, in some instances, help to 
people who are facing a chronic addiction because treatment may 
have failed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are now learning from other models, particularly in Europe, 
where they have been very successful in enrolling volunteers, 
hard core addicts, who become part of a heroin maintenance 
program.  It is a very well controlled, scientific program which 
has actually reduced the amount of criminal activity taking 
place. 
It has actually reduced the amount of activity that takes place 
in terms of buying drugs on the black market.  It has improved 
peoples' health status.  In some cases, it has allowed people to 
go back to work, find jobs, be in better housing and basically 
put their lives together.

<A HREF="#LINKT36"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion is about opening up a debate and saying that our 
approach to illicit drug laws in the past has been based on views 
that do not make sense today.  If we are really serious about 
saving lives, protecting the community and reducing the crime 
that comes about as a result of obtaining drugs on the street, 
then we need this kind of medical intervention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that there is a growing number of health 
care professionals, people in the justice system and recently the 
Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police, who have been calling 
for the decriminalization of small amounts of illicit drugs, and 
for better treatment, better support and better education.  The 
list is growing of people who recognize that the approaches we 
have had in the past simply are not working. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to detail some of the support that is out there. 
The most notable one is the Canadian Medical Association.  At its 
board meeting last December 1998, it passed the following 
resolution: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CMA recommends to the federal Minister of Health that the 
investigation of prescription of heroin for opiate-dependent 
individuals follow the same approval protocol in practice for the 
use of any therapeutic drug in Canada; and that the CMA recommend 
that methadone maintenance and counselling programs be more 
widely available across the country with appropriate education 
and remuneration of professional delivering such programs.  This 
recommendation applies also to correctional institutions. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is from the Canadian Medical Association. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The former B.C. provincial health officer, Mr. Millar, in his 
1998 report “HIV, Hepatitis and Injection Drug Use in British 
Columbia—Pay Now or Pay Later”, also recommended that 
controlled legal availability of heroin, in a tightly controlled 
system of medical prescription, should be pilot tested as an 
option, as part of a comprehensive harm reduction program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997 there was a federally funded national task force on HIV, 
AIDS and injection drug use.  It included representatives from 
the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police, the Canadian Bar 
Association and the Canadian AIDS Society, among others.  The 
task force recommended a continuum of treatment options and also 
called on the federal government to conduct clinical trials of 
prescription morphine, heroin and cocaine as alternative 
approaches, such as is being done in other countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even a high ranking Health Canada official, Mr. Rowsell of the 
Bureau of Drug Surveillance of Health Canada, has been reported 
in the media as saying: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—an initiative to gather evidence looking at the benefits and 
risks of heroin maintenance will be helpful. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The list goes on.  We had a chief coroner's report in 1994 in 
B.C. that came to the same conclusion.  The Canadian Psychiatric 
Association has encouraged Health Canada and the government to 
look in this direction.  The Canadian Addiction Research 
Foundation is on the list. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Organizations around the world are beginning to recognize that 
this kind of approach is something that will produce an overall 
benefit, not just in terms of individual users who are leading 
very desperate lives and are very marginalized, but in terms of 
the benefit to the community and to society as a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a controversial issue.  I have had people come up to me 
and say “You are just talking about legalizing drugs”, or 
“This is something that we could not do”.  I believe that if 
the federal government and the Minister of Health were committed 
to working with some of these organizations, like the Canadian 
Medical Association, then we could set up the appropriate 
protocols that are actually being developed by the Canadian 
Addiction Research Foundation in consultation with other 
professionals and scientists. 
The protocols are now being developed, but it requires leadership 
from the health minister and from the Canadian government in 
co-operation with the provinces to say that this is a pilot 
program.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The notion of multi-centre clinical trials for a heroin 
maintenance program is something which we should set up as there 
would be a great benefit.  We can learn from other countries 
which have already done this.  We would not be carving out new 
ground. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Information from the Swiss program, for example, has told us 
that when nationwide heroin trials were implemented in 1994 
there was overwhelming support for the program.  Criminal 
offences and the number of criminal offenders dropped 60%.  The 
percentage of income from illegal and semi-legal activities fell 
from 69% to 10%.  Illegal heroin and cocaine use declined 
dramatically.  Stable employment increased from 14% to 32%.  The 
physical health of people dramatically improved and most 
participants greatly reduced their contact with the drug scene. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By making contact with people who are marginalized, who are 
living on the edge of society because we force them to do so by 
our laws, we can bring them into an appropriate model of health 
care, into an appropriate setting for social support, for housing 
and for counselling.  People can then begin to put together the 
pieces and make choices in their lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been very honoured in my riding to meet quite frequently 
with drug users.  Perhaps not many members of parliament have 
been able to do that.  These individuals have their own 
organization in the downtown east side called the Vancouver Area 
Network of Drug Users, or VANDU.  These people are trying to 
assert their own rights.  They are trying to find their own voice 
to tell those of us in positions of responsibility and authority 
that they matter.  Their lives matter.  Because they have such 
difficulty in accessing the health care system, many of them live 
in slum housing, inappropriate housing, and most of them do not 
have access to adequate and proper services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The injection drug users are calling on us to take responsible 
action.  They have done a huge amount of very important work in 
my community in bringing forward to our local health board and to 
other bodies the fact that they have rights and that, in many 
ways, the health care system has failed them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This issue generates a lot of debate.  It deals with our mindset 
around illicit drugs.  However, my interest is to bring forward 
the desperation and the urgency that exists, not just in my 
community in the downtown east side, but in many urban centres. 
People are dying on the streets from drug overdoses because they 
cannot get the help they need, the housing they need or the 
medical support they need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a responsibility to look at this issue seriously.  I 
encourage members of the House to be supportive of modernizing 
and updating Canada's drug laws.  I encourage members to promote 
harm reduction strategies.  I encourage members to continue that 
work and to impress upon the Minister of Health that we will 
support any initiative he takes to bring this forward.  The 
minister will have support from the medical community.  He will 
have support from the association of Canadian police chiefs and 
he will have support from the coroners who see the bodies that 
come in as a result of drug overdoses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There comes a time when we have to have the courage to stand and 
say that we have to have change, that what we have done in the 
past is not working, and that we need a new approach.

what happened in Switzerland.  Look at what happened in Europe. 
Look at our communities and see the people who are suffering and 
consider this motion as a way of bringing forward a program that 
will save lives, protect the community and deal with this very 
urgent health matter. 
<P><A NAME="LINK180"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Elinor Caplan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the devastation of heroin 
addiction is of great concern to the government.  We want to 
ensure the health and safety of all Canadians.  It is our goal to 
prevent and eliminate the suffering that heroin addiction causes 
to individuals, to their families and to their communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Heroin addiction, however, is not straightforward.  It is a 
serious and complex issue.  Accordingly, the treatment of this 
terrible addiction requires a thoughtful, considered and 
sophisticated approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion put forward by the hon. member for Vancouver East, 
while well intended, would make clinical trials of using heroin 
to treat heroin addiction a priority.  The success of such 
treatment is not well established and would not only be 
controversial, it would have uncertain outcomes.  Before any 
risky clinical trials are embarked upon, all alternative 
treatments of heroin addiction should be given thorough and due 
consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Simply put, I believe we need to walk before we run.  That is 
because a number of alternatives for the treatment of heroin 
addiction are already in existence and are proven to work.  I 
strongly believe that rather than chasing after risky treatments, 
our time, efforts and resources would be put to much better 
effect pursuing viable, well-established strategies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why Health Canada is a strong advocate of increasing 
access to existing successful treatments, in particular methadone 
maintenance, as well as supplementing medical treatment with 
counselling and social support programs.  Methadone maintenance 
is the most effective, proven and well established treatment for 
those who suffer heroin addiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under Canada's drug strategy, any treatment or rehabilitation 
program must address all underlying factors associated with 
substance abuse.  It must also meet the needs of drug users, many 
of whom unfortunately use more than one drug at a time.  Any 
treatment that is chosen should strive to meet the basic 
principles, and methadone maintenance does that.  Canada's drug 
strategy endorses its use to combat opioid dependence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While on methadone addicts are able to improve their lifestyles, 
social health, functioning and productivity.  Many are able to 
recover and continue with their lives, such as living with 
families, completing education or training and remaining 
employed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is Canada's stated priority to increase access to methadone 
maintenance.  To this end Health Canada has streamlined the 
authorization program and the authorization process, allowing 
doctors to treat patients quickly and more effectively.  The 
number of physicians using methadone in the treatment of their 
patients has also increased in this country.  Furthermore, the 
department has undertaken consultation with stakeholders to find 
ways of increasing access to methadone treatment programs, and we 
are continuing to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As mandated in Canada's drug strategy, Health Canada is 
continually working to improve the effectiveness of and the 
accessibility to an array of safe and proven substance abuse 
interventions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also true that methadone cannot help all of those who 
suffer from heroin addiction.  However, there are even more 
alternatives, with equal promise, to methadone that are already 
in existence.  I am speaking specifically of buprenorphine, levo- 
alpha-acetylmethadol, better known as LAAM, and naltrexone. 
These alternatives could bring greater flexibility in combating 
this terrible and costly epidemic, especially to those patients 
who do not tolerate or do not respond to methadone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clinical trials in other countries which were referred to by the 
member opposite, particularly in the United States and Australia, 
have shown these other medications to be safe and effective.  In 
addition, there is a ready, safe and secure supply of these other 
alternatives.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us also remember that medical treatment alone is not enough 
to fight drugs.  Canada's drug strategy states that we must 
consider the determinants of health and address the underlying 
factors associated with substance abuse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many addicts feel a sense of hopelessness and helplessness that 
is not solely attributable to their habits.  This is usually just 
a symptom of many of the larger issues they are dealing with, 
such as other health problems, poverty, lack of housing, poor 
education or a history of abuse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Governments need to devote significant resources and energies 
toward providing greater and earlier access to conventional 
addiction counselling and social support programs, professional 
psychotherapy, education, vocational training and residential 
care.  The delivery of these health services is the 
responsibility of the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government sympathizes with the many Canadians caught in 
the trap of heroin addiction.  We want to reduce the toll of this 
terrible affliction.  We want to reduce the toll that it takes on 
individuals and on all Canadians.  It is clear that the best and 
most effective route is to pursue existing treatments that are 
known to work.  As I have said, Health Canada wants to expand 
access to well-established and proven treatments like methadone, 
as well as giving a chance to the newer treatments which I 
mentioned, LAAM and others.  It is the course of action that we 
believe makes the most sense in terms of time, cost, resources, 
effectiveness and, most importantly, safety for the patient and 
for society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our goal is to prevent the harm this terrible addiction causes; 
the harm it causes to individuals, their families and our 
communities.  While the member's proposal is well intended, we do 
not believe it is supportable at this time. 
<P><A NAME="LINK181"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
Motion No. 454 states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should, in 
co-operation with the provinces, implement clinical, multi-centre 
heroin prescription trials for injection to opiate users, 
including protocols for rigorous scientific assessment and 
evaluation. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a complicated, tongue twisting motion that I am sure no 
one understands.  We are talking about free heroin for addicts. 
What the NDP is proposing is a recipe for disaster.  This is the 
kind of solution that was adopted in Switzerland.  Addicts from 
all across Europe went to Zurich to live with their addiction and 
it created a mess.  The same thing happened when Denmark tried 
the heroin trial solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is no secret that there is a terrible drug problem, in 
particular on the east side of Vancouver.  In fact the lower 
mainland of B.C. has the highest incidence of intravenous drug 
use in North America.  This drug abuse problem is extensive 
throughout the region and extends to Surrey, Burnaby, North Delta 
and other suburbs.  I have even seen videos demonstrating how 
easy it is for undercover police officers to purchase heroin. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no real government involvement in the solution to the 
problem.  By that I mean that there needs to be an integrated 
approach which includes the federal, provincial and municipal 
levels of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion tries to address problems associated with heroin 
addiction, including social and family problems, health and crime 
related issues and high cost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many Canadians ruin their lives with heroin use.  The problem 
extends much further in terms of people, the addicts.  We need to 
do something to help these people.  These people are our brothers 
and sisters, our children, our friends and neighbours who want to 
come home to recover.

<A HREF="#LINKT40"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to be compassionate, to deliver the health care remedy 
necessary to solve the problem.  When addicts finally try to 
recover and kick their bad habits, they try to return to the 
suburbs or quiet towns in and around the lower mainland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This problem needs a two pronged approach.  First, we need to 
deal with the problem of heroin entering Canada.  If we could 
stop the drug from coming into our country we could stop 
producing addicts.  I know our law enforcement agencies are 
trying to do the best they can with limited resources at their 
disposal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, we have to help the addicts.  They need medical help, 
all sorts of help.  We need to stabilize the addiction and then 
integrate them back into their families and home environment so 
that we help them return to the community where they can pursue a 
healthy life.  We need to support the addicts at every stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Far from freely giving out heroin to addicts, we need to have 
them voluntarily return to a stabile environment where they can 
begin a medical program that will lead to their recovery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The drug abuse problem affects all surrounding communities in 
the lower mainland including residents of Surrey Central.  I have 
been made aware of the success we have had dealing with heroin 
addiction by using methadone in heroin addiction treatment.  In 
Surrey we are leaders in dealing with heroin addiction.  The 
federal government has been of little assistance, not that there 
is any co-ordination between different levels of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our local medical community is on its own in struggling to save 
the program and the process.  According to my information there 
are physicians all across the United States who have come to our 
province to learn about how we use methadone to treat heroin 
addicts.  We teach these physicians what they need to know in 
order for them to return to their communities and establish 
methadone treatment programs within their own medical practices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>United States Drug Enforcement Agency members came to Vancouver 
to study our intravenous drug use problem.  They did not go to 
Chicago, New York or Los Angeles.  They came to Vancouver because 
the IDU problem is so large there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to have the government support our own efforts in this 
regard.  It is a well known fact in our health community that for 
every dollar spent fighting illicit drug use there is an $11 
saving to be realized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surrey Methadone Treatment Centre Ltd. and Renaissance 
Foundation have a successful program in Surrey which I visited 
last summer.  I can cite many examples after talking to patients. 
One of the patients I talked with said he had seen his daughter 
after 12 years.  Because he was a drug addict he never went to 
his family, community or home.  After receiving successful 
treatment his family visits him at the clinic.  Now he is looking 
forward to rejoining his family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another addict told me he used to snatch purses and steal to 
support his addiction but now after receiving this successful 
treatment he is relieved.  He is thankful to the organizers and 
owners of the clinic, those who offered him help.  That is what 
we need in the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the House should consider expanding this program, sending 
it across the nation and exporting our expertise to fight this 
problem around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not talking about legalization or decriminalization of 
drugs.  Let me make that clear.  The NDP would have us use the 
concept known as heroin trial that allows physicians to dole out 
heroin to addicts who are receiving treatment.  Support must be 
provided for the injection drug use addict who chooses recovery 
instead of active addiction. 
I have been assured that a heroin trial prescription program is 
the wrong way to go.  Furthermore, the methadone treatment has 
already been proven to be successful.  It is the one that has 
been drawing the medical community to British Columbia to learn 
about it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The free drug program on the other hand presents us with a 
defeatist attitude.  We are beaten before we start, so we give in 
and give away heroin to those addicts.  In my view this is not 
helping the addicts or the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government has a national drug strategy.  We know it 
does not work.  It is just full of Liberal rhetoric.  A reduction 
in the illicit drug problem, as we know, is a reduction in our 
crime problem and a reduction in the drain on our limited health 
system resources.  Therefore we must tackle the roots of the 
crime and not focus always on the punishment aspect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a society we continue to push for these kinds of changes, but 
the Liberal government on the other side does not listen.  The 
government has cut $23 billion in health care and education since 
it came to power.  One year ago today Canadians witnessed a very 
important vote in the House on a matter that can only be 
described as a tragedy.  The official opposition forced the House 
to vote on whether or not to compensate all victims of hepatitis 
C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the federal government that controlled the Canadian blood 
supply that infected about 60,000 Canadians.  Today, after a year 
of holding the minister's feet to the fire, he is willing to 
compensate only about 20,000 of the victims of tainted blood. In 
the last year 1,200 of these victims died while waiting for 
compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since my time is over I emphasize that the Liberal government 
lacks compassion and vision.  Still, the member introduces the 
motion we are debating today as if there were the remotest 
possibility that the government would listen to her and take 
action.  How sad.

<P><A NAME="LINK182"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
rise to speak on Motion M-454, introduced by the hon. member for 
Vancouver East. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of her motion is to make sensible and regulated 
treatment options available to health professionals and the 
injection drug users under their medical supervision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With Motion M-454, which calls for the implementation of clinical 
trials of prescription heroin, the hon. member for Vancouver 
East hopes to get parliamentarians to give serious thought to 
the extent of the drug addiction problem in Canada, with the 
ultimate goal of reducing street drug related crime, protecting 
the community, and saving lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As part of its national action plan submitted in May 1997, a 
expert task force on HIV/AIDS and drug issues gave a status 
report on the situation in Canada.  At present, Canada is 
experiencing a true public health crisis as far as HIV/AIDS and 
injection drug use is concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The age of those infected is constantly dropping; the average 
age of new HIV-positive people has gone from 32 years to 23. 
Since the penal system has not taken any remedial action, it has 
become one of the places the virus is being spread. The 
over-representation of aboriginal people among the groups at risk 
is of the greatest concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of this, there are several underlying principles against 
which the steps to be taken can be assessed.  There are several 
different approaches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past, the favoured approach in treating drug addiction 
was abstinence, or a total break with the substance being abused. 
While this approach is perfectly valid, more and more experts 
recognize that this is not always the best solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Abstinence, in the case of drug addiction, is not always a 
realistic objective achievable in the short term. It would be 
better, in the interest of public health, to consider other 
solutions.

<A HREF="#LINKT42"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the harm reduction approach.  This approach 
neither tolerates nor condemns the use of drugs.  In fact, it 
allows the user to continue to consume, but at the same time 
encourages the taking of various steps to reduce the harm of 
consuming.  This approach therefore does not rule abstinence out 
as the ultimate goal of an individual wanting it, but it takes a 
more progressive approach with the aim primarily of minimizing 
the negative effects of the use of drugs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Needle exchange and condom distribution services, instruction on 
safe injection methods and the provision of locations for 
injections are part of the harm reduction approach. More and 
more studies are concluding in its favour.  Motion M-451 is right 
in line with this thinking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Long term treatment with methadone is used for people with a 
heroin dependency of over 30 years.  With the emergence of the 
HIV epidemic among intravenous drug users, there is more 
interest in methadone or other opioid agonist treatment.  Long 
term treatment is associated with a reduction in risky behaviour 
associated with injection, a reduction in new cases of HIV 
infection in treated populations, reduced consumption of 
opiates, lower crime and death rates and rehabilitation in the 
community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Vancouver area, a health emergency has been declared 
because of an epidemic of HIV infections among intravenous drug 
users.  This health emergency affects all large urban centres in 
Canada, particularly those where drug use is on the increase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Faced with this situation, we must lay all possible options on 
the table.  We must also take a look at what is being done in 
other countries, such as Switzerland, Germany, England and the 
Netherlands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Swiss government decided to issue heroin prescriptions 
on a trial basis throughout the country in 1994, the social 
advantages of keeping people on heroin were amply demonstrated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The results were as follows: a 60% reduction in criminal 
offences; a 60% drop in revenue from illegal or semi-legal 
activities; a spectacular reduction in heroin and cocaine use; a 
14% to 32% increase in the number of participants holding down a 
steady job; a considerable increase in their physical health 
and, in most cases, a noticeable drop in links maintained with 
the drug world; no deaths attributable to overdoses and no 
prescription drug sold on the black market; a net economic 
benefit of $30 per patient, per day, largely because of the 
reduction in costs related to health care and the administration 
of the criminal justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot remain indifferent to human problems such as drug 
addiction and to its terrible repercussions, indeed to any human 
suffering. 
It is imperative that we open our minds to any possible 
solutions.  Sometimes, this will require thinking differently, 
exploring new avenues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what Motion M-454 does.  And for that, we must thank the 
member for Vancouver East, who has shown much determination and 
devotion to the cause of helping the most disadvantaged members 
of society.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I want to thank the member for Vancouver East for 
bringing this thought provoking issue to the House.  Reading from 
her backgrounder, I want to remind the House and the Canadian 
public as to why the member did this.  It is a problem all across 
the country but in her home province it is particularly bad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to go through some of the numbers which the member so 
thoughtfully provided us with.  She says that in her home riding 
of Vancouver East a health emergency has been declared as a 
result of an epidemic of HIV infection among injection drug 
users.  She also states that in British Columbia the death toll 
is staggering.  As of November last year a record 371 people died 
of overdose in 1998 alone, 195 in the Vancouver area. Those are 
compelling statistics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Overdose from intravenous drug use has become the leading cause 
of death for adults in the age range of 30 to 49 years in the 
province of British Columbia.  Over and above that, the leading 
cause of HIV infection is now IDU.  It is estimated there are 
15,000 regular or frequent injection drug users in the province 
of British Columbia alone, the member's home province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is estimated that one-quarter of injection drug users are HIV 
positive and at most 88% have hepatitis C.  She also states that 
HIV infected drug users are showing up in larger numbers in the 
Kamloops and Kootenay regions.  She goes through some of the 
numbers in Toronto, Montreal, Winnipeg and other Canadian cities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are pretty grim statistics. We have to admire the member 
for wanting to do something about it.  I know the issue is 
somewhat controversial.  Some members on both sides of the House 
have said there are other examples in other countries and 
jurisdictions and what has been done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, the intent of the motion is to implement clinical, 
multi-centre heroin prescription trials and hence the 
controversy.  It is not an easy thing to deal with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at what the Canadian Medical Association has to say 
about it.  I am quoting from a document sent to me today: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CMA recommends to the federal Minister of Health that the 
investigation of prescription of heroin for opiate-dependent 
individuals follow the same approval protocol in practice for the 
use of any therapeutic drug in Canada; and that the CMA recommend 
that methadone maintenance and counselling programs be more 
widely available across the country with appropriate education 
and remuneration of professional delivering such programs.  This 
recommendation applies also to correctional institutions. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CMA has laid out quite clearly what it thinks of the issue 
and the proposal before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have done some research on this.  I came across what they call 
rapid opiate detoxification.  It is something that could be 
considered in this case.  It is a cleansing therapy that curbs 
heroin addiction.  It is somewhat new and exciting in the 
treatment of this addiction.  It is a treatment widely used 
throughout the world, but this sophisticated medical procedure 
has just arrived in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thanks go to a couple of individuals, Peter Garber and Mike 
Greenberg.  They tell us it is based on the work of psychiatrists 
Dr. Karl Loimer and Dr. Colin Brewer who in the late 1980s 
discovered that two drugs, naloxone and naltrexone, suppressed 
the addict's desire for heroin and other drugs such as methadone. 
The treatment does not purport to be a cure for heroin addiction 
but offers an essential and powerful first step toward achieving 
that objective.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They step through how this procedure works and talk about 
reducing withdrawal in five ways. First the process is 
accelerated so what used to take the body weeks to achieve on its 
own is now done in about six hours. Second, the body does not 
crave the missing narcotic because it is replaced by another 
substance.  Third, the entire treatment is performed under 
anesthesia so the patient is unconscious and unaware.  Fourth, 
unlike most programs, a physician and a nurse attend the patient 
as the anesthetic wears off.  Fifth, short term symptomatic 
treatment is prescribed to alleviate any mild withdrawal symptoms 
which may occur in the following couple of days. We are talking 
about a detoxification system with some amazing results.

Let us go through some of these numbers again. A study done in 
Toronto says “Deaths from heroin overdose have risen in certain 
cities, they are also related to HIV infection in some cases. The 
social cost exceeds millions of dollars, more going to drug 
enforcement”—and this is an important point—“than to drug 
treatment”.  That is an important thing to consider. It is 
estimated that some $40,000 per year is spent for every untreated 
user. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are going back to some of these new and exciting 
detoxification programs that have recently appeared. The question 
is what is the cost and can we afford it?  Considering the number 
of deaths, we cannot afford to sit back and do nothing.  I am not 
sure we can sit back and rely on the old methods of treating 
addiction. We have to examine anything that comes along which 
might deal with this in an effective way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The U.S. drugs are criticized in some of these programs but this 
is not unusual.  We can look at some of the other countries 
involved.  Australia has some major concerns as well.  I guess we 
could take some satisfaction with some of the stats coming out of 
The Netherlands.  Listening to some of the other experts, we 
wonder whether or not they are accurate and whether or not they 
are effective.  It depends on who the listener is, who the 
recipient is and whether or not they are interpreting some of 
those statistics in the same way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a big problem and one we want to see some progress on. The 
latest procedure which I talked about has to be examined in the 
context of what has been used in the past. Remember that when 
heroin first appeared on the scene it was supposed to be the drug 
that was going to relieve morphine addiction.  Look at what is 
happening with methadone which is an addiction of its own.  It is 
a substitute for another addiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the jury is still out.  But I think the consensus of 
this House is that this motion has to be examined very carefully 
by the Minister of Health.  We have to encourage more thought 
provoking motions like this one and consider all options in the 
treatment of a very serious situation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to thank the members who participated in this debate, 
in particular the member from the Bloc Quebecois and the member 
from the Conservative Party for their very thoughtful comments. 
That is what this discussion was about, to talk about this very 
serious issue and to examine what options and possibilities there 
are for dealing with the very very serious situation of chronic 
injection drug users who may be using heroin or cocaine or a 
combination of drugs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was disappointing to hear the response from the government 
member.  To me this debate is about saying we must have a variety 
of options available.  I would certainly agree with the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Health that methadone 
must be improved, it must be expanded.  There have been calls for 
that in all the reports I have read and I would certainly agree 
with that.  Indeed the other options she mentioned need to be 
brought forward and put on the table as real possibilities that 
can be used. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My concern is that we not rule out what has been shown to be 
successful in other countries in terms of a heroin maintenance 
program that can be viable and beneficial in circumstances where 
individuals have not been able to get successful treatment using 
other options. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To characterize the heroin maintenance program in Switzerland or 
anywhere else as something that is not well established or that 
is very risky, I would encourage the member to look at some of 
the material that is available from the very credible 
organizations that have been monitoring the Swiss program.  The 
evidence shows very clearly that we are not talking about risky 
situations but about a program that actually produced very 
amazing results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To the member from the Reform Party, it is very disappointing 
that this would be characterized as the NDP wanting to give out 
free heroin to addicts.  Morphine is also a controlled substance. 
We recognize that it has a legitimate use within our medical 
system.  Nobody here is advocating handing out heroin all over 
the place to whoever wants it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion talks about setting up a very tightly controlled 
scientific and medically supervised pilot program in which we can 
enrol people and make contact with people who otherwise are 
totally marginalized and seem to be outside of our health care 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To characterize a very complex health issue by throwing it away 
and saying that it is about free drugs really does not do service 
to the complexity and the compassion we need to show for people 
who are really suffering out there.  I was very disappointed to 
hear the remarks from the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard other members from the Reform Party say they have 
been to Vancouver's downtown east side in my constituency of 
Vancouver East and they are very horrified at what they have seen 
on the streets.  If that is the case, I would encourage them to 
look at this seriously and to seek out information from the 
Canadian Medical Association, the Canadian Addiction Research 
Foundation, the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police, 
coroners offices, and the list goes on and on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion was brought forward to bring about a debate, to 
bring about understanding, to encourage the government not to 
close the door on this matter.  It has had a lot of discussion 
within the health care community and the justice community.  This 
is something that should be taken note of and examined further. 
We should be working with the medical community to look at the 
protocols that would be necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From what I have been able to read in articles, even officials 
from Health Canada believe there is a place to have this kind of 
program set up. I would encourage the government not to reject 
this outright as being too controversial and risky but to look at 
it as an option, as part of a comprehensive harm reduction 
strategy for dealing with illegal drug use.

<P><A NAME="LINK187"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, if the 
government were an individual Canadian, it would have been forced 
into bankruptcy long ago.  If the government were a small 
business, the shop would have been boarded up for some time now. 
The government sees fit to waste taxpayer money with seemingly 
little regard and with even less respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On February 16, 1999, I challenged the Minister of National 
Defence on the issue of Canada's submarine purchase.  The price 
the government has led the Canadian taxpayer to believe it will 
spend on our new submarines is $750 million, but it appears the 
actual cost could be closer to $2 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine a Canadian small business underestimating its cost by 
over two and one-half times the original estimate when it 
budgeted for new equipment.  No respectable business could stand 
such gross financial mismanagement time and time again.  However, 
that is exactly how the government treats its own books and how 
it treats taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish the only problem with this deal was the cost, but the big 
picture is even worse.  The Liberal government's priorities are 
so far out of whack it is hard to conceive how it must have gone 
about making decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me ask why we are buying four used submarines and how this 
decision fits into the role our forces will play early in the 
21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two of the suggested roles, drug surveillance and fisheries 
patrol, are clearly dubious at best.  Does the government really 
think that increased submarine capability would have stopped the 
turbot war?  The proposed third reason for protecting our 
sovereignty under the ice cap would require an incredibly 
expensive refit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the cost of technical data and crew training?  What 
about the cost of infrastructure refit and development to be able 
to house the submarines?  What about the need, as I have 
mentioned, to refit them with air independent propulsion so they 
can work under the ice without frequent resurfacing? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, what will we do when these submarines break down? 
The production line for these submarines has ended and to get 
parts must we then cannibalize one of the four submarines we are 
purchasing?  What about the cost of changing the communication 
suites to be compatible with the Auroras and helicopters? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will detail my estimates and I trust the government will 
choose to do the same in its response:  acquisition costs of $800 
million; shore facilities and modification, $200 million; routine 
refits over the life of the program, $1 billion; and air 
independent propulsion system, $1 billion.  This totals $3 
billion and if we add 30 years of operating costs at 
approximately $2.7 billion, the grand total is $5.7 billion or 
over seven times the cost to the taxpayer that the government is 
touting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the big picture itself?  The government needs to 
answer a question to the people of my riding of Halifax West, to 
Nova Scotians and to all other Canadians.  How does this 
expenditure stand up against the need for adequate pay and 
housing conditions for Canadian forces personnel so desperately 
needed and so terribly missing?  It is true there has been some 
money infused as a result of the recent report of a committee, 
but yet there is a long way to go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does this stand up against the need for immediate attention 
to finding a substitute for the flying accidents waiting to 
happen or the Sea Kings and Labrador helicopters?  People deserve 
an answer and they are waiting. 
<P><A NAME="LINK188"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Elinor Caplan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the cost of acquiring the four 
upholder class submarines and putting them into active service in 
Canada is still $750 million in the year of 1998-99. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In April 1998 the government approved the acquisition based on 
this figure and nothing has changed except the names of the 
vessels.  It was announced on March 30 that the vessels would be 
known as the Victoria class submarines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first Victoria class submarine is due to arrive in Canada in 
the autumn of 2000 and the navy is already preparing for this. 
Even as we prepare to take possession of the submarines we have 
already started to plan for the future, precisely because we 
expect these boats will have a long life in the Canadian navy.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As with any piece of equipment there will be maintenance and 
upgrade projects involved throughout the life of the vessel.  It 
is unreasonable to think that one can buy any piece of equipment 
and keep it operating for 30 years without maintenance and 
upgrades. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, the Victorias will require a mid-life refit to 
ensure that they meet their expected lifespan.  We will also have 
to keep maintaining all the safety and rescue equipment so that 
it will be compatible with the newest technology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, as new technologies come available that would 
require enhanced operational capabilities of the submarines, they 
will need to be integrated into existing systems whenever 
possible.  It would be unfair and irresponsible to add the costs 
of such eventual projects to the cost of acquisition because at 
this point we cannot predict the timing, the cost or the nature 
of any future projects with 100% accuracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the time comes for any new expenditures I can assure the 
hon. member that these projects will be subject to the necessary 
government approval before they can proceed.  Planning for the 
future is the responsible thing to do and it is particularly 
important in times of tight fiscal restraint.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Sue Barnes (London West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, a 
growing number of children are directly involved in armed 
conflict as deliberate targets and as child soldiers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The record of the past decade is grim.  Close to two million 
children have been killed in armed conflict; more than four 
million children disabled; over one million children orphaned; 
over 300,000 girls and boys serving in armies and rebel groups as 
fighters, cooks, porters, messengers, spies and labourers; 12 
million children homeless; and over 10 million children 
psychologically scarred by the trauma of abduction, detention, 
sexual assault and witnessing the brutal murder of family 
members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The situation of children in armed conflict is worse today than 
it was 50 years ago when the Declaration of Universal Human 
Rights was signed.  Today 90% of the casualties of war are 
civilian, mostly women and children, whereas it was only 48% in 
the second world war and 5% in the first world war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Children usually become soldiers through coercion, either 
through mandatory conscription or forced recruitment.  Child 
soldiers overwhelmingly are recruited from the poorest and most 
marginalized sectors of society.  Particularly vulnerable are 
children without families or with disrupted family backgrounds. 
Coercion aside, children may join the military for security, food 
or medical care.  The military may offer children the only path 
to wages to support themselves or their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The use of children in armed conflict is global in nature.  It 
is a far greater problem than suggested by the scant attention it 
has received.  The use of child soldiers violates international 
norms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, signed in 1989 and 
ratified by all but two nations, establishes 15 years as the 
minimum recruitment age.  In fact, most countries have endorsed 
an optional protocol that boosts the minimum combat age to 18 
years.  However, in the face of armed conflict, military units in 
some nations, whether governmental or rebel, often pay little 
attention to age. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>International silence about the abuse of children must change. 
The welfare of the world's children merits special priority in 
Canada's human security agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Children are the most vulnerable group.  The experience of 
children during their early years affects them for life.  It will 
affect their families as well as their own future.  We simply 
cannot afford to let the current situation continue if we value 
our own future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In February the Minister of Foreign Affairs addressed the UN 
security council on the impact of conflict on civilians.  He 
outlined Canada's approach to this very serious issue.  In light 
of this, could the Minister of Foreign Affairs highlight what 
Canada is doing to protect civilians in armed conflict and in 
particular children?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Elinor Caplan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of

behalf of the Minister of Foreign Affairs I would like to 
acknowledge the important contribution that the member for London 
West has made to the issue of child soldiers.  She really has 
made a difference in advancing the cause of human safety and 
security when it comes to the lives that those children will 
have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that on February 12 the Minister of Foreign Affairs 
travelled to New York to preside over a special meeting of the 
security council sponsored by Canada on the issue of protection 
of civilians in conflict.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a recent innovation of the council to hold its meetings on 
a thematic focus.  This enables the security council to consider 
cross-cutting security issues in a broader, more integrated 
context than its usual crisis mode of interaction.  We support 
this practice which also permits the council to hear from outside 
non-state sources, for example the International Committee of the 
Red Cross. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This initiative is a key element of Canada's security council 
human security agenda which we hope to advance during our two 
year council term.  At issue is the rising toll of modern 
conflict on civilians, particularly vulnerable groups such as 
women and children who are not only victimized by new forms of 
aggression but are often directly targeted, as the hon. member 
who has worked so hard on this difficult issue has noticed, and 
used as child soldiers, which is a very serious issue.  Our goal 
is to explore new ways for the security council and the 
international community to address this pressing human safety 
concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Foreign Affairs delivered Canada's statement on 
this theme and reiterated to council members that the ultimate 
aim of the council's work was to safeguard the security of the 
world's people, not just the states in which they live.  Clearly, 
with the disproportionate toll modern conflict takes on 
civilians, the protection of individuals should be a primary 
consideration in the council's activities.  The minister called 
on the council to meet its responsibilities and to face the 
challenges of this issue head on.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The recent auditor general's report on the failed DFO management 
policies when it comes to the shellfish industry in Atlantic 
Canada, Quebec and Nunavut is one of the most damning reports 
ever on the policies of the Department of Fisheries and Oceans. 
The auditor general did great work.  We in this party want to 
thank him very much for raising the red flag. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1992 devastation hit Newfoundland and many other parts of 
Atlantic Canada in terms of the groundfish collapse which has now 
been proven to be solely the responsibility of the Department of 
Fisheries and Oceans.  Two levels of government mismanaged that 
fishery to the death knell of many people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately the auditor general says the exact same management 
policies that happened in the cod fish crisis is now happening in 
the shellfish industry.  We just cannot allow this to happen.  In 
committee report after committee report the facts are clear.  We 
have studied this issue to death.  The DFO cannot properly manage 
the shellfish industry of Atlantic Canada.  It does not have the 
resources.  It does not have the scientific people to do the job. 
It certainly does not allocate any money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the lobster industry is a $500 million industry in 
Atlantic Canada.  It spent $330,000 a year on research.  That is 
all it spent on this most important and crucial industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The DFO allowed the dragging of a brood stock of scallops in the 
Bay of Fundy.  That was a nursery, for God's sake.  It actually 
allowed a dragger to go through the Bay of Fundy and destroy an 
entire scallop industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general also pointed out that we have little or no 
at sea observer coverage on board ships within our own 200 mile 
limit.  It even ignores the observer reports it gets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997 the Minister of Veterans Affairs who was then the 
minister of fisheries and oceans ignored the North Atlantic 
Fisheries Organization's scientific advice.  We got this 
information from court transcripts of the Federal Court in 
Vancouver.  He ignored the advice of the Nunavut wildlife branch. 
He ignored the advice of the fisheries resource conservation 
council.  Most important, he ignored the advice of his own deputy 
minister and opened up the turbot fishery two months prior to the 
federal election.  Those are the facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now the auditor general has pointed out that the current 
minister ignores advice from his own department and ignores the 
advice from observer reports.  We can only come to the conclusion 
that it is based on political favouritism.  It is not issuing 
quotas or licences, for example, on sound biological or 
scientific evidence.  What it is doing is basing it on political 
favouritism. 
It is the same thing that the Liberal government accused the 
Conservative government of doing.

general has raised the red flag, has put up a precautionary note, 
and has given sound advice to the Minister of Fisheries and

there are effective monitoring programs in place.  Fisheries 
enforcement is a priority for the Department of Fisheries and 
Oceans and every effort was made to protect the enforcement 
program from budget reductions.  A number of steps have been 
taken to improve enforcement effectiveness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under a national recruitment strategy over 100 new fishery 
officers have been hired in the last three years.  Physical 
fitness and competency standards have been developed for fishery 
officers along with new training courses, including one on 
forensic auditing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Operating budgets have been increased and new surveillance 
equipment, computers and patrol boats have been purchased to 
augment program effectiveness.  In addition, the department is 
reviewing the mix of enforcement resources and examining ways to 
better utilize data collected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Major improvements are being made to dockside monitoring 
programs in 1999.  Dockside monitoring companies will be required 
to meet standards set by DFO and will be subject to checks and 
audits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The at sea observer program will also undergo a major review in 
1999 which will include the development of criteria for setting 
observer coverage levels.  We have learned from the groundfish 
collapse and we are determined not to repeat the mistakes of the 
past.  Conservation of the resources is the department's first 
and foremost priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Shellfish resources have been healthy and abundant in the 1990s. 
It is important to note that every shellfish fishery is managed 
through specific conservation measures such as minimum size, 
quotas, specific fishing areas and a limited number of licences. 
DFO's decisions on shellfish allocation are based on established 
criteria with conservation being the first priority.  Where 
temporary sharing of abundant shellfish resources is authorized, 
it is done in such a manner that it ensures harvesting capacity 
does not increase on a permanent basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general has recommended that the department should 
clearly define its policies.  I am happy to tell the member and
