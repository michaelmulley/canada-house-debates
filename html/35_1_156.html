	<B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Kingsway, NDP)</B> 
moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should condemn in the 
strongest possible terms the inhumane embargo of Cuba by the United States; 
that the condemnation be made at the United Nations, the Organization of 
American States and directly to the U.S. administration; and, that Canada 
restore full bilateral aid and trade with Cuba.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I welcome the opportunity today to 
raise in the House an issue of fundamental importance to the 
relationship between the people of Canada, the people of Cuba 
and, in particular as my motion points out, to the impact on the 
people of Cuba of the blockade by the United States.
<P>
	The motion before the House this morning has three 
components basically. First, it calls on the Government of 
Canada to condemn in the strongest possible terms the inhumane 
embargo of Cuba by the United States. It calls for that 
condemnation to be made at all possible opportunities, both 
bilateral and multilateral; at the United Nations, the 
Organization of American States and directly to the United 
States administration. Finally, the motion calls on Canada to 
restore full bilateral aid and trade. There is trade now but we 
should promote, strengthen and support that trade with Cuba.
<P>
	This is a significant time in the relationship between Canada 
and Cuba. In fact, 1995 is the 50th anniversary of the 
establishment of diplomatic relations between Canada and 
Cuba. Those diplomatic relations have remained unbroken since 
1945, a fact of which I as a Canadian am very proud. Canada was 
one of only two countries, the other being Mexico, that did not 
break diplomatic relations with Cuba following the triumph of 
the revolution in 1959. We celebrate that this year. In fact, there 
will be a number of celebrations, both in Canada and in Cuba 
next month.
<P>
<B>(1105) </B>
<P>
	As well, 1995 is the centenary of the death of the great Cuban 
revolutionary hero, José Marti, who died on May 19, 1885.
<P>
	This is also an important week for this motion to be debated in 
the House. Today the Secretary General of the OAS, the 
Organization of American States, Mr. Gavaria, is in Canada. 
Later this week the President of the United States, President Bill 
Clinton, will be visiting as well. I trust that the government will 
take the opportunity, in particular the Prime Minister, to raise 
directly with President Clinton the destructive impact of the 
United States blockade on Cuba. I hope that he will take that 
opportunity this week.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I also regret that the Bloc Quebecois will apparently not 
support this motion. Frankly, I find it surprising that the Bloc 
Quebecois, although several Bloc members are taking an active 
role in the Canadian parliamentary group on Cuba, will speak 
against a motion to lift the embargo against Cuba, to promote 
free trade and bilateral aid for Cuba. I can only presume that 
once again the Bloc Quebecois took this surprising position 
because of the priority it gives to relations with the United 
States.
<P>
	The Bloc supported cruise missile testing; the Bloc supported 
the free trade agreement; the Bloc now supports the United 
States' immoral and illegal embargo. This is unbelievable and 
unacceptable, especially because many groups in Quebec, for 
example Carrefour culturel de l'amitié Québec-Cuba and 
Oxfam Québec, are demanding, like other Canadians, that the 
inhumane and cruel embargo against Cuba be lifted and that the 
Liberal government put this issue high on the list of items on the 
agenda for the upcoming meeting with the American president.
<P>
	Once again, the Bloc Quebecois does not speak for Quebecers 
on this fundamental humanitarian issue of rights for Cubans. It 
is a pity that we have had to do this in their stead.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I would note as well that at a major international solidarity 
meeting last November in Havana, 1995 was declared the 
international year of José Marti and the struggle against the 
blockade. This is a motion which is of particular significance in 
this important year.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9792"> 9792 </A></B>
<P>
	Last month I had the honour of participating in the first ever 
Canadian parliamentary delegation which was hosted by the 
National Assembly of Cuba. I see a number of my colleagues 
from all sides of the House who participated in that delegation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Unfortunately the hon. member for Laval East was not able to 
take part, but she supported us. She supported the requests, as 
did many other Bloc Quebecois members. The member for 
Bourassa, for one, would be surprised to see the position taken 
by the Bloc today.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We met with many groups. We met with Cuban organizations, 
with individuals and with ministers. We had the opportunity to 
meet with Fidel Castro. We visited schools, hospitals and 
research centres. Our group was hosted on this historic visit by 
the president of the corresponding group in Cuba, the Minister 
of Education, Luis Gomes. During that same time frame, a large 
number of NGOs were visiting Cuba under the auspices of the 
Cuba-Canada Inter-Agency Project made up of some 36 
Canadian NGOs and churches and 25 community based 
organizations.
<P>
<B>(1110) </B>
<P>
	These NGOs have played an extraordinary role in helping to 
promote greater understanding, awareness, and solidarity with 
the people of Cuba. They include groups such as Oxfam Canada, 
the Saskatchewan Council for International Co-operation, 
CUSO, the United Church of Canada and the Anglican Church of 
Canada, as well as many groups based in Quebec.
<P>
	I want to take this opportunity in speaking of NGOs to also 
pay tribute to the many Canadian NGOs, churches, groups and 
individuals who have demonstrated their solidarity with the 
people of Cuba at this very difficult time for that country. Last 
August a group from across Canada, the brigadistas, travelled to 
Cuba to demonstrate their solidarity by working directly with 
the people of Cuba. The friendship groups assist in helping to 
provide desperately needed aid, particularly humanitarian aid, 
to the people of Cuba.
<P>
	Many different elements of the labour movement have 
demonstrated concrete solidarity. I salute here the recent 
leadership of the Canadian Labour Congress on this issue, the 
Canadian-Cuban Friendship Association in British Columbia, 
in my own area, and many others. All of these groups, without 
exception, have called on the United States government to lift 
the illegal and immoral blockade which has been in force since 
1963.
<P>
	At the most recent vote of the United Nations, 101 countries 
voted in favour of the lifting of the blockade and only two, the 
United States and Israel, opposed the resolution. Instead of 
responding to this appeal from around the world, what is the 
response of the leaders of the United States congress? The new 
chair of the Senate foreign relations committee, Jesse Helms, 
says he wants  to strengthen the blockade. That is absolutely 
unbelievable. He wants to effectively put an iron noose around 
Cuba. The test will come with the response of the United States 
president.
<P>
	It is time for President Clinton to stop listening to the right 
wing reactionary forces based in Miami, the Cuban American 
National Foundation, the Mas Canosas, and start listening to the 
progressive voices of the American people, including a number 
of Cuban Americans. It is time he started listening to the voices 
of his closest neighbours, the Canadian government and the 
Mexican government, that have called for a lifting of this 
blockade.
<P>
	It is time he started listening to some of his own legislators, 
democratic senators, members of the House of Representatives, 
like Claiborne Pell, Charles Rangel, José Seranno and others. 
Even the <I>Wall Street Journal</I> is calling on the United States 
administration to lift the embargo.
<P>
	The impact of the blockade has been devastating. Together 
with the collapse of trade with Russia and eastern Europe, and 
some admitted inefficiencies in the Cuban economy, the impact 
has been devastating. Dr. Benjamin Spock, when he visited 
Cuba in 1993, wrote on his return: ``When I visited Cuba I 
discovered pediatricians at otherwise splendid hospitals who 
spent every morning counting medication for the children. The 
director of a day care centre dreaded that the milk supply would 
dry up for her preschoolers, as it has for all Cuban children older 
than seven. How should we feel about an embargo that is 
keeping food and medicines from Cuban children?'' I feel 
ashamed.
<P>
	There are widespread hardships as a result of the embargo. 
One of the ironies is that these hardships even affect the 
American people. My colleagues and I visited a research facility 
in Havana which makes drugs that assist in traumatic heart 
attacks. These drugs, called recombinant streptokinase, would 
save American lives. Are Americans allowed access to them 
under the blockade? No. It is the same with a vaccine against 
meningitis B developed in Cuba. It cannot be distributed so it is 
hurting the United States as well.
<P>
<B>(1115) </B>
<P>
	In the midst of all the hardship as a result of the blockade, the 
Cuban government and the Cuban people have maintained a 
commitment to fundamental human and socialist values. For 
example, infant mortality rates in Cuba are the lowest in Latin 
America. They are lower than in many American cities. 
According to the most recent UNICEF figures it is about 9.9 per 
cent, one of the best records in the world. It is sort of ironic that 
the United States lectures Cuba on human rights.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9793"> 9793 </A></B>
<P>
	Yes, we acknowledge there are concerns around human rights 
particularly in the areas of freedom of speech and freedom of 
association. There are concerns with respect to the treatment of 
gays and lesbians in Cuba. The situation is better but the history 
in that country is certainly not a happy one.
<P>
	For the United States to lecture Cuba on human rights when it 
has a record of child poverty, of homelessness, of 37 million 
Americans with no health insurance whatsoever and of people 
with AIDS begging for funds to survive in the streets with 
unprecedented levels of crime, reeks of hypocrisy. It is not good 
enough. When they raise concerns around human rights in Cuba 
and are silent with respect to massive human rights violations in 
Guatemala, East Timor and elsewhere, it is not good enough.
<P>
	In the midst of some of the most difficult economic times in 
the history of Cuba, Cuba is able to maintain its international 
solidarity. Over 13,000 children victims of the 1986 disaster at 
Chernobyl were assisted by the Government of Cuba. I 
personally saw a number of these children at a rehabilitation 
facility at Tarara just outside Havanah. This speaks probably 
more eloquently than anything else to the sense of international 
solidarity of the people of Cuba. Even at a time of difficult 
economic circumstances they are prepared to extend a hand to 
the poorest, to the most vulnerable in our communities.
<P>
	Canada has an opportunity to play an important bridging role 
at this time to promote direct dialogue at last between the 
Government of Cuba and the Government of the United States. 
If the Government of the United States can maintain most 
favoured nation status with China, if it can end its embargo 
against Vietnam, if it can begin negotiations with North Korea, 
why this absurd and destructive obsession with Cuba?
<P>
	What can we do? In the couple of minutes remaining I want to 
set out some alternatives. Canada can play an important role by 
extending and strengthening trade. I commend the Canadian 
ambassador to Cuba, Mark Entwistle, for the leadership and 
energy he has shown on this front.
<P>
	We can strengthen EDC financing. We can ensure that we 
meet the kinds of standards other countries have set. We can 
promote support for environmental projects. Cuba has the 
opportunity to be an international environmental leader. Dr. 
Patricia Lane in particular from Dalhousie University has shown 
leadership in this regard. For example, they are trying to clean 
up some of the pollution in the Almendares River and others. 
This is the kind of role that Canada can play and play effectively.
<P>
	We can promote strengthening bilateral aid and moving it 
beyond partnership and establishing a central co-ordination 
point within the foreign affairs ministry for responding to Cuba.
<P>
	Perhaps one of the key components or priority in the trade 
area is negotiating now a foreign investment  protection 
agreement. Other countries are far ahead of Canada in this 
regard. Spain, Mexico, Italy, Russia and the United Kingdom 
have already negotiated agreements. We have heard one 
message loud and clear from Canadian businesses. It is to get 
that in place. We have heard the same message from our 
diplomats. I hope the government will move soon on that.
<P>
	Finally, we should ensure that Cuba is fully reintegrated into 
all multilateral organizations: the OAS, the World Bank and the 
IMF. It was shameful that Cuba was excluded from the Miami 
summit. I was pleased the Prime Minister spoke out against that.
<P>
<B>(1120 ) </B>
<P>
	In closing, I hope we as Canadians take advantage of this key 
year, the 50th anniversary of diplomatic relations between 
Canada and Cuba, to send a strong message to our friends in the 
American administration that it is time to end the illegal and 
immoral blockade.
<P>
	We will be hosting the foreign minister in the near future, 
Roberto Robaino. We will be hosting the president of the 
National Assembly, Ricardo Alarcon, and hopefully Minister of 
Education Gomes as well. I hope our Minister for International 
Trade will be travelling soon to Cuba.
<P>
	Canada has a historic opportunity here. I urge the House to 
join in sending a message today to the American administration 
and to our government that the time has come to lift the 
blockade, to respect the strong, proud and dignified people of 
Cuba and to reintegrate them fully into the community of 
nations.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jesse Flis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak to 
the motion introduced by the hon. member for 
Burnaby-Kingsway regarding the United States embargo on 
Cuba and Canadian policy.
<P>
	His motion reads at the end:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-and, that Canada restore full bilateral aid and trade with Cuba.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I do not know where the hon. member has been over the last 10 
or 20 years. We have full bilateral trade with Cuba that I 
witnessed personally and will mention later.
<P>
	I believe Canada and the United States share similar long term 
goals in Cuba, including the need for peaceful political and 
economic reform that will allow more liberal economic policies, 
the development of democratic institutions and full respect for 
human rights. However Canada has clear reservations about how 
the United States policy seeks to achieve these goals. I will 
explain what I mean in a moment.
<P>
	Let me begin by pointing out that Canada and Cuba have had 
an official relationship stretching, as the hon. member said, over 
50 years. Even at times when we had considerable differences of 
view with Cuba on Africa, east-west relations, the nature of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9794"> 9794 </A></B>
<P>
political change in Latin America and more recently human 
rights and good governance, we have maintained our ties and our  
discourse. I personally have met with the former and present 
ambassadors of Cuba. We keep very close ties and 
communications open between our two countries.
<P>
	There is also a web of unofficial private links that many 
Canadian organizations, companies and individuals have 
pursued with their Cuban counterparts over the years. When our 
review committee was in Saskatchewan I was very pleased to 
hear Friends of Cuba make a presentation to the foreign affairs 
review committee.
<P>
	Some of these unofficial links are concrete and measurable. 
Cuba is Canada's second largest trading partner after Puerto 
Rico in the Caribbean-Central American region. Our two-way 
trade was over $300 million in 1993. It is also a country in which 
a number of Canadian firms are pursuing investment 
possibilities.
<P>
	Cuba is a country that over 120,000 Canadians visit each year. 
Out of 600,000 tourists 120,000 come from Canada. I was in 
Cuba recently to open an honorary consular office in Varadero to 
help Canadians in difficulty. It is a country in which a number of 
Canadian universities, research institutes and 
non-governmental organizations have longstanding linkages 
that benefit both Cubans and Canadians.
<P>
	We enunciated Canadian objectives in Cuba in June 1994 
when the Canadian government announced several policy 
adjustments. First, we are in Cuba to promote normal Canadian 
interests including commercial and cultural activities. I 
underline cultural because when I was in Cuba in the fall well 
known jazz musician Vic Vogel was teamed with Noche 
Habanera. It was a performance that Cubans and the Canadians 
who were there will never forget.
<P>
	Second, we wish to support positive peaceful change in Cuba, 
both political and economic. We agree with Cuba on some 
issues, in particular in the areas of human rights and democratic 
development. However we will continue to pursue the 
discussion at appropriate levels.
<P>
	Third, we wish to encourage Cuba's full, constructive 
participation in international affairs.
<P>
	Finally, we wish to support Canadian organizations and 
individuals who are pursuing development activities in Cuba.
<P>
<B>(1125 ) </B>
<P>
	The Canadian government has supported Canadian businesses 
in their pursuit of opportunities in Cuba. Last fall at Havana 
International Fair we were pleased to see more Canadian 
companies than ever. Canadian government involvement was 
more visible. I witnessed 26 companies from Canada involved 
in this fair. Fourteen were companies from the province of 
Quebec. None of them had fleur-de-lis flags; they all had the 
Canadian flag. They were there as Canadians.
<P>
	I travelled to Cuba at that time to meet these business 
representatives. I will never forget the warm reception the 
Cuban government and the Cuban people gave me. Because of 
the difficult economic circumstances in Cuba our trade has 
declined in the past year but Cuba's rank remains as I indicated 
earlier.
<P>
	We also wish to encourage and support political 
developments in Cuba. Cuba has human rights accomplishments 
notably in the areas of economic and social rights. Cuba's health 
care and educational systems have been models for other 
countries. As a former educator I was impressed with the 
standard of education in that country and the standard of health 
care.
<P>
	At the same time we have very real concerns about Cuba's 
respect for civil and political rights, including freedom of 
expression, freedom of association and freedom from arbitrary 
detention. We have also expressed our concern about Cuba's 
unwillingness to co-operate with the United Nations human 
rights system, in particular the special rapporteur appointed by 
the UN commission on human rights. We have welcomed the 
visit to Cuba by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights 
and hope this can lead to greater Cuban co-operation.
<P>
	Thus Canada will continue to make human rights and 
democratic development areas of continuing discussion with 
Cuba in order that Cuban accomplishments in the areas I have 
mentioned can be mirrored in full respect of political and civil 
rights.
<P>
	In the area of development co-operation the government has 
made available the full range of partnership programs of the 
Canadian International Development Agency to Canadian 
NGOs and others in the non-governmental sector for their work 
in Cuba, including academic institutions and Canadian 
businesses pursuing developmental objectives.
<P>
	By the end of the current fiscal year Cuba will have received 
over $1 million in Canadian development assistance through the 
various programs we support, again demonstrating no need for 
such a motion as the one tabled today.
<P>
	These examples make clear that Canada is pursuing its 
objectives in Cuba through a policy of engagement and 
dialogue. I would add that this is very much in the tradition of 
Canadian policy regarding Cuba. As the government noted last 
June we are making adjustments in our policy, not turning policy 
around.
<P>
	The United States is clearly pursuing its objectives in a 
different adversarial manner. We have made it clear to the 
United States and publicly that we do not agree with its 
approach. For example, during the parliamentary debate on 
Canada's foreign policy review on March 15, 1994 the Minister 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9795"> 9795 </A></B>
<P>
of Foreign Affairs referred to the government's hope to see the 
end of the American commercial embargo against Cuba.
<P>
	The Canadian vote last year in support of the United Nations 
General Assembly resolution critical of the embargo reaffirmed 
that point. At that time we indicated that in this post-cold war 
period isolation was not the most effective means of fostering 
economic and political reform in Cuba.
<P>
	For Canada the central concern regarding the embargo is its 
extraterritorial reach. The way in which the United States 
through its laws and regulations governing the embargo seeks to 
constrain the freedom of trade of third countries such as Canada 
is not acceptable. Canada has always taken a vigorous stand 
against such measures and in 1992 issued a blocking order to 
ensure that Canadian companies were not subjected to foreign 
laws on trade with Cuba.
<P>
	We shall remain watchful of other efforts to bring Canadians 
under the ambit of U.S. laws and regulations. Accordingly I 
believe Canada has implemented a policy on Cuba which takes 
into account Canadian interests and Canadian perspectives and 
responds to the concerns of the member for 
Burnaby-Kingsway. I therefore do not believe that the motion 
is necessary and I do not agree with the tone in which it was cast.
<P>
	I am very pleased that the Canada-Cuba parliamentary 
friendship group has been established and a visit has already 
been made. Hopefully parliamentary exchanges will be speeded 
up. I know that our Minister of Foreign Affairs intends to meet 
the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Cuba.
<P>
	When I was there in October I met with five ministers. They 
welcome Canadians to Cuba. They welcome Canadian 
investment. You have to be there, Mr. Speaker, to get a feeling 
for the love and respect of Cubans for Canadians. I appeal to 
Canadians, if they want a place to invest, to invest in Cuba.
<P>
<B>(1130) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philippe Paré (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak today on behalf of the Bloc Quebecois on 
Motion No. 281 presented by the member for 
Burnaby-Kingsway.
<P>
	The aim of the motion essentially is to induce the Canadian 
government to denounce the American embargo on Cuba in the 
strongest terms possible at the United Nations, at the OAS and to 
the American administration directly. It also supports the 
re-establishment of full aid and bilateral trade ties with Cuba.
<P>
	It is one thing to express solidarity with the people of Cuba; 
but it is another matter altogether to interfere in United States' 
foreign affairs and to support a dictatorship. The member for 
Burnaby-Kingsway, in an analysis that was hardly more than 
an expression of emotion and without even having heard our 
arguments, condemned the position of the Bloc Quebecois. I 
would ask him, therefore, to take note of the basis for our  
position. Perhaps he knocked down a door that was open much 
more than he thought.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois will vote against the motion. Now allow 
me to set out the reasons behind our position. There are two 
reasons for our disagreement.
<P>
	First, we do not believe we should force the United States to 
change their foreign policy to meet the objectives of Canadian 
foreign policy, especially because we, ourselves, are 
particularly jealous of our own sovereignty.
<P>
	Second, we do not believe the state of human rights in Cuba 
would permit the re-establishment of bilateral aid with it.
<P>
	With respect to our first objection, we do not see how the 
Canadian government could dictate rules of conduct to the 
American government. Canada has always refused to interfere 
in the internal politics and diplomatic conduct of foreign states. 
We do not see why Canada would change matters now, and 
believe, furthermore, that it would not be in Canada's interest to 
do so.
<P>
	If Canada undertook the action proposed by our NDP 
colleague, we would have to be consistent and adopt a similar 
attitude toward a multitude of other countries whose foreign 
policy objectives do not coincide with our own.
<P>
	In any case, the Canadian government already has enough to 
do to look after its own foreign affairs, without taking on the 
task of advising its partners.
<P>
	In this regard, we would like to mention that a number of 
questions are currently awaiting action by the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs and International Trade, such as the case of Tran 
Trieu Quan, which I have mentioned on several occasions in the 
House. The minister should do everything possible to have this 
Canadian prisoner released from Vietnam rather than attempting 
in vain to influence American foreign policy.
<P>
	Moreover, while the American embargo against Cuba is 
certainly harming that country's economy, Castro's regime is 
clearly also responsible for the present economic crisis in Cuba. 
Would Canada not be better advised to attempt to convince 
Cuban authorities to truly liberalize their economy, rather than 
attempting to convince American authorities to raise their 
embargo? Cuba's state run economy carries a very high price 
and the few liberalization measures implemented recently, such 
as making the peso convertible, will not be enough to stop the 
Cuban economy from nose diving.
<P>
	Cuba needs help in initiating the unavoidable transition to a 
market economy. The best thing for Canada to do in this regard 
is to support such reforms through dialogue and trade. Such 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9796"> 9796 </A></B>
<P>
action on the part of Canada would be welcome in view of its 
new foreign policy direction.
<P>
	Economic reforms must nevertheless be implemented 
concurrently with political reforms. Dictatorship and the culture 
of fear must be eliminated in Cuba. Since the Bloc Quebecois 
strongly opposes the philosophy of trade at any price, human 
rights in Cuba should be taken into account in shaping our 
relations with this country. I will return to this later.
<P>
<B>(1135) </B>
<P>
	That said, we would be against Canada participating in the 
embargo against Cuba. The Bloc Quebecois expressed its 
approval when the Canadian government announced its decision 
to resume aid to this Caribbean state last June.
<P>
	Let us keep in mind that, following Cuba's involvement in the 
Angolan conflict in 1978, Canada decided to stop providing aid 
to, while maintaining diplomatic relations with that country. 
Now that the cold war is over, the new international order calls 
for a reorientation of Canada's relations with Cuba. The time has 
come to end that country's diplomatic and trade isolation. At 
stake is the very survival of its people, who have been hit 
extremely hard by Cuba's severe economic crisis. Therefore, it 
would be quite appropriate to resume our humanitarian aid to 
that country.
<P>
	However, this new decision by the Department of Foreign 
Affairs does not include restoring bilateral aid. The Bloc 
Quebecois agrees with the government on this. The motion put 
forward by our colleague from Burnaby-Kingsway calls for 
restoring bilateral aid. That is another reason why we cannot 
support it.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois feels that Canada should give priority to 
partnership-based aid programs and that international 
co-operation through NGOs is by far the safest and most 
efficient way to deliver aid to needy countries. This principle 
should be implemented especially when human rights abuses 
preclude any sustainable human development effort.
<P>
	In our dissenting report on the review of Canada's foreign 
policy, we were very clear on this. The majority of witnesses 
who appeared before the special standing committee agreed 
with us.
<P>
	In this report, we recommended that ``Canada discontinue all 
bilateral aid to states that UN agencies or any other agency 
recognized by the UN have identified as having committed or 
been responsible for gross and reliably attested human rights 
violations''.
<P>
	So far, Cuba has shown no sign of being on the road to 
democracy and establishing a state based on the rule of law. The 
Cuban government did however make real progress in some 
areas, particularly social and economic rights.
<P>
	But as regards civil and political rights, which are 
systematically violated by the Cuban regime, there is still 
serious cause for concern, as evidenced by UN resolutions on 
the matter as well as constant inquiries about Cuba at the 
Commission of Human Rights in Geneva.
<P>
	On this subject, I would like to remind the Canadian 
government that Cuba is not the only latin-american country to 
violate human rights and that, in fact, matters are considered to 
be even worse elsewhere in that area. In January, a slew of NGOs 
expressed concern to the Canadian government about the 
situation in Guatemala, Mexico, Columbia and Peru.
<P>
	At that time, the Canadian government was asked to denounce 
the human rights violations going on in these countries at the 
51st session of the UN Commission of Human Rights in Geneva. 
It matters more to us, the Bloc Quebecois, that the Canadian 
government take this kind of action in the case of Cuba rather 
than condemn the conduct of the U.S. foreign policy.
<P>
	In a nutshell, it might be a better idea for Canada to provide 
technical assistance and to do so though NGOs, because Cuba, 
which is currently facing a major food shortage, really needs 
humanitarian assistance. Any assistance sent directly to the 
Cuban government is not likely to serve Canadian official 
assistance objectives as well as if it were granted to 
humanitarian and non governmental organizations.
<P>
	This is basically why the Bloc Quebecois opposes Motion No. 
281 and why we will be voting against this motion.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> In trying to facilitate 
debate for and against the motion, I will now recognize the hon. 
member for Thunder Bay-Atikokan for a maximum of 10 
minutes. Of course I will return to a member from the Reform 
Party, if anyone should choose to speak and I have an indication 
from the hon. member for Red Deer.
<P>
<B>(1140 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Dromisky (Thunder Bay-Atikokan, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is my pleasure to address this House regarding 
M-281, a motion condemning the U.S. embargo on Cuba 
proposed by the hon. member for Burnaby-Kingsway. It is a 
pleasure for me to be in a position to second that motion.
<P>
	The red book states that ``Canadians want their national 
government to play a more active, independent, internationalist 
role in this world of change. They do not want Canadian foreign 
policy to be determined solely through special personal 
relationships between world leaders. Canadians want a national 
govern-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9797"> 9797 </A></B>
<P>
ment that takes pride in its tolerance, openness and common 
sense, and that reflects those values in its foreign policy''.
<P>
	As a member of the Canada-Cuba Interparliamentary 
Friendship Group, I acknowledge openly my pride in the 
tolerance Canadians reveal in their attempts to understand the 
differences between and among the nations of the world. There 
is also our use of common sense in defying the pressures of 
special interest groups as we encourage, develop, nurture and 
enhance our relationship with Cuba and other peaceful societies.
<P>
	It is interesting to note that shortly after the freedom fighter 
Fidel Castro overthrew the diabolical regime of Batista, the 
majority of ambassadorial representatives left the island. 
Recognizing and doing business with the new Government of 
Cuba were the governments of Mexico and Canada. As a result 
these countries were permitted to operate from their original 
embassies and continue to do so to this very day.
<P>
	Since the revolution, Canada's relationship with Cuba has 
continued to strengthen even though the Cuban government had 
to turn to the U.S.S.R. for substantial support. As American 
influence in other countries intensified and strengthened, so did 
its network of trade embargoes.
<P>
	Due to the diminishing supply of goods, it was necessary for 
the Cubans to introduce rationing early in the 1960s. This 
practice continues to this very day.
<P>
	Although the U.S. trade embargo has always deterred 
economic development in Cuba, it was not until the removal of 
the annual $5 billion Soviet aid package five years ago that the 
embargo began to have a dynamic impact on the lives of the 
Cuban people. There is a shortage of everything and there is no 
guarantee that the goods will appear in the near future within 
this tightly controlled economy. There is a serious shortage of 
instructional materials for the educational system. Certain 
medical practices must be curtailed or cancelled due to the 
absence of medical supplies. As people lose hope, despair 
overcomes and the crime rate rises.
<P>
	Priorities are established and strictly adhered to in this fight 
for survival. As wars fan the spirit of nationalism, so grows the 
spirit of common good against common evil.
<P>
	Although it may be classified as a third world country, as a 
member of the Community of Nations, Cuba has never abdicated 
its responsibility toward others. A good example of that is 
Chernobyl. Over 35,000 victims of Chernobyl have been 
brought to Cuba for treatment in one of the most advanced 
centres for the treatment of radiation. Over 13,000 of that 
number were children, and with the children came the mothers 
and fathers during the treatment period.
<P>
	Three years ago the American dollar economy was introduced 
in order to glean as many American dollars as possible for 
foreign trade. This was achieved chiefly through the 
introduction and enhancement of the tourist business.
<P>
	The free market economy is beginning to blossom in Cuba. 
We heard recently that privatization of land is possible. 
Companies can purchase the land. There are other options 
available as well. Investment is increasing. Canadians are 
investing.
<P>
	The situation was further aggravated two years ago with the 
introduction of the Cuban Democracy Act, also known as the 
Torricelli act by the U.S. Congress. The main thrust of the act 
was that of extending the embargo to American subsidiaries 
abroad. This of course applied to Canadian based U.S. 
multinationals.
<P>
<B>(1145) </B>
<P>
	Lifting the embargo now would allow Cuban exports to the 
U.S. and permit foreign investment in Cuba, having a 
substantial effect on the Cuban economy.
<P>
	With the election of the new Congress in the States, however, 
it appears that the hard line of Cuba may continue. This is 
unfortunate because the present embargo leads the U.S. down a 
very lonely path.
<P>
	For three years the UN has voted overwhelmingly to end the 
embargo, most recently in 1994. The result was a lopsided vote 
of 101 for and 2 against with 48 abstentions.
<P>
	Furthermore, Canada, Spain, Britain, Sweden, Germany, Italy 
and others are now expanding their links with Cuba. We were 
very fortunate in our visit to Cuba to meet quite a few 
representatives from these countries. They were business people 
who were in various stages of negotiating deals with the Cuban 
government.
<P>
	Obviously absent from the negotiating tables were American 
representatives. As well, private groups across the U.S. have 
been sending more and more humanitarian aid intentionally 
challenging official American policy.
<P>
	The cold war has been over now for five years. Cuba's 
situation in the present global context is radically different than 
during the 1950s and 1960s. Cuba is broke, crippled but not 
down. It is of no threat whatsoever to anybody and there exists 
no danger in lifting the trade ban.
<P>
	However, there are those who still refuse to dispose of their 
1950 style cold war mentality. It is time to stop trying to destroy 
Fidel Castro by destroying the people of Cuba. The main 
problem of American policy toward Cuba is that it is made in 
Miami, not Washington. Cuban expatriates are extremely 
powerful and are deemed crucial to ensuring whether the state of 
Florida swings in favour of the government during the 
presidential elections. As a result, they hold considerable clout 
in shaping American foreign policy vis-à-vis Cuba.
<P>
	In any nation or society where within a special interest group 
we find that the truest form of love is self-love, where greed is 
the major source of energy, where avarice and gluttony are 
esteemed to be honourable personal goals, we find that others in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9798"> 9798 </A></B>
<P>
their relationship with these groups usually are identified as 
victims in that relationship.
<P>
	I find that the embargo restrictions imposed on Cuba and 
other societies are the results of such special interest forces. 
This embargo which is a blatant example of central authorities 
catering to special interest, provincially minded political forces, 
is being maintained without regard for the suffering borne by the 
innocent.
<P>
	Our government's position with regard to Cuban foreign 
policy is very clear. Our ambassador to the United Nations has 
indicated that we need to engage with Cuba, not isolate it, in 
order to achieve our goals.
<P>
	Also, our Ministry of Foreign Affairs and our Secretary of 
State for Latin America have clearly indicated the need to end 
Cuban isolation. I applaud our government in this regard.
<P>
	However, as concerned Canadians we must increase our 
efforts to have this embargo curtailed and promote practices 
based on sound, realistic, humanitarian values and 
inter-relationships.
<P>
	The U.S. has lifted its embargo on Vietnam, so why not Cuba? 
Sure enough the time is right for a change of attitude. Let us 
work together to encourage Mr. Clinton to repeal the 
three-decade old embargo on all non-military items.
<P>
	The proponents of this embargo must be made aware of the 
fact and never forget that as man's relationship with his fellow 
man is positively enhanced, so is man's relationship with his 
spiritual leader or God.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it gives me 
pleasure to talk to M-281. I have had a long interest in foreign 
affairs and certainly in bringing Cuba into the modern world and 
the OAS.
<P>
	I visited Cuba, travelled around and realized some of the great 
potential of that country.
<P>
<B>(1150 ) </B>
<P>
	This motion asks us to make a strong statement against the 
U.S. policy on Cuba. I do have problems making a strong 
statement which directly relates to the foreign policy of another 
country.
<P>
	The U.S. is one of our most important trading partners. Even 
if it were not, how would we like to have another country, let 
alone our closest neighbour, threatening us and demanding we 
change our foreign policy? The preservation of one's 
sovereignty has been and always will be an important part of any 
country's foreign policy.
<P>
	Let us examine Cuba. The hon. member wishes to support and 
commend the actions of Mr. Castro and the country. If we are 
going to try and change the U.S. point of view it should be done 
by negotiation, not by threats or innuendo from Canadian 
members of Parliament. Threatening the U.S. will certainly 
guarantee a negative response and slam the door on what else 
might have occurred.
<P>
	Let us examine a few of the facts regarding Cuba. Why do the 
Americans feel so strongly threatened by that country? The 
history, the Kennedy missile crisis, the fact that it is 90 miles 
away from their boundary, the fact that the mafia used this as a 
headquarters for gambling, prostitution and laundering money 
are examples. However, when it comes to present history we 
must recognize that Cuba is ruled by a dictator. Cuba was not 
part of the summit of the Americas in Miami in December 
because it is the only country in the Americas that has not moved 
toward democracy.
<P>
	Human rights abuses abound in that country. My experience 
in that country was there was totally no freedom of expression 
except that controlled by the government. The people love to 
talk; they are friendly, great people, but they had to talk out on 
the water where they were sure that their secret service would 
not be listening to the conversation.
<P>
	I was able to visit a jail. I watched the prisoners working in a 
cane field and going back to their crowded conditions. It is quite 
different from the country club atmosphere of Canadian prisons.
<P>
	I attended a three-hour speech given in Varadero by Mr. 
Castro. I found it very interesting that for the three hours the 
people were told when to cheer, when to be quiet and exactly 
what to do. That is not exactly freedom of expression.
<P>
	People in Cuba are prepared to sacrifice almost anything to 
get on a board and cross 90 miles of shark infested waters just to 
get out. If the country had any kind of human rights or any kind 
of freedom of expression, I doubt that would be the case.
<P>
	There are severe shortages because Russia stopped its aid 
because it collapsed. Sugar cane production has decreased 
dramatically. In 1991, seven million tonnes; in 1994, down to 
four million tonnes. As I have mentioned, the infrastructure is in 
decay. The black market is running rampant throughout the 
country.
<P>
	I found it very interesting to visit the Tropicana show and see 
the people finally expressing themselves in terms of music and 
their culture. They were wearing 40 and 50 year old costumes. 
They certainly deserved some credit for at least trying to express 
themselves. How about a Sunday in Cuba when they take out the 
1950 cars for a drive? It is just more for show than for any 
practical means of transportation. What about the little kids who 
love to play baseball? They find that one way they might have to 
get off the island. There are ice cream stands on every corner. 
People told me that milk from Canadian Holstein cows was used 
to make the ice cream.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9799"> 9799 </A></B>
<P>
	The friendship toward Canada is certainly very obvious 
throughout that country. Anyone travelling around the country 
can see just how primitive the country really is. The last speaker 
said it was still in the 1950s. I would put it there or below.
<P>
	There are flight irregularities. Nothing seems to work 
properly. The hotels are acceptable, usually without toilet paper, 
white and sterile in nature.
<P>
<B>(1155 ) </B>
<P>
	The management is also very typical of a true communist 
country. There is really no incentive, no pride of ownership. 
There is really no drive left in the country because of the 
socialist way.
<P>
	The sanctions are not hurting the Cuban people as much as the 
dictator who holds them captive by military force. The hon. 
member should make the motion to condemn dictator Castro and 
demand his removal if he wants to interfere in another country's 
foreign affairs.
<P>
	The U.S. and Canada certainly have interests in Cuba. That 
country could prosper. In terms of Canadian, American and 
South American tourist business there would be no better place. 
If that were instituted the jobs and money would return. There 
would be an incentive to work. The ideal location of that country 
I have mentioned before.
<P>
	This sort of motion sends the wrong message. It is the 
mosquito approach versus the diplomatic approach to solving 
the really big problem. We can work and hold our own with the 
Americans. I do not think we have a problem. We have to help 
other OAS countries to deal with that American elephant.
<P>
	This motion makes us sound like spoiled kids with a temper 
tantrum. It is full of holes and would only be accepted by those 
who believe socialism would ever work any place in the world. 
We must work to gain respect and equal status with the 
Americans. We can show leadership. Certainly in the OAS we 
have a great opportunity to show leadership.
<P>
	Most of the South American countries are looking to us to 
show leadership in dealing with the powerful U.S. In NAFTA we 
have taken a role and will take an increasing role. The WTO will 
only increase our trade. Hopefully some day Cuba will be part of 
that.
<P>
	It would be nice if Cuba would join the other 34 members of 
the OAS, joining the 21st century in the whole UN reform and 
the new global community we are going to create. Cuba will be 
left in the dark ages if it does not change the infrastructure, the 
government within.
<P>
	As we have talked about many times, when it comes to trade 
there are three world areas: the European community; the 
Americas and Asia-Pacific. Cuba is part of the Americas and we 
should make it a part. Cuba is a part of our world and therefore 
we have a responsibility to help it get out of the dark ages of 
socialism. We do not  have sanctions on Cuba now, never will 
have, and should never have.
<P>
	Remember, Castro is a dictator. People are held hostage. 
Socialists have tunnel vision, only seeing one side of the issue. 
They will never reach a solution by their antagonistic approach. 
It is like a horse with blinders. One thing the member can take to 
heart is that sanctions do not really work anyway. They are 
probably not as effective as he might think.
<P>
	Finally, to attack a neighbour, our largest trading partner, and 
strain our relationship for an aging dictator who persecutes his 
own people for the sake of the impossible socialist utopia makes 
no sense. I expect the next thing the hon. member might suggest 
is a special day for Che Guevara.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mark Assad (Gatineau-La Lièvre, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
first of all, I would like to support the motion put forward by the 
member for Burnaby-Kingsway regarding Cuba. It is obvious 
that the Reform member who spoke before me had blinders on 
when he went to Cuba. It certainly was a change of scenery, but 
it obviously did not help him change his mind.
<P>
	I think that the description he gave is exaggerated and that 
Cubans are not slaves to a dictator. I saw people who are trying 
to build a future for themselves, who are standing tall instead of 
being down on their knees as they once were. Cubans have 
shown a lot of courage. I would like to say that successive 
governments here in Canada have had the wisdom to stay in 
contact with Cuba, and to maintain diplomatic and trade 
relations with that country.
<P>
<B>(1200) </B>
<P>
	They have done it because Canada is a humanitarian nation 
that will always stand up for justice. Of course, anybody who 
has had the opportunity to visit Cuba and to meet with 
politicians there is well aware of the situation. Those politicians 
did not try to make us believe that they live in a paradise. They 
know that they have problems. They know that Cubans are 
making sacrifices but that they have the motivation to succeed.
<P>
	The embargo imposed on Cuba by the United States is 
inhumane and we hope the United States will soon come to its 
senses and realize that making a whole country suffer is insane. 
Cubans are trying to protect what they have. They know that 
they do not live in a paradise, but they stand tall and want to 
preserve their values.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Parliamentary Secretary 
to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
gives me great pleasure to speak on this motion. First of all, let 
me congratulate the member for Burnaby-Kingsway for giving 
<P>

<B><A NAME="9800"> 9800 </A></B>
<P>
us an opportunity to speak on this subject. I am going to get right 
to the major points because time is very short.
<P>
	We had a great opportunity to visit Cuba in January, myself 
along with a number of other parliamentarians. We spent a week 
in Cuba and met with all the major leadership there, including 
the president, Fidel Castro.
<P>
	Back on December 5, I wrote to President Bill Clinton and 
asked him to remove the embargo. The embargo that is put on 
Cuba by the Americans really does not make sense in the 1990s. 
What are the reasons for the embargo?
<P>
	The original reason was security. The Americans said it was 
for security reasons, but is that still relevant today? Is the 
superpower of the world, the United States of America, afraid of 
Cuba? Does it have something to fear? I do not think so. There is 
no security threat to the Americans from Cuba. That is not a 
reason to have the embargo.
<P>
	Is the embargo there because of human rights? Are the 
Americans concerned that there are human rights violations? If 
that were the case, surely there are other countries that have 
serious human rights violations and the U.S. has traded with 
them and continues to trade with them. Therefore that is not the 
reason the Americans should have an embargo.
<P>
	There is no logical reason that an embargo should continue on 
by the Americans against Cuba. The rest of the world has said 
that as well. Looking at the UN, 102 countries voted to have the 
embargo removed and the U.S. has not listened.
<P>
	In conclusion, I hope we send a strong message from this 
House that this embargo is unjust, is not necessary and should be 
removed as soon as possible to help the people of Cuba.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The time provided for the 
consideration of Private Members' Business has now expired. 
Pursuant to Standing Order 96, the order is dropped from the

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="YOUNGOFFENDERSACT">YOUNG OFFENDERS ACT</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Fernand Robichaud (for the Minister of Justice, 
Lib.)</B> moved that Bill C-37, an act to amend the Young 
Offenders Act and the Criminal Code, be read the third time and 
passed.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sue Barnes (London West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
very pleased to stand in this Chamber today to talk about the 
youth justice system in Canada. It is a system that is going 
through change. It is a system that needs Canadian 
understanding.
<P>
	I often have felt over the past years that the public perception 
is far removed from the reality of the legislation and of the youth 
and their lives in Canada as they come before the courts every 
day across this land. Youth 12 to 17 years of age are captured in 
this act. That represents roughly 8 per cent of our 28 million 
population.
<P>
	In today's society it must be very difficult to grow up in 
Canada. It is much different from when I was a child. It is much 
different from when many members of this House were children. 
There is an increasing culture of violence in Canada and I 
believe Canadians have an increasing appetite to change that 
culture of violence.
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	Most kids in Canada today are good kids. We have to start 
with that premise. Most youth who are faced with drugs, 
alcohol, violence and fears for the future still turn out fine. They 
still manage. Their parents cope.
<P>
	It is difficult to be a parent in this society as well. I have three 
young children of my own. The first became a teenager a couple 
of months ago and I have already noticed a change. He questions 
a lot more. He does not accept things the same way he did when 
he was five.
<P>
	It is going to be a challenge for society, a challenge for the 
child, a challenge for our schools, a challenge for our court 
systems to cope with the difficult times these children go 
through.
<P>
	We talk about violence in society. It is there in the fantasy life 
of our children. It is there in the video games they play, on TV, 
and in the news they see every day. And it is not only fantasy. 
They see the atrocities of Rwanda. They see the ongoing wars in 
Europe and no peaceful times. They have more knowledge of 
violence at an immature stage of their development. We have to 
work against that backdrop to send different signals to 
counteract the violence, to counteract the prevalence of those 
signals.
<P>
	There is public concern both by adults and by youth. They are 
fearful of crime. They are fearful of young offenders. That is in 
part, I think, because crime sells papers. We read and hear a lot 
about crime in the media. Seventy per cent of the population 
believes everything they read in newspapers. I do not believe 
everything I read in newspapers and I am sure members of this 
House know there are often a few details added.
<P>
	That is the other backdrop we have to deal with. We have to 
address the reality of the fear of violence and put the fear of 
violence from youth into perspective. With this piece of 
legislation and with phase two which will come after it, we have 
to find a way to address the concerns of Canadians.
<P>
	The issue of young offenders is a hot topic. Everywhere I go 
people tell me that they have a problem with the Young Offend-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9801"> 9801 </A></B>
<P>
ers Act and that there is a problem with our youth today. We have 
some problems and we can do much better.
<P>
	We also have to realize that 86 per cent of violent crime 
committed in Canada in 1993 was committed by adults, not 
youth. Only 14 per cent was committed by youth. Of that 14 per 
cent, a full 50 per cent was the schoolyard punch and shove. A 
lot of that comes because of the new reporting and new zero 
tolerance programs in schools.
<P>
	There is a gradual rise, an increase in violent crime in youth. 
Depending on how the stats are read and the time periods of 
those stats, it can be seen as a significant rise, but it is rising and 
we have to address that.
<P>
	In this act we will delineate the very necessary harsher system 
for violent crime. There is a group of incorrigibles in our 
country who need to be given a very clear, strong message. This 
act in part deals with that message.
<P>
	It also delineates the other side of the coin. It also 
acknowledges that there are some less serious offences that 
bring youth before the courts. In fact, 60 per cent of them deal 
with property crime, often for the first time.
<P>
	When we talk about the violent offences reported in the 
papers, on average over a decade there have been about 40 
murders per year involving charged youth. Last year there were 
22. Somewhere between 115,000 and 130,000 young people go 
through the young offender system every year. A lot of those 
youth are saved by our system. We have to acknowledge that.
<P>
<B>(1210) </B>
<P>
	We have a national law, the Young Offenders Act. We also 
have provincial and territorial situations that interpret the act 
differently.
<P>
	We heard testimony in the justice committee which sat from 
September through to the end of November last year. The 
committee sat up to four times a week. We heard many different 
witnesses. We heard from school associations. We heard from 
parents. We heard from judges and lawyers and people who deal 
with youth in the probation and correctional facilities.
<P>
	We heard from young offenders themselves. Some of them 
had come through the system and had been saved by it; some had 
been hurt by it. Their testimony was very revealing and 
informative. We heard from victims groups. The victims groups 
are now going to be more thoroughly addressed by this 
legislation. There will be an allowance for victim impact 
statements to be made.
<P>
	This was a difficult task for the three-party committee. All 
the members sat around the table looking for appropriate 
solutions. I believe that very little time should be spent in saying 
what is bad and a lot of time has to be spent in asking what we 
should be doing better. We have to give credit where credit is 
due.
<P>
	If I were a child in trouble with the law in Canada today, there 
is no doubt in my mind that I would wish I were in trouble in 
Quebec over any other province. Quebec has interpreted its 
young offenders acts much more progressively than a lot of 
other areas in this country and with much better success. It has 
employed more diversionary tactics away from the courtroom. 
We can learn from that experience. It is essential that we learn 
from that experience.
<P>
	When I first started my law career in 1979 the Juvenile 
Delinquents Act was in force. I spent many days in courtrooms 
as duty counsel. Seven-year-olds were in those courtrooms. It is 
more appropriate now that there is this age. Phase two will 
revisit the question of age because Canadians want us to. We 
have had one debate in this House and the age question was 
defeated. Many people think we should lower the age for young 
offenders. I do not believe that. I think the ages are appropriate.
<P>
	We have to consider the level of maturity and understanding 
of youth today. We are dealing with a very malleable and 
impressionable age in this Young Offenders Act. That has good 
and bad points. One bad point is that kids are impulsive. They do 
not think the consequences through. They think they know 
everything. They think the Young Offenders Act is a joke and 
that nothing will happen to them.
<P>
	They think our system has no teeth. In fact the teeth are the 
same for youth as they are for adults. It is very important that 
youth understand that. It is very important that people 
understand that some of the breaks we give to adults in 
sentencing are not available for youth.
<P>
	Many members opposite like to say that if you do the crime, 
do the time. In youth court that is exactly what happens. There is 
no mandatory supervision or early parole. When a youth gets 
three years, he or she serves three years for the most part. It is 
important to understand that time is a different concept for a 
child in the developmental years. A year for an adult seems to 
fly by, but a week drags on for a child.
<P>
	Today in Canada when our youth come before the courts, of 
those found guilty roughly one-third will end up with a 
custodial sentence. I believe, along with many of my colleagues, 
that a custodial sentence, just locking somebody up and putting 
them away, is not a good short term answer and certainly is not 
the best long term approach.
<P>
<B>(1215 ) </B>
<P>
	It is important where we do lock people up and lock children 
up in a custodial setting that we provide some treatment while 
they are there; make sure that we are not just not warehousing, 
make sure the time, the money and the effort spent are directed 
to a change in the behaviour that in the long term will be much 
more effective in changing society, in safeguarding society, 
protecting citizens of Canada, and in changing the life of  the 
individual who came before the court. We have to ensure that we 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9802"> 9802 </A></B>
<P>
take the time that we take from these children and put it to good 
use. To me that means behaviour modification.
<P>
	There will be difficulties because a lot of people say that is 
being too soft, that is not tough enough. It is a lot tougher to sit 
down at a program and work through your problems and address 
those problems than it is to sit and watch a TV set or lull around 
the house or just pass the time away counting the days until you 
can be free again, than it is to work with the members of your 
community, with the members of your family, with the 
professionals put there for your assistance into changing 
behaviours.
<P>
	My community of London, Ontario, works very well with the 
young people diverted to it through either court order or 
alternate sentences. In particular I would like to commend the 
St. Leonard's Society of London because it puts programs into 
effect in the community that integrate the youth who have 
problems back into the community, paying back the community 
in ways that are meaningful in situations in which they are not 
pulled apart but integrated into the community, often without 
the community realizing it. Therefore the community helps in 
restoring their sense of self-worth, their sense of discipline, 
their sense of accountability. I will give one example of a project 
that works well in my community for youth and has met with 
success.
<P>
	In the spring, summer and fall a group of youths who have 
come into contact with the law go to plots of land in London and 
grow vegetables. They work those gardens. They hoe. They do 
the physical labour. They do the planning. They do the 
nurturing. They are there helping other people around them with 
their vegetables gardens. At the end of that time period they 
deliver the harvest back to the food bank.
<P>
	One of the people who worked in this project last summer 
reported to the counsellor who was working with them that it 
was a very good feeling for him because he had to come to that 
food bank, he and his family, to get food.
<P>
	A lot of our youth in trouble with the law are not all 
necessarily poor. Just like crime goes across all sections of 
society for adults, it also goes across all sections of society for 
youth. It is important to understand that the socialization 
process has an affect on youth.
<P>
	I am going to point out one thing that has bothered me. Maybe 
it is so obvious that we do not see the forest for the trees in this 
point. If I could predict what is the best predictor of getting into 
trouble with the law in this country it has to be being male. Our 
federal penitentiaries, all of our penitentiaries, are 
predominantly housing males.
<P>
	Recently in the youth system it used to be roughly 80 per cent 
male, 20 per cent female. We are seeing right now a significant 
increase in female participation coming before our courts. It is 
significant and disturbing.
<P>
	In the committee in phase two when we go on the road after we 
have these amendments through for our overall evaluation 
looking at what we can do better, looking at the 10-year review 
of the act, we can also take a look at what happens in our social 
culture differently between males and females because there are 
different results.
<P>
	This is a minor point but it is certainly very obvious when you 
look at the number of people using our systems. The problems of 
females with justice are on the rise admittedly but it is still 
substantially less than what happens to boys. I believe we are 
born equal, therefore something has to happen socially.
<P>
<B>(1220) </B>
<P>
	It does not happen socially, magically when one hits age 12. 
Something had to go wrong long before that and we have the 
expertise in this country to understand what went wrong. We can 
predict with very young children that they are getting into 
trouble, that there is aggressive behaviour that needs attention.
<P>
	We have the expertise with our psychologists, teachers, 
preschool teachers, neighbours and parents. They can see it. 
What in my opinion is criminal is that they see it and nothing is 
done. The answer often is the criminal justice system should get 
in there and fix it.
<P>
	There are problems putting really young kids in the criminal 
justice system. The problems have to do with understanding, 
with process. We have a very formalized process for serious 
offenders in the criminal justice system. It is necessary because 
there are rights of individuals, there are rights of youth. That 
was one of the big changes between the old Juvenile Delinquents 
Act and the Young Offenders Act, that we did give children 
rights.
<P>
	I go back to the analogy of a parent. If my child offends the 
rules of my household, I do not want to say: ``I am going to see 
you next week and we will talk about it for the first time. Then 
we are going to adjourn this conversation for a month. Then you 
come back and another month later we will look at it again and 
then we will do whatever''. I want immediacy. I want some fast 
action. I want to be able to cope better and faster and that is what 
is necessary in our youth courts.
<P>
	They have a tremendous job and when we look at the funnel of 
people going into this very formalized process, we have to make 
sure that we are funnelling in the right people, the right youth, to 
the more formalized, stricter process and we safeguard their 
rights.
<P>
	With lesser offences, lesser violations of the community, we 
should try now through this act to funnel more of them back to 
the community for it is the responsibility of all of us in that 
community to fix the problem.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9803"> 9803 </A></B>
<P>
	They are not our children to be shipped out of our 
jurisdictions and sent away and forgotten, hopefully not to 
return. We know in our federal system part of the reason that we 
want to do a rehabilitation program is that on fixed term 
sentencing 80 per cent of the population is going to come back 
and reintegrate into society. Kids for the most part are all going 
to be reintegrating into society unless there is an unusual case 
where there is a murder by a youth who gets bumped to adult 
court and has to stay most of his life in the adult system. If that is 
the case, that youth is going to be subject to stricter sanctions 
than are there right now for the adult who commits an offence of 
murder.
<P>
	We have to understand that kids are open to change and how 
difficult changing behaviour actually is. It has to be done from a 
base of knowledge. There have to be values put into that base of 
knowledge that include words like respect and accountability. 
There also have to be other words present like compassion and 
understanding.
<P>
	Retribution is part; rehabilitation is a better part. If one wants 
to fix in the long term one's society, then one had better put some 
attention to the detail of changing that underpinning, 
interdisciplinary approach of why things went wrong. It is not 
that this offence merits this amount of time and we will only talk 
about paying back for that crime.
<P>
	As a society we really have to address more and more crime 
prevention which is now in the preamble. We have to address 
long term rehabilitation which is also in the preamble. We have 
heard evidence at committee level that those things are 
counterproductive.
<P>
	I submit that they are not counterproductive. They are going 
to be a challenging base on which our justice system for our 
youth will change over time.
<P>
<B>(1225 ) </B>
<P>
	People will say we are not tough enough. There are going to be 
many people in this debate today who will tell us about the tough 
measures in this bill. I will deal briefly with them because it is 
important that people understand that we did address the 
concerns of the public. We have increased from five to seven 
years the time for those offences. That is a significant increase, 
especially given the fact that judges throughout Canada today 
are not even going to the maximums on the times allocated to 
them under the old provisions.
<P>
	We have to talk about who needs to know when the youth gets 
in trouble. That also was a concern of the public. It wants to be 
aware of who is offending and why this is happening in its 
communities.
<P>
	Again, we have taken a responsible and reasonable approach 
in this area. The area of providing information about offenders 
has been widened, has been increased. The professionals, the 
school officials, the welfare officials, the people who are 
dealing with the best interests of that offender will have an 
ability to get that information.
<P>
	This is far removed from branding a child by a label and 
giving broad based public information and shaming some child 
back into the right course which I have heard advocated in this 
Chamber. That is not what we are doing. We are going to have 
judicious use of information. If there is a need for protection of 
the public there will be a vehicle through the act and through the 
court system to get a wider distribution of information. That is 
necessary in some circumstances.
<P>
	I want to take a minute to make sure that I talk about another 
provision of the bill. We have had the ability since 1908 to take a 
child and move him up to the next level, to adult court. In this 
bill we have moved a further step. We have reversed the onus for 
some 16 and 17 year old offenders. It is called a presumptive 
transfer. It is saying that when one commits five very serious 
offences in this country one is going to be taken very seriously 
by the system: murder, attempted murder, manslaughter, 
aggravated sexual assault and one other in the list.
<P>
	Basically in those instances we are going to make the young 
offender prove to a judge that he should not be transferred, that 
the youth system is a better system to deal with him. The 
presumption will be a reversal. I think that is very harsh but 
these are very big offences. The reality is that people need to 
understand that the options will be there.
<P>
	We in committee heard much testimony on presumptive 
transfers. It is not a concept of reverse onus that I am very 
comfortable with. I think it should be used sparingly. Over time 
it has been used sparingly in our systems. It is expensive. It will 
create delays. It makes process very time consuming.
<P>
	It is necessary in some cases but what is important is again the 
delineation between harsh, strong, compassionate and 
behaviour modification. We have streamlined very effectively 
in this bill two different paths that are available. Judges will 
have to say why they do not choose the path of community if it is 
not one of those very strong offences.
<P>
	It is not only the offence, though. It always has to be the 
individual. If I say that theft under $200 is a summary 
conviction offence, maybe that is not that serious in the 
magnitude of the Criminal Code. But if it is the 15th time there 
has been theft under $200, maybe stronger intervention with 
different tactics relating to behaviour have to be changed.
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
	This act will still give a judge the ability to look beyond the 
charge, to look at all the circumstances. Consent to treatment 
will be changed and the ability to put more programming before 
an individual will also be there.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9804"> 9804 </A></B>
<P>
	I can only reiterate it is an ongoing process that will come 
with phase two. By the spring the Standing Committee of Justice 
and Legal Affairs will take the time to go into communities and 
talk to those groups that have knowledge and interest in youth. 
We will be looking for better partnerships with the people who 
are involved, who have strengths in these areas.
<P>
	At the London Family Court Clinic in my riding they have 
developed a handbook for schools funded through the 
department of health which was distributed to all 
superintendents of school boards across Canada. It dealt with 
integrating anti-violence messages into the curriculum from the 
low level grades right up to high school. It has been discovered 
that integrating these messages into the lesson plan on a daily 
basis can have a dramatic effect on violent attitudes. Studies are 
being done all the time and if these situations are not taken care 
of they will show up in our prisons later on.
<P>
	During these rounds of testimony we are hearing from people 
who are very concerned and have different ways of looking at 
their problems. Specifically I think of some of the First Nation 
witnesses that came before the committee. They talked about 
sentencing circles and appropriate ways of dealing with 
corrections for their people. It is quite different.
<P>
	They do not want to see the overpopulation of their youth in 
our prison systems. They have an alternate system they can 
engage. Perhaps in our sentencing it is time for us to look at 
some of those alternate systems. When we are talking about 
sentencing circles for native youth, we are talking about 
responsibility to the elders, responsibility and reparation to the 
community. The youth are accountable before their peers and 
the immediate family group.
<P>
	In phase two we need to figure out a meaningful way to get 
parents involved in their children's lives again and to restore the 
harmony that has been lost in a household. We have to know that 
justice is more than punishment. Justice for youth has to be 
meaningful and include reinvolvement, rehabilitation, 
reintegration into a community that cares for these children and 
wants them back as tax paying, hard working, responsible 
adults. We want to make sure we have more saves than losses.
<P>
	Along with my colleagues I look forward to spending time 
trying to figure out how we can develop better systems for 
youth. Bill C-37 goes a long way in addressing the concerns of 
the public. Violent crime needs to be addressed more strongly 
but we must leave a door open so that our communities can deal 
more meaningfully with the youth justice system.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
subject before the House today is the third reading of Bill C-37, 
an act to amend the Young Offenders Act and the Criminal Code.
<P>
	This bill was tabled by the Minister of Justice on June 2 last 
year. The Bloc Quebecois was frank and forthright in its 
criticism. During the first debate, I said that I would not vote for 
a bill that tries to punish crime by creating criminals. I moved 
that the House decline to give second reading to Bill C-37, the 
purpose of which is repressive. Unfortunately, my motion was 
defeated.
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
	Bill C-37 is part of the Liberal government's policy on youth 
crime. This strategy has two components. Bill C-37 is the phase 
one of the proposed reform, while phase two is to be a 
comprehensive review of the system by the Standing Committee 
on Justice and Legal Affairs.
<P>
	On June 6, 1994, the Minister of Justice said that he had asked 
the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs to 
undertake a comprehensive review of the Young Offenders Act 
and of the youth justice system in Canada in general. He went on 
to invite Canadians to take part in the discussion on the subject.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice should have requested the review 
before tabling this bill. I have already said that the Minister of 
Justice is a minister of consultation, and in this particular case, 
he is the minister of indiscriminate consultation. Whether these 
consultations are held before or after a decision is made is 
irrelevant, since they will have no effect on his decision.
<P>
	The minister proposes to change some important aspects of 
legislation that subsequently will be the subject of a 
comprehensive review by the Standing Committee on Justice 
and Legal Affairs. The Minister of Justice has put the cart before 
the horse. At this rate, the Liberal government's strategy will 
produce a law lacking any consistency it may have had.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice was in such a hurry to table a bill in 
response to increasing pressure from some members of his own 
caucus and from the Reform Party that he forgot to apply the 
most elementary principles of logic, according to which changes 
should not be made until one has a full understanding of the 
problem. The Minister of Justice panicked. He decided to amend 
legislation without realizing what was involved.
<P>
	The Young Offenders Act has been amended before. On May 
15, 1992, a major amendment on sentencing came into effect. 
This amendment increased the maximum sentence in youth 
court for a young person convicted of murder from three to five 
years. Today, the Minister of Justice wants to increase 
sentencing. They would be increased to seven years in the case 
of second degree murder and to ten years in the case of first 
degree murder. Furthermore, the minister is going after a very 
specific group of young offenders-the 16 and 17 year olds.
<P>
	They will now have to prove, if they are accused of violent 
crimes, that they should be tried in youth court, otherwise, they 
will be sent to the court that would normally have 
jurisdiction-adult court. This reversal of the burden of proof 
means, in other words, that an  adolescent may no longer be 
considered as such, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9805"> 9805 </A></B>
<P>
depending on the type of crime he has committed. In addition, 
his criminal liability increases, not as a function of his age, 
either, but as a function of the crime.
<P>
	However, the preamble to the Young Offenders Act seems 
clear, and the one to Bill C-37 is even more so. This section 
provides that young persons should not in all instances be held 
accountable in the same manner or suffer the same 
consequences for their behaviour as adults. How do we explain 
this nonsense? On the one hand, it is agreed that degree of 
responsibility should be measured in terms of age, on the other, 
16 and 17 year olds are being treated like adults.
<P>
	Does the minister have some hidden statistics to which only 
he has access? Do they indicate a disturbing increase in violent 
crime among 16 and 17 year olds? If the answer is yes, let him 
show them to us, because he needs a lot of justification for 
proposing such a bill.
<P>
	The approach of the Minister of Justice is similar to that of the 
members of the Reform Party. He supports the member for New 
Westminster-Burnaby, who stated the following in the House 
and I quote: ``The juvenile justice system in its operation should 
mirror the adult system as much as possible if it is to be 
understandable by the community and develop general 
deterrents''.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	What is the point of having an act for young offenders when a 
third of those it targets could be treated as adults? We might just 
as well propose revoking it. At the rate things go, this could well 
happen in the very near future.
<P>
	I shiver at the idea of a single system touted by the Reform 
Party. If we listen to the member for New 
Westminster-Burnaby, we should label young offenders in 
kindergarten. On June 6, he made the following statement: 
``Violent patterns in children are identifiable at the kindergarten 
level. By identifying young offenders before they graduate into 
the teen world of crime set before them, we drastically reduce 
the number of young adults we are forced to deal with six years 
down the road. This is social engineering at its best''. I wonder 
where he took his courses on social engineering.
<P>
	The minister did not bother to check the impact of the 1992 
amendments. He did not concern himself with statistics on 
young people and criminality. He did not take the time to 
examine how all those involved were applying the Young 
Offenders Act. If he had, he would have understood that many of 
the problems stem from how the act is being implemented, and 
not from the act itself. But no, the minister once again caved in 
to pressure. The winds of hysteria made the Liberal reed bend.
<P>
	Bill C-37 is premature. It cannot answer questions that have 
never been asked. The justice committee proposed some 
amendments following its study. Most of the 28 amendments it 
adopted were minor, and regarded style, terminology and 
concordance of the texts in both official languages. Some of 
them were more substantial, however.  I do not intend to dwell 
on these points, but they are worth mentioning, if only to define 
what we are debating today.
<P>
	To start, the first amendment removes aggravated assault 
from the list of offences leading to automatic transfer to adult 
court. In this way, we eliminate the danger that prosecutors lay 
heavier charges than the evidence available at the time would 
support. Without the amendment, a young person could almost 
automatically be transferred to adult court but be found guilty of 
a lesser crime which would not have merited such a transfer. 
That was only the lesser of the evils, since automatic transfer in 
principle remains intact.
<P>
	The second amendment pertaining to transfers allows for 
parents to be heard before their child is transferred to adult 
court. This becomes one more element for the judge to consider. 
The committee also agreed that in regard to proceedings brought 
before a judge and jury, the Young Offenders Act is applicable to 
young persons. Measures of the Young Offenders Act will 
therefore take precedence over provisions of the Criminal Code 
in regard to protecting privacy. The amendment emphasizes the 
young person's right to legal representation when absent from 
proceedings as a result of poor conduct or when his competence 
to stand trial is being assessed.
<P>
	These are significant amendments proposed by the 
committee. Since these amendments do not in any way alter the 
repressive nature of this bill or change the transfer procedure to 
adult court, all the while retaining the severity of sentences, I 
cannot believe that we are now debating an improved version of 
what was presented to us last June.
<P>
	The Liberal government has tried to smooth things over by 
suggesting a few amendments at the report stage. In committee 
and in this House, we have stressed a great many times the 
procedural problems created by Bill C-37.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	By increasing sentences for murder, the minister has given no 
thought to the confusion he will create. Section 11(f) of the 
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms stipulates, and I 
quote, ``Any person charged with an offence has the right to the 
benefit of trial by jury where the maximum punishment for the 
offence is imprisonment for five years or a more severe 
punishment''.
<P>
	Thus, the justice minister would increase the sentences for 
first and second degree murder without considering for a 
moment that a young person normally subject to the Young 
Offenders Act, which does not allow for trial before a judge and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9806"> 9806 </A></B>
<P>
jury, in fact has the right to a trial before a judge and jury under 
the Canadian constitution.
<P>
	There is no provision for bridging the gap between the Young 
Offenders Act, which governs the appearance in court and the 
request for bail, and the Criminal Code, which governs crime 
proceedings in which the accused can choose to appear before a 
judge alone or before a judge and jury, while a magistrate under 
the Criminal Code will oversee the preliminary hearing if there 
is one.
<P>
	The minister's feeble response to this nonsense and legal 
vacuum was to propose a hasty amendment at the report stage. 
This amendment details the Criminal Code provisions that will 
apply to preliminary hearings, when young people accused of 
murder are transferred to youth court.
<P>
	No one at the Department of Justice had a stroke of genius. 
Although the amendment was intended to improve a lame bill, it 
creates more problems than it solves. Once the young person 
chooses or is deemed to have chosen a judge and jury trial, the 
preliminary hearing will be held before the youth court. Fine, 
but when does the defendant make the choice? When he appears 
before the youth court or after the preliminary hearing, when he 
can still choose to be tried before a judge alone?
<P>
	What about the young person who is transferred to adult 
court? Will the preliminary hearing still be held before the youth 
court and will he then be summoned to appear before the adult 
court?
<P>
	Given the undeniable seriousness of the offences listed in the 
section on transfer to adult court, the young person will be held 
in custody while awaiting trial. However, the young person is 
entitled to a bail hearing, which would allow him to be free on 
bail until legal proceedings are over.
<P>
	Before which court and when will the bail hearing be held? If 
the election occurs when the accused appears in court, as is often 
the case, will the bail hearing be held before a higher court? As 
we can guess, the young person may well find himself in several 
jurisdictions even before being summoned to trial. He could 
appear before the youth court, have his bail hearing before the 
adult court, return to the youth court for his preliminary hearing, 
elect a judge and jury trial, and be summoned to appear before a 
superior court of criminal jurisdiction.
<P>
	If you have followed me so far, you will understand why this 
bill and its amendments are nothing but hogwash to create a 
situation that only judges will be able to untangle, judges who 
should not have to take on a responsibility that falls to the 
legislator in the first place.
<P>
	But when the legislative power does not do its job, then we 
have no choice but to defer to the judiciary, with the risks this 
may involve. Instead of the legislator, you now have 
jurisprudence deciding procedure and substantive law.
<P>
	Bill C-37 is typical of the kind of bill moved by a government 
that is reactionary and repressive. This is the coercive approach 
this government is taking to respond to pressures from a 
misinformed public and a right wing group that manipulates it.
<P>
	Bill C-37 cannot be justified either in terms of substance or in 
terms of the purposes it is claimed to have. Far from providing 
the appropriate remedy, it promises on the contrary to be a major 
source of procedural problems. It increases the costs to the 
provinces and substantially changes the role of rehabilitation 
centers in Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
	We do recognize, on this side of the House, that the rate of 
juvenile crime is cause for concern. Crime creates fear and 
jeopardizes the quality of life in our neighbourhoods and our 
cities. But it seems to us that the way juvenile crime is perceived 
is quite far removed from the reality around us.
<P>
	Reformers and some Liberal members are blind to this reality. 
To justify their repressive stance, they cite extreme cases that 
reflect in no way present trends.
<P>
	The inflammatory remarks made by the hon. member for New 
Westminster-Burnaby on June 6 have certainly made many 
people jump. He said, and I quote: ``We will be Her Majesty's 
loyal, constructive opposition with advocacy for improvements 
to Bill C-37 based on what the community wants''. And he went 
on to say: ``Reformers are the true opposition -Let the people 
speak and Reformers will bring their voice to this House''.
<P>
	Not only do Reformers not know how many seats they have in 
this House, but they crow over the idea of being the only 
sensible representatives of the electorate.
<P>
	Instead of caving into pressure from his colleagues and their 
confederates in the Reform Party, the Minister of Justice should 
take a closer look at the report by criminologist Julian Roberts, 
which was commissioned by his own department.
<P>
	Professor Roberts' study was about the public's perception 
and knowledge of crime and justice. This criminologist 
concluded, for instance, that crime is a serious problem in 
Canadian society that gives rise to a great deal of concern and 
controversy about the kind of preventive policies we should 
implement. However, before determining whether the public 
supports those policies, we must establish what the public really 
knows about crime and criminal justice.
<P>
	Professor Roberts wondered about the general public's 
perception of the Young Offenders Act. His remarks are an eye 
opener: ``Canadians have a very negative opinion of the legisla-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9807"> 9807 </A></B>
<P>
tion but are not very familiar with its provisions and impact. 
They do not understand the underlying principles or the specific 
provisions of the legislation and probably see it as another 
example of clemency being shown by the criminal justice 
system. The  public and certain criminal justice professionals 
are wrong to think that the crime rate can be reduced by harsher 
sentencing''.
<P>
	One of the avowed objectives of Bill C-37 is to provide better 
protection for the public, and the means chosen to achieve this is 
to extend sentences for young offenders. What the Minister of 
Justice is proposing is the exact opposite of what all studies on 
the subject recommend. Those studies were done, in fact, by his 
own department. It is surprising, to say the least, that the 
minister should go the route of repressive measures to deal with 
crime, if only to impress the public. No one in Quebec is 
impressed.
<P>
	Dealing with crime is not just a matter of sanctions or legal 
procedures. Bill C-37 is an exercise in futility. There are no 
statistics to justify a legislative change of this kind. Since the 
bill deals more specifically with young persons of 16 or 17 who 
have committed serious crimes, one would expect the statistics 
to show a disturbing increase in the crime rate among this 
population.
<P>
	Nothing could be further from the truth. A review of the 
records held by youth courts since the Young Offenders Act 
came into effect reveals that the percentage of cases heard by the 
court which involve this population has not varied.
<P>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
	Another example of statistics the Minister of Justice appears 
to be ignoring is to be found in a document on homicide in 
Canada put out by the Canadian Centre for Justice Statistics. It 
reveals that 35 young people between the ages of 12 and 17 were 
charged with homicide in 1993. This includes first and second 
degree murder, manslaughter and infanticide. The figure 
represents a 40 per cent reduction over 1992. Only 6 per cent of 
the individuals charged with homicide in 1993 were young 
people as against 9 per cent in 1992.
<P>
	How can we justify increasing the sentences for first and 
second degree murder, and in such a draconian fashion, when the 
trend is decreasing? How can we justify such a repressive 
approach? Is the aim of the exercise to impress?
<P>
	Nowhere does the literature indicate any effect of lengthening 
sentences on deterring or fighting crime. For example, robbery 
is liable to a sentence of life imprisonment, but statistics 
indicate that the percentage of robberies remains stable. The 
minister, however, is increasing the maximum sentence for first 
degree murder from five to ten years and the maximum sentence 
for second degree murder from three to seven years. This 
increase and the new provisions on parole eligibility are 
creating some rather extraordinary situations.
<P>
	It should be noted right off that the starting date used to 
determine the length of detention varies according to whether a 
young person is tried in adult court or in youth court. Thus the 
confusion is compounded.
<P>
	The most ludicrous situation is as follows: a 15-year old 
found guilty of first degree murder would be eligible for parole 
after five years in prison if judged in adult court. Yet this same 
15-year old, if judged in youth court, would have to serve a six 
year prison term before being paroled.
<P>
	In spite of the new measures regarding transfer, a young 
person in this position would do well to keep quiet, in the hope 
of being transferred to adult court. Ironically, he could be 
released sooner that way.
<P>
	On the subject of transfer, the justice minister has drawn up a 
list of offences for which the offender may be transferred to 
adult court. It is odd that the justice minister has not increased 
sentences for such offences he himself calls serious. This list of 
offences seems entirely arbitrary to me and entails the real 
danger that crown prosecutors might be tempted to increase the 
severity of the charge for the sole purpose of reversing the 
burden of proof.
<P>
	As I have already indicated, the Standing Committee on 
Justice has dropped aggravated assault from this list. The danger 
remains for other offences, however, such as in cases of 
aggravated sexual assault.
<P>
	I would like to stress at this point the inconsistency of the bill 
as pertains to multiple offences. Such situations are very 
common, unfortunately. Consider for example a young person 
charged with both murder and robbery. On the count of murder, 
the burden of proof in respect of transfer rests with the young 
person, and on the other charge, with the crown. How does the 
justice minister envision the application of this procedure? No 
solution is to be found anywhere in this bill.
<P>
	Will there be a joint inquiry exclusively in regard to transfers? 
If so, who would begin producing evidence? The young person 
in the preceding example might find himself in two separate 
jurisdictions in respect of the same events. This situation could 
lead us to make contradictory decisions. Imagine for example if 
he were acquitted in one jurisdiction and found guilty in the 
other.
<P>
	If the minister had bothered to properly analyze the 
amendments he is proposing, he would have realized that the 
mere act of reversing the burden of proof coupled with the 
increase in sentences would turn the whole system upside down.
<P>
<B>(1300) </B>
<P>
	Bill C-37 ignores the fundamental differences between 
Quebec and the rest of Canada. Once again, the federal 
government is trying to impose legislation Canada-wide, 
without taking into consideration regional differences and 
systems already in place. The fact that the Minister of Justice 
does not acknowledge that our system is  distinct is not so bad, 
but he adds insult to injury 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9808"> 9808 </A></B>
<P>
when he proposes a bill whose administration falls under 
provincial jurisdiction and whose reforms will have to be paid 
for by the provinces.
<P>
	If the Minister of Justice had done things right and had 
undertaken a general study of the penal system for young people 
before amending the law, he would have noticed that Quebec 
does things differently. He could have improved his reforms by 
copying Quebec. The Quebec Bar Association presented a 
thorough paper to the Standing Committee on Justice, which 
summed up the situation in Quebec.
<P>
	In an eloquent passage from the paper, the association said: 
``Young offenders in Quebec can take advantage of an 
alternative measure which entails referring the file to the youth 
protection branch. An agreement can be proposed and 
alternative measures imposed, such as reimbursement of the 
victim or community work. In fact, close to 47 per cent of all 
cases take this route. All other cases in Quebec are heard by the 
youth court. Once the order of the court is issued, the health and 
social services network carries out the sentence. Quebec's 
choice of sending these young offenders to institutions reporting 
to the Ministry of Health and Social Services illustrates its 
policy in this area, the ultimate goal being medium and long 
term rehabilitation rather than a repression oriented panacea 
which would probably only protect society in the short term''.
<P>
	That is how things are done in Quebec. I can already hear 
Reform members accuse us of being too soft and encouraging 
juvenile delinquency. They should know that the juvenile 
delinquency rate in Quebec is the second lowest in all of Canada. 
If passed, Bill C-37 would disrupt all Quebec institutions now 
focused on rehabilitation.
<P>
	Extending sentences for murder would mobilize 
rehabilitation resources for longer periods. Quebec institutions 
will focus more on protecting society by putting young 
offenders away instead of rehabilitating them. On the other 
hand, youth court trial applications by 16 and 17-year-olds who 
have committed violent crimes and appeals of decisions to 
dismiss such applications will result in additional delays, during 
which the young person will be held temporarily in a 
rehabilitation centre. This is compounded by the delays caused 
by holding a trial before judge and jury.
<P>
	Did the Minister of Justice try to find out if institutional 
resources are prepared to accommodate these new clients? I 
remind him that Quebec has chosen to place these young people 
in the care of the protection and rehabilitation system. Quebec's 
Youth Protection Act is a model piece of legislation which 
reflects a forward looking policy and should be copied by the 
other provinces. This approach was favoured long before the 
federal Young Offenders Act was implemented. The 
rehabilitation centre network took over the facilities used as 
youth correctional centres a long time ago.
<P>
	Today, the Minister of Justice is bluntly asking Quebec to 
change its policy. He is asking Quebec to backtrack and convert 
these rehabilitation centres into ordinary prisons.
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	Quebec uses a different approach and methods. Convincing 
results show that we are on the right track and should be held up 
as an example. Faced with a complex problem, we opted for a 
multidisciplinary approach and methods that have proven 
effective. All in all, the Minister of Justice should have had a 
better look at the Quebec experience before proposing his 
reform.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill 
C-37, an act to amend the Young Offenders Act and the Criminal 
Code, be read the third time and passed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to participate in third reading of Bill C-37.
<P>
	I begin by saying unequivocally that I am opposed to the bill 
because it does absolutely nothing to address the causes of rising 
criminal activity among the youth of our country. It does 
nothing to protect our sons and our daughters from the vicious 
attacks launched by their peers in school yards and on our 
streets. It does not expand the Young Offenders Act to include 
10 and 11 year olds. It does not mandate the raising of 16 and 17 
year olds to adult court, except through the reverse onus 
proposition that I will address later. Its disclosure clause is 
insufficient to provide members of the public with the 
information they need to protect themselves from violent young 
offenders, including sex offenders that reside within our society.
<P>
	The young faces in Canada's courts and jails are like masks. 
They hide society's ugliest scars: poverty, drug and alcohol 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9809"> 9809 </A></B>
<P>
addiction, sexual abuse, physical abuse, neglect, learning 
disabilities, fetal alcohol syndrome, racial and sexual 
discrimination.
<P>
	I am sympathetic to the many social adversities that confront 
the young people of the country. However it is not the role of the 
justice system to address what lies beneath these veils. It is not 
within the boundaries of justice to treat the social problems that 
are the root cause of crime.
<P>
	I believe this government and past governments have tried to 
mould the justice system to deal with the causes of crime. They 
have tried to make the system address factors it was never 
designed to deal with and they have tried to fool Canadians into 
believing this can be achieved.
<P>
	The justice system cannot prevent dysfunctional families. 
The justice system cannot reverse the ever increasing high level 
of taxation. It cannot change the fact that 50 cents out of every 
dollar earned by a mother or father is taken by various levels of 
government. It cannot stop the unacceptable level of 
unemployment. The justice system cannot prevent the negative 
aspects of society that lead to crime.
<P>
	The areas where these factors must be addressed are the same 
areas that are responsible for creating them: poverty, a lack of 
money to meet the cost of living. This exists when a person is 
unemployed or underemployed. This falls within the human 
resources development minister's area. Providing Canadians 
with better employment prospects will help alleviate poverty. 
We all know how successful the minister has been in this regard 
with his social policy reforms.
<P>
	Taxation, the single most debilitating financial factor in the 
country, falls squarely on the shoulders of the Minister of 
National Revenue, while economic conditions such as interest 
rates, the falling dollar and the ballooning deficit that continue 
to pressure Canada are responsibilities of the Minister of 
Finance.
<P>
<B>(1310) </B>
<P>
	The greatest threat to the economic stability of the family is 
the unrestrained power of governments to tax away the wealth of 
the individual. This has been going on at an enormous rate over 
the last 25 years.
<P>
	The Minister of Health has on her plate responsibility for 
dealing with the problems of alcoholism and drug abuse which 
destroy families and greatly affect our youth. Provisions for 
social services and programs designed to provide counselling 
for families and youth remain within provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	These ministries are responsible for dealing with the negative 
aspects of society, the root causes of crime. The objective of the 
justice system is the protection of society. The justice system 
was designed for one purpose and one purpose only: to protect 
society against those individuals who move toward a life of 
crime.
<P>
	It was designed to protect Canadians from people who lack 
self-discipline and respect for others. This objective can only be 
met through deterrence and the application of just penalties. 
Deterrence means ensuring penalties or the consequences of 
criminal behaviour are sufficient to thwart criminal activity. 
When crime occurs the justice system must provide penalties 
proportional to the offence which will protect innocent 
individuals within society.
<P>
	The attempts by the social engineers over the last 20 years to 
create a dual animal of some sort within the justice system has 
created a sieve. It has corrupted the justice system to the point 
where the rights of the criminal supersede the rights of the 
victim, where there is absurdly light sentencing, out of touch 
judges, easy parole, deportation orders that are an utter joke, and 
an absolutely ludicrous belief that murderers should not have to 
serve their full life sentence.
<P>
	This two-tier animal fostered by a bleeding heart mentality 
has led to the demise of the traditional justice system whereby it 
is no longer protecting the lives and the property of Canadian 
citizens.
<P>
	It is very apparent that Bill C-37 does not move to discard this 
problem. In fact it reinforces its foundation rooted in the parent 
act, the Young Offenders Act. The first clause of Bill C-37 
reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a) crime prevention is essential to the long-term protection of society and 
requires addressing the underlying causes of crime by young persons and 
developing multi-disciplinary approaches to identifying and effectively 
responding to children and young persons at risk of committing offending 
behaviour in the future;</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Bill C-37, as is the Young Offenders Act, is the product of an 
attitude that criminals are not bad people, that they are all 
victims of poverty and a ruthless, competitive society who do 
not require punishment but the infinite application of some 
mysterious panacea that has never been found or defined.
<P>
	The remedies are not defined within Bill C-37 as they are not 
defined within the confines of other justice bills. Both the 
causes and the treatment of criminal behaviour are beyond the 
scope of justice.
<P>
	A counsellor and youth worker in the youth correctional 
system of Quebec and Alberta has provided profiles of the 
young offender who came under his care. He said that the kids 
came from homes where one or both of their natural parents did 
not want to have them around. Many came from single parent 
families, women on welfare or working at low wage jobs who 
lost control of their children. Many were brought up by 
grandparents, uncles, aunts or foster parents.
<P>
	Common to all these histories was the impression that the 
young inmates were raised in homes that were emotional junk 
yards with fighting, screaming, drunkenness or drug abuse, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9810"> 9810 </A></B>
<P>
violence and neglect. ``Definitely'', the author says, ``not a 
warm and fuzzy place''.
<P>
	These kids grew up angry. No matter how tough, no matter 
how lenient, no matter what their rehabilitative efforts may be, 
the Young Offenders Act and likewise Bill C-37 cannot change 
the hostile environment that bred many of our young offenders. 
That environment can only be changed by powers that fall 
outside the justice system.
<P>
	The government can move against the influences in society 
that attack the moral fibre of our youth, influences such as 
pornography. We have in Canada peep shows where adults go 
into a room for a fee and watch naked women dancing and 
gyrating through a peep hole. We have naked dancing and lap 
dancing in bars where our daughters are enticed into so-called 
occupations that contribute to moral decline.
<P>
	I quote from a letter I received from one of my constituents. 
``Last night'', he states, which was October 15, 1994, ``I went to 
pick up my daughter and turned on CBC radio. Usually the 
program `Ideas' is on. The show was about female ejaculation. 
In the five minutes I listened to it before picking up my 
daughter, a woman was describing self-stimulation in front of 
mirrors and how exciting it was to ejaculate in front of the 
mirrors''.
<P>
<B>(1315) </B>
<P>
	The government can do something about this kind of thing and 
I ask that it do so. I ask the justice minister and the minister of 
culture to look into this particular radio broadcast. If these facts 
are accurate, as I have been assured they are, those responsible 
should be disciplined and this type of broadcasting should be 
eliminated from the CBC, which is financed by the taxpayers.
<P>
	These are areas the government can do something about. Yet 
members across the way refuse to act in these areas that attack 
the moral fibre of our society, particularly our youth.
<P>
	Until the negative aspects of society that breed delinquent 
behaviour are addressed, this pretence that the Minister of 
Justice is getting tough on crime will continue. I suggest it is 
only a pretence. Until the minister moves to eliminate those 
areas within the Criminal Code that facilitate violence, the 
pretence will remain.
<P>
	If the minister is serious about getting tough on crime, why 
does he not amend the legislation that allows a statutory release 
of violent offenders such as Mr. Auger, who is the prime suspect 
in the murder of Melanie Carpenter, after serving only 
two-thirds of their sentence? Why not move to stop that type of 
release of violent offenders into society? The members of the 
parole system advised those in charge that Mr. Auger was still 
dangerous and would likely offend again.
<P>
	Why does the minister not act? He could move quickly to plug 
that loophole. He would certainly have the support of the 
members within the Reform Party caucus. Why did the Minister 
of Justice vote against the private member's bill eliminating 
section 745 of the Criminal Code which gives murderers an 
opportunity for early parole?
<P>
	Why is he voting in favour of the criminal and against a safer 
society? Will the Minister of Justice change his vote on this bill 
if he is serious about getting tough on crime? I ask all members 
of the House, what do they believe is a fair and just penalty for 
the premeditated murder of an innocent person such as Melanie 
Carpenter?
<P>
	I can support portions of this bill. The minister has obviously 
been listening, if only somewhat, to the thousands of Canadians 
who have demanded toughening of the Young Offenders Act. 
Although I believe that many Canadians were looking for 
significant change, as were we in the Reform Party, not what we 
consider to be a charade.
<P>
	The amendments contained in Bill C-37 are not significant. 
They are nothing more than a pretence that the minister is 
dealing with the problem at hand. I believe that people like Stu 
Garrioch, the father of a boy who was stabbed in the stomach 
with a hunting knife by a 15-year-old and the 195,000 people 
who signed his petition want to see major reform, not mere 
tinkering and amending.
<P>
	The same could be said for Donna Cadman, whose 16-year 
old son was fatally stabbed by another youth on a street corner in 
Surrey in 1992. She is asking that all violent offenders be tried in 
adult court. We ask the same.
<P>
	Yvette Steck, a 27-year old housewife in Fort St. John, B.C., 
has been pushing her community to call for a registry of sex 
offenders. She was motivated by the revelation that she had been 
leaving her seven-year old daughter at a neighbour's home 
where a convicted child molester was staying. On a petition 
demanding that molesters lose their right to privacy after 
victimizing a child, Mrs. Steck collected 6,500 signatures.
<P>
	An estimated 10,000 people demonstrated on Parliament Hill 
on September 24, 1994 calling for crime control, not gun 
control. On September 25, 1994, 3,000 people marched in a rally 
alongside Bob Niven, whose 31-year old son was beaten to 
death by two teens, demanding tough reform of the Young 
Offenders Act.
<P>
<B>(1320 ) </B>
<P>
	In November last year 1,500 people converged on the lawns of 
Parliament Hill. They came out of respect for Anne-Marie 
Bloskie of Barry's Bay, whose skull was smashed after being 
sexually assaulted by a 17-year-old. They came out of respect 
for Melaine Deroches who was beaten to death with a wrench in 
Kemptville by a 14-year old classmate, for Marwan Harb, the 
Hull teenager who was stabbed to death during an after school 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9811"> 9811 </A></B>
<P>
rumble with  three teens, and for Nicholas Battersby who was 
shot on Elgin Street.
<P>
	They came to mark the fifth birthday of the late Joshua 
Baillie, a young accident victim struck dead by a youth out joy 
riding in a stolen van. They came out to say: ``Enough is enough. 
We want significant change, not just tinkering and mere 
amendments''.
<P>
	The boy who sexually assaulted and murdered Ann-Marie 
earned three years in jail. Melaine's killer received a three-year 
term in youth custody. Young, innocent Joshua's assassin, after 
pleading guilty to criminal negligence, got one year in custody 
plus one year probation.
<P>
	A couple of weeks ago 3,000 people from B.C. mourned the 
death of Melanie Carpenter and thousands more people are 
rallying around a campaign organized by the Carpenter family 
demanding reform of the criminal justice system.
<P>
	Bill C-37 is a half-hearted attempt to address the concerns of 
Canadians. This bill, although propelled by the grassroots and 
not the ivory towers of this nation, does not meet the needs of 
Canadians. Why has the the minister not been consistent in his 
adherence to the wishes of Canadians? Where are all the 
petitions containing thousands of signatures?
<P>
	Where have all the protests been held calling for the 
registration of rifles and shotguns? How many people marched 
on Parliament demanding an outright ban on handguns? I have 
not seen them.
<P>
	I have travelled throughout the west and northern Ontario. My 
colleagues have been in the east. We have witnessed gathering 
upon gathering of thousands of people. We have in our 
possession petitions from every part of Canada containing 
thousands of signatures protesting the minister's decision to 
compel law-abiding citizens to register their rifles and 
shotguns. Yet on and forward goes the minister.
<P>
	The minister is inconsistent in his adherence to the wishes of 
Canadians. He is also inconsistent in his approach to criminal 
justice. Although he has moved to increase sentencing in 
relation to gun offences, he was reluctant to increase sentences 
for youth criminal offences.
<P>
	I commend the justice minister for increasing the penalty for 
murder from five to ten years for young offenders. However, 
how does he equate 10 years for murder with the same penalty of 
10 years for deliberately neglecting to register a rifle or 
shotgun? Does this make sense? Is this fair and reasonable? 
What do the inconsistencies in this type of legislation do to 
further attack the credibility of the present justice system?
<P>
	During the 1993 election campaign I heard constituents in my 
riding expressing concerns about the prevalence of crime, 
particularly about youth crime. Every day I receive letters 
asking for our help in restoring some sense of sanity to a justice 
system that seems to have run amok.
<P>
	I hear about the deficit and the debt and the runaway taxes 
imposed by previous governments. I hear about the mounting 
cynicism toward politicians, particularly those at the federal 
level.
<P>
	During the campaign people in my riding revealed that they 
felt betrayed. The imposition of the much hated GST and 
wasteful spending habits were at the root of their cynicism prior 
to the 1993 campaign. Today it is the result of a lack of 
substantive action on the part of the Liberal government.
<P>
	During the campaign I did not hear one person, nor do I today 
hear people expressing concern that we do not have enough 
firearms control. In fact the <I>Maclean's</I> Decima poll indicated 
only 5 per cent of Canadians felt violent crime was due to a lack 
of sufficient and adequate gun control measures. However, I did 
hear and continue to hear that people are concerned about their 
safety. They are worried about the alarming rate of youth crime, 
particularly violent crime.
<P>
	Bill C-37 is not the answer for the rising rate of crime among 
our youth. The answer is a complete review, an overhaul of the 
Young Offenders Act with a goal of restoring the traditional role 
of justice to our system.
<P>
	Reform wants a number of amendments to the Young 
Offenders Act which in the absence of a complete review will be 
the only way to satisfy us that the protection of society will 
prevail. We have requested that the Young Offenders Act cover 
youth aged 10 to 15 inclusively rather than 12 to 17 which 
currently is the case.
<P>
<B>(1325) </B>
<P>
	I am sure members are aware that the criminal justice system 
cannot hold accountable youth aged 10 and 11 years for any of 
the crimes they might commit. That is unacceptable. We believe 
that there are too many 10 and 11 year olds committing crimes 
for which the police cannot charge nor prosecute them. As for 
older offenders we believe that youths age 16 and 17 are old 
enough to assume full responsibility for their crimes and should 
in all cases and in particular in the case of violent offences be 
tried as adults.
<P>
	Under Bill C-37 the justice minister has proposed that 16 and 
17 year old youths who are charged with murder, attempted 
murder, manslaughter, aggravated sexual assault, and 
aggravated assault be tried in adult court unless an application is 
granted for the youth's case to be heard in youth court. The onus 
is now on the young offender to demonstrate why he or she 
should not be tried in adult court and the court will have the 
discretion to accept or reject the application.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9812"> 9812 </A></B>
<P>
	This amendment creates a hearing within a hearing. It will 
cause delays and add to the backlog of cases currently before the 
courts. It will be more costly. We reject the suggestion and the 
amendment.
<P>
	The Reform Party had proposed increased sentencing. 
Therefore I support the provisions contained in Bill C-37 to 
have sentences for first degree murder increased from five to ten 
years. We had also recommended that amendments to the Young 
Offenders Act include permission to publish the names of young 
offenders who have been convicted of any offence involving the 
use of violence, who contravene any narcotic control act or food 
and drug act or who have been convicted previously of any two 
offences.
<P>
	Bill C-37 has failed to provide this amendment. It is perhaps 
the greatest failing of the bill. I firmly believe that the 
publication of the names of young offenders is essential for the 
protection of Canada's innocent children.
<P>
	For example, a school principal may not know that one of his 
students has been convicted numerous times for drug 
trafficking. A parent may not know that his child is associating 
with a offender convicted of a series of rapes. The young man 
next door who has been entrusted to babysit children could be 
another Jason Gamache.
<P>
	Who should we be protecting, the vast majority of Canadians 
who are law-abiding, hard-working, caring people who will 
continue to be the building blocks for a productive society or the 
local high school's drug dealer and unknown rapist in the 
neighbourhood? I do not think that is a hard question to answer. 
Undoubtedly it is these offenders who must be made known to 
society.
<P>
	We are not talking about the youth who makes a small mistake 
and comes in contact with the justice system on a single 
occasion. The best interest of the public may not be served by 
publishing the details. We propose and firmly believe that in 
order to make community protection the number one priority, 
the publishing of violent young offenders' names must not be 
prevented by law as it is today and continued in Bill C-37.
<P>
	A successful justice system cannot have as its base the 
withholding and concealment of the truth. The names of victims 
and the horrific details of the crimes perpetrated on them are 
open to public scrutiny but the names of the offenders remain a 
state secret. The young faces in Canada's courts and jails are the 
masks that hide society's ugliest scars, scars that will fester if 
they are not exposed.
<P>
	The Reform Party on behalf of our many constituents has 
asked the government to establish a registry of child sex 
abusers. The government has provided its typical response to a 
request of this nature. It knows there is a problem. It knows that 
Canadians want something done about it. It has promised to 
study the issue and consult the proper authorities. In other 
words, the government is dragging its feet and in the meantime 
children will continue to be sexually abused and violently 
attacked by  repeat offenders that the government is guilty of 
protecting by refusing the public the information it needs to 
protect our children and our society from these perpetrators.
<P>
	In an effort to understand the need for a child registry Health 
Canada, Justice Canada and the Ministry of the Solicitor 
General commissioned a study. The federal ad hoc 
interdepartmental working group on information systems on 
child sex offenders prepared a discussion paper.
<P>
	What was the conclusion of that study? We need another study 
and we need further consultation. Also contained in that paper is 
information which clearly indicates both the need for a child 
registry and for the publishing of young offenders' names.
<P>
<B>(1330 ) </B>
<P>
	The report states: ``Statistics compiled on all violent crime 
committed against children in Canada indicate that young 
offenders, those aged 12 to 17, account for approximately 23 per 
cent of all accused offenders. Further information indicates that 
from 17 to 29 per cent of those accused of child sexual abuse are 
under the age of 18''.
<P>
	It is important to note that this same age group only represents 
7.9 per cent of the Canadian population. The report states that 
studies have repeatedly indicated that sex offenders have one of 
the highest rates of recidivism of any criminal group, with an 
estimated 40 per cent reoffending within five years of release. 
Furthermore, research examining the effectiveness of offender 
treatment programs has shown limited results.
<P>
	Did the Minister of Justice not read the report of the federal ad 
hoc group? If he had, he would know that sex offenders reoffend. 
If he could do simple calculations he would know from the stats 
that between 17 and 29 per cent of sex offences in Canada are 
committed by young offenders. If 40 per cent of that 17 to 29 per 
cent reoffend, sadistic acts will continue to be committed 
against the most innocent and vulnerable members of our 
society. And the government could have prevented this by 
releasing their names to society. If they had read their own 
report and acted immediately on its findings, unspeakable acts 
on our children could have been thwarted.
<P>
	Bill C-37 does not undertake to protect our children from the 
Jason Gaumaches of this world. It does not protect us from the 
faceless, nameless individuals poised behind the mask of 
adolescence.
<P>
	Furthermore, the weight is still balanced in favour of the 
young offender in this country. The protection of society, the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9813"> 9813 </A></B>
<P>
protection of our children, is still outweighed by the so-called 
rights of violent and delinquent young Canadians.
<P>
	All we are asking is that the scales be evened out, that the 
rights of the victims, the rights of our children be given priority. 
We ask that the protection of society outweigh the protection of 
violent young offenders who have no respect for the lives and 
rights of others.
<P>
	All we are asking is that the Minister of Justice listen to the 
people of Canada; listen to the mothers and fathers whose 
children have been taken from them at such an early age; listen 
to the grassroots of this country, not those in the ivory tower who 
are immune to what is really going on at ground level.
<P>
	I can only support legislation that finds its roots with the 
people or that can be substantiated by fact, not personal agendas. 
In closing, I reiterate my opening remarks. I cannot support Bill 
C-37. I will only support legislation that meets the objective of 
justice: the protection of society.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> We will now move to the 
next stage of debate. During the next five hours members will be 
entitled to interventions of 20 minutes subject to 10 minutes of 
questions or comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Derek Wells (South Shore, Lib.):</B> I rise today to speak in 
favour of the amendments to the Young Offenders Act put 
forward by the Minister of Justice and confirmed by the report 
of the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs as 
tabled in this House on December 8.
<P>
	First of all, I can state that I consider the minister's two-part 
strategy to reform the youth justice system to be an appropriate 
response to the problems of youth crime.
<P>
	As a lawyer and as someone who has worked with youth for 
many years and also as a parent, I do not support the hard line 
argument that a weak Young Offenders Act is leading today's 
youth to commit more and more crimes. I acknowledge that the 
act has shortcomings but I am satisfied that the amendments in 
Bill C-37 will begin to close the gaps, increase rehabilitation 
and improve public safety.
<P>
	While I support the need for changes in the Young Offenders 
Act, I consider it imperative that any changes be based on the 
best available knowledge rather than on public fear and anger or 
on the widely held myth that harsher punishments are what is 
needed to bring most youth crimes and violence under control.
<P>
	I believe that most criminal behaviour stems from 
sociological factors. I am therefore pleased that phase two, the 
parliamentary review of the Young Offenders Act, will include a 
study of the alternatives to legislative responses to youth crime. 
If we can prevent youth crime by gaining an understanding of 
the underlying causes of criminal behaviour and tackling these 
causes, then I think it will be proven that the Young Offenders 
Act is an effective tool of the justice system.
<P>
	Rehabilitation should be the ultimate goal of any legislation 
dealing with youth crime. The act as it now stands is somewhat 
lacking in this area but I feel that the changes proposed in Bill 
C-37 will begin to address this deficiency. This legislation is an 
indication that the rehabilitative needs of young people are 
being seen in relation to the need to address issues related to 
public safety. I would like now to comment on the various 
components of Bill C-37.
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	The bill proposes two major changes to the act's declaration 
of principles which I feel set a more appropriate tone for its 
interpretation in court. This is achieved by acknowledging two 
truths: one, that crime prevention is essential to the long term 
protection of society; and two, that there is a relationship 
between the protection, society and the rehabilitation of 
offenders.
<P>
	Bill C-37 proposes an increase in the maximum penalty for 
first degree and second degree murder to 10 and 7 years 
respectively. This is an important change. In fact I would 
support a further increase in these maximums for this most 
terrible of crimes.
<P>
	The proposed change to the act which requires 16 and 17 year 
old youths charged with specified serious crimes involving 
violence to be tried in adult court is a significant departure from 
the current system of treating all youth between the ages of 14 
and 17 the same way. This will ensure a more appropriate 
response to each young offender's transgression. For those who 
have to go through the process of showing the judge why they 
should be tried in youth court, this amendment will ensure that 
they are left with a clear understanding of the seriousness of the 
charge and the consequences of their violent action.
<P>
	Section 16 of the act specifies the criteria to be considered by 
the youth court in making these transfer decisions. I would like 
to quote them because they are important. The criteria include: 
the alleged offence, the age, the character and criminal record of 
the young person, the availability of treatment in either 
system-that is a very important criterion-and any other 
factors considered relevant by the court.
<P>
	In making transfer decisions, youth courts must consider both 
the protection of the public and the rehabilitation of the young 
person. Where the two objectives are irreconcilable, protection 
of the public is to be paramount. The young person must then be 
proceeded against in adult court.
<P>
	There have been a lot of discussions on this change. People 
have raised the argument that this will be set aside on a charter 
argument in time. I guess we will have to wait and see on that. 
For certain, there is a reverse onus. We acknowledge there is a 
reverse onus.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9814"> 9814 </A></B>
<P>
	Some people may have difficulty with that but I agree with it. 
Some people suggest there is a presumption of guilt built into 
this, that the young offender is presumed guilty. I reject that 
argument. I do not feel there is a presumption of guilt built into 
this section.
<P>
	On balance I feel this change is good. It is appropriate. Let us 
not forget that it deals with only the four most serious crimes: 
murder, attempted murder, manslaughter and aggravated sexual 
assault.
<P>
	The amendment which allows for victim impact statements to 
be made in court meets the strong demand of victims to be a part 
of the criminal justice process.
<P>
	Two other important amendments are the changes to the 
record provisions of the act and the improvement of information 
sharing within the youth justice system. The general public and 
young offenders will both benefit from an increased level of 
co-operation among the various professionals who work with 
young people in the community.
<P>
	The proposal that allows a judge to impose conditional 
probation at any time it is deemed necessary for the benefit of 
the youth or for the protection of the public is another 
amendment which should meet the demands of those concerned 
with public safety and those in favour of rehabilitation for young 
offenders. The same can be said for the change that will 
authorize the courts to request psychological and medical 
assessment of chronic and serious young offenders.
<P>
	As a person in favour of measures to improve the chances of 
rehabilitation, I find the proposal encouraging the consideration 
of alternatives to custody for less serious crimes an important 
one. Many experts report that closed custody is the most 
expensive and least effective way of dealing with less violent 
forms of delinquency. This change responds to research which 
shows that non-violent young people do better when they are 
treated in the community away from more serious and violent 
young offenders. It also recognizes the widely held belief that 
custody often undermines rehabilitation.
<P>
<B>(1340) </B>
<P>
	By allowing for any number of alternatives to be considered, 
the youth system will be able to identify the most effective way 
of dealing with each individual offender. As well, it forces 
young offenders to take an active responsibility for their 
actions. This change is an important one because ultimately 
rehabilitation improves public safety.
<P>
	As I stated earlier, I am satisfied that the proposed changes to 
the Young Offenders Act are appropriate. Most of the 
amendments demonstrate an underlying concern with protecting 
the public while allowing for the necessary conditions to 
encourage rehabilitation.
<P>
	The Young Offenders Act is based on the premise that youth 
should be held responsible for their illegal actions but that 
young people have special needs as they develop and mature. It 
is therefore a balance between the need to protect the public and 
the need to assist young persons in conflict with the law to 
develop into productive law-abiding adults. The proposed 
amendments maintain this critical balance.
<P>
	In addition to the changes I have discussed, I believe that the 
findings of the widespread review being conducted by the 
Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs will be 
important to the development of a co-ordinated long term 
response to the general problem of crime in Canada.
<P>
	Legislation is only one part of the solution however. It is 
becoming increasingly apparent that until we are able to 
effectively address the issues of poverty, alcoholism, family 
violence, abuse, racism and illiteracy just to name a few, our 
legislative efforts at reducing youth crime will continue to be 
deemed as insufficient.
<P>
	In his presentation to the Standing Committee on Justice and 
Legal Affairs, Dr. Alan Leschied, assistant director of the 
London Family Court Clinic, confirmed this research by citing 
four major predicators as to why kids commit crime. First, he 
noted it has something to do with the nature of families and how 
we in our society function as families. Second, it reflects the 
impact and nature of friendships and peer influence. Third, it 
has something to do with how we develop certain attitudes that 
justify anti-social actions. Fourth, it can also have a lot to do 
with substance abuse.
<P>
	Research has proven that there are reasonable links between 
crime prevention and the proper care of children. Youth who 
turn to criminal activity often come from an environment where 
poverty, neglect, substance abuse, physical abuse and 
unemployment are the norm. It goes without saying that the 
more positive influences that are present, the better.
<P>
	While Dr. Leschied expressed his opinion that there is no cure 
for crime, he noted there are solutions that will reduce the 
incidents of youth crime.
<P>
	For instance, a solid relationship with caring adults has been 
shown to deter children from developing anti-social behaviour. 
Therefore, where possible as a society we must ensure that youth 
are raised in a supportive environment. Where this is not 
possible we must work to ensure that there are adequate support 
networks to assist youths and their families.
<P>
	High quality day care and an adequate education can also have 
a significant impact on behaviour. In addition to providing a 
solid basis for the future, schools can also play an important role 
in crime prevention by, among other things, teaching young 
people about the legal system; encouraging the development of 
social skills, including responsibility, tolerance and respect for 
others; teaching methods of conflict resolution; including 
anti--
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9815"> 9815 </A></B>
<P>
racism programs in the curriculum; and early identification of 
and intervention for those with serious problems.
<P>
<B>(1345 ) </B>
<P>
	As well, it may be more appropriate for those children who 
grow up in homes where violence, drug or alcohol abuse or 
emotional and mental problems are prevalent to be dealt with by 
the mental health system rather than the justice system. It is 
clear to me that in most cases it is only when all the support 
systems fail that the justice system is forced to respond to youth 
who have committed a criminal offence.
<P>
	Therefore we should be focusing our efforts on improving the 
effectiveness of these services. I am hopeful that the results of 
phase two will support this argument.
<P>
	For those who feel that the amendments introduced in Bill 
C-37 do not go far enough, I would like to quote from an 
editorial which recently appeared in the Chronicle Herald, a 
local newspaper in Halifax, Nova Scotia: ``We should be careful 
not to equate our wishes for teenagers to have more respect for 
people and property with shortcomings in the Young Offenders 
Act or the criminal justice system. Reform of the act is not a 
panacea for the apparent discipline problem of our youth. 
Fundamental social and family problems put children in court''.
<P>
	Before concluding, there seems to be some misunderstanding 
of what the Young Offenders Act is supposed to do and perhaps 
some misunderstanding of what the amendments propose. In the 
few remaining minutes I would like to set out again for the 
record the major elements of the act.
<P>
	There are amendments to provide that 16 and 17 year olds 
charged with specified serious crimes involving violence will be 
proceeded against in adult court unless the youth court orders 
that they be proceeded against in youth court. There are 
amendments to increase the sentences in youth court for young 
persons convicted of murder. There are amendments to increase 
the period of time that 16 and 17 year olds convicted of murder 
in adult court must serve before becoming eligible to apply for 
parole.
<P>
	There are amendments that provide that young offenders 
should be accountable to their victims and to the public through 
non-custodial dispositions where appropriate. There are 
amendments to provide that the records of young persons 
convicted of specified serious offences will be retained for 
longer periods and that records for young persons convicted of 
minor offences will be retained for shorter periods. There are 
amendments to provide for greater sharing of information 
relating to young offenders with persons who require such 
information for safety reasons.
<P>
	There is always a fine balance when trying to determine what 
is best for society and what is best for the individual. Every 
piece of legislation does not get it right every time. This, like 
any criminal justice legislation, is  evolving. It continues to be 
reviewed. It has to be reviewed on a regular basis.
<P>
	I feel that these amendments address some of the very real 
issues in front of the public today. The general public has been 
asking for changes and I believe the government has responded. 
It has responded in a reasonable way and it has listened to people 
who work with youth.
<P>
	On a number of occasions I attended the committee hearings. 
The committee had experts attend to give evidence and it had 
experts that worked with youth on a regular basis. They were 
people who understand the system, who understand the youth 
justice system and who understand what is required for 
rehabilitation. I believe that to a large extent, although not in 
every instance, what is incorporated into this legislation reflects 
what the committee heard from the experts who appeared before 
it.
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
	The quote I used earlier states my position and the 
government's position very clearly. We should be careful not to 
equate our wish for teenagers to have more respect for people 
and property with shortcomings in the Young Offenders Act or 
the criminal justice system. I believe that is a truism. I believe it 
strongly and I fully support the amendments put forth in Bill 
C-37.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened to the dissertation by the hon. member for 
South Shore. As I was listening to the hon. member, I was struck 
with the fact that there is an inconsistency between the 
sentencing aspects of young offenders under the provisions of 
Bill C-37 and the sentencing provisions under Bill C-41, 
another government bill having to do with sentencing circles for 
aboriginal Canadians.
<P>
	The idea under the Young Offenders Act is that the anonymity 
of the young offender is the watch word of the whole thing. Once 
the young offender makes a mistake or does not make a mistake 
but does something very deliberate, creating an offence of 
significant magnitude against someone else, the whole idea is 
that we have to somehow make sure we can save this young 
offender from recidivism, making sure we get them started on 
the right track.
<P>
	That is great. It is a good idea. It is motherhood and apple pie. 
The problem is that it demands almost total anonymity. The 
young offender's neighbours cannot be informed of the offence. 
The newspapers cannot be informed of the offence.
<P>
	At the same time we have sentencing circles requiring 
positive peer pressure. We would return someone to their 
community so their sentence would be handed down by their 
elders. They would have to face members of the community they 
have injured or disgraced.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="9816"> 9816 </A></B>
<P>
	We have the whole notion of the principle that motivates 
human beings. Is it recognition and reputation or shame and 
disgrace? On one side under Bill C-37 we have complete 
anonymity. On the other side we have peer pressure, the 
opposite of anonymity. I wonder if the hon. member for South 
Shore would comment on this inconsistency and tell the House 
and Canadians how sentencing circles which would require peer 
pressure from the community could work for aboriginal 
Canadians, while non-aborignal Canadians are expected to 
change their ways in complete anonymity.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Wells:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not propose to comment on Bill 
C-41. I will comment on the provisions of Bill C-37.
<P>
	What I said earlier applies. We have to find the balance. We 
are dealing with young offenders. We are dealing with people of 
a tender age, if we can use that worn expression. I do see some 
benefit if we are dealing with the four most serious offences that 
we are now treating differently for 16 and 17 year olds.
<P>
	I would consider engaging in some discussion on those types 
of offences at that age of individual, to look at perhaps 
publishing the names even if the youth court decided they would 
remain in youth court. There is some discussion that could be 
had on the point that perhaps peer pressure could be brought to 
bear. There are some advantages in school principals and others 
knowing who these people are. I think that is the point being 
made.
<P>
	I do not suggest for a minute that some of the points are not 
good points. I am suggesting that some of the flaws or concerns 
we had originally with the Young Offenders Act have been 
addressed in this bill.
<P>
	There is phase two. We are going to go forward with a further 
review of the act. Suggestions you have of that nature have some 
merit. I would not hesitate at all to discuss the pros and cons, 
recognizing at the end of the day that perhaps everything you 
want and everything I want we may not get.
<P>
<B>(1355) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I hesitate the interrupt the 
member for South Shore but I think it is worthy to remind 
ourselves not to get into a dialogue between two members of the 
House when we are all participating. All interventions are to be 
directed through the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, there 
are a couple of comments I would like to make with regard to 
what the member has said. I would like to get his comments 
back.
<P>
	The government seems to be quite pleased with the idea that 
16 and 17 year olds are going to be charged in adult court. Then 
it has thrown in a little extra clause which says unless it can be 
proven by the defendant that it would be more beneficial for 
them to be in juvenile court.
<P>
	To me that means that every 16 and 17 year old who gets 
charged as an adult will appeal and want to be charged as a 
youth. I would not blame them for wanting to do that. That 
means more court time and more nice little jobs for lawyers to 
take on to help fill their pockets a little more and it does not 
change anything. Now we are charging the youth and if they feel 
they ought to be in adult court, then we have court trials to fight 
for that. I do not see where that has changed anything. Either 16 
or 17 years old are in adult court or they are not. I cannot believe 
the government would come out with that kind of wishy-washy 
legislation.
<P>
	I really wonder why so many members from the justice 
department are constantly concentrating on the social aspect of 
problems. We have a social department. I want to see good 
prevention programs. I want to see good rehabilitation. I want to 
see all the things that these people want to see, but the justice 
department does not want to address the part called justice. It 
continually wants to talk about low income families, the poor 
mistreated child, the victims of society. It does not address the 
justice part. Victims of this country are so anxiously awaiting to 
hear what we are going to do in terms of justice. I have not heard 
that yet.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Before I give the floor to the member for South 
Shore, I think we are close enough to two o'clock now for 
Statements by Members. I wonder if the member for South 
Shore could think about his response and as soon as question 
period is over I will return to him.
<P>
	It being 2 p.m., pursuant to Standing Order 30(5), the House 
will now proceed to Statements by Members, pursuant to

with Canadians.
<P>
	Vancouver <I>Sun</I> columnist Barbara Yaffe wrote a column 
asking people to express their opinions on this issue. The 
response within 10 days was 12,000 letters from people fed up 
with politicians raising taxes and cutting services for ordinary 
Canadians while at the same time leaving their own perks and 
pensions untouched.
<P>
	In a time of fiscal restraint and budget cutbacks, Canadians 
rightfully expect their representatives to show fiscal leadership 
by tightening their own belts.
<P>
	I ask all members of this House, regardless of their political 
stripe, to make and accept the necessary changes to bring MP 
pension plans in line with those of other Canadians.

	<B>Mr. Eugène Bellemare (Carleton-Gloucester, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the government operations committee of which I am a 
vice-chairman has been reviewing contracting out practices for 
over six months.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The previous government's bias toward wholesale 
contracting for services within the public service has led to little 
accountability as to numbers or quality of the shadow public 
service. The committee continues to be frustrated by the lack of 
data and costing.
<P>
	The $5.2 billion for contracting services in 1993 is but a 
guestimate and could well be twice this amount. It is my belief 
that the government should restrain this practice so that public 
service employees not lose their jobs while the shadow public 
service continues to grow and prosper out of control.

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Does the public have a right to know every single detail of evidence that 
will be presented during the trial? In principle, in defence of freedom of the

detail? The answer surely is no, so long as the public is assured that such 
evidence has been seen and weighed by the judge and the jury of 12 who will 
represent us all in deciding the case.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>While the media may have an obligation to inform the public, there is surely 
also a duty to respect the dignity of the victims and of the victims' family, 
neighbours and friends.</BLOCKQUOTE>

	As I noted in this House last year, Mr. Kelly was convicted 11 
years ago in the murder of his wife. The prosecution's key

she had not witnessed the murder, contrary to her testimony 
almost ten years ago. Ms. Taber said last Wednesday: ``You

amendments to the criminal code, constituents up in arms over

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, Michel 
Robert, spokesperson for the Security Intelligence Review 
Committee, the same Michel Robert who denied the existence of 
a secret file bearing the name of Preston Manning, said that 
Grant Bristow did nothing that was reprehensible. However, a 
recent video contradicts this statement and shows that Mr. 
Bristow committed acts that are unlawful and unacceptable in a 
democratic society like ours.
<P>
	My question is directed to the Solicitor General. Will the 
Solicitor General finally admit that when he was a CSIS 
informer, Mr. Bristow acted in a way that was reprehensible and 
unlawful by engaging in a campaign to promote violence, more 
specifically against the Canadian Jewish Congress?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House

prepared a comprehensive report that was tabled in this House, 
and I think the hon. member should draw the attention of SIRC 
to any remaining concerns he may have in this respect.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, a video 
exists that was brought to the attention of quite a few people, and 
it shows that Mr. Bristow was, at the time, making speeches to 
promote violence and the commission of unlawful acts.
<P>
	How does the Solicitor General expect the public to trust the 
Security Intelligence Review Committee when this is the second 
time the committee's findings have been contradicted? After it 
was denied that there was a file on Preston Manning, we are now 
told that Mr. Bristow, and this was shown on the video, 
committed totally reprehensible acts when he was an informer 
for CSIS, although we had been given assurances this was not 
so.

	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House

Review Committee did not say that there was a file about 
Preston Manning but rather that the file had been mistakenly 
entitled Preston Manning while it dealt only with the 
investigation into possible election financing by another 
government.
<P>
	The activities of the source in question were gone into 
thoroughly. Points were raised by the Security Intelligence

General.
<P>
	Would the Solicitor General agree that the only way to get to 
the bottom of these allegations concerning Mr. Bristow, a CSIS 
agent, and his activities within the racist Heritage Front 
organization is to set up a genuine commission of inquiry to find 
out what is going on there, since obviously the Security 
Intelligence Review Committee is not well informed and its 
investigation techniques are not up to scratch?

was to eliminate the deficit. A target without specifics is no 
target at all; it is just political grandstanding and wishful 
thinking.

ultimate target?

way to the zero deficit target.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> When?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peters:</B> The timing of it is not certain. We will have 
rolling two-year targets so that we meet those targets. There is 
no point in going out like members of the previous government 
and saying that there is going to be a certain deficit in so many 
years when they have no intention of achieving it.
<P>
	We are going to meet our targets in rolling two-year periods 
as the finance minister has said.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
all know about the imminent downgrade of Canadian debt by 
Moody's. Moody's primary concern is not the deficit for this 
year or next year. It is mid-term factors. It knows full well that 
the 3 per cent target will leave the government open and an 
inevitable downturn in the U.S. economy will cause an 
escalation once again in the debt-GDP ratio. The minister 
knows that.
<P>
	Once again, will the minister tell the House, if he has no idea 
how the government is going to achieve its ultimate target, how 
they can assure investors that the deficit-GDP ratio will not 
again spiral out of control once we have a downturn in the U.S. 
economy?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International

<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peters:</B> There seems to be some disagreement among my

deficit. We have made some major changes in the structure of 
the deficit.

<HR>

<P>
	Our structural deficit is much lower than it ever was. It is a 
matter of the changes we made in the last budget and the changes 
that will be made in this budget which will make that deficit 
target achievable in the near term.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
minister who also has some economics knowledge will know 
that a 3 per cent GDP target at the top of a cycle is a very high 
structural deficit.
<P>
	On Friday, once again, the Minister of Finance blamed the 
previous Conservative government for the problem, saying that 
it had left a huge accumulated debt. The House will remember 
that the previous Conservative government used to blame the 
Liberals before them for the large accumulated debt.
<P>
	When will the government stop with these excuses, stop 
saying it suddenly discovered compound interest and abandon 
the go slow, go nowhere policies that caused millions of 
Canadians to abandon the Conservatives?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the millions of 
Canadians that abandoned the Conservatives gave the hon. 
member an opportunity to run for Parliament.
<P>
	Let me tell the hon. member that the changes we made in the 
last budget were the biggest changes in spending cuts that have 
been made in any budget in a decade. We are going to continue to

<P>
	At noon today the Canadian Taxpayers' Association presented 
on the Hill 230,000 petitions against taxes. Our party has 
received over 15 sacks full of mail strongly advising the finance 
minister not to increase taxes.

take this anti-tax message to the Minister of Finance? More 
important, will he vote against any net tax increases in the next 
budget?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of National Revenue,

Minister of Finance and other members of the government are 
listening with great care and attention to the public on many 
issues related to tax, but I can assure him that we will not be 
dissuaded from proceeding with our deficit reduction plan 
outlined, as the Secretary of State for Financial Institutions 
mentioned a moment ago, in last year's budget.
<P>
	We will achieve those goals regardless of protests that might 
occur.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I really 
expected that answer from the minister. He was quoted in the

``Obviously we will be listening to the public and obviously I 
have had many meetings with groups of Canadians on tax

altered simply by protests here or there. He has objectives he 
must meet''.

on that occasion with two mothers whose young children had 
each lost an eye as a result of the misuse of BB guns or air guns.
<P>
	As a result of that meeting I examined the manner in which air 
guns or BB guns are regulated in this country. I discovered that 
at present some of them are classified as firearms and therefore 
regulated as other guns are, the distinction being the muzzle 
velocity of the projectile. If the muzzle velocity is above a 
certain threshold, then they are regulated in terms of acquisition 
or possession as others guns are. The question is whether that 
threshold should be lowered to capture the commonly available 
BB gun and perhaps save the eyesight of children.
<P>
	A recent research study at the University of Ottawa 
demonstrated that BB guns are the leading cause of eye loss 
among children in Canada which has to be troubling to us all.

<P>

<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I think the member is 
confusing the refugee stream and the immigration stream.

	The issue here is not a claim based on whether an individual is 
or is not HIV positive. The claim made was on the basis of being 
a member of a social group, in this case sexual orientation, and 
that there was a well founded fear of persecution.
<P>
	Three years ago the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that 
sexual orientation constitutes a social group. The Geneva 
convention allows for claims to be made based on social group 
persecution. There have only been two cases in the system. One 
was refused. There is this case raised by the hon. member which 
was initially refused by the IRB and appealed to the Federal

<P>
	<B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans,

for the fishermen of Atlantic Canada is under some financial 
stress because more fishermen and more plant workers than 
originally anticipated have had to request assistance.
<P>
	One of the reasons that there are more fishermen and more 
plant workers is that from an ecological point of view, more 
fisheries have had to be closed as recently as a few months ago.

	The red fishery, which is important to the Magdalen Islands 
had to be closed, necessitating more assistance being paid out to

<P>
	While the minister knows that spending on social programs is 
about the same proportion today as it was in the seventies, would 
he confirm that the reason our accumulated debt has grown since 
1984 has been almost exclusively the result of the high interest 
rate policy of the previous government, continued by this 
government apparently, and the myriad of tax loopholes 
particularly for corporations and the wealthy?
<P>
<B>(1455 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member 
will recall that I spoke out in the early 1990s about the high 
levels of interest rates and about the policies of the previous 
government. This government has changed those policies and 
we are moving not only to cure our deficit but to improve our 
social programs as well.

	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in his questions and answers booklet on the Canadian 
firearms registration system, the Minister of Justice tells 
Canadians that his new registration system will help eliminate 
smuggling and stolen firearms as sources of supply.
<P>
	Just last Thursday the minister stated publicly that the new 
gun control legislation will do little to prevent smuggling. 
Could the minister please explain which statement is true?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the proposals we put 
before the house will help a great deal in reducing the smuggling 
of firearms. We have been through this before. <I>Hansard</I> is 
replete with detailed responses to questions that are asked daily 
in the House by the same members.
<P>
	Let me come to the specific question the member puts. I 
believe, and the government believes, that its proposals will 
help enormously. Last week it was put to me by a provincial 
counterpart, the Solicitor General of Ontario, that there is much 
more we can do. I agreed with him. Indeed there is much more 
we can do and should do. With the collaboration of the 
provincial solicitors general, I believe we can and will do more.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this minister has had 16 months to deal with gun 
smuggling. He has done nothing but table a plan to register the 
guns of law-abiding Canadians. Registration has not proven 
effective for crime deterrence in any other democracy in the 
world.
<P>
	Why does the minister not take the $85 million he has 
committed to gun registration and instead target it toward 
directly defending our borders against gun smuggling?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in large part, the 
registration system we propose is targeted at the borders to 
reduce smuggling, and we are very confident that it will have 
that result.

question is for the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food.
<P>
	Just days away from budget day, the federal minister of 
agriculture talks about reviewing all agricultural subsidies, and 
those for grain transportation in particular. He plans to replace 
existing rail carrier subsidies with direct assistance to Western 
grain producers.

intention to stop paying rail carriers subsidies and start 
subsidizing Western grain producers directly instead? And if so, 
can he undertake before this House to-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Perhaps the hon. member could ask one 
question and maybe another short one, but three is a bit much.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the subject of western grain 
transportation reform has been debated for probably the better 
part of the last 25 years.
<P>
	We intend to proceed with various aspects of that reform. 
Indeed some measures are already before the House in the form 
of proposed legislation.
<P>
	Over the course of the last number of months both the 
Minister of Transport and I have been engaged in intensive 
discussions with farmers, farm organizations and other 
stakeholders in the industry involving all aspects of Canadian 
grain handling and transportation from one end of the country to 
the other. At the time of the budget or shortly thereafter there 
should be an opportunity to describe the details.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, can 
the agriculture minister give us at this time the assurance that all 
farm producers in Canada will be treated equally and that the 
measures he will be putting forth will not allow Western 
producers to use federal subsidies to compete with Eastern 
producers?

	<B>Mr. Paul E. Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby, Ref.)</B> 
moved for leave to introduce Bill C-304, an act to amend the 
Criminal Code (prostitution).
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my hon. colleague from 
Crowfoot for seconding my introduction of first reading of the 
bill. It is my pleasure to introduce the bill to this House.
<P>
	The bill will increase the penalty for persons who engage in 
the public act to buy or sell sexual services from a summary 
conviction to an indictable offence. It would make the penalty of 
section 213 of the Criminal Code, which is public 
communication to obtain sexual services, parallel to that of 
section 212 just before it in the Criminal Code, which is 
procuring.
<P>
	A summary conviction has a maximum sentence of only six 
months. While this may be appropriate for some crimes in 
Canada, it is most certainly not appropriate for the acts of the 
public prostitution trade. With the increase to an indictable 
offence it will allow the courts to give a sentence for the 
maximum penalty of up to ten years and provide the range of 
flexibility that is needed. By such designation it changes the 
category of seriousness and affects the allocation of police 
resources. It places more flexible tools into the hands of the 
police, who instead of writing a curb-side ticket may now arrest, 
if necessary.
<P>
	Canadians are frustrated with the street trade of prostitution. 
They are upset that along with this comes widespread criminal 
drug use. I note that many Canadians want stiffer penalties for 
this behaviour and that is exactly what my bill attends to do.

<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I have the pleasure to introduce a 
second bill. Again my hon. colleague from Crowfoot is 
seconding the introduction of the first reading of this bill.
<P>
	This bill will create a separate punishment for those who 
willingly become intoxicated through alcohol and drugs and 
who during this self-induced intoxication commit a prohibited 
act.
<P>
	The bill clearly defines what is meant by a prohibited act and I 
believe that all Canadians would concur with this.
<P>
	The recent Supreme Court ruling is what began the outcry. It 
is interesting to note that it was a suggestion of the Supreme 
Court that we as members of Parliament make the necessary 
changes to an apparent flaw in the system.
<P>
	In his minority report Mr. Justice John Sopinka stated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It has been suggested that Parliament should create a new offence of 
dangerous intoxication. Such changes are for Parliament and not for this 
Court to make.</BLOCKQUOTE>

inconsistencies within the Canadian Criminal Code.

youth 14 years of age and above commits any crime of violence, 
including but not limited to murder, manslaughter, aggravated 
and sexual assault and armed robbery, he or she will

	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
my pleasure to introduce two different petitions into the House 
today.
<P>
	The first one draws to the attention of the House that although 
the proposed anti-firearms legislation, as these people call it, 
will do virtually nothing to reduce violent crime it will, 
however, severely restrict the rights and freedoms of millions of 
innocent firearm owners contrary to the very principles of 
justice upon which this country was founded.
<P>
	They ask and pray that the government refuse the anti-firearm 
proposals of the Minister of Justice and insist that he bring forth 
legislation to convict and punish criminals rather than persecute 
the innocent.
<P>
	I think that is a good emphasis.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="HUMANRIGHTS">HUMAN RIGHTS</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the second petition is from people in and around my riding. They 
ask Parliament not to amend the human rights code, the 
Canadian Human Rights Act or the Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms in any way which would tend to indicate societal 
approval of same sex relationships or of homosexuality, 
including amending the human rights code to include in the

sexual orientation.

1,000 of the undersigned residents of Canada draw to the 
attention of the House that the Canadian Broadcasting 
Corporation is Canada's national public broadcasting service 
and an agent of Her Majesty; that the CBC is funded by the 
federal government with taxpayers' dollars;  that the CBC plays 
a significant role in meeting the statutory objective set out for 
the broadcasting system of safeguarding, enriching and 
strenghthening the cultural, political, social and economic 
fabric of Canada; that the CBC has applied to televise the 
proceedings of the Paul Bernardo trial and that this application 
does not support the role of the CBC and does nothing to 
safeguard, enrich or strengthen the fabric of Canada.
<P>
	Therefore the petitioners call upon Parliament to condemn the 
actions of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and to request 
that accordance with its responsibilities as the national 
broadcaster, the CBC withdraw its application to televise the 
Paul Bernardo trial.

<P>
	They point out that the Canadian Radio-Television and 
Telecommunications Commission, the CRTC, has allowed Bell 
Canada to increase local area calling rates by $2 per month for 
each of 1995, 1996 and 1997, which represents an increase of 
approximately 50 per cent over three years. They point out that 
the proposed increases far exceed the cost of living index and 
that the proposed savings in long distance rates will be of little 
benefit to the majority of senior citizens receiving the 
guaranteed income supplement and other low income 
individuals.
<P>
<B>(1510) </B>
<P>
	Therefore, these petitioners request that Parliament urge the 
CRTC to require Bell Canada to file a plan that will address the 
issues of accessibility to local telephone service and the 
affordability of local calling rates for senior citizens who are 
receiving the guaranteed income supplement as well as other 
low income individuals in our community.

community to own and use firearm responsibly, passes careful

Speaker, I thank the hon. member for raising the point. I hope I 
will be in a position to furnish the House with an answer to her 
question later this week.
<P>
	I note that the reply will be lengthy because the Canada 
Council hands out a great number of grants to numerous 
individuals and bodies across Canada. The first reply was 
received. Certain information that the member requested was 
missing from the answer and it was sent back so that it would be 
made complete. I expect to be in possession of the complete 
answer later this week.
<P>
	If the hon. member is so concerned about saving taxpayers' 
dollars I have no doubt she would have gone to the Library of 
Parliament and looked up the annual reports of the Canada 
Council wherein all its grants are listed. She could have 
obtained the answer there instead of putting a question on the 
Order Paper which will cost many thousands of extra dollars to 
provide to the House in the copies and in the form that she 
wishes to have it.

this is the fourth time I rise in the House to point out to the

October 19. This is more than 120 days ago, although normally, 
it takes 45 days to get a reply. It has now been four months, and I 
have yet to get an answer to my question, unlike the hon. 
member for Calgary Southeast.
<P>
	The Minister of Public Works is doing everything in his power 
to prevent us from having access to the information I requested. 
I wonder whether the government is trying to keep members 
from having access to the information they need. I ask the 
Speaker to urge the government to observe the rules of this 
House. In my opinion, this shows utter contempt for the 
Standing Orders of this House. Could I have a commitment from 
the hon. member, a specific date on which I will get the 
information I requested four months ago?

sociological factors at our peril.

over those of the hon. member. The hon. member will perhaps 
remember that Dr. Leschied was at the committee hearing. I

offer young people an alternative to the Criminal Code, which 
applies to adults. Our society is aiming not only at stopping and 
penalizing the criminal behaviour of young people, but also at 
giving them training to help them learn and adjust. For this 
reason, responsibility for administering the Young Offenders 
Act does not rest with the judicial system alone, but also with the 
social services set up by the various provinces.
<P>
	In Quebec, organized services for young people in trouble and 
young offenders date back to the establishment of the first 
industrial and reform schools in the second half of the 19th 
century, that is, even before the federal Parliament adopted the 
first juvenile delinquents act in 1908.
<P>
	More than 8,000 social workers from various professions 
currently work in youth centres in Quebec. They are involved 
annually with 85,000 young people and their families, including 
nearly 22,000 young persons who are referred to them under the 
Young Offenders Act. These experts represent an extraordinary 
resource we would be wrong to forgo.
<P>
	We are in the curious situation in the House today of 
discussing a bill to amend the Young Offenders Act in third 
reading, when almost all those making representations before 
the House Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs had 
asked that the adoption of these amendments be delayed.
<P>
	These people all asked the Minister of Justice to move 
immediately on to the second phase of his plan of action-an 
in-depth evaluation of the present act and its 
application-before making such substantial amendments to the 
act.
<P>
	Based on this evaluation, the amendments proposed by the 
justice minister could be reviewed and all members could vote 
with the full conviction that they are giving the parties involved 
in fighting youth crime the legal tool to do so, while at the same 
time promoting deterrence and rehabilitation.
<P>
	Why is the justice minister refusing to take this logical step? 
Can the minister convince us that the amendments he has 
proposed must definitely be passed without delay?
<P>
	In preparing my statement, I was struck by the fact that none 
of the stakeholders I met would feel any better equipped to fight 
youth crime if the amendments proposed by the minister were 
passed. On the contrary, they are convinced that their job would 
be even more difficult, both in respect of the public and the 
young persons themselves.
<P>
	For instance, increasing sentences for serious offences may 
create a false sense of security among the public, although past 
experience gives us no reason to expect that such a measure 
would have a positive effect, either on the level of crime or on 
recidivism among young persons.
<P>
<B>(1525) </B>
<P>
	Moreover, by basically limiting detention orders to offences 
involving serious assault with bodily harm, the act would 
deprive the judicial system and social workers of an instrument 
sometimes necessary to the rehabilitation of certain young 
persons for whom recidivism, schooling, family and personal 
situation and other circumstances must be taken into account. In 
short, a prison sentence may be appropriate in certain cases even 
if the offences in question did not entail serious personal harm.
<P>
	In other words, we can assert on the basis of present findings 
that passing this act would not provide any greater measure of 
social protection and that the quality of supervision for certain 
young persons would suffer. The question which naturally 
comes to mind is the following: Why is the Minister of Justice 
bent on pushing through so quickly an act that all those 
concerned doubt will be effective?
<P>
	Many people think the answer to it is that the Minister of 
Justice has given in to a small but very vocal group that favours 
lex talionis, ``an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth''. This group 
is reacting to the small glimpse they have gotten of juvenile 
delinquency and to the knowledge they have gleaned from the 
media of certain extreme but very rare manifestations of that 
criminality, such as crimes against persons. Left to its own 
devices and fanned by radio talk-show hosts, this fraction of 
public opinion is demanding that draconian measures be taken 
against juvenile delinquency.
<P>
	By giving in to such pressure, the Minister of Justice shows 
that he pays more attention to what radio talk-show hosts say 
than to those working in the sector. Has he forgotten that his 
primary mission is to propose effective laws to Canadians that 
enforce our ideals of justice?
<P>
	We are very disappointed that the Minister of Justice has 
abdicated his primary responsibility by proposing repressive 
and ineffective amendments inspired by ultraconservative 
opinions on social policy first propagated by the Reform Party, 
then apparently adopted by the Liberal party as their own.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois believes that we can and must channel 
the legitimate concerns of the population towards a better 
understanding of juvenile delinquency and towards a 
willingness to apply adequate preventative and deterrent 
measures, as well as effective rehabilitation measures for young 
offenders.
<P>
	The minister promises that he will take that approach later, 
while forcing us to adopt amendments which go against the 
spirit of the very approach he proposes. The members of this 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9834"> 9834 </A></B>
<P>
House must understand that the amendments proposed by the 
Minister of Justice reflect a policy and values that are 
fundamentally different from those underlying the act itself.
<P>
	By increasingly linking sentencing to the seriousness of the 
offences committed as the sole factor, these amendments thwart 
the search for measures consistent with both the seriousness of 
the offences and the needs of the young offenders. This search is 
the very basis for the existence of a Young Offenders Act 
distinct from the Criminal Code.
<P>
	How can they ask us to renounce today the underlying 
principles of a law that is supposed to undergo a thorough review 
in the coming months?
<P>
	We are well aware of the inconsistency in the approach 
proposed by the Minister of Justice and will vote against these 
amendments. We know, however, that the bill is at the third 
reading stage and that, unless it is withdrawn by the Minister of 
Justice, it will be passed by the government majority, probably 
with the support of Reform members.
<P>
	Therefore, I ask the Minister of Justice straight out to 
reconsider his position and initiate his proposed review of the 
Young Offenders Act now before this bill is passed.
<P>
<B>(1530) </B>
<P>
	I am confident that such a decision would be widely supported 
across Canada, and it would be the only acceptable option from 
Quebec's point of view. In Quebec, this bill was opposed not 
only by those who work with young offenders but by the Quebec 
government, which expressed its opposition very clearly 
through its Minister of Justice, its Minister of Health and Social 
Services, and its Minister of Public Security.
<P>
	As early as June 14, 1994, Roger Lefebvre, as the then 
Minister of Justice and on behalf of his colleagues, the Minister 
of Health and Social Services and the Minister of Public 
Security, told his federal counterpart about his deep concerns 
regarding Bill C-37. Quebec's position, together with a detailed 
analysis of the bill, was relayed to the federal deputy minister as 
early as September 12 and tabled before the House of Commons 
justice committee.
<P>
	Let me read the main conclusions of this analysis: Bill C-37 
does not resolve the problem adequately; Bill C-37 is 
unfounded; Bill C-37 is full of inconsistencies and ambiguity; 
Bill C-37 has undesirable and unjustified effects in terms of 
service organization and principles as well as in clinical and 
financial terms.
<P>
	Quebec's position on this bill could hardly be clearer and 
more devastating. I want to emphasize the fact that this position 
was developed by members of the previous Cabinet in Quebec, a 
Liberal Cabinet, and that it was fully endorsed by the present 
Party Quebecois government. Therefore, there is no doubt that 
this position reflects a very large consensus in Quebec society.
<P>
	The federal justice minister must understand that, should the 
amendments contained in this bill be passed, the justice, health 
and social services departments as well as those primarily 
responsible for their enforcement in Quebec would then be 
forced to put into application amendments to the Young 
Offenders Act that they unanimously denounced and against 
which the vast majority of members from Quebec would have 
voted.
<P>
	This brings to light a serious situation where the Canadian 
majority would impose upon the people of Quebec values and 
directions to which they object.
<P>
	This situation appears all the more unacceptable that most 
witnesses from the rest of Canada and even federal justice 
analysts agree that Quebec is in fact a model in combatting 
youth crime and rehabilitating young offenders.
<P>
	While the youth crime rate in Quebec compares favourably to 
the rate in the other provinces, the number of cases transferred is 
much lower than it is in the other provinces. There are only 9.4 
per cent of referrals in Quebec, with 25.4 per cent of the youth 
population between the ages of 12 and 17.
<P>
	This is due to a large extent to the enforcement measures put 
in place in Quebec and a more extensive use of the alternative 
measures program. In addition, the emphasis put on the Youth 
Protection Act and its enforcement in Quebec makes it possible 
to deal with difficult family circumstances without resorting to 
the Youth Offenders Act. In short, Quebec has developed an 
integrated and efficient approach and the other provinces should 
follow suit.
<P>
	How are we to explain to our fellow Quebec citizens that, if 
this bill is passed, we will have to abide by the wishes of the 
federal Parliament even though these amendments were rejected 
unanimously by the Quebec departments and officials in charge 
of enforcing them?
<P>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
	Of course we will have to mention the constitution, although 
the hon. member for Shawinigan and Prime Minister of Canada 
does not like it when we bring this up. Well, according to the 
Canadian constitution, the Young Offenders Act is a federal 
matter, although its implementation is up to the provincial 
governments.
<P>
	Quebec will have to submit to the will of Parliament in this 
respect, until we change the constitution or decide to draft our 
own constitution, as a sovereign country.
<P>
	Some members or observers may think I am just using this 
debate to promote the sovereignist option by stressing the 
differences between Quebec and the federal government. That is 
certainly not the case, since I have asked the Minister of Justice 
to delay the passage of this bill and to proceed with a review that 
would be beneficial to all the provinces of Canada.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9835"> 9835 </A></B>
<P>
	If the Minister of Justice says no, I will have to conclude that 
we are faced with two different philosophies regarding youth 
crime and that the rest of Canada, by using the powers conferred 
by the constitution on the federal Parliament, is forcing on 
Quebec an approach that it cannot accept. I think that young 
people in Quebec who are in trouble deserve a more satisfactory 
response than the one proposed by the Minister of Justice, which 
draws its inspiration from the repressive and ultraconservative 
policies that come to us from Western Canada.
<P>
	In any case, the Bloc Quebecois will do everything in its 
power to stop these policies at the Quebec border. First, by 
voting against this bill, and then by maintaining our support for 
sovereign status for Quebec, which would give it exclusive 
legislative powers.
<P>
[English] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Bruce-Grey, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
know that Quebec has a different approach to young offenders 
and it works quite well. I wonder if there is not enough leeway in 
the bill for judges to make a decision that would accommodate 
Quebec's option.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Tremblay (Rosemont):</B> Mr. Speaker, the government of 
Quebec submitted an analysis, which I could give my colleague. 
It was tabled with the House justice committee. Very clearly, it 
says first that this bill is not justified. Reasons are given for 
increasing sentences. Sentences were just increased in 1992, 
when Kim Campbell was the Minister of Justice. In 1992, she 
increased sentences for young offenders.
<P>
	We have yet to see the results. Now we are giving in again. We 
are trying to be like the people of California, or just about. Their 
biggest budget items are prisons and the police. We want health 
and education to be the biggest items here, not prisons and the 
police.
<P>
	In the bill, sentences are being increased. What is more 
serious in this bill from the standpoint of young people? One 
very important point is that, from now on, detention will be 
almost impossible for young people who have not committed 
serious crimes against individuals.
<P>
	For example, young people involved in car theft networks or 
even in drug or cigarette trafficking, who have not been caught 
committing crimes against individuals, but who need to be 
withdrawn from their surroundings, must be detained for 
rehabilitation. The bill will restrict the ability of those in these 
situations who must intervene and remove young people from 
their surroundings so that they do not become hardened 
criminals.
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	On the one hand, unfortunately, sentences are being 
increased, while on the other, offences for which such sentences 
can be imposed are being restricted. Basically, however, if the 
system is adequate-which is unfortunately not the case in all 
provinces-being in  custody allows for the young person to be 
extricated from criminal surroundings and rehabilitated before 
it is too late. The other aspect which seems absurd to us is that a 
16 or 17-year old will have to prove that he should be heard in 
youth court.
<P>
	First of all, I would like to point out a misconception which I 
hear on a regular basis from members of the Reform Party. In 
certain cases, young persons might clearly fare better before an 
adult court than under the Young Offenders Act because the 
Young Offenders Act also provides for extended sentences in 
certain cases to allow for rehabilitation and, very often, such 
young persons are removed from a series of measures instituted 
to help them, but also to supervise them.
<P>
	I listened to what was said and at times I found it quite 
astonishing. Putting young persons into custody under the 
present system is no picnic for them, but it provides for good 
supervision and gives them a chance to make a fresh start for 
themselves. The bill refers to rehabilitation; the preamble has 
been changed. Nothing in the amendments provides for 
improved rehabilitation. Changing the preamble and including 
all the measures which appeal to the Reform Party will not 
improve the act.
<P>
	In Quebec, we are systematically opposed to it. All 
institutions, departments concerned and interested parties know 
that it is taking us in the wrong direction.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in rising to speak on Bill C-37, which amends the 
Young Offenders Act and the Criminal Code, I am taken back to 
earlier stages in my professional career as a sometime crown 
prosecutor and a defence lawyer. At a later stage I specialized in 
the teaching of Soviet law and the aspects of Soviet criminal 
law. I speak now of non-political crimes where that country had 
moved in the sentencing phase into much more of a sociological 
approach than a conventional criminological approach.
<P>
	The bill is interesting because it comes at a time of historical 
transition in our society and in the world community as a whole, 
with the social tensions that are always present in a period of 
very rapid change which outstrip the ability of the social 
processes to accommodate to the changes.
<P>
	As one who has to deal a lot with statistics, I have 
reservations, but it is a fact that the statistics show no substantial 
increase in the numbers of crimes being perpetrated in our 
society. It is also a fact, I think beyond doubt, that the intensity 
of the crimes and the violence of them are greatly augmented. 
This is what explains the public demand, it is certainly reflected 
in one of the opposition parties, for a toughening up of the 
criminal law, if one can use those terms.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9836"> 9836 </A></B>
<P>
	The criminal law, not less than any other branch of public law, 
represents an attempt to balance the larger public interests 
against individual interests. Sometimes the metaphor of the 
pendulum has been used, but the pendulum which has swung 
much more in the immediate past years in favour of the rights of 
accused persons has swung, in the last several years certainly, 
much more strongly in favour of the protection of societal 
interests. We all reflect that.
<P>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
	It is reflected in the petitions presented in this House today. I 
note with interest that members of several different parties 
present petitions on this general question. All of us as members 
of Parliament receive letters from our constituents.
<P>
	One of the very sad things in all this is that since Jeremy 
Bentham first formulated his plans on penal reform, on curing of 
the offenders, one has the terrible feeling that not as much 
progress has been made in that as a scientific discipline as 
should have been made. Therefore we come back to the issue 
with this bill: How has the balance been struck by the minister in 
approaching the demands for amendment of the existing Young 
Offenders Act and the Criminal Code? How has he responded to 
the conflicting social interests?
<P>
	Listening to the debate, one was struck by the difference in the 
attitude of the two opposition parties. The official opposition, 
and I take the criticisms of the hon. member for Rosemont as 
reflecting this, felt that the measure was too severe, that it did 
not adequately reflect the social interests in protecting young 
offenders. With the other opposition party, I think the criticism 
was made that it did not go far enough.
<P>
	If the minister manages to build in both those criticisms of his 
work, it may strike many that maybe he has found the middle 
way. Let us have a look and see exactly what has been done.
<P>
	There is the increase in the maximum sentences for teenagers 
to ten years for first degree murder or a maximum of seven years 
in the case of second degree murder. This reflects quite clearly 
the public concern that young offenders can commit murder and 
walk away from them.
<P>
	I thought that the hon. member for Rosemont suggested that 
this was a simplistic approach and it did not take enough account 
of the element of recidivism which he feels is still severe in 
relation to young offenders who have been imprisoned. Perhaps 
we can take a look at that a little later when we examine other 
parts of the proposed bill.
<P>
	The second part of the bill is significant and concerns young 
offenders, 16 or 17 year olds, charged with serious personal 
injury offences which are defined in the revised act as murder, 
attempted murder, manslaughter, aggravated sexual assault, and 
aggravated assault. These persons will be tried in adult court 
unless they can show a judge that public protection and 
rehabilitation can be  achieved through the youth court. It 
changes the burden of carriage of the suit significantly from the 
preceding act which it now proposes to amend.
<P>
	The bill does reflect the public interest in the public right to 
know the facts of offences. Parameters must be established in 
this regard.
<P>
	In this House in recent days we have heard a certain cry of 
anguish from many members about what many feel are indecent 
attempts of some public media to open the books on recent sex 
offences and murders involving young people. Members know 
the cases without my citing the names.
<P>
	The public interest, the public right to know demands 
increasingly that the courts be opened up. This process is 
reflected architecturally in the grand design of the Supreme 
Court of British Columbia, Arthur Erickson's design, which is 
literally intended to allow people to walk in from the streets and 
through the courts.
<P>
	Courts used to be shut up. When I was a young lawyer, they 
were closed. It was very hard to find your way and was panelled 
in dark wood. The court officials seemed to do their best to keep 
people out. Therefore this particular aspect is certainly there. In 
so far as court proceedings are a part of the general public 
educational process in criminal law, I think this is a step forward 
without any apparent disadvantages to it.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	The time that 16 and 17 year old young offenders convicted of 
murder in adult court must serve before they can be considered 
for parole is extended. This is a reaction generally to a public 
feeling that the parole system today is not functioning as it 
should. It is being addressed in a more general way by other 
sections of the justice ministry.
<P>
	Suffice it to say, for the most serious offence of all, the 
extension of the time to be served in the case of young offenders 
responds to very clear public interest. This was expressed to all 
members of Parliament through petition and through direct 
correspondence to us.
<P>
	The provision for information sharing among professional 
people, school officials, police, and certain public groups when 
public safety is at risk has been criticized by some as exposing 
young people to public obloquy. It has been criticized by one of 
the opposition parties in this debate as not going far enough. 
There are two things to remember.
<P>
	We have moved a long way from the 18th century notion that 
people were exposed in the docks, in the public stocks in the 
village square, and made to wear a letter on their chest if they 
were convicted of certain offences. It reflects a reaction to this 
but it also recognizes awareness of the relevance of the charter 
of rights. The charter of rights, as interpreted in the 
jurisprudence in our courts, is very strict in its definition of the 
limits of the public right to know and the protection of the 
privacy of individuals.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9837"> 9837 </A></B>
<P>
	In this particular sense, it seems to me the minister has gone 
as far as he sensibly can go. He is a law reformer who wants his 
law to prevail. He does not want it to be challenged endlessly 
before the courts and perhaps thrown out on the basis of the 
rational interpretation of the court jurisprudence that all of us as 
professionals in the field know how to make.
<P>
	Similarly, with the provisions for rehabilitation and treatment 
of young offenders, I was struck by the comments of the member 
for Rosemont, the official opposition. I think we are all ready 
and willing to learn from the experience of other countries and 
certainly from provinces within our federal system. I was struck 
by the thoughtful question posed by a member of my own party 
to the member for Rosemont.
<P>
	This exchange of information is important. As far as the 
federal law is concerned, it represents a significant advance on 
provisions as they now exist.
<P>
	One very interesting area is the provision the minister makes 
for the private law responsibility of offenders, here specifically 
young offenders, where property crimes or less serious offences 
are what is involved. The concept seems to be the restorative one 
that the criminal offender, the delinquent, should not merely 
purge an offence in terms of suffering punishment but should 
also assume the burden of correcting the social situation that he 
or she has so rudely disturbed.
<P>
	If young people wantonly destroy property, we can take the 
Singapore approach and you can cane them in well publicized 
ways. Or we can ask the young people to repair the property as 
part of their sentence. We can ask them to accept the 
responsibility for what they have done which I think is an 
excellent approach. I hope it will be extended more widely 
within our criminal law.
<P>
<B>(1555 ) </B>
<P>
	Contrary to public impression and also public impression of 
some public officials, the way always exists under our law for 
private law actions to compel just that, the restoration of the 
situation to as it existed before. Actions are quite common in 
continental European law against the parents of young offenders 
or against the young offenders themselves for that matter, for 
whom their parents would stand in responsibility.
<P>
	In any case, this is innovative. It shows the attempt the 
minister is making to produce a coherent law that balances the 
old with the new social imperatives in a period of rapid change. 
In making compromises, it strikes a balance that takes us beyond 
the social problem as it has been thought to exist.
<P>
	On this basis this is a valuable step forward. We have to be 
especially careful when dealing with young offenders in facing 
the reality that long incarceration with young people encourages 
recidivism and may be the least effective social control of all.
<P>
	Nevertheless the minister, in relation to the supreme offences, 
first and second degree murder, has taken the step of increasing 
the punishment. In other areas he has recognized the public wish 
to be involved but within the limitation that we will not 
encourage prurience by publishing televised tapes that people 
recorded of their victims. We will go so far as to say the public 
has a right to know.
<P>
	We will bring in the social services people to encourage 
rehabilitation of young people. We will accept the notion that in 
the protection of the public responsible public officials in 
schools and elsewhere need to be given information. However 
that information must be done in conformity with the Charter of 
Rights and Freedoms as interpreted by the courts and as 
predictably applying in cases such as the present.
<P>
	On this basis, I am happy to commend Bill C-37 for adoption 
by this House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have a hard time understanding this. A 17-year-old murders an 
individual, such as the mother in Edmonton. Someone else, who 
happens to be one year older, does the same thing. For him it is 
an automatic life sentence for first degree murder because he is 
one year older.
<P>
	Why should there be a difference between a 17-year-old and 
an 18-year-old? Why should a 17-year-old who performs that 
kind of act receive three years, which is very possible, and an 
18-year-old who performs that kind of heinous act receive a 
25-year sentence?
<P>
	I am struggling with the difference. Why do we not take 16 
and 17 year olds and say they are in adult court, period? Why 
include something that says unless it can be proven that it would 
be more to their benefit to be in juvenile court? Are we trying to 
create more work for lawyers? That is probably one of the 
motives, but I would not dare suggest it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McWhinney:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the fruitful 
question raised by the hon. member. I would have thought the 
bill as presented by the minister responded to the specific cases 
he raised. These 16 and 17 year olds are to be dealt with in adult 
court under the bill. The maximum sentence is 10 years for first 
degree murder.
<P>
	We are getting into this issue of marginal variation and where 
do we draw the line? Would we extend it from 16 years down to 
15, or why not then 14? A life sentence and even death sentences 
were routinely applied in earlier periods of criminology to 
young children. We have obviously gone beyond that.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9838"> 9838 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	We have tried to establish a new line which reflects present 
societal expectations and present societal realities. It is always 
possible to amend this, but I would have thought that there is a 
significant change now made in applying this 10-year minimum 
sentence for first degree murder. On that particular score I think 
that the bill represents an advance. However, if on experience it 
is found that changes are needed, it can be amended again.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul E. Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak again on Bill C-37, an act to 
amend the Young Offenders Act.
<P>
	This matter is close to my heart, as I lived with young offender 
issues and their consequences long before the Young Offenders 
Act became the law of the land. I was a part of the more than 10 
years of consultation and wrangling that occurred which finally 
produced Bill C-61 back in 1981, which brought us this tragic, 
social science experiment perpetrated upon the Canadian 
people.
<P>
	I have a clear message for the Minister of Justice and his 
cabinet colleagues. I also want to wake up the policy section of 
the Department of Justice which has led the justice minister into 
the mistake of Bill C-37.
<P>
	I can appreciate that the justice minister has to take what he 
believes is the best advice he can get from his advisers. I say to 
those few in the department who have misguided the minister 
that the shame of the country is on their shoulders.
<P>
	The condescending prescriptive approach of Bill C-37 is 
fundamentally out of step with mainstream Canadian values and 
it makes one's heart sink. I do not know what I can say to drag 
the members opposite into the nineties, clear their heads and 
listen to what I am saying. They should not discount what I say 
because of where I stand in the House. I claim particular 
credibility about the Young Offenders Act.
<P>
	This country does not need Bill C-37. Rather, it needs a 
renewed Young Offenders Act, one which will improve the 
safety of our streets, put Canadians' minds at ease and reflect 
what Canadians want.
<P>
	Members of this House and the minister, listen to what I am 
saying and make the appropriate adjustments. Bill C-37 is 
wrong. Hopefully we can get it right at the 10-year review.
<P>
	Since coming to Ottawa I have sat through most of the justice 
committee meetings which dealt with Bill C-37. I have held 
town hall meetings and have done widespread surveys in my 
riding of New Westminster-Burnaby. I have also consulted 
across the country. The conclusion is the same, the Young 
Offenders Act and the amendments proposed as part of Bill 
C-37 do not come close to solving the problems associated with 
young offenders today.
<P>
	In a survey included in a recent householder of mine I asked 
constituents a straightforward question: Does the current Young 
Offenders Act need to be amended? The yes response was an 
astounding 96.3 per cent. At town hall meetings in my riding the 
consensus was to lower the age and to change other essential 
elements.
<P>
	This feeling is widespread across Canada. However, the 
bleeding heart Liberals do not want to admit it. Clearly the YOA 
is fundamentally flawed and has not achieved the acceptance 
that we would expect if it were operationally appropriate.
<P>
	Canadians have had it with high taxes and an uncontrollable 
deficit and debt. They have had it with gun control measures 
which do not deter criminals. Most of all, they have had it with 
the Young Offenders Act which does not protect innocent people 
or support the principles of specific or general deterrence. 
Instead it seems to protect the rights of the offender in a manner 
out of balance with that of the victims.
<P>
	The Young Offenders Act makes certain that the identity of a 
young offender is not known even if this puts the general public 
at high risk. Further, the Young Offenders Act fails to recognize 
the rights of the victim as a needed integral part of the justice 
system, as there is no legal recognition of their stake in the 
general proceedings.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice asked for consultation, such as his 
1993 discussion paper ``Toward Safer Communities''. The 
public thinks that the minister really cares about what it thinks. 
What the public does not know is that the minister already 
finished drafting the bill before the last responses were 
received.
<P>
	True consultation is something which all members of the 
Liberal Party need to learn. Perhaps they should take a lesson 
from the members on this side of the House. To consult means 
not only to listen but to implement what the majority wants. 
Canadians are being reminded again that the Liberals' definition 
of consultation is to appear to listen and then to follow their 
original agenda.
<P>
<B>(1605 ) </B>
<P>
	Before the drafting of Bill C-37 there were rallies upon rallies 
across the country for drastic changes to the YOA. What 
happened? There were no drastic changes. Now on the eve of the 
1995 budget Canadians are holding tax rallies from Victoria to 
St. John's demanding no more taxes. What will happen? The 
finance minister will raise taxes and increase the deficit all in 
one shot. The Liberals will still have the nerve to say that this is 
what the general public wants or should have.
<P>
	The Reform Party appreciates the grassroots and listens very 
carefully. Our plan of reform of the YOA is community based, 
with a history of a bottom up approach, rather than the 
traditional bureaucratic, top down, no grassroots approach. 
Therefore, the Reform proposals I want to present are the ones 
that the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9839"> 9839 </A></B>
<P>
Canadian public wants and the ones that the Canadian public 
deserves.
<P>
	One, lower the young offenders age of definition of young 
person from 10 to 15 years inclusive from 12 to 17 years 
inclusive. Two, any young offender who commits an indictable 
offence could possibly be transferred to adult court. Three, 
remove extra privacy and secrecy provisions in the Young 
Offenders Act and treat all YOA records, access to information, 
ability to publish in the same manner as is for adults.
<P>
	Four, sentencing must emphasize victim compensation, 
community service, skills training, education and deterrence to 
others. In custodial facilities opportunities for rehabilitation 
must be emphasized in a disciplined environment. Medical 
psychological treatment orders should not require the consent of 
the young offender.
<P>
	Five, parents of young offenders should be held responsible 
for compensating victims for property crimes if it can be 
demonstrated that they have not made a reasonable effort to 
exercise parental control. Six, victims must be given legal 
standing in youth court and be invited to be involved at all stages 
of court.
<P>
	Constituents often ask why the government always tinkers 
with the YOA instead of making all the necessary changes in one 
try. I think we all know the answer. By changing it slightly 
throughout its mandate, the government makes it appear that it 
is really working hard for the people while basically preserving 
the status quo and not changing what it originally gave us.
<P>
	Many members spoke on Bill C-37 at second reading stage 
and many more are going to be speaking at this stage. However, 
very few who will speak on this bill have experienced the 
frustrations of the Young Offenders Act firsthand. I realize that 
many of my colleagues in this House are lawyers but I know that 
only a few have ever dealt with defending or prosecuting a 
young offender.
<P>
	As a former probation officer in the British Columbia Youth 
Court, I had to deal with the Young Offenders Act on a daily 
basis. I have lived and breathed the Young Offenders Act 
problems for years. As an officer of the court I did my best to 
administer at the street level the Young Offenders Act and its 
predecessor, the Juvenile Delinquents Act of 1908.
<P>
	Beyond the lawyer who may have defended a youth at court, I 
regularly made home visits with young offenders and surveyed 
the social context of the offender. I worked hard to promote 
innovative resolutions to varied crises in case management, 
bringing together public health, social work and psychiatry in 
the schools to respond to particular needs. This both pre-court 
and post-court effort was happening long before the Young 
Offenders Act became law. The reality of administering the 
sentences and consequences of the Young Offenders Act is far 
removed from court proceedings. This different world is not 
comprehended very well by legal drafters and policy people.
<P>
	I mention this as it relates not only to what should be done to 
fix the YOA but in respect to the credibility of the message 
giver. The Bloc accused me of nostalgic fascism when I rose to 
speak about the Young Offenders Act on May 12, 1994.
<P>
	I want to remind my detractors in this House and those few 
lawyers who think they know something about young 
offenders-it seems that everyone in this House has an opinion 
about youth crime-that my recommendations come within the 
context of years of intimate working knowledge of trying to 
make the system work at the level of basic application.
<P>
	The Reform Party's proposals are not right wing reactionary, 
but rooted deeply in direct experience and a careful evaluation 
of the balance between community desires and specific offender 
concerns.
<P>
	The member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce is nationally known 
for his misguided views about offenders. At report stage he was 
again attributing views to the Reform position on Bill C-37 
which had more to do with covering his own guilt about what he 
and his colleagues did to this country when a previous Liberal 
administration, which included the current Prime Minister, told 
Canadians what was good for them and thereby gave us the 
Young Offenders Act.
<P>
	I was involved in early consultations when the Juvenile 
Delinquents Act was being changed to the early version of the 
Young Offenders Act. Philosophies are varied. I have seen 
violent youth released because of minor technicalities and flaws 
in the act. The Young Offenders Act is terribly flawed and will 
only further harm Canadians if it is kept in its present state, 
including if the amendments to Bill C-37 are given royal assent.
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	I tried as a professional to defend the system with the tool box 
of rules and resources that I had at my disposal. I found the act at 
times to be very cumbersome, a liberal statement of unrealistic 
hope over reality, inflexible rules over common sense, a sense of 
government betrayal to many victims, and a carte blanche to the 
self-centred predator.
<P>
	On a regular basis I ran into frustrated parents on both sides. 
Some parents wanted the law to do something with an offending 
son or daughter but the hands of the authorities, including mine 
as a court officer, were tied. Victims were always asking the 
same questions, why the parents of young offenders cannot be 
held accountable, why the guardians who are supposed to be 
doing their duty and who fail to act cannot be held accountable 
for what they allowed to happen. How many times have we all 
heard the comment when a young offender is caught: ``Where 
are the parents?''
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9840"> 9840 </A></B>
<P>
	This government gave its answer to the country and it was in 
plain, clear English. It could not care less. In December 1994 
this bill was at committee stage. At that time the Liberal and 
Reform parties brought forward amendments that would alter 
Bill C-37. Every amendment the Reform Party put forward was 
voted down by the Liberals, not because they may have 
disagreed with the amendment but because some were afraid to 
break party ranks. They were afraid to do what was right for the 
country.
<P>
	One of our amendments would have included some limited 
parental accountability to the Young Offenders Act. The 
proposed change was to clause 13 of the bill. It asked the courts 
to order the person having custodial care and control of the 
young person who fails to reasonably exercise foreseeable 
parental duty to pay and to order such person at such time and on 
such terms as the court may fix an amount by way of 
compensation for loss of property, for loss of income or support 
for special damages for personal injury arising from the 
commission of the offence where the value thereof is readily 
ascertainable, but no order shall be made for general damages.
<P>
	It is now a record for the whole country to see where this 
government stands. This government is determined to have its 
own way, to defend the status quo and to continue the old style 
way of governing this country. The Liberals only listened as 
they were preparing the red book. They put in the red book what 
the people wanted to hear but then they quickly forgot what they 
had heard.
<P>
	The book promised changes to the Young Offenders Act. 
More so, it promised to deal with Canadians' concerns. It was 
100 per cent smoke and mirrors, I think. Canadians' thoughts 
were not even brought to the table.
<P>
	Let us look at what has been accomplished. The Liberals were 
elected as the government and the people are still suffering 
under an ill fated Young Offenders Act. By failing to take bold 
action to correct what was largely not working and introducing 
legislation just to mollify a restless public and fulfil an election 
promise with the call ``trust us'', this government has fallen 
short and let us down.
<P>
	The Liberals' efforts are simply a top down, we know best 
answer to an increasingly aware and justifiably demanding 
populace. I am most pessimistic about any result from the 
announced 10-year review.
<P>
	Members of this House of Commons may not feel the 
backlash from constituents just yet, but be sure that when they 
vie for re-election constituents from coast to coast will be 
asking what Liberal Party members did to improve the Young 
Offenders Act. When these Liberal MPs have to really defend to 
their constituents the inadequate improvements electors will 
look for the party that will truly represent the people and that 
party will certainly be the Reform Party.
<P>
	We have a social philosophy of openness and community 
accountability that the old style Liberal ideology just cannot 
seem to comprehend. A new Young Offenders Act must be 
socially resonant. It must clearly demonstrate Canadian 
society's values and mores. It must be an instrument not only of 
rehabilitation and treatment but also of deterrence and orderly 
denunciation. It must reflect mainstream Canadian values.
<P>
	Parents are concerned for the safety of our children. They are 
demanding an accountability of the justice system to the 
community and they want to have a sense of ownership in the 
process of justice. They are frustrated and angry that the current 
system seems to operate for and around a select enclave of 
justice professionals, the criminologists, the legal community, 
corrections workers, offender care agencies and the police.
<P>
	Nine pages of this bill relate to amendments around a faulty 
premise. I say clearly to the minister let go of these outdated 
notions and stop the tangled bureaucratic response where one 
line in the act would suffice to simply state that a youth court 
record and an adult criminal record are one and the same of a 
continuum to be kept in one computer and handled like all other 
criminal records.
<P>
	Society sees violent crime with abhorrence, needing 
denunciation and a sensible social defence response.
<P>
<B>(1615 ) </B>
<P>
	If the violent 16 and 17 year old young offender is kept within 
the bounds of the Young Offenders Act, the maximum penalty 
for first degree murder would be 10 years. If that same violent 
offender were dealt with in adult court, the penalty for first 
degree murder would be life imprisonment. While 10 years 
under the new proposal would seem to be sufficiently harsh, the 
reality is that probably only 6 years would be spent in detention 
at most, with the remaining 4 years to be spent under community 
supervision.
<P>
	At the other end of the spectrum are the youngsters 10 and 11 
years old who are flexing their egos and daring society to take 
them to task. Under the provisions of Bill C-37, they remain 
untouchable. By the time they are 12 years old, the hard core are 
street wise and becoming increasingly sophisticated in testing 
the system. When they finally appear as young offenders, they 
are already beyond being intimidated by the system. The 
successive warnings and breaks they receive as young offenders 
then become meaningless.
<P>
	They often are too deeply entrenched in the game to see or 
desire a way out. However I believe that 10 and 11 year olds, if 
brought under the umbrella of the justice system, publicly 
denounced and placed in programs of education and 
rehabilitation, would be much more responsive to efforts to set 
them straight.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9841"> 9841 </A></B>
<P>
	It would provide the legal tools to break the offending cycle 
and require the social services of public health, social work and 
education to deal co-operatively and resolutely with these 
individuals.
<P>
	The Reform Party cannot support this bill. It does not 
represent the wishes of my constituents. Some of the members 
who sit across from me on the government benches represent 
ridings close to mine. I have received correspondence from their 
constituents. These constituents do not support Bill C-37 and 
therefore neither should their member of Parliament.
<P>
	The one saving grace for this legislation is the second phase 
that will take place later this year. The Standing Committee on 
Justice and Legal Affairs will have the opportunity to hear 
witnesses from all across Canada as part of a 10-year review of 
not only the amendments to Bill C-37 but the entire Young 
Offenders Act.
<P>
	I understand the committee will travel across the country and 
make itself available for all Canadians to provide input. I want 
to encourage the chairman of the committee to solicit witnesses 
from all groups and not stack the hearings with bleeding hearts 
as was done sometimes during the committee stage.
<P>
	As well, the Minister of Justice must respect the wishes of 
those who provide the input for this 10-year review since these 
are the people who are affected most by such changes. The 
minister has a second chance to do what is right, namely lower 
age limits, deal with serious offenders in adult court, eliminate 
publication bans, put victims into the system and make parents 
responsible for property crimes committed by the youth.
<P>
	Let the YOA become a short, clear statement in principle 
rather than a tangled act that is becoming a retirement plan for 
lawyers. Bill C-37 is off track and I call on the government to set 
it right during the 10-year review.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to compliment my colleague on a very well delivered 
speech. He said some great words.
<P>
	I too have had lots of experience with youth over a 35-year 
period. Could he explain or comment on his views of the young 
offender under the age of 12 at that time? How real was it and 
how informed and knowledgeable was that age of child, 
anywhere from 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 or whatever the age might be as 
compared to the idea now that they are not accountable?
<P>
	I would like his comments on the people who were under age 
12.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Forseth:</B> Mr. Speaker, we know that common law 
tradition previously was that we would not put anyone under 
seven years of age through the criminal process. We had 
developed through common practice of the administration of the 
provinces under the old Juvenile Delinquents Act that no one 
under 10 years old was ever processed.
<P>
	Our suggestions of changing the age of operation is to provide 
a better context where social services can be directly brought to 
bear on those who are most likely to benefit from those social 
services.
<P>
	In this day and age of growing awareness and the sociological 
changes, by the time someone is 16 years old we grant them the 
privilege to drive a car and become an impaired driver. Yet we 
are going to still treat them as misguided children.
<P>
	If the age in the Young Offenders Act was lowered to 10, 
probably most 10 and 11 year olds would never come before the 
courts. They would be dealt with through alternative measures. 
It would certainly put a flexible tool into the hands of the police 
for those exceptional cases that could be redirected at an earlier 
stage, rather than becoming a tragedy later in the system. We are 
saying that the basic change of operation is well rooted in 
criminological science and the experiences of social services in 
the community and is not a rather reactionary response.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jesse Flis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was hoping the hon. 
member would delve a little deeper into the alternative measures 
that he started talking about.
<P>
	I wonder if the hon. member is looking at the same bill, Bill 
C-37. I draw his attention to the summary.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This enactment amends the Young Offenders Act and the Criminal Code.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The major elements of the enactment are the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>amendments to provide that sixteen and seventeen year olds charged with specific 
serious crimes involving violence will be proceeded against in adult court-</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>amendments to increase the period of time that sixteen and seventeen year olds 
convicted of murder in adult court must serve before being eligible to apply for 
parole;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>amendments to provide that young offenders should be accountable to their 
victims-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This is what his constituents are requesting. In fairness, he 
should draw this to the attention of his constituents.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>amendments to provide for greater sharing of information relating to young 
offenders with persons who require such information for safety reasons.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Again, this is something his constituents are requesting. 
Sometimes I believe that members of Parliament are not serving 
their constituents properly if they do not share with the 
constituents exactly what is in the bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Forseth:</B> Mr. Speaker, certainly I have made an effort to 
share what is in the bill. The mild gestures for opening up the 
system, for sharing of information, for example, is going to be a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9842"> 9842 </A></B>
<P>
most tangled provision. It is going to be very difficult to 
administer.
<P>
	We have heard very convincing arguments that we really do 
not even need a young offenders law because of the charter. I 
have heard some rather learned people argue successfully that 
way.
<P>
	I am saying that Bill C-37 really does not go far enough 
relating to the ability to take a statement or general openness. 
For specific and general deterrence to work the media should 
have access. We have a system of rules for maintaining criminal 
justice records. I know how difficult it is trying to keep separate 
files and create a fiction to a subsequent sentence in court, trying 
to figure out what I am allowed to tell the judge and what I am 
not allowed to tell the judge because of all the tangled 
provisions in the Young Offenders Act. I might be misleading 
the judge because of the social engineering aspects of it.
<P>
	I am simply saying that Bill C-37 is not workable and there is 
nothing that can fulfil that ideal. I can give cases where the act 
has worked the other way and has caused harm.
<P>
	As far as 16 and 17 year olds are concerned, we basically say 
they should be dealt with in the adult system.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morris Bodnar (Saskatoon-Dundurn, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to stand today to deal with the Young 
Offenders Act in light of some of the comments that have been 
made, especially the comments that seem to be based on the 
premise that in our society youth crime is increasing.
<P>
	That is not the truth. If the Reform Party is indicating that 
youth crime is increasing, then the Reform Party is misleading 
the public. It just is not true. That is the problem. Its arguments 
are based on a premise that is not true.
<P>
	When we deal with matters such as lowering the age, what is 
so magical about the age of 10? If we are going to reduce the age 
from 12 to 10, why not 8? Why not lower it to the age when they 
begin to walk? Is there any problem with that?
<P>
	There lies another problem. No basis is given as to why the 
age should be lowed to 10. I have a 12-year old child. I cannot 
see that child being in young offenders court. They are young 
and immature. Twelve-year-olds may be physically tall, but 
mentally they are not mature. Putting such people into the 
criminal justice system is not right.
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	The bill provides that young offenders can be transferred to 
adult court. In the proposed amendments, on serious offences, 
16 and 17 year olds are to be tried in adult court unless they can 
convince the court that they should be in youth court. Surely 
there is no need for change in that area.
<P>
	Removal of privacy is another factor that has been brought up. 
What good is it to society to reveal the name of a young 
offender? It will ostracise the child from the rest of society. It 
will ostracise the child and will restrict rehabilitation. That is 
not what the Reform Party wants to do. It wants to know and 
make it a matter of gossip that a certain child was in youth court.
<P>
	There is no purpose to be gained by revealing such 
information. In the proposed amendments we deal with it. The 
information can go to the essential parties. It can go to school 
teachers and groups such as that so they can deal with the matter 
as is required.
<P>
	Sentencing is the fourth point raised. Rehabilitation is to be 
emphasized. Unfortunately for the Reform Party they must 
realize that this is a matter of provincial jurisdiction. Young 
offenders are sentenced to facilities that are under the control of 
provincial governments. Some provincial governments deal 
with the matter differently than others.
<P>
	In some provinces they simply put the young offender into a 
holding tank, lock the door, and release him or her four or five or 
ten months later. Open the door and out comes the young 
offender, not rehabilitated but simply better trained by prison to 
commit crime. That is the problem we have.
<P>
	If the young offender leaves better trained to commit crime, 
then we have a problem because that young offender in short 
time becomes an adult and knows how to commit crime better. 
That young offender just goes through the system again and 
again.
<P>
	Rehabilitation may be wonderful and should be emphasized 
by governments but it is a matter of provincial jurisdiction. 
They have to deal with it more seriously than they have in the 
past.
<P>
	Reform members want parents of young offenders to 
compensate the victims. One has to distinguish whether we are 
in a civil court or whether we are in the criminal court when we 
are dealing with these matters. The mixing of the two does not 
always mix that well.
<P>
	In giving the victims legal standing one has to question 
whether this is an offence of a youth. Is this an offence against 
the state as it has been traditionally in the criminal justice 
system, or are we now going to have everyone from a 
community come in and apply for standing in dealing with 
matters that are before the courts? This would completely 
uproot hundreds of years of tradition.
<P>
	Certain perceptions have been raised by members of the 
Reform Party. According to them there are indications that 
crime has been increasing by young offenders, but in reality this 
is not so. The only area where there has been an increase in 
crime are those crimes classified as violent offences. However a 
violent offence involves a common assault, a slapping, et cetera.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9843"> 9843 </A></B>
<P>
	The problem we have in those particular areas is that people 
have been reporting more of these incidents. When two young 
people are fighting at school, the matter is not resolved by the 
young people going to the principal's office or calling the 
parents. The matter is resolved by calling the police and charges 
are laid. That is how statistics get distorted and that is how 
statistics show that those crimes have gone up. It has not 
happened. That is the problem.
<P>
<B>(1630 ) </B>
<P>
	Statistics are being used to distort reality. In fact 16 and 17 
year olds in our criminal justice system have been treated more 
harshly than adults. Sixteen and seventeen year olds in youth 
court who are sentenced to six months of closed custody serve 
every day of that six months of closed custody. They do not get 
paroled; they are not released early. That is different from the 
way adults are treated in our system today.
<P>
	Another problem that has arisen is the perception that the 
police cannot properly enforce laws against young offenders. Of 
course police can. Their rights are the same as they are for 
adults. If they can use the same rules they use for adult criminals 
when dealing with young offenders they can deal with them just 
as easily.
<P>
	The Young Offenders Act enhanced the authority of police 
compared to old Juvenile Delinquents Act. The police can 
fingerprint young persons and maintain records of prior 
convictions. These matters cause young people to be treated 
more like adults and simplify enforcement proceedings for 
police in dealing with young offenders.
<P>
	Young people can be transferred to adult court. Under the 
proposed legislation and the proposed changes, 16 and 17 year 
olds automatically go to adult court for serious offences. The 
sentences for first degree murder are doubled to 10 years. That is 
the maximum. Of course there is discretion on the part of the 
judge sentencing the person.
<P>
	One has to question what would be served by increasing that 
sentence to a further term. What would be served by having a 
young person who is 16 years of age sentenced to life 
imprisonment? What is served by that? Many of our young 
people who get into problems come from dysfunctional 
families. Many of them come from families where the parents 
are drunks. They are not raised with direction. They go out into 
the world with the problem of not knowing how to deal with it.
<P>
	These are the young people that members of the Reform Party 
would want to throw away, lock the doors and support forever. 
They want a system similar to that of the state of California 
where more money is spent on prisons than on education. If that 
is what we are going to do we have a problem. We cannot let that 
happen to the youth of this country. We have to help them get 
rehabilitated. We cannot lose faith in the youth.
<P>
	Another problem we have is that anyone who tries to show 
that a system works or has worked over a period of time is 
immediately accused of being bleeding hearts.
<P>
	In discussing these matters with prosecutors who have 
prosecuted in the field they have indicated the Young Offenders 
Act works well. These prosecutors are Canadians. They are in 
the system all the time. It is only when Canadians are given 
misinformation that they have different opinions. When they are 
given the facts they agree that the Young Offenders Act 
basically works well.
<P>
	Most violent offences are not committed by youth. Adults 
commit 86 per cent of violent crimes. Of the approximate 14 per 
cent committed by youth, half are what we classify as common 
assaults: a slap or a punch. Those are the facts. Over 57 per cent 
of property crimes committed by youth are thefts. The majority 
of those are theft under $1,000. In other words most of them are 
offences such as shoplifting.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	Let us not distort the facts. These are the facts. With these 
facts we have to look at the Young Offenders Act to determine 
whether it was working properly. I suggest the act is working 
very well.
<P>
	In the past police often decided that charges should not be 
laid, especially for first time offences by young offenders. They 
would take the young offenders home. They would take them to 
the parents. The young people quite often were more 
embarrassed than anything. That would end the matter. That is 
not the way it is dealt with now. The young offender is 
apprehended on an offence, a charge is laid, the youth is then 
taken into court and the matter is dealt with in the court system.
<P>
	I am not criticizing that maybe that is not the way it should be 
dealt with, but that is how statistics are built up. They are built 
up in particular areas when they should not be. As well there is 
an increasing willingness to report offences in the school system 
instead of schools taking care of matters as they have in the past.
<P>
	We can all recall years ago when there would be a fight in a 
school yard and the principal, at least in my school, would take 
matters into his own hands. He would take the young people to 
the office. The odd one got the strap. The odd one was kept in 
detention. The police were not called. The way it is now the 
police are being called to lay charges, which is distorting the 
facts.
<P>
	However the proportion of all persons charged from 1986 
until now has remained virtually unchanged. There is not this 
huge explosion of an increase in crime by young offenders. It 
just has not happened. It only appears to have happened when 
distorted facts are given to the public. That has not happened. 
Since it has not happened we have to inform the public of the 
facts.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9844"> 9844 </A></B>
<P>
	Fourteen per cent of young offenders were charged with 
violent offences in 1992. Almost half of those offences were 
equivalent to very minor assault charges. None involved 
weapons. The offences resulting in the most serious of personal 
injuries amounted to approximately 2.4 per cent. We are hearing 
this large furore over the way matters are being dealt with or 
should be dealt with. The number of youth charged with break 
and entry has actually decreased. It was lower in 1992 than it 
was in 1986. These are the facts.
<P>
	The Young Offenders Act must be doing something right. 
Something is working. We have to fine tune it in particular areas 
and that is what we have endeavoured to do by increasing the 
sentences for teenagers convicted of first and second degree 
murder in youth court to ten years and seven years respectively. 
We hope that we have been able to deal with the matter in giving 
the system flexibility.
<P>
	Rehabilitation was raised by the member from the Reform 
Party. Rehabilitation is an important factor. However 
rehabilitation quite often commences in the jails because the 
youth never got an earlier chance. They never learned how to get 
up in the morning. They never learned how to go to work in the 
morning. They never learned how to take care of their room. 
They never learned personal hygiene. They never learned basic 
things like knowing how to work. They never learned how to 
clean anything. They never learned how to do any basic jobs. 
These are matters that have to be learned and these are required 
parts of the rehabilitation scheme. We cannot do this by simply 
opening a door, throwing youth in, locking the door behind them 
and forgetting about them until their term is over.
<P>
	I must admit that it would not hurt if some of the parents were 
given the same treatment because many of them do not know 
how to get up in the morning. Many of them have not taught their 
children because they have not known how. They are going 
through a vicious cycle. It is going from generation to 
generation in that direction. It has to be halted. The Young 
Offenders Act goes as far as we can go in halting it. The 
provinces have to take over at a particular point.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	This is not bleeding at all. This is simply common sense. I 
wish it was incorporated at times in the comments being made 
about young offenders. Common sense plays a part and certainly 
goes a long way in remedying some problems that exist.
<P>
	Some young offenders who are violent need extended periods 
of time in incarceration. That is what we are dealing with in the 
Young Offenders Act. This provides a chance to rehabilitate 
them in the institutions where they are placed. Once that is done 
it is up to the provinces and the workers working with them in 
the institutions to take over rather than advocate the holding of 
young people for prolonged periods of time.
<P>
	In the proposals dealing with transfers to adult court we have 
done what many people in society have wanted. They have 
wanted young offenders in extremely serious offences to be tried 
in adult court. If those young offenders can convince a judge and 
demonstrate that the objectives of the protection of the public 
and rehabilitation can be met in youth court then they remain in 
youth court but only then. The young offender who has 
committed 10 or 15 break-ins will not be in youth court. He will 
be in adult court. The person who continuously repeats offences 
will go into adult court.
<P>
	These are important factors to be dealt with. We have dealt 
with them in a responsible manner. The amendments are before 
Parliament so that the courts will eventually have more 
flexibility in dealing with these matters and dealing better with 
these matters.
<P>
	The sharing of information and records is important. We do 
not demonstrate to the world what the young person's name is. 
There is no purpose in that. We do give it to the right people to be 
dealt with for the purpose of protecting the public such as school 
officials and child welfare agencies. There are people who 
should have the information. Such information when released is 
important. We have balanced the interest of the child and the 
interest of society by doing what we have done.
<P>
	The amendments we have proposed at this time certainly meet 
many of the requirements of the Canadian public. The Canadian 
public has wanted some changes. We have come up with those 
changes. They are responsible changes in attempting to fine tune 
portions of the legislation that had to be changed. We have done 
this.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened with rapt attention to the hon. member's 
discourse. When hundreds of thousands of Canadians are 
voicing their opinion that the Young Offenders Act needs 
serious reform or serious overhaul I find it absolutely 
astounding a member would claim as he just did that ``the Young 
Offenders Act is working very well''.
<P>
	The hon. member derided the use of statistics, yet he himself 
went on to use statistics throughout his presentation over and 
over again to try to prove his own personal bias that the Young 
Offenders Act is working very well.
<P>
	I would like to ask the member, in as few words as possible, if 
he feels therefore that young offenders who reoffend over and 
over again should be held accountable? He said that somehow it 
was their background, that they came from dysfunctional 
families. They have all sorts of societal reasons why they 
commit crimes and why they break the law and have no respect 
for it. If it is always someone else's fault how do we hold these 
people accountable?
<P>

<P>
<B>(1645 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bodnar:</B> Mr. Speaker, when we are dealing with repeat 
offenders who recommit offences over and over again, quite 
often we are dealing with a very small proportion of the 
members of the young offenders group who commit these 
offences.
<P>
	Of course there is a need for rehabilitation. Quite often the 
reason they are committing these offences is that there is 
nothing for them in the institutions in their provinces that 
prevents them from doing it or rehabilitates them in any way. If 
nothing is done the only problem and the reason they recommit 
and get caught is that they were not trained well enough the 
second time. They are out, caught again, go in again and 
recommit. That is the problem we have.
<P>
	Of course people do not want to be just in jail. They do not 
want to be just in jail for the sake of being incarcerated. That is 
not what they want, but they have not learned a different way of 
life. We have to realize this and become realistic in this 
direction.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have a couple of questions to ask the hon. member. I would like 
to comment on the 14 per cent of crimes being committed by 
youth; 12 to 17 year olds if I am not mistaken make up 14 per 
cent of the population, so that balances out pretty well.
<P>
	Recently I went on a ride along in several places with police 
throughout the country, not just in one or two places. I witnessed 
the police dealing with youth on a few occasions. On many 
occasions there were no charges brought forward. Rather, the 
police dealt with the situation. They contacted parents and 
charges did not follow.
<P>
	If charges were being made at a ridiculous pace to include 
school fights et cetera, I would have thought from those nights I 
was involved that there would have been a real increase in 
crime. However, there were no charges brought forward. I 
wonder what basis he has to show this House that is happening, 
that school yard fights are being reported. Where does he get his 
information?
<P>
	I know at my school in my district of many schools, never 
once were the police ever called. That was until 1992. Never 
once were they called for a school yard fight. As far as I know, to 
this day they have never been.
<P>
	He said that some provinces throw them in the clink for four to 
ten months and then just let them go. I would like to know what 
provinces these are and where he got his information.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bodnar:</B> Mr. Speaker, I can speak fairly well from 
personal experience. Rehabilitation does not really function in 
the province of Saskatchewan. That is because money is not 
being put into the system to properly rehabilitate individuals.
<P>
	The whole question indicated by the hon. member for Wild 
Rose of the number of people young offenders represent being 
12 to 14 per cent of the population and therefore committing 12 
to 14 per cent of the offences verifies the fact that we do not have 
this explosion of offences among young offenders. It has not 
occurred. It is not occurring. I am very pleased the hon. member 
for Wild Rose has just verified that fact for me.
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to ask the member where he is getting his statistics from. I 
have statistics from the Canadian centre for justice statistics 
showing that since 1962 the rate of young offender offences has 
risen by over 300 per cent.
<P>
	Since the introduction of the Young Offenders Act in 1982 the 
incidence of young offender violations has risen some 117 per 
cent. There was a small drop between 1992 and 1993 of 3 per 
cent. At the same time young males between 15 and 25 in our 
population dropped by 14 per cent.
<P>
	I do not know where you are coming from. There is an 
explosion of youth justice, looking over the last 30 years. The 
Young Offenders Act simply is not working. Where are you 
getting your figures?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I would ask hon. members to put their 
questions or comments through the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bodnar:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rely on that most unreliable 
authority called the John Howard Society which indicates that 
the youths charged as a percentage of all persons charged in the 
period 1986-92 has not increased.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul E. Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, when characterizing how young offenders are 
placed in custody in Saskatchewan, the hon. member made a 
description something like open the door, put them in and then 
let them out.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	I will be contacting the attorney general of that province and I 
will be getting the information about the millions that province 
is spending on juvenile offenders for social programming while 
they are in custody. Millions are being spent across Canada by 
every province. The federal government has a tremendous share 
of that cost sharing program.
<P>
	We are doing a lot to provide social services and community 
resources to those who are in custody. It is an awful thing to say 
that in any province in Canada they would treat young offenders 
in the way that he is describing.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bodnar:</B> Mr. Speaker, I can facilitate matters for the hon. 
member since I live about three blocks from the youth detention 
centre in the city of Saskatoon. If he wishes to come to see it, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9846"> 9846 </A></B>

contact me and I will arrange matters for him. If he wishes the

<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It is my duty, pursuant to Standing 
Order 38, to inform the House that the questions to be raised 
tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows: the hon. 
member for Frontenac-customs tariffs; the hon. member for 
Québec-Est-social housing; the hon. member for 
Cariboo-Chilcotin-citizenship and immigration.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, right off 
the bang, I am going to tell you that the Bloc Quebecois' 
position on Bill C-37 is that it is repressive and loses sight of the 
ultimate goal of all criminal laws: crime prevention and the 
rehabilitation and reintegration of offenders.
<P>
	The bill will in no way contribute to stopping young people 
from committing criminal acts. Ottawa is going down a 
dead-end street, as far as Quebec is concerned. Quebec is to 
assume responsibility for administering the system. Our 
recommendations have once again been overlooked. This is yet 
another good example of the struggle between the legitimate 
goals of Quebec and those of the rest of Canada. Once again, the 
bill demonstrates that the federal regime has failed.
<P>
	As I already said in this House when speaking about the same 
issue last June, I am very concerned about the situation our 
young people find themselves in. I am sure that many of us are 
also concerned, but I am less sure of what we want to do to help 
them.
<P>
	For over 34 years, I worked with young people as a teacher in 
a comprehensive school. I got to know many thousands of young 
people, and I can assure you that the image we tend to have of 
them is not always true to life.
<P>
	Of course, there are a few who stick out from the others 
because of the way they dress, because their hair is the colour of 
the rainbow, or unfortunately because they commit 
reprehensible acts.
<P>
	I think it is important to remember that the current Young 
Offenders Act has a very special philosophy. This policy is to 
help and supervise young offenders, unlike Bill C-37, which 
tells us that young offenders must be punished. This bill caters 
to the feelings aroused by extreme cases, while the notion of 
educating, helping and supervising young people is totally 
forgotten.
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
	The policy statement behind this bill refers to rehabilitation 
and social reintegration, but what about prevention? Where, in 
this bill, is the word ``prevention''? This is a repressive bill. One 
of the things that strike me the most is that 16 and 17-year olds 
who commit serious crimes will now have the burden of proof as 
to whether they will be tried in adult or youth court. This makes 
all the difference.
<P>
	I really wonder why we should favour such an extreme 
solution and whether it is really necessary. Under the existing 
legislation, a young person charged with a serious crime may be 
tried in adult court. This provision is used by crown attorneys 
when a thorough review of the young person's record by several 
people shows that he must be tried in adult court.
<P>
	Do we really need to amend the existing legislation, when it 
already allows us to transfer records from youth court to adult 
court? We cannot afford to move toward automatism. By virtue 
of his age alone, a young person may now face trial in adult 
court. This bill raises many questions, including the following: 
Is a 17-year-old first time offender who injures someone while 
committing a robbery more of a criminal than a 15-year-old 
who has committed close to 100 burglaries? It is a question.
<P>
	Please, let us be a little realistic. Again, it is not a matter of 
age. It is a matter of prevention and education. I will tell you that 
in my riding, for example, in January, a young man was 
sentenced to imprisonment for incest. His own father had gone 
to jail before him for the same offence. As incredible as it may 
sound, for this young man, incest was a normal thing. Would you 
not say, Mr. Speaker, it is high time we take our responsibilities 
as adults and as a society?
<P>
	Let us stop burying our heads in the sand and delude ourselves 
into believing that by offloading on the judiciary, we will 
resolve the youth crime issue. What I mean by taking our 
responsibilities is giving our young people reason to have faith 
in the future, because we know full well that the causes of youth 
crime are many.
<P>
	The example I gave earlier is but one of many. Other factors 
are drugs, movies where violence is pervasive and so on. Again, 
let us take our responsibilities and unite against poverty and 
dropping-out. Yes, let us fight together against poverty and 
dropping-out. Furthermore, let us provide parents and, in their 
absence for whatever reason, the various officials involved with 
means to show young people that there is nothing wrong with 
being young.
<P>
<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
	When a young person has the misfortune of committing a 
crime, our reaction must certainly not be to throw him or her in 
jail, because we all know-and no one can deny it-that jail is a 
breeding ground for criminals. Moreover, it is clear that custody 
has no deterrent effect.
<P>
	Our youth should have rights, including the right to be better 
provided, better provided with the services of experts and better 
provided with shelters if need be, but certainly not with adult jail 
as the only alternative.
<P>
	The Young Offenders Act, as it stands, contains very strict 
guidelines relating to the maintenance of records on teenage 
offenders. Access to these records is restricted. However, in this 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9847"> 9847 </A></B>
<P>
bill, the confidentiality aspect has been set aside completely. 
What is this supposed to achieve? I have no idea.
<P>
	Bill C-37 proposes to disclose information on a young 
offender to representatives of the school system and other 
unspecified persons. I find this part of the bill very disturbing as 
well.
<P>
	Last week, <I>Newsweek </I>reported that the U.S. justice system 
was using shame as a deterrent. Young people who had 
committed a crime had to ask their parents and their victims for 
forgiveness in front of the television cameras, to show they 
really felt remorse. Furthermore, the nature of the offences and 
identity of young offenders could also be disclosed in church.
<P>
	Bill C-37 mentions revealing the identity of young offenders. 
It proposes to disclose information on young offenders to 
representatives of the school system and other persons 
concerned.
<P>
	Again, who are these other persons? Are we going to follow 
the American model? Will announcements during high mass be 
next? This is absurd.
<P>
	We can hardly expect a young person who has committed a 
crime to rehabilitate himself when he is acutely aware that so 
many people know his identity and what he did.
<P>
	How will young people react when they see their privacy 
invaded and their record made public knowledge? We must stop 
punishing and looking down on people, and we must try to help 
our young people who, need I repeat, are the future of our 
society. Give them a job, because that is how they will regain 
their self-esteem.
<P>
	On May 5, the Liberal Party of Quebec-yes, the Liberal 
Party of Quebec-and the Parti Quebecois agreed to move a 
motion in the Quebec National Assembly demanding that the 
federal legislation on young offenders comply with the laws and 
policies of Quebec with respect to youth protection.
<P>
	This agreement was possible because Quebecers are aware of 
the need to protect the rights of the child.
<P>
	In Quebec, the experience of the last fifteen years has shown 
that prevention, rehabilitation and readjustment are far more 
effective than repression.
<P>
<B>(1705) </B>
<P>
	We are trying to find out the causes of delinquency instead of 
using custody as the only deterrent. Of course, this will not solve 
all problems. There are a number of obstacles. The system is not 
perfect. Sometimes prevention and rehabilitation are not 
enough. On the whole, however, the approach taken by Quebec 
is more effective in protecting young people. How could a bill 
like the one before the House today ignore this fact? Should the 
minister not take advantage of Quebec's experience and show 
the rest of Canada that repression and intolerance will 
undoubtedly aggravate problems instead of solving them? I 
repeat: Young people are the future of our society. It is up to us 
to help them.
<P>
	In concluding, you may recall that we as adults have certain 
responsibilities. One of our poets, Paul Piché, explains how we 
have an impact on the next generation. If I may, I would like to 
quote a passage from one of his songs: ``Children are not really, 
really bad. They may misbehave, from time to time. They can 
spit, lie or steal, but after all, they can do everything they are 
taught''.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
in one of his comments my colleague said we should look for the 
causes rather than lock up those who offend. There are so many 
cases today where young offenders do offend repeatedly. I 
would like to ask him whether at some point it seems a logical 
conclusion to lock up an individual. Whether the individual goes 
to a prison where adult criminals are is another question.
<P>
	I would also like to ask him about his concept of looking for 
the causes when there is a young offender. I would also like to 
find out whether he thinks the publishing of young offenders' 
names is something that is relevant in the case of an offender or 
would he be more on the side of looking for the causes as well as 
opposed to some of the solutions to the young offender problems 
we have?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fillion:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thought what I said was fairly 
clear. First and foremost, we must find out the causes of crime. 
Environment is everything. When the environment is a healthy 
one, we give our young people every opportunity. If they do not 
have every opportunity, there comes a time in their life when 
they may well do something wrong. On the other hand, are they 
always to blame for such action? When the parents are not home, 
when there is no money and no work, these are all factors.
<P>
	As to the second question, about identifying, publishing the 
names of offenders, I am totally against it. This is not the way to 
remedy things. Let us give our young people access to people 
who can look after them, experts in various areas, places to stay 
where people will listen to them and where they can go and talk 
about their problems.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	Let us listen to their demands. You will see that, if we keep 
listening to them and giving them work, pride will come out on 
top, and the crime rate, although dropping now-it was at two 
per cent in 1992 as compared to five per cent in previous 
years-will continue to drop.
<P>

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Warren Allmand (Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as chair of the justice committee which made a 
thorough study of this bill I would like to make a few comments.
<P>
	The bill was referred to the justice committee on June 23, 
1994 and was subject to hearings until December 8, 1994. Over 
that period of time we heard from 42 witnesses, groups and 
individuals from all walks of life. We heard from victims' 
groups, groups of offenders and ex-offenders, experts from the 
correctional service, witnesses from children's aid societies, 
witnesses from police forces, judges, bar associations, 
psychologists, sociologists, school board officials and 
representatives from the provinces. We had a very wide range of 
input into the work of the committee. I want to congratulate and 
thank members of the committee for their co-operation over 
those months when we had hearings on the bill.
<P>
	The bill dealt with a very limited number of issues. To begin 
with, it added to the declaration of principles with respect to the 
Young Offenders Act. It pointed out in section three that crime 
prevention was essential to the long term protection of society 
and affirmed protection of society as a principal goal of the law. 
It also affirmed that young persons must bear responsibility for 
their actions and for their contraventions, although not in the 
same way as adults. That is one of the main reasons we have the 
Young Offenders Act.
<P>
	The bill also dealt with transfers to adult court. Under the 
present law which deals with young persons from 12 to 17 years 
of age inclusive, a youth aged 14 to 17 can be transferred to adult 
court on an application from the crown for certain serious 
offences. The youth court will make the judgment as to whether 
the young person will stay in youth court or will be transferred to 
adult court. That is the law as it exists at the present time.
<P>
	Under Bill C-37 a change is proposed whereby those who are 
16 and 17 years old would be transferred automatically to adult 
court for certain serious crimes of violence against the person 
unless the young person makes an application to the court not to 
be transferred to adult court. That is a sort of reverse burden of 
proof which is being put forward in this particular bill as 
opposed to the present law.
<P>
	The bill also deals with the penalty for murder. It would 
increase the penalty for murder for young offenders tried in the 
youth court to ten years for first degree murder and to seven 
years for second degree murder. At the present time the 
maximum penalty is five years.
<P>
	The bill also provides for victim impact statements at the time 
of sentencing of a young offender.
<P>
	It also provides that for treatment the consent of the young 
offender must be obtained. Under the present law treatment can 
be ordered for the young offender without his or her consent.
<P>
<B>(1715 ) </B>
<P>
	Another principal change the bill makes is to leave the 
decision with respect to open or secure custody with the 
provinces when the provinces have set up offices to deal with 
that.
<P>
	Finally, the bill would provide for a greater publication of 
youth offence records, in particular the publication of the names 
of young offenders who have committed certain offences. Under 
the present law this dissemination of information is highly 
restricted.
<P>
	Bill C-37 would allow for a greater dissemination of that 
information to people in positions of trust and administration, in 
schools and other places where young people study or work, so 
that there would be greater protection for the public.
<P>
	More or less those are the changes that Bill C-37 would bring 
in with respect to the Young Offenders Act.
<P>
	As I pointed out, during the hearings on the bill we heard from 
a great number of people, approximately 42 individuals and 
groups. I must tell the House that the great majority of those who 
appeared before the committee did not want us to proceed with 
Bill C-37 until we did a general review of the act such as was 
proposed as phase two of our studies.
<P>
	The House will recall that the Minister of Justice, when 
referring this bill to the House and to the committee, stated that 
he also wanted the committee to do a complete review of the 
Young Offenders Act since it had been in force for 10 years. He 
wanted us not only to study every aspect of the law, but also the 
resources available to administer the law and the situation with 
respect to youth crime in this country.
<P>
	A great majority of witnesses said: ``If you are going to do 
that overall, comprehensive general study, why legislate in 
these few particular areas right now? Should you not complete 
your broad, general study and then make a judgment with 
respect to those matters once that study is completed?''
<P>
	That made sense to many members on the committee, but to 
the majority it did not. The committee decided that despite these 
pleas it should carry on with the consideration of Bill C-37, 
principally because during the election campaign, the 
government had made a commitment to bring in those very 
specific changes. It felt those changes should be legislated right 
now despite the fact the committee was going to undertake a 
general study as phase two of its work.
<P>
	The committee did proceed with Bill C-37 and reported back 
to the House and the bill is now before us. At the end of our 
hearings we did make 28 amendments. Most of those were 
technical amendments. They were corrections in the wording, 
improvements in the expression of the law, improvements in the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9849"> 9849 </A></B>
<P>
French translation. However, there were a couple of substantive 
amendments among the 28 that were made by the committee.
<P>
	One substantive amendment was to change to a certain extent 
the new transfer provision. I mentioned that Bill C-37 provides 
for automatic transfer of 16 and 17 year olds, unless the 16 or 17 
year old can make a case before the court that they should not be 
transferred to the adult court.
<P>
	An amendment was made in committee. It was agreed that it 
would not be necessary to hold such a hearing and go to the 
expense and the time consuming process when the crown 
attorney agreed with the defence attorney that the young person 
should remain in youth court despite the fact that the individual 
may be 16 or 17 and had committed one of the serious offences 
referred to.
<P>
	Another amendment of substance was to curtail somewhat the 
dissemination of information that was provided for in Bill C-37. 
While Bill C-37 will now provide for greater information to the 
public with respect to young offender records than under the 
present law, it will not go as far as Bill C-37 would have gone in 
the first instance.
<P>
<B>(1720) </B>
<P>
	During this debate over the last few hours and when the bill 
was before the House at report stage, some members especially 
some of those from the Reform Party, have charged that the 
Young Offenders Act is a failure. They have charged that youth 
crime is out of control and that the Young Offenders Act is to 
blame for that increase in crime among youth.
<P>
	As a matter of fact, some have blamed me, as one of the 
original authors of the Young Offenders Act, for this state in our 
country. They blame me for what they consider to be an increase 
in youth crime and for the failures of the Young Offenders Act. I 
want to respond to that.
<P>
	To begin with, youth crime is not out of control and has not 
increased in Canada. The incidents of youth crime have not 
increased. As I pointed out the other day at report stage on the 
bill, the greatest number of homicides committed by youths 12 
to 17 years of age was 68 in 1975. That was before the Young 
Offenders Act. The lowest number was in 1987 when there were 
only 35. With respect to homicides, there was a much higher 
number committed by those 12 to 17 years of age before the act 
and the lowest number was committed after the act came into 
force.
<P>
	One could give even more precise statistics. For example, in 
the period from 1974 to 1978, a four-year period prior to the 
Young Offenders Act, there were 60 charges for murder laid 
against youths in Canada. From 1984 to 1989 which is a 
five-year period after the act, there were 40 charges. One could 
go on and on.
<P>
	Of course, a certain phenomenon has been taking place which 
has led to an appearance of increase in statistics. That is what 
might be called the zero tolerance approach in many school 
board districts. School authorities now call in the police 
whenever there is a fight or a disruption in the school yard. In the 
past, when those sorts of incidents took place, the principal 
might call in the young people involved and discipline them, 
call in their parents and do something about the incident, but 
criminal charges would not be laid.
<P>
	Now in those ordinary types of assaults in the school yard, 
charges are being laid in many jurisdictions. Therefore of course 
the statistics for charges laid has increased but the number of 
incidents has not. As a matter of fact, the trend has been more or 
less the same with respect to those kinds of assaults over the 
years, both before and after the act.
<P>
	Let us be absolutely clear. I can refer to many documents. 
There is a fact sheet put out by the John Howard Society on 
youth crime. The title of the bulletin is ``Youth Crime: Sorting 
Fact from Fiction''. It goes into much detail and deals with 
violent crime rates with respect to youth over the years. There 
has not been a substantial or significant increase in crime with 
respect to young persons. As a matter of fact, as I pointed out, 
there were much higher rates of youth homicide before the act 
than there were after the act.
<P>
	The act has not failed. The act is the same one from 
Newfoundland to British Columbia. It is the same act in 
Windsor, Ontario, as it is in Tuktoyaktuk in the Northwest 
Territories, but it is administered very differently in the 
different provinces and in the different territories. In some 
provinces and territories there is no trouble with the act; in other 
provinces and territories there are problems with the act.
<P>
<B>(1725) </B>
<P>
	I must ask, are the problems attributable to the provisions of 
the act or the way in which the act is administered? It so happens 
in some provinces such as my province of Quebec a great deal of 
resources, much more than other provinces, are dedicated to the 
administration of this act and to dealing with the causes of youth 
crime. There is much greater satisfaction with the act in the 
province of Quebec than there is in certain other provinces, but 
it is the same act in Quebec as it is in Alberta, as it is in 
Manitoba, as it is in New Brunswick.
<P>
	The act is not the cause of youth crime where it does take 
place. I do admit there are still some horrible youth crimes 
taking place in this country. The perception of those youth 
crimes is way out of proportion to the number of crimes which 
are actually taking place.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9850"> 9850 </A></B>
<P>
	In any case, the act is not responsible for the crimes. There are 
causes for those crimes and it is there that we must direct our 
attention. We must also accept the fact that there has been very 
uneven administration of this act across Canada and very uneven 
dedication of resources, both human and financial, to the whole 
area of youth offenders and youth delinquency.
<P>
	If that is the case, if the act is not responsible for those crimes 
which do take place, then simple changes really will not reduce 
the level of crime. To suggest to the Canadian population that we 
are going to change section 5, or section 8, or section 25 and all 
of a sudden there will be a panacea and we will reduce crime is to 
mislead the public.
<P>
	If we are serious about reducing youth crime where it does 
exist in Canada then we must dedicate resources to the causes of 
that crime, whether it is broken families, whether it is 
alcoholism, whether it is battered children and battered mothers, 
whether it is drug addiction and the trafficking in drugs, whether 
it is the lack of employment, the lack of recreation 
opportunities, latchkey kids who have nobody to come home to, 
a whole range of things. If we are serious about reducing the rate 
of youth crime, a simple amendment to the law will not do it.
<P>
	However putting our minds to it and putting some resources 
and care into it at the level of the causes at the community level 
might do it because where that has been done there has been 
more success and less youth crime. We only delude ourselves 
and the public by suggesting that a few changes here and there to 
the act will substantially change the situation.
<P>
	I want to absolutely rebut those suggestions. I am sure we will 
hear them again, especially from the Reform Party. We will hear 
that youth crime is out of control, that it has substantially 
increased, that the cause of that youth crime is the Young 
Offenders Act which is a failure. Well it is not a failure and it is 
not out of control. However, there are still some serious cases of 
youth crime in this country and if we are serious about this issue 
we should direct our attention to those causes.
<P>
	In conclusion, I want to say that this bill has some worthwhile 
changes in it and they should be supported. There are other 
changes which I find doubtful. I will nevertheless support the 
bill with the understanding that when we do our phase two 
review we will re-examine everything that we have done under 
Bill C-37 as well as the entire Young Offenders Act.
<P>
	As chair of the justice committee, I give lukewarm support for 
this bill because I feel it is a mixed bag. It has some good 
sections that are worthwhile. It has others which are doubtful. 
However we are going to have a chance to do a complete review 
of the act within a few months.
<P>
	It will not be just a complete review of the act but a complete 
review of the administration across the country of the facilities 
for correcting young offenders, the  probation systems, the 
secure custody systems and so on, and also the nature, level and 
status of youth crime in Canada. We are going to do all those 
things in the committee later this year. Therefore, I will reserve 
judgment on those matters until that time.
<P>
<B>(1730 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
YOA is not the cause of crime. I do not think there are any 
qualms about that. I know we have been accused of saying that it 
is the cause but that is not the case at all. There are a number of 
causes. I agree with the hon. member there are causes that have 
to be addressed. We must address the causes in any way we can. 
We involve the provinces, social service and every aspect we 
can.
<P>
	When we are trying to eliminate the causes and are doing a 
good job and somebody crosses the line and breaks the law 
anyway by committing murder, we say that the YOA is not doing 
its job of performing justice. The word justice is missing from 
our system in a number of ways.
<P>
	I received 15,000 letters in one day that I will be delivering 
soon to the Minister of Justice. There are another 5,000 to 6,000 
letters that I received in my riding and in Ottawa. I am sure every 
member has received letters that ask us to do something about 
young offenders. The government continually sits over there 
saying that it is all right, that Canadians like what they are 
doing, and that the act is good. That is baloney.
<P>
	When will the government recognize what people are saying 
out there? It should pay attention to Canadians. The Young 
Offenders Act is not satisfactory to Canadians. Why does the 
government continually deny that? I know the member receives 
the same letters I do.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Allmand:</B> Mr. Speaker, at the beginning of his remarks I 
thought my good friend from Wild Rose was more or less 
agreeing with me. However at the end of his remarks I knew that 
he was not.
<P>
	He asked a question and it is a serious question: What do we 
do with an a young person who commits a serious crime of 
violence after all has been done to prevent crime and all has been 
done to direct our attention to the causes of crime? Of course the 
individual has to be sent to secure custody. In some cases we 
would probably send him to adult court and to adult prison if the 
case is serious enough. The law provides for that and I support 
that.
<P>
	However let us remember that justice in my view means 
protecting the public. It does not mean revenge. It does not mean 
an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.
<P>
	In our system the overwhelming majority of youth as well as 
adults who are convicted will be sent back to society. If we are 
really concerned with protecting the public, which I believe is 
the purpose of the justice system, we must do everything 
possible with an individual in our control to rehabilitate the 
person and to make sure that when the person returns to society 
he or  she will be a safer risk for society. We are not going to 
keep that person in prison until he or she dies. We do not have 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9851"> 9851 </A></B>
<P>
capital punishment. We are going to release the individual 
sooner or later, whether it is five years, seven years or ten years.
<P>
	The hon. member asked what we should do. Yes, we should 
keep the person in custody if the person is a young violent 
offender. However we should work on the individual to give him 
or her a sense of worth, to give him or her a trade or an 
education, to make sure the person knows how to deal with the 
problems of life when released from prison, to make sure the 
person has contacts with family if there is family, and so on. We 
should build up a situation so that the person returns to society a 
better risk than when he or she entered the prison system.
<P>
	That is what I believe. I believe in protecting society. We must 
dedicate our resources when the person is in secure custody or 
open custody to doing everything possible to rehabilitate the 
young person so that he or she will be better off upon return to 
society.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Arseneault:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. My 
understanding was that during questions and comments we 
would rotate between the established parties present. I am 
wondering whether or not that is the practice.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> My practice is to give the opportunity 
to an opposing party of the member speaking unless there is 
nobody rising from an opposing party. In my experience 
powder-puff questions tend to be put by a member of the same 
party.
<P>
<B>(1735) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would agree with that. Powder-puff has been here today.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Arseneault:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on another point of order. 
I hate to say this but I take exception to your statement about my 
question being a powder-puff type of question. I had a comment 
to make on the bill. I think the point you made should be 
retracted.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The comment was not addressed to the 
particular member. It was addressed to members in all parties in 
all situations.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, I can assure 
the member that this will not be powder-puff.
<P>
	The hon. member talked about not blaming the Reform Party 
and not blaming him. I do not think that is the case at all. After 
all he is only a one-one hundred and seventy-seventh part of the 
problem.
<P>
	There is no misleading the public at all. There is a genuine 
concern for law-abiding Canadian citizens. My hon. colleague 
read demographics and statistics from various documents. He 
quoted the John Howard Society. I would like to quote a few 
items from Victims of Violence that has a big stake in the bill.
<P>
	According to Victims of Violence youth crime is up 117 per 
cent since the Young Offenders Act took effect in 1984: 25 youth 
committed first degree murder in 1990, 23 youth committed 
second degree murder in 1990 and 6 youth committed 
manslaughter in 1990.
<P>
	I suspect the member would say that is not very many. 
However the fact is that there are strings of victims in the wake 
of what is going on here. When one crosses the line, as the hon. 
member for Wild Rose has said, there must be an act in place to 
effectively look after that.
<P>
	I would like to ask my hon. colleague this question. If he 
looked at the statistics from Victims of Violence, would he not 
agree that the tougher the measures for those who cross the line 
the better and more effective the fixing of the problem would be 
rather than looking at it from his perspective which is in my 
opinion is powder-puff?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Allmand:</B> Mr. Speaker, the statistics I referred to come 
from the Canadian Centre for Justice. We had the Victims of 
Violence group before us in the committee. I do not know from 
where it got its figures.
<P>
	There is no doubt there are still some serious crimes in the 
country. I deny that there has been an increase in violent crime 
among youth over the years. When we look at the statistics from 
the police and from the Centre for Justice statistics they show 
that is not the case.
<P>
	Despite that I sympathize with the public that is seriously 
concerned with youth crime, whatever there is. He asked if it 
was not better, once they crossed the line and committed serious 
offences, to have tougher measures.
<P>
	I do not agree with that and I will tell the member why. I do not 
agree with it because it does not work. They are doing it in the 
southern United States: three strikes out and you are an outlaw. 
They have a much higher rate of crime than we have in Canada.
<P>
	The southeastern state of the United States have brought back 
capital punishment and have mandatory sentencing. They 
execute somebody in the morning and they have three or four 
murders in the afternoon. The countries doing exactly what the 
member is suggesting have the worst rates of violent crime in 
the western world.
<P>
	What the member is suggesting has led to no improvement in 
the situation. That is why I am not for it. A much better approach 
is the approach being used in western Europe in countries like 
Holland, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, France, Germany, Italy, et 
cetera, and in Canada to a certain extent. It is to concentrate on 
the causes of crime, to concentrate on rehabilitation and 
correction, and not simply on harsh, hard, long penalties that do 
not protect the public. If they did protect the public we would be 
able to walk the streets freely in Miami, Dallas, New Orleans 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9852"> 9852 </A></B>
<P>
and many other cities which we cannot do simply because they 
are doing what the member suggests.
<P>
<B>(1740) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to add my thoughts and 
concerns on the Young Offenders Act and Bill C-37 to the 
debate.
<P>
	I would like to begin by sharing a letter from a constituent 
who writes:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Last week my neighbour's son was physically assaulted in the hallways of 
his high school, not by a teacher or a fellow student but by a youth gang 
member who walked in off the street. The kids call him the ``enforcer''. 
Apparently my neighbour's son had asked the wrong fellow to stop spraying 
rocks when he spun out of the parking lot. This less than courteous driver had 
gang membership connections and sent for the ``enforcer'' to beat him up.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I realize that changing the Young Offenders Act won't solve all our 
problems, but it would be a very good start. All of society has to take 
responsibility for putting an end to violence through long term teaching and 
learning in our education system. We must begin to give the message that the 
rights of victims will be protected more than the rights of criminals. The 
youth of today are laughing at our judicial system.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The RCMP advised my neighbour to press charges even though he said it 
would take up to 18 months to go to trial and the kid would only get 
probation. This type of youth thinks probation is something to brag about. 
We need to do more than slap wrists. We have to stop this senseless violence.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Surely the government can act to change the present state of our judicial 
system. An overhaul is long overdue. The rights of the average law-abiding 
citizen of Canada need to be protected now.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>As for my neighbour's son he is on a waiting list for a head scan as they 
feel the bone fragments in his head could cause permanent damage. The 
doctor said this was not a school kid fight but a serious attempt to do 
permanent damage. How many more young leaders of the future have to be 
maimed or killed before changes to our laws are made?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That sentiment is echoed by many letters. I am sure I am not 
the only MP to receive those types of concerns from 
constituents.
<P>
	This one school yard incident illustrates much of what is 
wrong with our youth justice system today: youth gangs, 
physical assault, fear in the school yard, misplaced value 
systems, increasing levels of violence among youth, lengthy 
delays in our youth detention centres before going to trial and 
overcrowded courts, lack of respect of youth for the justice 
system, and inadequate penalties for repeat and violent young 
offenders.
<P>
	When I speak about school yard violence I have to relate it to 
my own situation. We can all appreciate that as we grew up we 
were confronted with bullies. I know in my case my father said: 
``At some point in time you just have to stand up for yourself. 
The only language bullies understand is to meet force with 
force, or you will just keep getting pushed around''.
<P>
	I have a young son who will be 12 years old pretty soon. I hear 
in the news about young children getting stabbed at school or 
getting kicked in the head. I see some members opposite 
laughing about this. I do not understand how they find it 
humourous. I am very concerned about when my son will come 
to me for advice on what to do about bullies in the school. I do 
not know if I should tell him to stand up for himself against a 
bully who might bring a knife to school the next day and stab 
him or kick him to death.
<P>
	Something has to change. Bill C-37 begins to address some of 
the problems but I do not think it goes nearly far enough. We 
cannot afford to tinker with our justice system. We must look at 
what works and what does not work. We must have the strength 
and the confidence to change what must be changed.
<P>
	One out of every two young offenders who passes through the 
system will commit another offence. That is far too high. 
Obviously our current system is not working.
<P>
	One significant problem that must be addressed is the 
enormous time delays between the commission of a crime and 
the court date. In some jurisdictions it takes from six months to a 
year. In Prince George it can take up to 18 months, and that is not 
acceptable. How can young offenders think we take their crimes 
or rehabilitation seriously when it takes so long to get their cases 
to trial? All too frequently if left at liberty youths will reoffend 
while they are waiting for their court appearance.
<P>
<B>(1745) </B>
<P>
	According to justice statistics in 1993-94, 9 per cent of the 
youth court cases dealt with young offenders who had not 
complied or had failed to appear for previous court dates. 
However, if the youth is held in a youth detention centre pending 
trial, they are subject to physical, mental, emotional abuse by 
other more violent young offenders. This is not fair either to any 
youth.
<P>
	A lengthy stay in such an environment is not conducive to 
learning more socially acceptable behaviours. Eliminating trial 
delays must be a priority so young offenders are placed into 
programs appropriate for them sooner, whether community 
service or the so-called boot camps.
<P>
	Another serious flaw of this bill is that it does not apply to 10 
and 11 year olds. Child protection services in most provinces do 
not have the resources to meet the needs of every child they 
know is at risk of criminal activity. They know once the youth is 
finally arrested at age 12, additional resources might be 
available within the young offender system.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9853"> 9853 </A></B>
<P>
	According to a preliminary study on youth gang activity done 
for the Solicitor General, gangs are recruiting young children to 
transport drugs, break into houses and rob commercial property. 
Children under 12 are re-enacting the violent behaviour of older 
juvenile delinquents in the school yard. Twelve is obviously too 
late.
<P>
	We must get these children into the system earlier, giving 
them appropriate counselling, structure and values before they 
become set in their criminal ways. They must learn as early as 
possible there are always consequences for one's actions, if 
you're old enough to do the crime, you're old enough to do the 
time.
<P>
	Our justice system needs to distinguish between young, first 
time offenders who commit minor crimes and those who engage 
in habitual or violent criminal behaviour. Everyone deserves a 
fair chance to mend their ways, to learn responsibility, 
accountability and a new sense of purpose.
<P>
	Many of these first time offenders are trapped in 
dysfunctional or abusive families. Some are poor or have 
learning disabilities. They have low self-esteem and are looking 
for a way out of their cage. Some turn to a youth gang for 
security. They steal something to boost their own confidence, to 
impress their peers or simply because they are looking for help.
<P>
	Our youth justice system must recognize these kids and 
provide them with a sentence appropriate to their needs to guide 
them back to the straight and narrow. That does not mean we 
allow them to blame their background or society for their 
actions. It does not mean we put them into counselling and 
ignore their crime.
<P>
	The first step on the path to becoming a responsible citizen is 
to accept responsibility for one's own actions. They must be 
held accountable. If they are sentenced to open custody, part of 
that sentence must entail reparations for the damage they have 
done. In some cases it might mean picking up garbage. In others, 
more difficult work such as planting trees.
<P>
	If they are going to be successful, community programs must 
be tailored to the needs and the punishment of the particular 
young offender. We must differentiate between those who 
deserve a chance with a lighter sentence and others who have 
repeatedly demonstrated they have no respect for our laws.
<P>
	Despite what some advocates would have us believe, not all 
young offenders who commit non-violent property offences are 
harmless. Many are already habitual criminals with no moral 
conscience and a warped value system. They do not understand 
why they should respect the lives and property of other 
Canadians.
<P>
	These youth need to know the punishment for their crimes 
will not be a slap on the wrist like raking leaves at the local park 
on weekends. These youth need a stronger reason to think twice 
before stealing another car. We need to strike a balance between 
deterrents and accountability, between punishment and 
rehabilitation.
<P>
	Under Bill C-37 sentences for young offenders are inadequate 
and uncertain. It fails with respect to habitual delinquents. For 
property offences Bill C-37 advocates open custody. If a youth 
commits a property offence, the onus is now on judges to justify 
sending them to secured custody rather than to the community.
<P>
	Currently there are not enough community programs to 
absorb these youths. The infrastructure is not yet in place. For 
property offences more emphasis has to be placed on whether 
the youth is a habitual offender. I do not think a bit of 
community work will be taken seriously by someone who 
openly flaunts the law on a continual basis. They should be dealt 
with very differently than other first time property offenders.
<P>
<B>(1750) </B>
<P>
	For violent offences Bill C-37 generally prescribes 
maximums rather than minimums. In the case of premeditated 
first degree murder a young offender is subject to a maximum 
six-year sentence in secured custody with an absolute maximum 
of ten years, including open custody.
<P>
	This is a substantial improvement over the old five-year 
maximum but still does not go far enough. With no minimums, a 
young offender may still believe the sentence for murder will be 
a few short years. Some people do not believe longer sentences 
will deter youths. All I can say is ridiculously light sentences 
sure have not.
<P>
	We need longer minimum sentences for violent young 
offenders so they know exactly what they will be facing when 
they contemplate rape, assault or murder.
<P>
	When we incarcerate youths today the law says they must be 
provided with shelter, safety and schooling. There is also some 
counselling but the rest of the time they are frequently idle 
without constructive structure in their life.
<P>
	Last summer at a justice rally in my riding one teenage girl 
told us that she has friends who actually look forward to 
detention. It was like a vacation for them with three square 
meals a day and no worries. They do not have to confront the 
reasons they are there. How can you rehabilitate a violent young 
offender if they do not understand there are serious 
consequences for breaking the law? How can they learn an 
acceptable value system if they view custody as a vacation?
<P>
	Youth detention centres are expensive. In Alberta it has been 
estimated that it costs about $45,000 per year to keep a young 
offender. In Ontario it costs taxpayers $100,000 per youth. At 
least 50 per cent of all young offenders currently reoffend. For 
$100,000 a year Canadians have a right to expect better results.
<P>
	I advocate the concept of the so-called boot camps. We do not 
yet have enough statistics on the various models of these camps 
to prove whether they are effective in all cases, but we do know 
<P>

that the reoffending rate is lower for many graduates of these 
wilderness or outbound camps, or whatever you call them.
<P>
	For many youths in these camps, it is the first time in their 
lives they are placed in a highly structured environment with 
specific tasks, responsibilities and expectations. They do not 
have idle time to scheme or intimidate other youths.
<P>
	Just south of Prince George we have one such camp. It has 
been around for 23 years and has a fairly good success rate. 
These young offenders warm up with callisthenics and go for a 
four mile run before breakfast. They are assigned tasks and 
chores around the camp, have strict school and study regimes, 
and almost no idle time.
<P>
	They are not doing hard labour as critics of some camps might 
suggest. They are in a disciplined, structured environment, 
designed to foster more responsible behaviour.
<P>
	Just this last year Manitoba has also moved toward this style 
of detention for youth. In Ontario it costs half as much to send a 
youth to Camp DARE and they are far less likely to reoffend 
than if they stayed in a youth detention centre.
<P>
	Another problem with this bill is that it only transfers 16 or 17 
year olds who commit violent personal injury crimes to adult 
court. It does not deal with 16 or 17 year old habitual offenders 
who obviously hold the justice system in contempt.
<P>
	In B.C. between April and September of last year 999 of the 
1,819 youths sentenced or remanded in custody were 16 or older. 
They are responsible for more than half the crimes committed by 
youths. When it comes to 16 or 17 year olds who commit crimes, 
I am in complete disagreement with this bill.
<P>
	I believe every 16 or 17 year old knows the difference between 
right and wrong. They know when they are committing a crime 
and I believe they should be treated as adults. They do not 
belong in the same system as a 12-year-old, nor should they 
expect the same treatment for their criminal behaviour. This bill 
provides a loophole to keep even the most violent of older 
offenders in the youth system. Sixteen and seventeen year olds 
who commit murder or violent assaults can request that they be 
kept in the youth system. This bill has created a whole new field 
for lawyers and will tie up even more valuable court time. I do 
not think that is right.
<P>
	I was recently reading an article in <I>Readers' Digest</I> by Mike 
Royko which originally appeared in the Chicago <I>Tribune</I>. It 
illustrates the sentiments many Canadians feel toward violent 
criminals who rape or murder regardless of their age. I will 
quote a part of the article:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Judge McKay hears criminal cases in Trumball County, Ohio. Recently he 
had a two-legged beast in front of him who had kidnapped, robbed and 
repeatedly raped a 12-year old girl. When it was time to sentence the 22-year 
old villain Judge McKay said:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``When you slithered out of your hole that day and spewed your venom all 
over this defenceless girl, you made this court's top ten list of the lowest 
scum this country has to offer. In a way the best sentence this court could 
give would be no sentence at  all because if you left this courtroom I don't 
think you would be alive 10 minutes. You are nothing but a weed among 
wheat. When we have a weed, it is my job to eradicate it because if I don't 
you will choke the wheat. Therefore I am going to take you off the streets for 
as long as I can''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The judge then ticked off long sentence after long sentence for each crime 
committed against the girl. ``You won't be eligible for parole until you're 
92'', the judge pronounced, ``that leaves only one more count, aggravated 
robbery. You stole this little girl's bra as a souvenir, probably to brag about it 
to your friends. I'm going to give you a souvenir of Trumball County justice, 
and that is a maximum sentence of 10 to 25 on the aggravated robbery for 
stealing that bra and I hope that in your last 25 years in prison you remember 
that souvenir. Get this scum out of here''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1755) </B>
<P>
	There are millions of Canadians across this country who are 
demanding that type of justice for that level of criminal. When a 
17-year-old in Canada murders or rapes they should know they 
are going to face serious, severe consequences. Three meals a 
day in our current youth detention centres and time to practise 
more criminal skills does not cut it.
<P>
	I believe inmates in adult prisons should not be idle either. 
Reform of the entire prison system is not the subject of this bill.
<P>
	In summary, young offenders must know they will get caught, 
they will be convicted and they will be punished. Young 
offenders must know that justice will be swift and sure and they 
must know what to expect.
<P>
	Bill C-37 is a start but our entire youth justice system must be 
overhauled now. It should include 10 and 11 year olds who are 
slipping through cracks of underfunded child protection 
agencies and becoming habitual criminals before the age of 12. 
It should recognize that all 16 and 17 year olds are responsible 
for their actions, not society. It is their choice to break the law.
<P>
	We must commit the resources to implement and monitor 
programs for first time offenders. We must establish or expand 
highly structured and disciplined youth detention facilities and 
programs that teach habitual and violent young criminals 
respect for our values and laws.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harold Culbert (Carleton-Charlotte, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened to the presentation of my hon. colleague with 
a great deal of interest as he discussed Bill C-37.
<P>
	One of the points that we should recall in that bill quite 
obviously is the fact that 16 and 17 year olds are moved over to 
adult court and there is only one way as I understand that piece 
of legislation for them to even be considered in youth court. 
They must prove for some reason beyond a doubt and must have 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9855"> 9855 </A></B>
<P>
that evidence agreed to by the judge that they would be 
considered for youth court.
<P>
	That would happen in very limited situations with extenuating 
circumstances. As we know also basically this new legislation 
would double sentences.
<P>
	Further, I would like to touch on a presentation that I recently 
had the opportunity to attend by Dr. Fraser Mustard. The 
presentation indicated the research that he had done over many 
years. While many in this House would recognize that a few 
short years ago when we looked at early intervention with 
children we thought of kindergarten age. Today according to Dr. 
Mustard we are looking at a much young age. We are looking at 
an age as low as six months for proper nutrition, for nurturing 
and for assistance.
<P>
<B>(1800) </B>
<P>
	My question for my hon. colleague would be formed in this 
fashion. Does he not believe that community assistance and 
community help in addition to those changes in Bill C-37 to 
make penalties stiffer is certainly something that we all have to 
work for in order to prevent those crimes from happening and 
the necessity to punish our youth in the future?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
thank my hon. colleague for his thoughts on my presentation and 
for his question.
<P>
	I will try to address my answer to the issues he raised in the 
same order that he did. As to the transfer of 16 and 17 year olds 
under Bill C-37 to adult court, he is quite correct. The onus is on 
the individual, on the young offender, to apply and give reasons 
why he or she should be kept in youth court.
<P>
	As a previous speaker noted, there is also the facility that 
came forward by way of an amendment when it was at 
committee stage where the prosecutor and the defence attorney 
can get together and make that decision before it comes to court. 
This leaves the whole thing open to exactly what we have seen in 
cases of plea bargaining. It is of real concern to us.
<P>
	As I stated in my speech, 16 and 17 year olds should not be 
given that option. At 16 years old, these children know exactly 
what they are doing. They should know the consequences of 
committing that crime. Therefore there should be automatic 
transfer with no chance to be tried in the same youth court that 
would try a 12-year-old.
<P>
	As far as the comment about the sentencing provisions of Bill 
C-37 that double the sentence, my understanding is that Bill 
C-37 only doubles the sentence for murder.
<P>
	As I said also in my speech, the sentence goes from five to ten 
years. I personally believe that for first degree murder, 10 years 
is not long enough. It certainly is not when one looks at the 
maximum. It can be six years in closed confinement and four 
years in open.
<P>
	As to the comment about the community service, certainly I 
support that concept. I referred to it in my speech as well. We 
have to have all the forces that can be brought into play. That is 
not the answer in all cases.
<P>
	The wilderness camps are not the answer either. Closed 
confinement is not the answer for everyone. We have to look at a 
wide range. However, the concern that members are hearing 
from Reformers is that there are those individuals out there who 
constantly flaunt the law.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I am sure you are familiar with a case of three 
young offenders last spring in Edmonton who broke into a young 
family's home. They knew the family was at home. The young 
mother woke up and disturbed their burglary. They could have 
ran. She was no threat to them. However they had absolutely no 
respect for law or even for human life. They cold bloodedly 
murdered her. They stabbed her to death.
<P>
	That is why Reformers say we have to get tough with these 
people. We have to send a message that our society is not going 
to condone that type of behaviour.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I did not want to take part in this debate; I especially 
did not wish to comment on the hon. member's speech. 
However, given the well-known difference between his way of 
thinking and the mentality in Quebec, I feel compelled to speak 
up.
<P>
	The way I view these matters is far removed from that of the 
Reformers. To listen to the hon. member, one would think that 
young people are the very scourge of society. One would think 
that young people 18 years of age or younger are truly 
responsible for the majority of crimes or that crime is increasing 
because of 18 year olds. We need only look at the statistics. I am 
a Bloc member and I will use statistics from Justice Canada: we 
see that the average number of persons under 18 years of age 
suspected of homicide has dropped considerably in recent years 
as compared with the 1970s.
<P>
<B>(1805) </B>
<P>
	Since the 1970s, I believe that the number of serious and 
abhorrent crimes committed by young offenders has decreased. 
There are of course the tabloids-the type of newspaper 
Reformers probably read-which report and in fact highlight 
such serious crimes. Yet that is not a true representation of what 
is happening in Canadian society, especially in QUebec.
<P>
	Would the hon. member please say whether, in his own 
province at least, the present young offenders act is enforced in 
the spirit of its objective? Specifically, the act states that ``the 
protection of society. . . is a primary objective of the criminal 
law applicable to youth''. This objective is served by 
rehabilitating young persons whenever possible. In his own 
province, is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9856"> 9856 </A></B>
<P>
the act enforced with this objective in mind at least? Is there a 
system to rehabilitate and reintegrate these young people? It is 
fine to criticize, but are the minimum  instruments in place to 
help reintegrate these young people into society? I think not.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
hope I will be granted as much time as was granted my hon. 
colleague who just rose with his comments.
<P>
	I have a couple of comments. The hon. member from the Bloc 
finds himself a thousand miles away from Reform thinking. 
That is very obvious and all I can say is thank goodness for that.
<P>
	The hon. member likes to quote statistics. I notice that most 
members seem to be using statistics that support their case. I 
guess we will continue to do that as long as this debate lasts.
<P>
	I am referring to the Canadian Centre for Justice statistics 
which say: ``Since 1992-93 the number of property cases has 
decreased by 5 per cent''-this is referring to young offenders' 
statistics-``while the numbers of cases in all other offence 
categories have either increased or remained near the same 
level. The number of cases involving violence has increased by 
8 per cent''.
<P>
	We can all quote statistics. We can all say the problem is 
getting worse or better, depending on what side of the House we 
are on and what side of the argument we are on.
<P>
	The point I would make to the hon. member is this. The people 
who are demanding justice the loudest are the children 
themselves, the good kids. We tend to forget that. Some seem to 
think that if Reformers get up and say that we have to get serious 
with these young offenders that we are somehow attacking 
youth.
<P>
	We are trying to defend the youth who are the good citizens, 
the model citizens, the ones who are afraid to go to school, 
scared to walk down the street after dark because they could be 
attacked by some gang because the gang is not being properly 
dealt with by the system. The system is failing these young 
people.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Cannis (Scarborough Centre, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
let me say how pleased I am to have the opportunity to join in 
this debate on such an important issue as the well thought out 
and timely amendments to the Young Offenders Act that have 
been proposed by the Minister of Justice.
<P>
	The issue of youth crime and youth in general has been a part 
of the Canadian political scene since the passage of the Juvenile 
Delinquency Act in 1908. It was completely overhauled in the 
mid-1980s and replaced by the current Young Offenders Act 
which has gone unamended since its initial passage.
<P>
	The government made certain commitments and promises 
during the election campaign. It promised to move on this 
specific issue. As a matter of fact it was a promise instrumental 
in my election to Parliament. Once again we have delivered as 
we have on so many other issues. Even the media has praised us 
for our efforts and I admire them for doing so.
<P>
	Let me quote an article by an Ottawa reporter. ``The Tories 
talked tough on law and order, but the Liberals have acted'' says 
Sean Dirkan of the Ottawa <I>Sun</I>. ``Jean Chrétien's red book 
brigade have introduced more tough law and order legislation in 
a little under nine months in office than the Tories did during 
nine years in power''.
<P>
<B>(1810 ) </B>
<P>
	He points to measures introduced by the Minister of Justice 
and by the Solicitor General, measures such as amendments to 
the Young Offenders Act, sentencing reform, a crackdown on 
child sex offenders and reform to the correctional and parole 
systems. It goes on and on.
<P>
	This legislation does not stand alone, nor should it stand 
alone. It will no doubt have an important impact on various other 
portfolios. Not unlike a car engine, all cylinders must work 
together, one province co-operating with the other, all levels of 
government and political parties working together in harmony 
to achieve this very important goal.
<P>
	The most important player is the family unit. That is where it 
all begins.
<P>
	Several months ago my family had a frightening experience 
with a group of youths at the exhibition grounds in Toronto. 
Since that time I have urged the Minister of Justice to act swiftly 
to bring forward changes to the Young Offenders Act so that we 
can once again make our streets safe for ourselves and for our 
children.
<P>
	Since my election to the House I have had the opportunity to 
speak with many of my constituents regarding this legislation. 
One common theme that has consistently been raised is that the 
crime situation has grown out of control in general and among 
youths in particular.
<P>
	Although the crime rate has not increased according to 
Statistics Canada, it is the seriousness of youth crime which has 
been amplified both in the media and by the Reform Party 
specifically.
<P>
	A recent article in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> stated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>No longer are students simply breaking windows and stealing from corner 
stores, rather they are breaking into cars and carrying weapons to school.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In the city of Scarborough, school board officials have 
recently noted that prior to the implementation of the board's 
zero tolerance policy they were finding 25 weapons a month, of 
which half were strictly possession for self-defence and the 
other 50 per cent were used to intimidate, scare and assault. I 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9857"> 9857 </A></B>
<P>
find that very disturbing. Our children attend schools for 
educational and intellectual stimulation, not to intimidate or 
assault. They  should be taking pens, pencils, books and 
calculators to classrooms, not guns and knives.
<P>
	The government's real interest is in attacking the roots of 
youth crime, getting at the circumstances that breed crime, 
learning why youths have committed those crimes and ensuring 
that they do not happen again so as to stop the next generation of 
potential criminals. These circumstances include child poverty, 
youth unemployment, inadequate day care and insufficient 
counselling for high risk families and children before they fall 
into a criminal pattern. We must attack those roots and prevent 
criminal behaviour before it starts.
<P>
	The 12th report of the standing committee on justice released 
in 1993 stated that we must attack the roots of crime, including 
unemployment, physical and sexual abuse and neglect, 
illiteracy, low self-esteem, substance abuse, glorification of 
violence in film, video and television, school failure, 
dysfunctional families and inequality.
<P>
	This is not to say that we should ignore or simply pardon 
crimes committed by youth, who unfortunately, due to 
circumstances beyond their control, have violated. Youth must 
be held accountable. They must learn to be accountable for their 
actions. If they violate societal rules they should be punished. 
They must learn at an early age to be respectful, responsible and 
accountable. It is at this stage that the family plays a vital role.
<P>
	We must go beyond punishment. We must rehabilitate those 
who break the law and that is what this legislation also does. It 
provides for the punishment of violators while recognizing that 
the most successful treatment for young offenders is not only 
punishment, but rather to both punish and rehabilitate so that the 
offender will learn that it is wrong to commit a crime, know why 
it is wrong and will not reoffend.
<P>
	The onus to reduce crime is not just on the government to 
bring in and amend legislation. The onus is also on the 
participants of society. The family is paramount in helping to 
alleviate the problem of youth crime. This is the first line of 
defence. It is here that youth receive their earliest level of 
socialization and they are taught right from wrong.
<P>
	The onus also falls on our educational system and our 
educators. They must step forward and show leadership and 
compassionate guidance, become once again role models for 
their students and motivate and encourage them to become 
nothing but the best. But the school system must also have the 
opportunity to function in an environment that is free from fear.
<P>
<B>(1815 ) </B>
<P>
	The onus also falls on our police forces to properly carry out 
the law. If we are going to ask them to provide and improve their 
performance, to take a leading role in crime prevention without 
seriously jeopardizing their lives, we have an obligation to 
provide the proper resources so they may be able to serve and 
protect the public.
<P>
	The onus also falls greatly on the CRTC in the type of 
programs that are easily and readily available which so much 
influence our youth of today. I have an article here from the 
Toronto <I>Sun</I> about Jamie Taylor and Mark Williams who became 
murderers at age 17.
<P>
	It states here how Jamie Taylor grew up as an abused and 
neglected child. When he was three Jamie was rushed to hospital 
after his step father severely beat him with a curtain rod. Since 
the age of 12 he had no supervision. He did whatever he wanted. 
His mother often disappeared for a month at a time without 
checking in on him. Jamie grew up watching macho man 
destructo movies, playing war games, embracing the very tough 
image. That was his way of having a leading role.
<P>
	We also know of a case in the U.K. in which a youth watching 
a video took an axe and seriously injured the child he was baby 
sitting. We can see here how constant bombardment of this 
nature not only can but does influence people's minds and 
behaviours.
<P>
	When we do apprehend, convict and incarcerate these people, 
let us ask ourselves is the problem solved? I do not think so. This 
is what I mean. Mark Williams has had virtually no treatment in 
six years. He has seen his case worker four times, less than once 
a year. Mark also states how he has had to rehabilitate himself. Is 
the system helping in any way to prepare this person to re-enter 
society? I do not think so. I am very worried because his parole 
comes up in 1998.
<P>
	I have stated in the past that I would make the parole request 
contingent upon successful completion of a rehabilitation 
program so that the risk of reoffending can be if not eliminated, 
greatly minimized.
<P>
	It has been said many times by many people and deserves 
repeating once again that our youth are Canada's future. 
However, it has been said recently this is the first generation that 
will not have a higher standard of living than its parents. For me 
that is truly a tragedy.
<P>
	Youth should be a time of bright optimism. Today our youth 
find themselves facing problems that are not of their own 
making. Unemployment for youth is at an all time high. We are 
in an economy grown weak by constant tinkering, a political 
situation that to many seems to defy solutions, an economy 
weakened by constant talk of separation which has brought 
nothing but instability. We hear of investors in companies 
hesitating to expand and invest because they do not know if 
Quebec will be in or out tomorrow.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9858"> 9858 </A></B>
<P>
	It is no wonder that our youth live in a perpetual sense of 
pessimism. I think it is time to move away from political 
rhetoric to concentrate on economic renewal, development and 
job creation for our youth.
<P>
	We must work together to turn this sense of hopelessness 
around. We must encourage our youth to stay in school, 
complete their studies and become valuable members of our 
community. We as a government have initiated programs to do 
just that. However, our government or any government cannot 
do it alone.
<P>
	In partnership with the other players in society, the 
businesses, the educators, the community groups as well as 
members of the opposition parties, we must work together to 
achieve this goal of eliminating youth crime.
<P>
	Some of the proposed amendments to the Young Offenders 
Act such as doubling the sentences for those convicted of first 
and second degree murder go a long way in doing so. Also, 
victim impact statements would be allowed where victims, 
should they wish, would now have the opportunity to make a 
statement about how a young offender's crime has affected 
them. I believe this will certainly go a long way in helping the 
courts to see the broader picture in imposing proper sentences.
<P>
	With respect to medical and psychological assessments, we 
will with these amendments give the courts the authority to 
request assessments be done on chronic and serious young 
offenders without having to request consent from the offender.
<P>
	Through these amendments we have also established an 
information sharing system which I believe is very important. 
Records and information would be shared and would also allow 
the release of information of young offenders to affected 
members of the public where there might be a risk to them in the 
entire community. This information would be shared among 
professionals, for example between the police, school officials, 
child welfare agencies, day care centres, et cetera.
<P>
<B>(1820) </B>
<P>
	Again, we can see here that this will help minimize the risk 
and we will add more protection for all. Most important, with 
these new amendments the young offender who was charged 
with murder, attempted murder, manslaughter, aggravated and 
sexual assault will now automatically be transferred to adult 
court.
<P>
	This is a very important step because the onus here will now 
be on the youth to prove that they should be tried in the youth 
court as opposed to adult court. We can see therefore that all 
these amendments go a long way in sending a strong message 
that crime at any level will and can no longer be tolerated.
<P>
	In conclusion, we can clearly see that these changes, some of 
which I have mentioned, are a step in the right direct so as to 
help our youth get started in the right direction and send a strong 
message that violence will no longer be tolerated.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is always a pleasure to hear government members 
speak on bills like Bill C-37.
<P>
	The bill on young offenders was hotly discussed in Quebec. I 
would like the member to tell me whether Bill C-37 reflects the 
opinion of the Quebecers who spoke before the justice 
committee. Their message to summarize it in very clear terms, 
was ``do not touch the Young Offenders Act''. The act is only 
good if each province enforces it and, to the best of our 
knowledge, Quebec enforces it the most. The provinces that say 
the Young Offenders Act is no good are those that do not enforce 
it.
<P>
	Is the government member aware of that and will he tell me 
whether Quebec's demands are respected in the government's 
proposed amendments to Bill C-37? Perhaps Quebec's reaction 
to the Young Offenders Act is an example of its distinct 
character.
<P>
	Will the member tell me whether the amendments to the bill 
contain changes to meet Quebec's demands?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cannis:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his 
question. In our red book commitment when we looked at this 
issue we did not try to look at B.C.'s, Quebec's or Ontario's 
interest. We tried to look after Canada's interest because it is 
Canada's youth. It is not Quebec's youth, not Ontario's youth, 
not B.C.'s youth.
<P>
	It is an overall picture that we are looking at here. I believe the 
members from the Bloc Quebecois and the members from the 
Reform Party should learn to put our differences aside for a 
moment and work on streamlining these amendments together 
collectively to bring forward the proper amendments, to send 
the right kind of message as a united force that violence will no 
longer be tolerated whether it be youth in Quebec, Ontario or 
anywhere in the country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, to 
the hon. member I would like to say how much I appreciate his 
family values and the importance and emphasis he puts on 
schools and the function that they have to perform. I compliment 
him on his speech in that manner. He did a very good job.
<P>
	I would like to ask the hon. member to comment on something 
that crosses my mind when we talk about what we are going to 
do with regard to these problems. Over the course of the last 20 
or 25 years or whatever we talked about causes. The causes, we 
have to search them out.
<P>
	I remember the drinking age being 21 and how that was 
lowered. That simply meant that it was lowered even lower than 
the illegal drinking age. Instead of 18 and 19 year olds illegally 
drinking, now it is 14, 15 and 13 year olds.
<P>

	I think of pornography. There was a time we did not have any. 
Now it is running rampant. We have a lady in Alberta who is 
fighting hard to get rid of pornography, peep shows, nude 
dancing, all these things which we know contribute to the minds 
of our youth in a very negative way. It is a cause.
<P>
<B>(1825) </B>
<P>
	If you walked down the street and called a policeman a pig 
when you were a young man, what would happen? You would 
not do it out of fear, but more so out of respect. Now it is 
common practice. Yet there is no recourse, no way in the world 
that they are supposed to do any thing. We do not meet violence 
with violence. We listen to all of this bad mouthing-causes.
<P>
	It seems like every time I address it the one thing that comes 
up is a wall that is put in front of me. If we want to do something 
about these causes, it is the Charter of Rights and Freedoms that 
stops us so many times. When we decide we want to do 
something about a problem we have to remember the rights. I 
think it is a hindrance in our judicial system in that regard with 
young offenders.
<P>
	Would the hon. member comment on that?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cannis:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
question. As much as I would like to agree with him, I cannot. In 
any civilized society we need to have a basis to function around. 
We need a charter. We need rules and regulations. Sometimes we 
do not agree with them. We need obviously rules and regulations 
to protect us.
<P>
	There have been times when people abuse these rights. I am 
not disagreeing with that. This is why the Minister of Justice is 
taking the initiative to bring forth changes. I am not saying that 
these changes are going to solve our problem. As we know there 
is ongoing consultation. The justice committee has not finished 
its work. It will continue.
<P>
	We have often heard the saying that Rome was not built 
overnight. The minister cannot bring forth an amendment that 
will solve every one of our problems. This is a step in the right 
direction.
<P>
	I certainly would hope that the justice committee would 
continue to look at the situation, monitor it and make continuous 
recommendations. Hopefully as time goes on we will make new 
changes, new amendments that will hopefully improve the 
system and make it safer for ourselves and our children.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I too 
would like to commend the hon. member for his speech. I 
enjoyed it very much. It is that kind of attitude that certainly we 
can work with on this side.
<P>
	There are some things that the government can do and there 
are other things it cannot do to help people out. My hon. 
colleague from Wild Rose mentioned this point. We have a 
problem with pornography and these other things which eat 
away at the moral fibre of our society, in particular the moral 
fibre of our young people.
<P>
	Would the hon. member be prepared to support the 
elimination of pornography, pass laws that would do away with 
peep shows where people for a fee can come in and watch girls 
dancing and gyrating on the other side naked? Would he be 
prepared to pass laws to support the elimination of naked 
dancing in bars and lap dancing? Would the member be prepared 
to support legislation, initiate legislation, on the government 
side to eliminate this kind of conduct that has such a terrible, 
negative-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Scarborough 
Centre has about a minute.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cannis:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
warm comments about my presentation. I campaigned on family 
values. I tried to reflect that in my presentation.
<P>
	I personally do not approve of pornography, especially child 
pornography, and I certainly would like to see the elimination of 
child pornography and see people who engage in that type of 
pornography harshly penalized.
<P>
	This legislation is not one that addresses this specific 
concern. I know there are proposals to address these concerns. I 
hope that the quicker we bring them forth the cleaner and safer 
our society will be.
<P>
	There are so many justice issues that we have to address it 
would be unfair to spread ourselves too thin. We are attacking 
one specific issue and that is the Young Offenders Act in this 
debate.
<P>
	I certainly hope that the other issues, as the member has 
stated, come forth as soon as possible so that we can address 
them with the thrust with which we are addressing this Young 
Offenders Act. As I stated earlier, I think this is a step in the 
right direction. I believe there is room in the future, but again, 
let us not prejudge our youth. Let us give them the benefit of the 
doubt.
<P>
<B>(1830) </B>
<P>
	In the future I would be very happy to work in the area of 
eliminating pornography.

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">ADJOURNMENT PROCEEDINGS</H2>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 
deemed to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CUSTOMSTARIFFS">CUSTOMS TARIFFS</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
worried about the federal government's unwillingness to 
intervene while Canadian customs tariffs are under attack from 
the U.S., I questioned the Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food last Friday. What I was asking the minister to do was 
to ready his 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9860"> 9860 </A></B>
<P>
guns and get down to confronting the Americans on the yogurt 
and ice cream issue.
<P>
	Let me remind you briefly of the cause for my concern. 
According to U.S. commerce secretary, Mickey Kantor, Canada 
is in breach of the North American free trade agreement when it 
imposes tariffs varying between 100 and 300 per cent on ice 
cream, yogurt, eggs and poultry exported to the U.S. On the 
other hand, under the GATT agreements, customs tariffs should 
be going down gradually over the next six years.
<P>
	That is where I start having a problem with the Liberal 
government's inaction. The minister stated that the Canadian 
government was determined to defend dairy and poultry 
producers. I wish I could believe the government, but if it acts in 
the future like it did in the past, after seeing what it has done to 
Article XI of the GATT agreement, I must say that I can only 
doubt the good will, the genuine willingness of the minister and 
his government.
<P>
	In response to my question, the minister also reiterated his 
government's support to the Canadian supply management 
system. In my sense, nothing is more uncertain than the 
Canadian government's willingness to fight for our supply 
management system. I would not be surprised if the 
government's feebleness on the ice cream and yogurt issue were 
the price to be paid to the Americans for resolving the conflict 
over Western wheat last summer.
<P>
	One way to settle this dispute that may very well, in my 
opinion, degenerate into a trade war is to stop putting our heads 
in the sand and fight for recognition of GATT's precedence over 
NAFTA. All we have said so far is that GATT should indeed 
prevail, but we do not say it too loud to keep our American 
partners from hearing us.
<P>
	Three days ago, the minister gave me the following answer: 
``If the United States has a different point of view and wants to 
take a run at us, we obviously cannot stop it from taking a run at 
us, but if it does, we will defend ourselves with everything we 
have''. Incidentally, what do we have to defend our farmers 
with?
<P>
	I do not think the minister has any effective means to defend 
our farmers because he has not gone to a GATT panel that could 
settle the Canada-U.S. dispute. Allow me to quote the 
Federation of Dairy Producers of Canada: ``Unfortunately, the 
U.S.-based controversy surrounding the GATT and NAFTA 
regulations on tariff quotas has reached such proportions that 
our dairy producers are increasingly doubtful that Canada will 
succeed in negotiating a bilateral agreement that will benefit 
them''. This quote does not come from me.
<P>
<B>(1835) </B>
<P>
	In a news bulletin, a few moments ago, I heard Claude Rivard 
and the vice-president of the Quebec milk producers' federation 
at a press conference here in Ottawa beg the government to show 
some guts and take action.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lyle Vanclief (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure 
to respond to the hon. member's comments tonight.
<P>
	On February 2 the United States trade representative, 
Ambassador Kantor, requested formal consultations under 
NAFTA relating to the U.S. access to the Canadian market for 
dairy and poultry products.
<P>
	The Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food and the Minister 
for International Trade have repeated frequently and remain of 
the view that our application of tariff equivalents in our bilateral 
trade in poultry and dairy products, including ice cream and 
yogurt, is fully consistent with our rights under GATT and 
NAFTA. In fact, the ministers issued a press release on February 
2 of this year setting out that view so there could be no 
misunderstanding on it. The Canadian position has not changed 
and is not changing. Moreover, both ministers stated their view 
again in this House last Friday.
<P>
	The U.S. request for consultations should be seen as just that, 
a request to meet with us and to discuss the issue. The fact that 
the U.S. is seeking consultations under the dispute settlement 
provisions of NAFTA does give it a more formal character, I 
agree, but it does not alter its fundamental nature.
<P>
	Requests for formal consultations occur quite frequently 
between trading partners. Sometimes they are in the form of a 
panel before they are over. Other times the consultations are 
adequate to resolve the issue. In some cases they are concluded 
only after lengthy discussions.
<P>
	We expect these consultations to start in the next week or so. 
In this particular case we are satisfied that our legal position is 
sound and we will continue to hold our own. Our preferred 
approach is a negotiated solution.
<P>
	It could be expected that the issue might arise in the upcoming 
visit of Mr. Clinton to Ottawa. If it does, the Canadian line will 
not change. We are acting within our trade agreement rights and 
we will defend those rights.

<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="SOCIALHOUSING">SOCIAL HOUSING</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
last Friday I put a question to the minister responsible for social 
housing about the unfair way Quebec is being treated with 
respect to social housing.
<P>
	I wanted to ask him whether he was aware of the fact that 
Quebec has had a potential loss of $100 million per year for 
several years. On a per capita basis, Quebec should receive at 
least 25 per cent of CMHC spending, but at the present time, it 
gets only 20 per cent. One hundred million dollars annually is a 
<P>

<B><A NAME="9861"> 9861 </A></B>
<P>
lot of money. If we were to calculate this on the basis of need, 
Quebec should receive as much as 29 per cent of the CMHC 
budget.
<P>
	So a shortfall of $100 million annually for Quebec is a lot of 
money, and that is a conservative estimate. In fact, this is all part 
of the government's attempt to get another $25 million or $26 
million out of the pockets of people who live in so-called social 
housing. The government intends to raise rents by 20 per cent. It 
looks more like the government has no social housing policy at 
all.
<P>
<B>(1840) </B>
<P>
	Funding for social housing has been frozen since the Liberal 
Party came to power. Quebec is not getting its fair share, and 
now they want to raise the rents of the neediest group in Quebec. 
Would the government like to clarify this? Would it at least 
admit that this is unfair, and would it like to explain what it is 
doing with respect to social housing? Does this government 
have a social housing policy?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réginald Bélair (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to respond to my colleague's statement.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I want to be very clear on one point. This government is 
committed within the current financial climate to social housing 
for all Canadians in need. This includes those Canadians who 
reside in the province of Quebec.
<P>
	In order to fully understand how existing housing 
expenditures are made, my friend must recognize that in the 
early years of public housing the province of Quebec elected not 
to participate. For example, under the old rent supplement 
program, Ontario began participating in 1971, whereas Quebec 
only joined in 1978. In those years, Ontario delivered 9,500 
units for which it continues to receive subsidies, whereas 
Quebec delivered no units and as such has no subsidy.
<P>
	Notwithstanding history, our friend across the way must 
understand that dollars for new housing commitments in Canada 
are now distributed according to a formula based on core need, 
not on population. That important distinction must be 
recognized. According to these principles, each region receives 
its share of housing dollars for new commitments.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In 1993-94, some $350 million was spent in Quebec, which 
provided assistance for more than 140,000 social housing units. 
Quebec also received additional funds because of special 
circumstances. I am referring to the $4 million provided under 
the RESO program established to improve living conditions in 
southwestern Montreal and promote local development.
<P>
	I am also referring to the $5 million given to the Montreal 
owner-occupants whose homes were damaged by the drought.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Finally, on the point of the alleged $100 million that is not 
going into Quebec, my friend is aware that the number he is 
using is false. He knows it. It is most regrettable that the 
member and the Bloc Quebecois are attempting to play 
separatist games on the backs of those in Quebec who can least 
afford it. He should come clean with Canadians and Quebecers.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="IMMIGRATION">IMMIGRATION</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, earlier today the Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration stated that I understood neither the Immigration 
and Refugee Board nor the refugee process.
<P>
	As for my supposed misunderstanding of immigration law, 
section 19.1(a)(i) and (ii) and (b) of the Immigration Act clearly 
states the grounds by which an individual is to be refused 
admission into Canada. It states that one is not to be allowed into 
Canada if they are: first, likely to pose a danger to public health 
or safety; second, would cause excessive demands on the health 
care system; or third, are unable to support themselves in 
society.
<P>
	Given Mr. Arthur Lasha fits all these grounds, he should not 
have been allowed into Canada and should be both stripped of 
his status and returned to his native Poland. In regard to the 
specifics of the case, according to numerous reports, this HIV 
infected individual was accepted as a refugee by the IRB based 
both on the disease he carries and the reaction the Polish people 
showed toward him.
<P>
	Mr. Lasha's claims are ludicrous and the IRB should have 
known the following. First, the Polish parliament is currently in 
the process of passing a broadly supported bill recognizing same 
sex marriages. Second, a constitutional amendment recognizing 
the equality of homosexuality and heterosexuality is in the 
process of being adopted there. Therefore, the claim that there is 
systematic discrimination against homosexuals and, as in Mr. 
Lasha's case, HIV carriers, is groundless.
<P>
	Clearly Mr. Lasha has not been entirely honest in describing 
his homeland. The minister has not accurately portrayed the 
facts in terms of refugee claims based on homosexuality. The 
minister said that only two such claims have come before the 
IRB.
<P>
	In Newfoundland alone the claim has 90 per cent acceptance 
rate. According to a legal aid official in that province it is 
becoming a popular approach to staying in this country.
<P>
	The minister spoke a great deal about Mr. Lasha being a 
member of a social group, that being by sexual orientation, and 
cited the Supreme Court of Canada as having made that 
decision.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="9862"> 9862 </A></B>
<P>
	In the 1993 case of Canada v. Ward, the Supreme Court set out 
the guidelines for assessing whether an individual was a 
member of a social group. There were three possibilities: first, 
groups defined by an innate or immutable characteristic; 
second, groups defined by an association so important to their 
human dignity that they should not be forced to forsake the 
association; and third, groups defined by a former voluntary 
status, immutable due to historic permanence.
<P>
	The court also suggested possible groups for examination, 
including homosexuality, but added it was the job of legislators, 
not the courts, to decide whether or not homosexuality could be 
considered a social group.
<P>
	Given that the question of whether homosexuality is the result 
of genetic makeup or environmental influence is far from being 
settled, the minister cannot say whether Mr. Lasha was or was 
not a member of a social group.
<P>
	The IRB was therefore gravely misguided to make this 
judgment on the assumption that this individual held an innate 
or immutable characteristic.
<P>
	To conclude, in this case the IRB was wrong on a number of 
accounts. It ignored several subsections of section 19 of the 
Immigration Act, placing an unfair burden on the health care 
system and Canadian society as a whole.
<P>
	Second, it failed to examine Polish society and the accepting 
environment that the government is fostering toward the 
homosexual community.
<P>
	Third, it failed to use the definition of social group properly, 
as outlined by the Supreme Court of Canada.
<P>
	Given all this, it is clear that the Immigration and Refugee 
Board has failed those legitimately seeking protection in 
Canada from well founded persecution. It has failed Canadian 
society by allowing in those who clearly should not be admitted 
into this country.
<P>
	Now that the minister is fully aware of the facts of this case, 
will he not accurately portray the facts about immigration 
application and acceptance? Second, will he have this individual 
deported immediately? Third, will he disband the IRB? Fourth, 
will he replace the IRB with competent immigration officials 
armed with well established guidelines centred around helping 
those from around the world truly in need of immediate 
protection?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Susan Whelan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of National Revenue, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as the member 
knows, the decision was made by the Immigration and Refugee 
Board which is a quasi-judicial independent decision making 
body.
<P>
	On the broad general issue of sexual orientation there are two 
compelling facts that may help explain the issue. In June 1993 
the Supreme Court ruled that sexual orientation constitutes 
membership in a particular social group.
<P>
	As well, the Geneva convention recognizes that in certain 
countries, members of particular social groups have grounds to 
fear persecution. It is on these grounds that individuals are 
eligible to apply for refugee status, not only in Canada but in all 
other countries that are signatories to the Geneva convention.
<P>
	This case does not set a precedent. To date there have only 
been two cases on the basis of sexual orientation. One claim was 
determined to be negative. The other, the claim the member 
raises, was determined to be positive following an appeal to the 
Federal Court of Canada.,
<P>
	Let me inform the member that Canada is not the only country 
to accept refugees on the basis of sexual orientation. In fact the 
United States, Germany and New Zealand have all accepted the 
positive claims on the basis of sexual orientation.
<P>
	In conclusion, when claims are evaluated it is with a view to 
offering Canada's protection from systemic persecution and 
abuse. I remind the member that Canada has been 
internationally recognized for its compassion and thorough 
stand on human rights issues when it comes to refugee 
determination in Canada.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Pursuant to Standing Order 38, the 
motion to adjourn the House has now been deemed to have been 
adopted. Accordingly the House stands adjourned until 
tomorrow at 10 a.m. pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
