<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="HEALTHCANADAADVERTISEMENT-SPEAKER'SRULING">HEALTH CANADA ADVERTISEMENT-SPEAKER'S RULING</A></H4>
	<B>The Speaker: </B>I am now ready to rule on the question of 
privilege raised on March 4, 1997 by the hon. member for 
Laurier-Sainte-Marie, concerning a Health Canada advertisement 
published in certain daily newspapers.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I would like to thank the members who spoke to this matter on 
the following day, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, the hon. member for 
Lethbridge, the chief government whip, the hon. members for 
York-South Weston, Joliette and St. Albert.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In his statement, the hon. member for Laurier-Sainte-Marie 
said that an advertisement placed by Health Canada, which 
appeared in Quebec's major newspapers on March 4, 1997 
concerning the ``anti-tobacco law'', was false and affected the 
privileges of the House. He said that the advertisement assumed 
that the House had already enacted Bill C-71, whereas this was not 
the case. By unanimous consent, he tabled a copy of the 
advertisement.
<P>
	I have carefully examined the advertisements in question. In 
their statements, the hon. members for Laurier-Sainte-Marie and 
Lethbridge drew a parallel between the case before us now and one 
that was the subject of a ruling by Speaker Fraser in October 1989. 
Although both cases concern advertising in relation to not-yet 
enacted legislative provisions, there are certain basic differences 
that make the comparison dubious. Before elaborating on these 
obvious differences, I would first like to remind the House of the 
circumstances surrounding the 1989 incident.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	On August 26, 1989 the Department of Finance published an 
advertisement concerning the goods and  services tax, the GST, in 
newspapers across the country. Although the GST legislation had 
not yet been given first reading the advertisement read as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>On January 1, 1991, Canada's Federal Sales Tax System will change. Please save 
this notice. It explains the changes and the reasons for them.</BLOCKQUOTE>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	On September 25, 1989, the then Leader of the Opposition, the 
right hon. John Turner, raised a question of privilege on this issue, 
arguing that the advertisement as published constituted a contempt 
of Parliament. On October 10, 1989, at pages 4457 to 4461 of the 
<I>Debates</I>, Speaker Fraser stated that the purpose of the 
advertisement was not intended to tarnish the dignity of the House 
and that, accordingly, there was no <I>prima facie</I> contempt of 
Parliament. He thought, however, that the advertisement was 
ill-conceived.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Similarly in a recent case before the Ontario legislature Speaker 
Stockwell dealt with a question of privilege concerning 
government advertising. It was alleged that whereas legislation had 
yet to be adopted by the assembly a pamphlet was issued by the 
minister of municipal affairs and housing regarding the 
government's program for reforming municipal governments in 
metropolitan Toronto.
<P>
	On January 22, 1997 Speaker Stockwell considered that the 
contents of this brochure were worded in a very definitive way and 
conveyed the impression that passage of the required legislation 
was not necessary. Consequently, the Speaker determined that a 
prima facie case of contempt had been established.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	On the basis of the two examples just examined and with 
particular attention to the wording of the advertisement published 
by Health Canada, I am of the view that this situation is quite 
different. On the one hand, the 1989 advertisement concerned 
specific provisions of the GST legislation and was worded a style 
that might be described as a categorical affirmation.
<P>
<B>(1010)</B>
<P>
	On the other hand, the Health Canada advertisement appears to 
me to be primarily of an informative nature: certain statements are 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8988"> 8988 </A></B>
<P>
made about the use of tobacco in  Quebec, ending with the slogan 
``J'appuie la loi anti-tabac-C'est une question de santé''.
<P>
	As has been pointed out in discussions on that issue, there is 
nothing that indicates that Bill C-71 has been enacted or even that a 
particular provision of it will come into force on a specific date. 
Also, the English version of the same advertisement refers to 
``anti-tobacco legislation''. In my opinion, it cannot be concluded 
that this advertisement gives the impression that the House has 
already passed Bill C-71.
<P>
	In the case before us, the Speaker's role is to determine whether 
the Health Canada advertisement constitutes a <I>prima facie</I> breach 
of the privileges of the House. Like the hon. member for Joliette, I 
have been unable to find ``malicious intentions'' or an attempt at 
``false representation'' on the part of the government 
representatives.
<P>
	Is this advertisement false and did it tend to diminish the 
authority of the House in the eyes of the public? In the light of the 
facts that have been presented to me, I do not think so and, in the 
absence of evidence to that effect, the Speaker finds it impossible 
to conclude that the advertisement in question is a <I>prima facie</I> 
breach of the privileges of the House.
<P>
	In a decision handed down on June 12, 1996 concerning 
government advertising for Bill 33 on drug insurance, the Speaker 
of the Quebec National Assembly, Jean-Pierre Charbonneau, 
stated, at page 2094 of the <I>Journal des débats</I>:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The constituted authorities are fully entitled, in our political system, to publish 
their decisions and choices affecting their area of jurisdiction.''</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I share the views of Speaker Charbonneau. The government has 
the right to communicate with the public and inform it of its 
policies and its programs. On the other hand, where the 
government issues communications to the public containing 
allusions to measures before the House, it would be advisable to 
choose words and terms that leave no doubt as to the disposition of 
these measures. The use of certain terms or, in the words of the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Leader of the Government in the 
House, ``colloquialisms that are not, strictly speaking, precise'' 
may occasionally give rise to unwanted interpretations.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Those whose duty it is to approve the wording of 
communications to the public for a minister must surely be aware 
that the terms used in parliamentary language have a very specific 
meaning. Trying to avoid them or to use them for advertising 
purposes shows a lack of consideration for the institution of 
Parliament and the role of the members in the legislative process. If 
there is no ambiguity in the choice of terms the public will be better 
served and the House can get on with its work  without being called 
upon to resolve the difficulty caused by such misunderstanding.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Once again, I thank the hon. member for Laurier-Sainte-Marie 
for bringing this matter to the attention of the Speaker.

the number or cap it at the new number of 301 following the  next

has a senatorial selection act which allows for the election of 
British Columbia senators. They also draw attention to the fact that 
British Columbia Senator Len Marchand will resign his Senate seat

Madam Speaker, I would like to withdraw a number of

	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Madam Speaker, is it necessary when withdrawing 
motions to require unanimous consent of the House to withdraw 
those motions?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> They are just 
motions and they are the possession of the hon. member until they 
are moved. Therefore she can withdraw them.
<P>
	We also have Motion No. 48 in the name of the member for 
Edmonton-Strathcona who is not here.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Madam Speaker, we have an unfortunate situation 
with a very ill member who has not able to attend the House today 
for the debate.
<P>
	I wonder if there would be unanimous consent of the House for 
the motions presented in the name of the member for 
Edmonton-Strathcona to be moved by the member for Kootenay 
East, our critic in the area who is leading the debate for our party. 
Would there be unanimous consent for those motions to have been 
deemed moved and seconded?
<P>
<B>(1035 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Arseneault:</B> Madam Speaker, before giving consent, I 
understand the hon. member for Edmonton-Strathcona is ill. We 
accept that point. I hope the same spirit of co-operation the 
government is showing will prevail. We would not be in favour of 
many of those amendments and by not agreeing to the consent it 
would be a very easy way of disposing of them.
<P>
	For the sake of debate and under the circumstances we would 
agree. We hope the same consideration and co-operation will be 
shown during the debate and that there will not be any attempt to 
delay the bill unduly today.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> Is there 
unanimous consent?

	He said: Madam Speaker, I do not plan to debate this grouping at 
any length because it mostly involves technical amendments by the 
government with regard to technical language and whether the 
French and English versions correspond.
<P>
	I have a few remarks to make about the bill in general. Bill C-32 
has gathered some publicity in the hearings and in public. The 
government the bill is balanced. It takes into consideration the 
creators and the users. It went before committee where there were 
many witnesses. We received almost 200 briefs. I am sure members 
of the committee received an equal number of letters touching on 
the bill.
<P>
	I take this opportunity to single out the role of the committee in 
this regard. Considering the way the bill was handled members of 
all parties exhibited consistency in the committee hearings. The 
members showed up consistently, asked quality questions, listened 
to the witnesses and dealt with some issues. There was a lot of 
movement from the beginning of the hearings to the end. I 
congratulate members from all parties.
<P>
	All the amendments in Group No. 1 are technical amendments. 
Some are consequential and result from changes made by the 
standing committee. We made many amendments and might have 
missed a little word here or there along the way. Other amendments 
are required to maintain consistency between the English and the 
French texts.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I will not discuss these amendments in detail. These 
amendments concern technicalities. I can assure you that the 
government support these amendments, and I believe that, if 
opposition members take a close look at them, they will see that 
these are only technical amendments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it is with considerable pride that I rise to speak today as 
official opposition critic for heritage and culture. I am proud 
because this is a bill which sets politics aside and addresses 
copyright. It addresses the moral and economic rights of creators 
over their works.
<P>
<B>(1040)</B>
<P>
	I would remind members that Bill C-32 is the second stage in an 
effort to update a law drafted in 1924, which was amended for the 
first time in 1988. This bill affects creators and authors who have 
waited years to see their rights finally modernized and brought into 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8992"> 8992 </A></B>
<P>
line with the  economic and cultural activities of modern society, 
including the use of new technologies.
<P>
	In 1988, phase I of the bill, the review phase, extended copyright 
protection to computer programs. It also gave creators additional 
moral rights over their works. In addition, it modernized the 
Copyright Appeal Board, now known as the Copyright Board.
<P>
	Finally, in 1988, an extremely pivotal development took place: 
collective societies were recognized. There was recognition of the 
right of authors and creators to be represented by an organization 
that, through its efforts, would oversee the use of authors' and 
creators' works, collect royalties and levies and distribute them to 
artists. This recognition of collective societies is becoming 
important. We will see in the latest phase, Bill C-32, how this 
collective society was an issue when the bill was being studied.
<P>
	Between 1988 and 1994, there were several amendments to the 
Copyright Act so that the government could meet its obligations 
under the free trade agreements, NAFTA and the World Trade 
Organization.
<P>
	Finally, last April, the government, in response to pressure from 
the official opposition, tabled Bill C-32 in phase II of the review 
process and, in so doing, introduced some new and very important 
rights called neighbouring rights, which are granted to performers 
and producers. Performers' rights had not yet been recognized, 
although they are recognized in 50 countries which signed what is 
known as the Rome Convention. Canada dragged its feet but finally 
decided in the course of this session to table this bill and introduce 
neighbouring rights.
<P>
	It also set up what is referred to as a private copying 
compensation system. When the committee held its hearings, many 
groups came to submit their briefs and talk to committee members. 
As we all know, tape-recording for personal use is common 
practice. Even the Consumers' Association of Canada agreed. 
Everyone copies music and songs on tapes. Everyone records tapes, 
people pass them along, and so forth. Everyone agreed this was 
common practice.
<P>
	In its bill, the government introduced a compensation system for 
private copying, which finally recognizes the rights of creators and 
authors by collecting a levy directly from the manufacturer. This 
levy will be redistributed as a kind of basic salary among all 
creators and authors, which we think is only fair. Later on I will tell 
you how many millions of dollars performers lose as a result of 
pirating alone.
<P>
<B>(1045)</B>
<P>
	The bill also establishes book distribution rights for Canada, 
thereby strengthening the position of our book distributors, which 
is most welcome as a way to protect our culture. Finally, it 
improves procedures with respect  to the avenues of legal recourse 
available to performers and to the applicable sanctions in case of 
fraud or if users refuse to comply with the law and pay royalties to 
the authors and creators who need this income to survive.
<P>
	The average performer's salary is between $7,000 and $14,000, 
depending on whether the performer is a performing artist, a singer, 
a composer, an author or something else.
<P>
	So this was a much needed improvement. However, there was a 
big black cloud hovering over this bill: the exceptions.
<P>
	When copyright legislation is drafted so that authors and 
creators can make a living wage by collecting royalties, that is fine. 
But when the bill goes on to explain for pages and pages that 
authors and creators are not entitled to royalties in the case of 
cegeps, colleges, educational institutions, libraries, and many other 
sectors that are exempted from paying copyright, I think this is a 
very black cloud indeed. I will get back to this later on when we 
consider the amendments.
<P>
	Bill C-32, phase II, is most welcome. It is welcomed by the 
entire artistic community, particularly in the case of neighbouring 
rights, by performers, including Quebec performers, whose work is 
played in francophone countries and who receive no royalties 
because Canada is not one of the 50 signatories of the Rome 
Convention.
<P>
	With respect to neighbouring rights, let us recall that the Bloc 
Quebecois had called upon the government to table this bill and 
made a commitment to support it, provided it made specific 
reference to neighbouring rights.
<P>
	We have respected that commitment and will continue today to 
support the government's bill, with its extremely important 
dimension for all artists: neighbouring rights.
<P>
	As for private copying, and all this piracy using blank tapes, let 
us recall that what the government is introducing in the bill is a 
royalty charged directly to the manufacturer, which eventually 
becomes a salary for the artists.
<P>
	This measure will enable artists, who are literally being robbed 
by illegal copying, to receive what is termed a fair share of what is 
owed to them.
<P>
	I would like to remind you that, throughout the committee stage, 
the Bloc Quebecois brought in a series of amendments. I wish to 
congratulate my committee colleagues, for we accomplished a 
huge task. First of all, we received, heard and exchanged views 
with over 65 groups, who came to testify before the committee. I 
must say that all of my colleagues on the committee listened to the 
evidence and asked questions with a very open mind, particularly 
in the search to enhance the objectives of the bill. I wish to again 
congratulate them on their work in committee.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8993"> 8993 </A></B>
<P>
	I would, however, like to draw the government's attention to 
the amendments presented by the Bloc, and to point out that it 
would be important to support the amendments we are presenting 
at the report stage, simply because they concern the interests of 
authors and creators, not the political interests of one party, but 
the interests of authors and creators.
<P>
	I invite the government to support the Bloc Quebecois 
amendments.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, the 
Reform Party fully acknowledges the necessity of the revisions for 
the Copyright Act. As a matter of fact, the Reform Party would be 
very supportive of a well thought out process which would achieve 
that objective. Unfortunately this bill does not represent that well 
thought out approach.
<P>
<B>(1050)</B>
<P>
	The bill was initially tabled on April 23, 1996. It had second 
reading on June 4, 1996 and there was a briefing meeting with 
officials from industry and heritage on June 18, 1996. It was at that 
meeting that we had our first indication that the bill, indeed this 
entire effort on the part of the heritage minister, was in great 
trouble.
<P>
	There were a number of questions that I had posed at that 
briefing meeting that it seemed to me the officials, with all due 
respect, were completely unprepared for. Many parts of the bill, 
unfortunately, had not been thought through at all.
<P>
	When the minister made her presentation to the committee, 
which I believe was in September 1996, she was basically working 
from briefing notes and had not grasped the implications or the 
problems which the bill she was proposing would create both for 
the creators and for the users of the work that comes under 
copyright legislation.
<P>
	The process, unfortunately, went further off track in my 
judgment in that the committee also decided, against my 
protestations, to have the selection of witnesses in camera. There 
was a deletion of concerned parties to the bill. There was a period 
of time when there was a tremendous amount of unhappiness about 
that.
<P>
	I must say that during the process of the crammed committee 
hearings there developed a tremendous spirit of co-operation 
among the members of the committee.
<P>
	As with the member who spoke before me, I would like to pay 
tremendous respect to the members of the committee from all 
parties who worked in that spirit of co-operation. I would 
particularly like to say that the work of the parliamentary secretary 
and the work of the chair of the committee aided the process, and I 
commend them for that.
<P>
	It was unfortunate that the spirit of co-operation, although it was 
leading to a very productive process of  making necessary changes 
and improvements to the bill, ended up being seriously side 
tracked. As a matter of fact, it was fully derailed in a massive train 
wreck by the heritage minister.
<P>
	It seems to me that basically what happened was she came to the 
conclusion that since becoming heritage minister she really had not 
accomplished anything and suddenly decided-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Arseneault:</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. In 
the spirit of co-operation and in the spirit of the rules and 
regulations of the House the hon. member has some flexibility. 
However, to openly get into a debate and criticize other hon. 
members of the House with respect to the process I do not believe 
is fair. I do not think that is called for at report stage. It is more of a 
political debate and I think we should address ourselves to what is 
on the table.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Madam Speaker, what I am trying to say is that the 
process we are now in, unfortunately, is being driven by the 
government and the procedures of the House. Opposition members 
have to have their motions in place by 6.00 p.m. the day prior to 
debate at report stage whereas, by virtue of the standing rules, the 
government only has to show the motions at the very last minute.
<P>
<B>(1055)</B>
<P>
	I would like to quote from the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> dated December 
13, 1996 concerning our situation in committee: ``However, 
because most of the amendments were only circulated to 
committee members and not to the media or a room full of lawyers 
and lobbyists that have been following this bill since April, exact 
details will not be known until February, heritage officials said on 
Thursday''.
<P>
	With deference to the parliamentary secretary I will try to defuse 
this simply by quoting what Michael McCabe, president of the 
Canadian Association of Broadcasters, said on Thursday. He said 
last minute amendments could cost his industry $6 million or more 
and accused the heritage minister of going back on her word and so 
on and so forth.
<P>
	The point is I have seen for the very first time in my short 
parliamentary career since 1993 a committee and a process that 
was working and was being productive. I have commended all the 
members as well as the people who came and the officials of the 
respective departments. This should be an non-partisan issue. This 
should be a non-partisan bill because it has so much impact on so 
many people in Canada.
<P>
	However, the fact that there were last minute amendments, the 
fact that there were behind the curtain discussions between certain 
people in that committee process, the fact that only this morning 
were we made aware of the number of changes being proposed by 
the government, this basically creates a situation where this  bill is 
so badly fouled up and flawed that I do not see we are ever going to 
make any sense of it.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8994"> 8994 </A></B>
<P>
	Furthermore, if we are going to patch this bill back together at all 
we simply must have more time to digest what the government has 
brought forward. We simply must have more time to have 
intelligent debate on this issue. It is far too important to far too 
many Canadians.
<P>
	As a consequence, I move:
<P>

	<B>Mr. Ramsay:</B> Madam Speaker, when I arrived at my seat, the

not have been in my seat at the proper time, I did vote in support of

supporting this motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (North Vancouver):</B> Madam Speaker, I was here on

<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> Madam Speaker, since a 30 minute bell is now a

<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Madam Speaker, a further problem we have 
compounding this vote is that some members who voted before the 
announcement of the vote have left the Chamber again. The 
Minister of National Defence is one but there are perhaps others. I 
do not think that is in order. I am not sure what we should do about 
that.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> In order to 
vote, members have to be in their seats at the moment that the 
question is put and stay in their seats until the result of the vote is 
pronounced by the clerk.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gouk:</B> Madam Speaker, due to the confusion because of the 
timing of the bell and the early walk by the whips and because it 
appears that some members voted who were not in their seats in 
accordance with the directive you just put, and that some members 
left after voting before the results were read, I move that we vote 
again.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Madam Speaker, I know it is your duty of course to 
maintain order and to make sure things are done in an orderly 
fashion. There is some problems with members having left before 
the vote was announced.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> On that point 
of order I have already clarified. There are some members who 
have left and there were some members who were not in the House 
when I called the question and still they did not rise. We will now 
go to the result of the question.
<P>
<B>(1135 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Madam Speaker, I appreciate the clarification of the 
rules. I would like now to ask you what we do if the rules have been

there are such people, how will you know who they are? I know the 
rules, but how will you know who they are if they have left the 
House? What do you do about that?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> I will now ask 
the clerk to read the results of the vote and thereafter we will 
proceed with any other points of order.

<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> I declare the 
motion defeated.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Madam Speaker, I still would like you to explain 
how we know for use if that vote was the vote which accurately 
reflected the vote of the number of people who stayed in their seats 
until the vote was announced. I mentioned one person specifically 
who left the Chamber before the announcement of the vote. That 
person, of course, cannot be counted. Because of what took place, I 
do not know if that person was counted or not. I brought it to your 
attention but I am not sure if it is included in the 84 or not.
<P>
	I would like you to let me know how I can be sure who got called 
and who voted where because some people left in the middle of it.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> It is not a 
written rule but a question of convention and I think of respect for 
the responsibility of the House to be in your seat at the time the 
question is called and to remain in your seat. It is a question of 
respect and convention. It does not invalidate the results of the 
vote.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to comment on the 
point of order raised by my colleague from the Reform Party. I 
think the only way to respond to his question is to see tomorrow 
who voted. And if they think someone was absent, they can then 
raise it in the House. I imagine that the person who is absent will 
say he was, and we will see whether that changes the outcome.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Blaikie:</B> Madam Speaker, I think what we are seeing here 
today is the fruit of three years of sloppiness with respect to this 
rule. It used to be very hard and fast, even though not a rule but a 
convention, that people would have to be in the House and would 
not be able to leave until the results of the vote were read.
<P>
<B>(1140 )</B>
<P>
	I have noticed that in this Parliament, and maybe even toward 
the end of the last Parliament, this rule became more and more 
relaxed. People were coming in and going out. We cannot decide, 
all of a sudden, that today we are going to enforce the convention 
that, frankly, almost everyone has been ignoring for three years.
<P>
	If we want to restore that convention, I think it would be a good 
idea but we need to say collectively that we want to restore and 
respect that convention.
<P>
	In the same vein there is another convention, that there is a30 minute bell and the vote is taken after 30  minutes. If we want to 
start playing around with that convention, as we did today, through 
the collusion between the government and the official opposition, 
then we will have a real problem on our hands. I do not sit on 
committees, but for the sake of people who are on committees, who 
are hearing witnesses, they may proceed to hear a witness because 
they know they have 15 minutes, but when they get here they find 
the vote has already taken place. Do we want to introduce another 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8996"> 8996 </A></B>
<P>
dimension of unpredictability into what is already an unpredictable 
place? I think that would be a serious mistake.
<P>
	I ask you, Madam Speaker, to reflect on this but I also ask all 
members of the House to reflect on this. Once we start to play 
around with a convention it slips away and we have another layer of 
chaos on top of an already very chaotic place. I see what has 
happened today as being very regrettable.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> I thank the 
hon. member for his point of order. We will do some research on 
this convention and we will report back to the House on our 
findings.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Madam Speaker, if the House would give its consent 
to refer the matter you just described to the Standing Committee on 
Procedure and House Affairs for examination, that committee 
could report back to the House about the convention and make a 
recommendation.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> I am informed 
that the committee does have the power to do that if it so wishes.
<P>
	Is the House ready for the question?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Question.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> The question 
is on Motion No. 1. Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the 
motion?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> All those in 
favour will please say yea.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Yea.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> All those 
opposed will please say nay.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Nay.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> In my opinion 
the yeas have it.
<P>
	<I>And more than five members having risen:</I>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> The recorded 
division on the motion stands deferred. The recorded division shall 
also apply to Motions Nos. 8 to 11, 39, 42, 43 and 46.
<P>
	The next question is on Motion No. 48. Is it the pleasure of the 
House to adopt the motion?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> All those in 
favour will please say yea.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Yea.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> All those

<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Nay.

	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> The recorded 
division on Motion No. 48 stands deferred.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Madam Speaker, did you call for debate on that 
motion? It seems that you read the motion and you just said, ``all 
those in favour''. Did you call for debate?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> It was debated. 
It was part of Group No. 1. There was a motion put to stop the 
debate, and Motion No. 48 is part of that vote. All the questions on 
the motions in Group No. 1 have been put.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Catterall:</B> Madam Speaker, may I request clarification on 
Motion No. 48? You are correct that debate began after the motion 
was moved and after the House gave its consent to the moving of 
that motion as part of the first group. When you called the vote, I 
heard many nays. I did not hear one yea. Does that mean the motion 
was defeated?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> The division 
has been deferred until the end of the debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Arseneault:</B> Madam Speaker, has Motion No. 49 in Group 
No. 1 been voted on?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> Motion No. 48 
will be voted on separately and in consequence Motion No. 49 will 
be voted on according to the result of the vote on Motion No. 48. 
The vote on Motion No. 49 depends on the outcome of the vote on 
Motion No. 48.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Arseneault:</B> Madam Speaker, we completed the vote on 
Motion No. 48 already. It was defeated unanimously-

<HR>
<B><A NAME="8997"> 8997 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> It was

deferred. Motion No. 49 is deferred automatically.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Arseneault:</B> Madam Speaker, I do not want to delay things 
but I have the report stage order from the Table. It says that the 
question on Motion No. 49 is put if the question on Motion No. 48 
is negatived. Motion No. 48 was negatived but Motion No. 49 was 
not put.
<P>
	Before we move on to Group No. 2, I would ask that the question 
on Motion No. 49 be put.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> I repeat to the 
hon. parliamentary secretary that the vote on Motion No. 48 has 
been deferred.
<P>
	We will now move to Group No. 2.

	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, it 
is a pleasure to speak to Bill C-32 and to reflect a bit on my own 
experience as a broadcaster.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Conflict.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solberg:</B> I want to declare my background right off the bat 
so that people do not suggest I am in conflict, which I thought I 
heard from across the way.
<P>
	As someone who comes from a broadcasting background, it is 
important to point out that there are many aspects of Bill C-32 that 
do not reflect the reality of broadcasting across the country today. 
Indeed, in Bill C-32 we see all kinds of impediments to doing what 
I think the government is hoping to do through this legislation. The 
government seems to want to protect the rights of copyright holders 
and to ensure that ultimately Canadian culture is strengthened. 
Unfortunately some aspects of Bill C-32 actually prevent that from 
happening and I want to touch on some of them.
<P>
	One of the concerns I have as a broadcaster by trade, and I think I 
can speak with a little authority on this, is the whole aspect of time 
shifting. One of the concerns that broadcasters have raised over and 
over again is that the legislation does not permit broadcasters to 
delay the broadcast of a television or radio program and replay it at 
a later date without incurring additional expense and seeking the 
permission from the holders of the rights to do that.
<P>
	It makes it extremely difficult for a small radio station or small 
broadcast outlet to seek the permission of the various rights' 
holders to do that. It escapes me why when there has been such a 
strong lobby from people in the broadcast industry to make what is 
just a common sense change that the government has failed utterly 
to do that.
<P>
	I know some members on the other side are trying to make that 
happen and some amendments have been proposed. We are very 
happy that members on the other side are trying to do that. For nine 
years this legislation has been in the works. For nine years people 
have made the same point over and over again to successive 
governments. Apparently their pleas have fallen on deaf ears. It is a 
common sense change.
<P>
<B>(1155)</B>
<P>
	If that type of change is not made, it is going to hurt Canadian 
content. It is going to hurt the ability of broadcasters to broadcast 
local parades on the community cable channel. It is going to hurt 
the ability of broadcasters to do the sorts of things that have made 
them an integral part of the Canadian cultural scene. That is one of 
the major problems that many broadcasters have with this 
legislation.
<P>
	Something else that concerns me very much is the whole idea of 
transfer of format. A new reality in the broadcast industry-it has 
been a reality for a few years now-is that many broadcasters have 
to transfer a recording from, for instance, a CD on to the electronic 
format, to the computer.
<P>
	One of the things the government has resisted forever is allowing 
broadcasters the right to make that transfer without subjecting 
themselves to a legal challenge. In fact, broadcasters have raised 
that over and over again. It is quite possible that, by going ahead 
and transferring  something from CD on to computer, the rights' 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8998"> 8998 </A></B>
<P>
holders will then ask that they be paid for the privilege of having 
their music transferred on to a computer.
<P>
	The computer then plays it over the air. Under that circumstance, 
broadcasters will have to pay the right's holder already. Potentially 
radio and television broadcasters are being charged a couple of 
times for something that really has only the effect of being played 
once on the air. In other words, the holder of the rights suffers no 
commercial loss. However, it imposes a tremendous burden on the 
broadcasters.
<P>
	That is something that needs to be pointed out. Broadcasters 
have been very patient with the government on this point. They 
have raised it over and over ad nauseam. Somehow the government 
has failed to see the value in this approach. All the broadcasters are 
asking for is a common sense exemption.
<P>
	In order to make the point more fully, it is important to mention 
the role that broadcasters play in the Canadian cultural scene. For a 
number of years, broadcasters have had regulations imposed on 
them whereby they have to play 30 per cent Canadian content. 
They play thousands and thousands, really millions, of hours worth 
of music every year to promote Canadian artists and composers. 
Under previous legislation, the composers received all kinds of 
money back from the broadcasters through the current copyright 
legislation.
<P>
	The artists made millions of dollars by selling their records. 
There was a quid pro quo exchange between the broadcasters who 
were able to give the artists all kinds of what amounts to free 
promotion on the air and the radio stations were able to use the 
music to attract listeners and, ultimately, to sell advertising and 
make a profit.
<P>
	It was a system that worked extremely well. For reasons that 
escape me, the government has decided to change something that is 
not broken, to fix a problem that did not need fixing and has caused 
a firestorm of controversy.
<P>
	That has been reflected not only in opposition from parties like 
the Reform Party but even among Liberal ranks where a number of 
people have great concerns about what is being proposed. A 
number of members on the other side have propose amendments 
and have spoken out quite strongly against this legislation.
<P>
	That should not be lost on us because it takes considerable 
courage to do that in the Liberal Party, knowing that the 
government may slap sanctions on those members. Some of them 
will not be rewarded when it comes time for the Prime Minister to 
hand out some of the goodies that he is able to hand out. We should 
note that they have done this. It points to how serious they feel an 
assault it is on their community radio stations and ultimately on the 
cultural sector.
<P>
<B>(1200)</B>
<P>
	For a number of years radio stations in Canada have been in a 
perilous position. Many of them lose money today. Most AM radio 
stations are in a position where they simply cannot make ends 
meet. The government is somehow insensitive to this fact and is 
slapping all kinds of new regulations on broadcasters of various 
sizes. The ultimate result will be that they will be bearing new 
costs.
<P>
	We have made a point of saying over and over and over again 
that high taxes and regulation kill jobs in the Canadian economy. I 
do not think we want to kill the jobs created by Canadian radio 
stations that provide tremendous services to their local 
communities, reflect the values of their local communities, and 
completely bring together all disparate strands in the local 
community in one place so that people understand what is 
happening on a daily basis, in fact every minute of every day. This 
is something that happens through no other media form.
<P>
	We should be sensitive to this point and ensure that bills like Bill 
C-32 do not end up killing a very important institution like 
Canadian radio broadcasting.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Guy H. Arseneault (Parliamentary Secretary to Deputy 
Prime Minister and Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I would like to enter into the debate to clarify a 
few points.
<P>
	There was some concern in the Reform Party with regard to the 
ephemeral and transfer of format exceptions. That opinion was 
expressed in committee by a number of members. The government 
listened to the members, our caucus, the opposition and the 
witnesses, and they are in the bill. There is an ephemeral exception. 
There is a transfer of format exception. I take the member at his 
word. If they are in there he will support them and the process will 
be speedy. That is why they are there. That is part of the negotiation 
game.
<P>
	After the amendments came out of the committee in December 
there were concerns that perhaps telethons and Santa Claus parades 
were not protected. We felt they were already in the bill, but the 
government decided to clarify them even more. The amendments 
are there.
<P>
	With regard to whether they got the amendments late and did not 
get a chance to analyse them, to a certain extent that is fair game 
but in written form they only had them today.
<P>
	Last evening I had a chance to indicate to the hon. member that 
ephemeral and transfer of format exceptions, telethons or whatever 
were there and that I would be available to meet with him after to 
explain the amendments.
<P>
	We are parliamentarians. There should be respect and honour in 
this place. The bill is before the House. We were fair with the way 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8999"> 8999 </A></B>
<P>
in which we handled a situation the Reform Party asked about this 
morning. We  collaborated and we would like to see the same 
collaboration.
<P>
	For instance, putting up speakers for the sake of speaking is not a 
way of collaborating. The hon. member who just spoke is very 
knowledgeable of the subject. He also spoke when it was first 
introduced in the House. I appreciate some of the comments he 
made. It gave me a chance to reflect.
<P>
	However his comments would have been better placed in Group 
No. 7 which deals with ephemeral, transfer of format, telethons and 
radio stations rather than Group No. 2.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solberg:</B> I will speak then.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Arseneault:</B> You have already spoken. I have heard that 
message.
<P>
	We have clarified those aspects. There is ephemeral. There is 
transfer of format. I look forward to the support of the Reform 
Party on the bill rather than delay and delay and delay. The time has 
come to get on with it. There is other business of the House than 
Bill C-32 that we must get on with. This is a very important bill. 
The producers, the creators and the users have been waiting for the 
bill.
<P>
<B>(1205)</B>
<P>
	What damage are we doing to the relationship between the 
creators and the users if we continually say that this is here and that 
is there and it is not so? It is important to create a good working 
relationship. Both sides want this clarified now, right away.
<P>
	That is what we are doing. We have put forward the bill. We have 
our amendments and we are putting them forward today. Let us 
clarify it and get on with the work of the House so that the creators 
and the users can get on with their business as well.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to take part in the debate today on 
Bill C-32.
<P>
	The first time I spoke in the House, on January 24, 1994, I 
immediately announced where I stood. I said: ``Moving to the 
complex issue of copyright, I would like to point out that creators 
are currently out in the cold and that the government will have to 
act quickly by tabling as soon as possible a bill to correct this 
unfortunate situation''.
<P>
	I am delighted that the government has tabled this bill, that we 
are now at report stage and that very extensive amendments have 
been made. We know that we will have to keep up our efforts, 
because the bill is not completely finished, there will be a Phase III, 
but I am very pleased to see Phase II being wrapped up.
<P>
	I would urge the third party to give its co-operation so that we 
can proceed with debate on a non-partisan basis and move quickly 
to give creators in Canada a bill that will help them improve their 
living conditions.
<P>
	I think it extremely important that we leave partisan politics 
behind in this issue, and it is upsetting that the member for 
Medicine Hat spent 10 minutes telling us that he comes from a 
broadcasting background and forgot to mention that the bill 
requires a radio station to make over $1.25 million in advertising 
revenue before it is required to pay royalties. In other words, the 
station is required to pay only $100.
<P>
	He spoke for 10 minutes but did not mention this fundamental 
fact. It is an objective piece of information contained in the bill and 
I think the member for Medicine Hat acted in very bad faith by 
failing to mention it when he spoke in the House.
<P>
	The purpose of Bill C-32 is to amend the Copyright Act, which 
was passed in 1924. The first review of this act, in 1988, solved 
certain problems, notably by increasing creators' moral rights over 
their works and recognizing the organization of copyright holders 
into collective societies. The mandate of these societies is to 
authorize, on behalf of their members, public performances and 
reproductions, and to collect and distribute royalties or levies 
payable in exchange for these authorizations.
<P>
	Society has evolved considerably since then, and there have been 
artistic, technological and legal developments in the cultural 
industry. Internationally, intellectual property has become a 
resource just as important as money or natural resources. New 
techniques have led to an explosion in artistic distribution and it is 
our responsibility as legislators to ensure that creators are protected 
by law.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois has resolutely supported creators in all 
sectors of the cultural industry. Our efforts seem to have been 
successful because a number of amendments proposed by the Bloc 
Quebecois have been adopted by the heritage committee in one 
form or another, and we are pleased that we have kept a watchful 
eye on this bill so that there is finally something to show for 
creators in Canada.
<P>
	The bill's amendments to the Copyright Act deal primarily with 
recognition of performers' and producers' neighbouring rights, the 
establishment of royalties for private copies and the definition of 
exceptions to creators' rights.
<P>
<B>(1210)</B>
<P>
	I mentioned earlier that when radio stations broadcast music or 
songs, authors and composers receive copyright fees, while 
performers, musicians and producers do not. Bill C-32 provides a 
remedy in this respect. Now, musicians, performers and producers 
will also benefit from neighbouring rights.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9000"> 9000 </A></B>
<P>
	These rights are recognized in the 50 countries that signed the 
Rome Convention. Once Parliament has passed this bill, Canada 
will be able to sign the convention, and our performers will also 
be able to benefit from this protection when their work is 
distributed abroad, and collect royalties as well.
<P>
	According to a report prepared for the Department of Canadian 
Heritage, neighbouring rights are an important tool for the future, 
especially with the advent of digital cable radio which will 
broadcast good music, uninterrupted by radio hosts or 
commercials. This type of broadcast will be a major source of 
income for artist-performers and record producers if the 
neighbouring rights system is introduced. That is why it is so 
important to proceed diligently with this bill.
<P>
	Most payments for neighbouring rights will indeed be made by 
radio stations. As I said before, the bill provides that their income 
must be in excess of $1.25 million before they have to pay 
royalties. Otherwise, the fee will be only symbolic, as it will be 
$100.
<P>
	Another interesting point is that the bill provides for a legislative 
review of the act in five years, which will be an opportunity to 
make some adjustments based on our experience with this 
legislation. We believe, unlike the hon. member for Medicine Hat, 
that the concessions made to broadcasters are a little too generous 
and should perhaps be reviewed downward.
<P>
	However, it is rather unfortunate that the government did not 
recognize this right in the case of creators in the audiovisual sector. 
I hope that in phase III, which will come as soon as possible, the 
emphasis will be mainly on the audiovisual sector and 
photography.
<P>
	As for private copies, every year, millions of audio and video 
cassettes are sold in this country. Many customers use these 
cassettes to copy the works of creators without paying copyright, 
thus depriving them of their living.
<P>
	For instance, out of 44 million blank audio cassettes sold in this 
country last year, it is estimated that 39 million were used to make 
private copies of sound recordings of composers or performers. 
These copies made at home apparently cost the audio recording 
industry as much as $324.7 million per year.
<P>
	Fortunately, the bill provides some compensation by providing 
for a levy that will be collected from manufacturers or importers of 
blank audio tapes, and subsequently distributed among authors, 
composers, performers and record companies.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois supports this kind of measure which already 
exists in 25 countries, and it has insisted that the amount of the levy 
be set by the Copyright Board, which is in a position to determine 
what is fair compensation for the creator, while allowing for the 
consumer's ability to pay. We appreciate the fact that the Copyright 
Board has been closely involved in the preparations for this bill and 
the follow-up, because so  far, the board has shown that it is capable 
of doing an outstanding job.
<P>
	However, we regret the fact that these rights do not apply as well 
to video tapes, which leaves creators in the audiovisual sector in 
limbo.
<P>
	The bill provides that libraries, educational institutions, 
museums and archival services will, to a certain extent, be 
exempted from paying copyright.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois believes that these exemptions which 
deprive the persons concerned of their due will be difficult to 
administer and may lead to court cases. Although the exempt 
institutions are concerned with education and culture, we believe 
that the support they need should come from government, and that 
authors who already pay taxes should not have to subsidize them by 
forgoing income.
<P>
<B>(1215)</B>
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois would have preferred to see the legislator 
leave the question of copyright to the various parties involved. The 
agreements currently in place between collective societies and 
users prove that this type of mechanism does work.
<P>
	Nevertheless, the heritage committee is to be congratulated for 
having made great strides in tightening up the numerous exceptions 
in the original version of the bill.
<P>
	Finally, we must point out the heritage committee's efforts to 
bring the bill more in line with the concerns of the interested 
parties. The Bloc Quebecois has presented some 75 amendments, a 
number of which were accepted by the government, which has 
finally lent an ear to the artists' legitimate demands. Let us hope 
that, in future, the government will accept the beneficial influence 
of the Bloc Quebecois in other areas.
<P>
	The government must continue to modernize its legislation, and 
must begin right away to identify the modifications required for 
Canada to recognize neighbouring rights on videotapes, and the 
mechanisms required to protect the rights of our artists as the 
information highway expands.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak to this bill and these clauses today.
<P>
	This bill has created a lot of problems for many of my 
constituents, across the whole range of the clauses dealt with in the 
bill. In particular, I received yesterday a letter from a company in 
my riding. That company, for the last 75 years, has been supplying 
bookstores. As a result of the changes which are being made by this 
bill, which they see as a major distortion of the marketplace under 
the excuse of protecting Canadian culture, the book market will be 
disrupted and it will be very bad for consumers.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9001"> 9001 </A></B>
<P>
	This company and my constituents have urged me to bring to 
the attention of the House the fact that this bill will be a major 
disadvantage to consumers. It will protect Canadian distributors 
of books when libraries and universities could have much better 
direct access to wholesalers in the United States. The 
protectionism in the bill will not protect Canadian culture at all, 
it will simply drive up prices and create a very restrictive market 
within Canada.
<P>
	I wanted to get that on record. Not only in the many areas that 
have been discussed earlier but in the area of book distribution this 
bill is a major problem.
<P>
	Amendments were introduced today at a moment's notice to the 
House. We have not had the time to review them properly. We are 
appalled at the speed at which this bill is moving through the 
House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
would like to speak specifically to the issue of copyright 
performances, sound recordings and communication signals that 
are part of this clustering of motions we have.
<P>
	Before I do that, however, I would say to the parliamentary 
secretary that there is within the parliamentary system the ability 
for members of Parliament to be able to converse with each other 
and to reveal what is coming so there is some prior notice. I respect 
that.
<P>
	However, on the other side of the coin I would point to an 
obscure example but a very accurate one, that the Liberals would 
say they said they are in favour of an elected Senate and this is what 
they did with the Constitution and the Charlottetown accord. That 
measure fell far short of what we are asking for. To have said it is 
accurate, that the measure was there, but in fact it in no way 
reflected what we consider to be important.
<P>
	While I respect and accept the hon. member's comment that 
there have been provisions put in place in response to some of the 
concerns that were expressed by me on behalf of our party and on 
behalf of users, on the other side of the coin the fact that I have not 
to this point had the opportunity to see what those things are and to 
pass judgment on what those things are is exactly the problem we 
are having at this time.
<P>
<B>(1220 )</B>
<P>
	I accept that he would have said these things to me in good faith, 
that he would have said they have answered our concern. However, 
by the time this bill becomes an act, by the time it is law, there will 
be an interpretation either by the copyright board or by the courts.
<P>
	On behalf of my party and people who have expressed their 
concerns to me, I want the opportunity to have even a couple of 
hours to understand the legal implications of the words the 
government is now coming forward with. It is for this reason that I 
have been as upset as I have this  morning that at the very last 
minute the government has been trying to put patchwork on to this 
seriously flawed bill.
<P>
	With respect to the motions before the House now, there are any 
number of issues we can speak about in terms of so-called 
neighbouring rights. For example, the end of clause 1 speaks of the 
Rome convention country. We do not share airwaves with people in 
Europe, nor do we share them with people in Australia and other 
signatories to the Rome convention.
<P>
	My understanding is that drawing the performers in line with the 
Rome convention is very commendable. However, our radio 
stations are sharing airwaves with the people who border the 49th 
parallel. Until the U.S. decides, if it does decide, to go ahead with 
neighbouring rights, our broadcasters, in particular in the 
Windsor-Sarnia area, even in the Toronto area with the Buffalo and 
Rochester signals, in Montreal with the signals coming in from 
Vermont, will be at a serious disadvantage by comparison with 
their U.S. competitors. Many of their U.S. competitors are going 
after exactly the same advertising dollar.
<P>
	In her presentation to committee the minister challenged me on 
behalf of my party. She said ``you say your party believes in 
property rights, that you would see the enshrinement of property 
rights''. A performance right is somewhat parallel to a property 
right. She was right.
<P>
	This issue is a case of weighing out the advantage and the 
disadvantage. It is a case of weighing out who will be benefited or 
who will be hurt. We are taking a look at the value the performers 
actually receive from airplay. I grant there is a good argument but 
not an exceptionally strong argument. If I were to balance it out I 
would say it is probably 60 per cent in favour of the notion that 
performers who actually perform their works which are being 
broadcast should receive some direct recompense from the revenue 
driven by radio. In my humble judgment there is a 60:40 argument 
in favour of the artist.
<P>
	Then I look at the entire picture of the value they receive of the 
airplay, which is the 40 per cent. People will go to the record store 
to buy the CDs or cassettes. There is a live performance factor that 
has been put into this by members of the Canadian Association of 
Broadcasters and there is a value that the performers receive. I see 
that we have close to a balance.
<P>
	Then I look at the economic damage that will be done to the 
radio stations. I look at the fact that they are already paying over3 per cent in copyright. We do not know what percentage they will 
be open to. Will it be 1 per cent, 2 per cent or 3 per cent? I do not 
know what the percentage is going to be for these neighbouring 
rights.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9002"> 9002 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1225)</B>
<P>
	I looked at the people who are employed in the broadcast 
industry and the fact that there are many technologies including 
satellite where we can beam things up and down and have them 
broadcast at the local level. There are many labour saving devices 
such as being able to electronically file music that would normally 
be handled physically from CDs.
<P>
	I looked at all the things that are happening electronically and if I 
were going to be investing in a broadcast facility I would be 
looking at the total picture. Where am I going to get this extra 1 per 
cent or 2 per cent that is going to be charged to me on my airplay 
for the performers? I would probably be driven to the conclusion in 
my decision making process, managing intelligently and well, that 
I would be better off to get some kind of electronic labour saving 
device that would probably remove some of the technical staff, 
some of the on air people.
<P>
	In other words, this has the ability on one side of the coin to give 
a financial reward to performers but at what cost to the bottom line 
of the radio stations and particularly at what cost to the people who 
are working in those radio stations? I see this as being a well 
intentioned move, warm and fuzzy, but I see it as ultimately being 
very dangerous and very possibly a job killer.
<P>
	I would invite all members to take a serious look at this and to 
follow the motions that have been put forward by the Reform Party 
and vote to repeal the neighbouring rights section of Bill C-32.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
it is my pleasure to rise in the House today to debate Bill C-32. 
Before I get into my presentation I think it is proper to mention 
once again that the procedure we are going through today is really 
an affront to people who like to do a good job of analyzing 
legislation, who like to go into detail and make detailed 
amendments. There are obviously several things wrong.
<P>
	First, the bill is so hopelessly flawed that the Minister of 
Industry and the minister of neighbouring rights spend time in the 
papers decrying one another's position. There is not even 
unanimity in the cabinet on this bill. This bill is not the answer for 
the broadcasting industry in Canada.
<P>
	Today we have had phone calls in Reform Party offices from 
both sides. The Canadian Association of Broadcasters has 
problems with neighbouring rights and with some of the provisions 
of the bill as originally tabled. SOCAN, the society of Canadian 
artists, also has concerns in favour of neighbouring rights. Between 
the two we find they are both against it for exactly the opposite 
reasons. One group is against it because it says it gives to much 
power or too much economic deterrent to playing Canadian 
content. Canadian artists are saying  that this does not give enough 
power and coinage in the pockets of artists.
<P>
	What do we take from this? I think we take from this that the 
government has botched this bill from the beginning to the end. 
The government does not have support in the broadcasting 
industry. It does not have support among artists. Who then is the 
government doing it for? What is the purpose of this bill?
<P>
<B>(1230 )</B>
<P>
	Every time the Canadian heritage minister muses in the press 
about what she would like to see the broadcasting industry look 
like, the alarm bells go off from one end of the country to the other, 
for different reasons. When she muses, as she did a couple of week 
ago, that perhaps we should double the amount of Canadian content 
on the radio, what happens then?
<P>
	I can tell members what happens. The broadcasters in my area 
tell me that there is a limited amount of Canadian content. What we 
have is pretty good stuff and people enjoy it. But if broadcasters are 
asked to play twice as much, they are going to take the songs which 
are already heavily played and play them every other time.
<P>
	If we hear Celine Dion-and I like Celine Dion, I have her tapes 
and her CDs-her songs would have to be played every second 
time because there is not enough Canadian content to double the 
amount without causing chaos in the industry.
<P>
	When you live in an area like I do, or like most Canadians do, 
within broadcasting distance of the United States, the government 
can only jack around the listener so much until the listener says: 
``You know, I do not have to listen to this. I have choices. I can 
crank my dial''.
<P>
	Advertising dollars are now going down to Bellingham because 
people are saying: ``I just cannot put up with this any more. I do not 
have any say about what kind of stuff is going on the radio. There is 
so much government regulation and bureaucracy that I am not sure 
of the quality of the product. The regulations, the hoop-jumping is 
so onerous, what is the point?'' Therefore, advertisers are not 
putting their money into Canadian markets, they are putting into 
neighbouring markets, taking it south of the border and it is being 
beamed back into Canada.
<P>
	Our advertising dollars are flowing south when they should, in 
my case, be staying in Chilliwack and Abbotsford and recirculated 
there. A lot of the advertisers and broadcasters are losing heart.
<P>
	When the minister starts musing in the press about doubling the 
amount of Canadian content it sends a shiver up everybody's spine. 
They wonder what on earth she is talking about. There is not 
enough content to do that.
<P>
	Another musing by the minister is when she talks about 
Canadian content. The rules are so screwy that with stars like 
Celine Dion and Bryan Adams, their music  cannot be played 
because it is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9003"> 9003 </A></B>
<P>
not Canadian enough. They are Canadians. They qualify as 
Canadians and I do not think anybody is going to deny that. 
However, they are not Canadian enough under the rules.
<P>
	What happens? Bryan Adams, whose producer may not be 
Canadian, does not get the Canadian content benefit because he has 
too many banjo players or whatever who are not Canadians. He 
cannot meet the rules. That person is cut off and does not qualify as 
a Canadian artist. Again, that is a shame because a lot of Canadians 
identify Bryan Adams as a Canadian rock star and think they 
should be able to listen to him and call him a Canadian artist, as I 
do.
<P>
	Furthermore, when the minister went so far as to say that if it 
was not for the kinds of rules we are debating today, Celine Dion 
would be picking berries in some backwoods somewhere, never 
having achieved stardom, well, I do not know. Every time I see 
Celine Dion or listen to her music, I think this superstar blows the 
socks off most of the world with some of the best selling CDs, 
records and tapes of all time. To think that the minister said there 
was no way she could have made it if we had not had these content 
rules or this kind of regulation is farcical. It is just not true. No one 
can possibly believe that Celine Dion would be anything but a 
superstar regardless. That is my second point.
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	The first point concerned her musing about doubling the amount 
of Canadian content that must be played. That is just not possible. I 
do not know what she is doing. It scares the pants off a lot of 
broadcasters in Canada and it is something I wish she would refrain 
from doing because of the sight that would be.
<P>
	Furthermore, as I mentioned earlier, there is an inconsistency 
between what she is demanding and what the industry minister is 
demanding. The industry minister wants to strengthen the industry 
without getting into the malarkey that has been proposed in this bill 
and others. It is one thing to strengthen the industry but it is another 
to just throw rules in its way so they can neither do business or 
industry or broadcasting well.
<P>
	The third thing I would like to mention is a concern of the 
broadcasters with regard to transferring music from CDs to digital 
computers. I have been through the Fraser Valley Broadcasting 
Group facilities a couple of times. It has had a complete 
technological revolution in the last three years. There has been a 
complete upheaval in the industry. It is an upheaval that involves 
the computer and digital recording. It also involves the opening up 
of a competitiveness between the players and the industry that are 
trying to play by the rules that this minister seems to dream up on 
her way to the coffee shop in the morning.
<P>
	The industry needs stability. It needs to know that when it wants 
to transfer this stuff from CD to digital it  can. It wants to know that 
it is not going to contravene some rules. It does not want to sort of 
get away with it when technically it is at fault. That is the problem 
with this bill. There are so many amendments, so many mistakes 
and it is so poorly drafted that everyone, from broadcasters to 
artists to consumers to legislators, are concerned enough that they 
are saying this bill should be stopped until it is cleaned up and the 
direction of it clearly given and that has not been done.
<P>
	The minister should withdraw this bill until she has assured all 
the players that something proper is going to be done.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Duncan (North Island-Powell River, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, this bill as it is currently constituted is of great 
concern to broadcasters. It is of great concern in respect to 
neighbouring rights.
<P>
	There is a reduction in the neighbouring rights phase-in period. 
It removes the criteria that would require that the value of air play 
and volume of music use be factored into neighbouring future 
rights tariffs.
<P>
	There is a rebalancing in light of the ephemeral exception. 
Particularly the radio end of it sees it as being too narrow a 
proposal. Many of us in this arena certainly use radio to a fair 
degree. I know it is probably the major media, other than the print 
media, in many of our experiences.
<P>
	Many small radio stations in the country perform a very valuable 
service. Indeed, those radio stations need to transfer their medium 
on occasion. Many of them are using 30-year old technology. As a 
consequence, they are trapped into making these ephemeral 
changes. It is a major upgrade to get away from that. It is certainly 
not doing anyone any harm that they continue with this.
<P>
<B>(1240 )</B>
<P>
	I have a letter from the Canadian Association of Broadcasters 
that is worthwhile for me to operate from in this area.
<P>
	Certainly these private radio broadcasters and some of the 
private television broadcasters wish to counter any suggestion that 
the proposed amendment meets broadcasters requirements as they 
have articulated them. This material has been conveyed to the 
government and there is still great concern about the present 
wording of the clause.
<P>
	It was not very long ago when I was spending some time in my 
vehicle and heard an interview on CBC radio. Many Canadians 
enjoy CBC radio. I am one of them. The value of CBC radio to 
Canadian broadcasters in the development of Canadian recording 
artists and so on became readily apparent in the anecdotal evidence 
that was being presented by artists, by people doing the recordings, 
by promoters and by others.
<P>
	Sometimes we lose sight of what is the key issue in levelling the 
playing field or developing Canadian artists.  One of the other 
examples that the Canadian Association of Broadcasters talk about 
has to do with episodes of local talent or variety shows. These are 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9004"> 9004 </A></B>
<P>
taped in clusters for broadcast throughout the season to make them 
economically viable.
<P>
	This bill, as it currently reads, requires that these tapes be 
destroyed 30 days after taping rather than as it is in competing 
countries like the U.S. and the U.K. where time starts running after 
the first broadcast. This seems like a very legitimate concern.
<P>
	Then the association gives some other specific examples. Very 
often, rather than talking in broad terms if we can actually look to 
examples, we can see the flaws in what is being proposed in 
legislative and other initiatives much better.
<P>
	This letter talks about CKCO's Kitchener Octoberfest parade. 
This is recorded by a station and tape delayed for time zone 
purposes by corporate sister companies in the west, part of the 
Baton Broadcasting in this case. The exception only applies to 
stations in formal networks of which there are very few in Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Arseneault:</B> We have changed that. We clarified it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> Thank you. Programs and program segments 
recorded without a public audience such as spots to promote 
Canadian musicians on CTV's ``Canada AM'' and so on state in 
this letter that because the exception tries to restrict itself to event 
programming and does so by requiring a public performance at the 
same time as a reproduction is made, this also constitutes lack of 
qualification for this kind of programming.
<P>
	The broadcasters talk about some other absurdities, as they call 
them, in the bill. They are highlighted by a requirement that copies 
of these ephemeral reproductions can only be kept beyond 30 days 
if an official archive accepts their deposits on the basis of their 
exceptional documentary character.
<P>
<B>(1245 )</B>
<P>
	Broadcasters really should be allowed to keep their own archival 
copies in house. I think this would be a great loss to Canadian 
society if we were to create this kind of concern. They would like to 
reuse them possibly in the future and they would be quite happy to 
pay a licence fee at that time. This would also of course create quite 
a burden for national archives should this kind of provision remain.
<P>
	The bottom line of what the Canadian Association of 
Broadcasters is saying is that unless these flaws are corrected, 
programming would remain at risk because of the administrative 
burdens and the economic burdens through trying to clear this 
hurdle on rights clearance.
<P>
	This would affect Canadian viewers who want to have a good 
look at programs about their local area. It would affect charities 
relying on broadcast based fund raising. It  would have its impact 
on Canadian talent and there are other provisions that would be 
detrimental to French language music and programming. These 
would be the main people who would suffer the neighbouring rights 
provisions.
<P>
	I find this whole episode this morning of most concern. I know 
this bill and these amendments are of great concern to many 
Canadians. Sometimes what goes on in this place ends up in the 
form of partisan gamesmanship or something quite 
non-productive. It is my hope and my wish that we can move 
forward, make the enlightened amendments that are required in 
order to make this a bill that Canadians will find progressive, 
productive and that will indeed assist Canadian broadcasting, 
Canadian artists, Canadian recorders and so on.

comments made by certain members of the Reform Party, which I 
found to be in extremely bad faith, especially with respect to the 
danger radio stations will face with the introduction of 
neighbouring rights.
<P>
	The aim of neighbouring rights is to afford performing artists 
and production houses the protection enjoyed by the citizens of the 
countries that signed the Rome Convention and to ensure that 
performing artists and producers receive fair and equitable 
royalties when they work, whether they are interpreting the works 
of creators or authors or producing their own works.
<P>
	This has long been awaited and requested by artists. They were 
totally forgotten in Quebec and Canada when 50 countries signed 
the Rome Convention, which provides artists with a salary. I do not 
need to remind this House, and particularly my Reform colleagues, 
that the average annual salary of artists is between $7,000 and 
$13,000 per year.
<P>
	Our objective was to ensure that the introduction of 
neighbouring rights did not penalize certain stations with lower 
revenues or facing difficult financial situations. We in the official 
opposition would have preferred the government leave the matter 
with the Copyright Board. The government preferred to set a floor 
or a ceiling in order to exempt a number of radio stations.
<P>
	Our Reform colleagues make no mention of this important 
element of the bill, which provides that radio stations with $1.25 
million or less in advertising revenues will pay only $100 a year in 
neighbouring rights. When I hear our Reform colleagues talking 
about the risk of stations closing and of jobs being lost, I think that 
is bad faith.
<P>
	Neighbouring rights, I remind you, are those paid to performers 
and producers. They have been ignored for decades, although they 
are recognized by over 50 countries. We must at least understand 
that there is a whole category of artists called performers, who 
work and are not getting paid. They get no return on their work, 
because it is played on the radio or elsewhere.
<P>
	These people are entitled to a fair income for their work, like 
everyone in society who works and is paid a fair wage. I have a 
hard time understanding the Reform Party's objection to people 
living or trying to live off their work as artists. The Reformers are 
defending the radio stations at all cost, crying wolf, saying that 
neighbouring rights will force stations everywhere to close, 
causing a loss of jobs.
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	This is crying wolf, because, after evaluation-and my own and 
others' discussions with representatives of radio  stations-this 
significant $1,250,000 exemption means that the bulk of stations 
will simply be charged $100 annually, which does not jeopardize 
them in any way. Let us be clear on this: it does not jeopardize them 
in any way, contrary to what the Reform Party claims.
<P>
	I would like to focus particularly on the Bloc's amendment in 
Group No. 3 of motions, reminding the government that it is 
merely intended to ensure that photographers are recognized as the 
author, on the same footing as other creative artists are by the bill.
<P>
	I would like to point out this extremely important aspect, 
because the photographers themselves have been trying to gain 
recognition as artists for decades.
<P>
	I invite the government to support my amendment on this. There 
is even a museum of photography here in the national capital. We 
know how the magazines use professional photographers for 
exhibitions. We know how some photographers have earned 
international acclaim as artists on the basis of their works. How can 
it be that the government has not yet lent an ear to the 
photographers, and included them in the bill and recognized them 
as artists?
<P>
	In order to ensure proper attention to this, the Bloc motion 
provides that, when a person has a series of photographs taken of 
the family, the children, etc, it is clearly stated that the person who 
pays the photographer has ownership of the photos and therefore 
owns the work, and not the photographer.
<P>
	In all cases, however, where photographers take pictures with a 
view to displaying them as works of art, it strikes me as completely 
logical in 1997, after decades of efforts to gain recognition, that 
photographic artists finally be recognized in the bill.
<P>
	We moved this amendment because the bill lacked any clause 
recognizing photographers as artists and creators, and I hope the 
government will support our amendment and give recognition to 
photographers.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, when 
this bill came forward, a tremendous number of people were 
concerned about it, including the photographers. One of their 
concerns was the lack of protection for their works. As I look at 
Motion No. 4 put forward by the Bloc member for 
Richmond-Wolfe, it seems that the Bloc Quebecois is infringing 
on ordinary contractual agreements that can be made between 
people.
<P>
	The Bloc is really asking in this bill that there be a virtual 
interference with the ability of people to come to their own 
conclusions, arrive at their own agreements and work forward from 
that point. The member has brought forward a very restrictive 
motion. For example, Motion No. 4: ``A person who for private and 
domestic purposes commissions the taking of a photograph or the 
making of a film has, where copyright subsists in the  resulting 
work, the right not to have copies of the work issued to the public'', 
and I do not understand the Bloc's thought process here, ``the work 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9006"> 9006 </A></B>
<P>
exhibited or shown in public, or the work broadcast or included in a 
cable program service''.
<P>
<B>(1300 )</B>
<P>
	The reason I am saying I do not understand the Bloc's thought 
process is that realistically there should be an agreement between 
two consenting parties. When I look at the inclusion of the clause 
by the government I find myself far more in agreement with the 
position of the government. The reason is simply that it speaks 
about the exchange of value for consideration. The consideration 
was paid pursuant to the order and in the absence of any agreement 
to the contrary the person for whom the plate or other original was 
ordered shall be the first owner of copyright.
<P>
	It sets up a pecking order that would work well to resolve 
situations between contracting parties as opposed to the Bloc 
amendment which sets up restrictions that people would actually 
have to negotiate away.
<P>
	This is a concern. Photographers made presentations to us in 
committee, to me personally and to, I am sure, many other 
members. They pointed out that in a lot of instances when they lose 
control of the negative their work has the potential of being 
compromised.
<P>
	I think of a situation in my constituency where a chap has had a 
photograph reproduced many times in many magazines. As a 
matter of fact it was actually made significantly larger and 
reproduced in poster format. It was the picture of a helicopter 
soaring above the clouds in the mountains taken from the 
mountainside. It is very dramatic. Imagine his chagrin that he has 
no way to recapture it.
<P>
	We have been critical and continue to be very critical of the way 
in which the government has handled Bill C-32. Many portions of 
the act have created imbalances in both directions. It is being held 
together with chewing gum and baling wire. Nonetheless this is a 
clause included by the government that I would see the Reform 
Party being able to support fully.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I rise to speak to Motion No. 4 in the name of the member for 
Richmond-Wolfe which reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-32, in clause 10, be amended by replacing lines 33 to 4 on page 14 
with the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It goes on to describe different items. I would like to explain 
what I think is right about the several proposals of the member for 
Richmond-Wolfe. Also another serious flaw which the member 
for Kootenay East did not raise but may or may not agree with me 
on is a pretty obvious one.
<P>
	This amendment would replace a part of Bill C-32 which, for the 
most part, seems well crafted. It mentions  an exchange or a 
contractual agreement between two parties, which is a property 
right. It talks about the necessity of the arrangement and how one 
person can obviously enter into a contract on a photograph. It 
includes photographs as a piece of property and is a good 
amendment.
<P>
	It has the support of most people. Professional photographers or 
someone who commissions a photograph should have some 
proprietary rights to it. It should not be used willy-nilly without 
their say. If there is not some kind of control professional 
photographers, except for the initial photograph, would have no 
protection from leeches who could steal their work, publish it in 
papers, copy it and make their pound of flesh from the artistic 
ability of the photographers in question.
<P>
<B>(1305 )</B>
<P>
	The problem with the amendment is that it is written in the 
negative. They would have the right not to have. That is a poor way 
to describe a right someone has. The amendment is crafted 
backward. It should be crafted in the affirmative. It should talk 
about what the person has the right to do, not about what the person 
does not have the right to do. It is a poor way to describe that right 
of photographers.
<P>
	To get into the body of the proposed amendment, where 
copyright subsists in the resulting work I am not sure if that is the 
same as what exists. I guess it means it can be or it could be 
copyrightable. I am not sure if that is wise. Copyright rules are 
designed so that one has to copyright something before one gets the 
rights to it.
<P>
	Be that as it may, as we get into the body of the amendment we 
see that part A talks about copies of the work being issued to the 
public. The intent there is proper. It would protect someone from 
having a photograph in a gallery beside the Chateau or anywhere 
else in Canada retaken, recopied, sold as a work of art and profiting 
from it. I assume issued to the public would include things like 
issued for sale and not just for presentation or whatever they are 
doing to receive a benefit. There should be a contractual 
agreement. Part A is relatively easy to agree with.
<P>
	Part B is the work exhibited or shown in public. This is a 
worthwhile amendment in that it protects people who may not want 
their works broadly distributed. It protects those who may want a 
limited audience for their photographs. It may have been very 
private or personal. It may be one of a kind. All photographs are but 
it may be something for their pleasure only.
<P>
	Under that amendment they would think their work would not be 
shown without their permission. I think of everything from very 
personal photographs of babies or loved ones or some horrific 
pictures of car accidents they do not want rebroadcast for public 
gain, for propaganda purposes or for a dollar value. It is something 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9007"> 9007 </A></B>
<P>
they do not  want rebroadcast. It should be their right to step in and 
say they do not want that to happen.
<P>
	Part C refers to the work broadcast being included in the cable 
program service. One concern about the Copyright Act that I have 
heard expressed by local cable companies is the infringement of 
their rights. I am thinking of a local cable service in my riding that 
does a good job of broadcasting public events. It is almost a public 
service. It works almost exclusively with volunteers. It 
rebroadcasts events of all kinds including parades, other public 
events and showings and local fairs. It takes its cameras to 4-H 
Club presentations. It is a real public service.
<P>
	In towns such as mine with about 60,000 to 70,000 people the 
cable service becomes a community service. It is not a money 
maker per se. We count on the cable service broadcasting council 
meetings, for example, and all the other items I mentioned.
<P>
<B>(1310 )</B>
<P>
	When such a work is included in a cable program service 
sometimes it is inadvertent. The broadcast of a 4-H demonstration 
or whatever could include original works of art or original 
photographs that are contest prizes. They could rebroadcast on the 
cable system, as paragraph (c) mentions, which could almost 
inadvertently infringe on somebody's rights.
<P>
	In my riding these shows are often rebroadcast four or five times 
during the week to ensure they hit all the target audience. The 
concern expressed to me was about what would happen if the Santa 
Claus parade were rebroadcast and something copyrightable was 
infringed on.
<P>
	There are no provisions. It is just thrown out that if the cable 
program services do it they are in trouble. If they repeat it four or 
five times they are really in trouble. They say that is unacceptable. 
They say they need the freedom as a community service to 
broadcast public events, public showings and so on. They feel that 
if people do not want their photograph or their product rebroadcast 
they cannot be expected to know that. They cannot stop the 
cameras, go up to someone and ask if it is all right to move past a 
painting or display. They cannot function in this way in a public 
event such as a fair, a Santa Claus parade or whatever. It is not 
possible.
<P>
	They are concerned the Copyright Act does not give them the 
freedom they need to do their job as a community service. I have to 
agree with them.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Duncan (North Island-Powell River, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, the proposed amendment by the Bloc is a bit 
complicated. It amends a current amendment to the bill which 
amends subsection 13(2) of the act.
<P>
	I have read the amendment several times. I have consulted with 
other people. I do not know if it is anything but what can be 
described as nebulous. The  amendment is amending an 
amendment which is nebulous, to begin with.
<P>
	I will try to explain what I mean. We are talking about 
engravings, photographs, portraits, plates and originals. The 
wording of the unamended amendment indicates that in the 
absence of any agreement to the contrary the person by whom the 
plate or original was ordered shall be the first owner of the 
copyright.
<P>
	The question comes down to the ``by whom''. Is it the artist or 
the person ordering from the artist? Legal counsel would only be 
able to say that is unclear. It could be interpreted either way.
<P>
	As a consequence we cannot build a concrete foundation on a 
sand foundation. It will not work. It is not that I wanted to compare 
the Bloc amendment to concrete necessarily, but I had a duty to 
point that out.
<P>
<B>(1315 )</B>
<P>
	I assume that the intent of the Bloc's amendment is to empower 
the artist. However, we may already be empowering the artist with 
the original amendment. If it is an attempt to overturn that 
amendment, that is one thing. If it is an attempt to strengthen it, 
that is another thing. I am not at all clear in which direction we are 
going.
<P>
	In any case, there is a flaw. It is an important flaw. We want to 
attempt to achieve clarity in our legislation. We have all been in 
circumstances in which we have seen draft legislation come 
forward, and the constructive readings of that draft legislation can 
come from the most unpredictable sources.
<P>
	In one of the committees on which I sit a government bill was 
introduced that turned out to be so badly drafted when it got to 
committee that it was withdrawn and has yet to come back to 
committee. That was several months ago.
<P>
	There are lots of precedents. We all know this can happen. It is 
important for us to look once again at this clause.

<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-32, in Clause 28, be amended by replacing lines 22 to 26 on page 62 
with the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``where they were made, of any used books.''</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Mr. Guy H. Arseneault (Parliamentary Secretary to Deputy 
Prime Minister and Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I would like to be on the record on these motions. 
There are in this grouping three motions, Motions Nos. 6, 44 and 
60.
<P>
	Motion No. 60 is a government motion. Motions Nos. 6 and 60 
are both technical amendments. Motion No. 6, is a consequential 
amendment. It makes a correction to a subsection added to the bill 
by the committee.
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	Motion No. 44 by the member for Kootenay East in the name of 
the member for Edmonton-Strathcona is about used books. It 
claims that used books could not be  imported and things of that 
nature. I would like to correct that perception.
<P>
	The bill does not prohibit the importation of used textbooks. 
Rather, it provides a safeguard should the importation of certain 
used textbooks become a problem. The amendment made by the 
standing committee ensures that Canada can continue to maintain 
control over its own marketplace. It is a very solid safeguard and 
the concerns of members should be looked after with regard to that 
amendment.
<P>
	Motion No. 60 in the name of the government is a consequential 
amendment, one that all parties will probably accept as well as the 
other one. It ensures that an amendment made by the committee 
will not be retroactive to June 30, 1996. I know many members 
have spoken against retroactivity in the past including members of 
the Reform Party, Bloc Quebecois and the independent members 
present. I suggest to them again that it would be wise to support this 
amendment.
<P>
	With regard to Motion No. 44, the government will be indicating 
its decision but personally it is a no vote. We are not in favour of 
Motion No. 44 because the bill itself guarantees protection and 
there is a safeguard in there to make sure that our marketplace is 
not distorted when it comes to used books.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise today to speak to Bill C-32, 
specifically to Group No. 4 amendments.
<P>
	At the outset I wish I could share the confidence of the hon. 
parliamentary secretary that the clause I am going to speak on is 
not going to be a problem for students. I do not see that when I read 
the bill. I take exception to his confidence that it is not going to be a 
problem.
<P>
	Motion No. 44 effectively deletes the second part of clause 45(e) 
which deals with import copies made with the consent of the owner 
and the copyright in the country where they were made of any used 
books. Then it goes on to say except textbooks of a scientific, 
technical or scholarly nature for use within an educational 
institution in a course of instruction. That is the clause which is the 
problem.
<P>
	Clause 45 in the bill addresses the issue of exclusive distributors 
in Canada. If a copyright owner has selected a Canadian publisher 
to distribute his or her work in Canada, that publisher is an 
exclusive distributor. Clause 45(e) provides an exception to this 
and makes it lawful for individuals to import used books. That 
would be fine if this government had left it at that. Instead, the 
government has created an exception to the exception. It has 
specifically made it unlawful for individuals to import textbooks of 
a scientific, technical or scholarly nature for use within an 
educational institution such as colleges and universities.
<P>
	What does this mean? The Liberal government has given into the 
pressures of the Canadian publishing  industry at the expense of 
those who can at least afford it, the students. It is interesting to note 
that this amendment was pushed through at the last minute in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9009"> 9009 </A></B>
<P>
response to pressure from Canadian publishers. It is also 
interesting note that when the Canadian Booksellers Association 
appeared before the parliamentary committee considering Bill 
C-32 in October 1996 absolutely no mention was made of used 
textbooks. Instead, this amendment was added at a late date 
without any meaningful opportunity for interested parties such as 
booksellers and student associations to have input. That was 
shameful.
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
	Time and again this government has said that it is committed to 
young Canadians. This government has tried to make us believe 
that it is investing in the futures of young Canadians. For many 
young Canadians the future starts with university or college. Books 
are one essential part of higher education. As a parent whose 
daughter is currently in university I am only too familiar with the 
costs involved, tuition, books, living expenses. They all add up 
quickly. In a northern riding such as mine, Prince George-Peace 
River, the expenses can be much more if a student is forced to 
relocate in order to pursue a higher education.
<P>
	Luckily my daughter has parental support, but many students do 
not. One way they can defray the high costs associated with 
university or college is to buy used textbooks. Because there are 
few Canadian suppliers of used textbooks, bookstores and students 
rely on a supply of used textbooks imported from the U.S.A.
<P>
	The average price of a brand new text book is about $75, and 
even that seems low. I am well aware that many students face costs 
of hundreds of dollars for textbooks. It is estimated that the cost to 
students of purchasing new rather than used textbooks will be $5 
million annually if this amendment is passed. This will only 
worsen the student debt problems that we are currently facing. On 
an individual level the effect of this amendment will be to increase 
the total amount a student spends on textbooks over the course of 
his or her degree by as much as $1,600. This is a huge blow to 
students and their parents.
<P>
	Sixteen hundred dollars would pay for a whole semester of 
college or university. Sixteen hundred dollars could help students 
from more remote areas who have been forced to relocate to travel 
home for Christmas or for summer jobs. Not only do students buy 
used textbooks to save money, they sell them back to campus 
bookstores in order to recoup some of their money.
<P>
	These textbooks are exported to distributors outside Canada. 
Canada currently exports more used textbooks than it imports so 
there is a balance of trade there. By restricting the importation of 
used textbooks this government is affecting this export trade. We 
can expect that if the import of used books stops, so will the export. 
Demand for used texts will fall and students will no  longer be able 
to sell their books back to campus bookstores. This will result in an 
estimated loss to students of $2 million in revenue each and every 
year from the sale of used textbooks.
<P>
	Canadian universities and colleges are increasingly relying on 
revenues from the sales of used books. Campus bookstores benefit 
twice from the sale of used textbooks. They get a commission on 
the purchase of used textbooks by the students and they get a 
margin on the later sale of reused textbooks to other students.
<P>
	It has been estimated that lost revenues for Canadian academic 
institutions and their bookstores as a result of this Liberal 
amendment would be almost $600,000 each year. As we all know, 
decreased revenues are always passed on to the consumer in the 
form of reduced service and higher costs. In this case I reiterate that 
the consumers we are talking about are students.
<P>
	Who will this amendment really help? The Canadian publishing 
industry seems to think it will protect them. However, despite what 
we have been led to believe Canada is not being overrun by foreign 
used textbooks. In 1995-96, 29 per cent of the used textbooks that 
were exported from and reimported into Canada were Canadian 
material. Canada is in effect recycling its own used textbooks.
<P>
	The effect of this amendment will be to force students to buy 
brand new textbooks, most of which are published by American 
companies. Therefore the protection of Canadian interests 
argument does not hold water. I submit that the true effect of this 
amendment is to protect the profits of foreign owned new textbook 
publishers.
<P>
	Another effect of this legislation will be to encourage Canadian 
students to photocopy their friend's textbooks rather than spend 
money on new ones. Students who resent being forced to purchase 
new textbooks or who simply cannot afford them will no doubt pick 
the cheaper option and head to the photocopier. Who could blame 
them?
<P>
<B>(1330)</B>
<P>
	Surely this is a step backward for copyright protection. Not only 
does this raise concerns from the student perspective, it also raises 
concerns under NAFTA. The amendment would interfere with 
trade based solely on geography rather than content or intellectual 
property rights, thereby offending the national treatment provisions 
of NAFTA.
<P>
	Clearly this amendment, which restricts the import of used 
textbooks into Canada, does little for anyone other than foreign 
new textbook publishers. All it does is unfairly penalize Canadian 
students, colleges and universities while at the same time failing to 
have any positive effects on the Canadian economy.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9010"> 9010 </A></B>
<P>
	That is why I strongly urge this House to adopt the amendment 
proposed by my hon. colleague to delete this senseless restriction 
on used textbook importation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
it is good to speak to this amendment today. It is an important one. I 
do not know if it slipped in without being noticed by the 
government but for some reason the government has seen fit to 
leave it in here.
<P>
	It is concerned about one of those rising free trade issues of all 
times, the case where used textbooks could slip across the border in 
incredible numbers, flooding the market with cheap textbooks. It 
happens all the time that thousands of businesses go broke. Every 
day I get phone calls about this.
<P>
	The reason it is a concern is that this specifically mentions 
university textbooks of a scientific, technological or scholarly 
nature. This provision is in there in case used textbooks become a 
problem. Again, I can hardly imagine that happening. Even if it 
were to become a so-called problem, what a delightful problem it 
would be.
<P>
	I was in university for a while. The reasons I left will be left not 
discussed today. I was in university for some time. What does a 
person do when they get into university? The first thing they do is 
get courses assigned and textbooks.
<P>
	People get their textbooks. They rush down because there is 
always a certain number of used textbooks available. They are 
available for first come, first serve. They are half price. If a person 
charges in there, they can get a scientific novel, a dissertation that 
is already highlighted and ready to go at half price.
<P>
	When talking about a $1,600 bill for textbooks, what a plum to 
know there are plenty of textbooks, hopefully a plethora of 
textbooks, a cacophony, lots of textbooks all available at half price.
<P>
	The member from Peace River asked what the number one 
priority is of a student. There is no doubt what the number one 
priority is. It is scholarly activity.
<P>
	Jana is one of the many pages who serve us in the House of 
Commons. They do a wonderful job. I asked this young lady what 
her priorities are, what is catching her attention these days. They 
are getting near the end of term. They are here on a scholarly 
enterprise. They are here to learn and they also learn in university.
<P>
	She said: ``I live to work at my scholarly activities''. I said: 
``You look a little tired this morning. Is it possible that you have 
been working too hard?'' She said yes, she had been working too 
hard. She had been up to three o'clock in the morning studying 
some obscure topic that probably most of us would not even 
understand.
<P>
<B>(1335 )</B>
<P>
	I am sure that with the use of a textbook and friends of both 
sexes they worked together to get to the studies at  hand, using 
every asset at her disposal and pouring herself into her work. I was 
impressed. I am sure that at about one or two o'clock this morning 
she was thinking to herself ``where are those used textbooks?'' It 
was weighing heavily on her heart. I am sure she was thinking ``if 
they cut off the supply of used textbooks, what shall I do, I will 
have no opportunity to further my education''. She could be 
relegated to spending evenings in fruitless activities or who knows 
what.
<P>
	I think of Jana when I think of this clause. I think what a sad 
thing it would be if this clause were to pass unamended. It would 
make it impossible for her to use any of these used books.
<P>
	I jest somewhat of course. However, the intent of my remarks is 
sound. People going to university have a limited income, limited 
access to books. Almost all of them are striving to make ends meet 
and it is a tough job. These pages here are just like everyone else. 
They are trying to make ends meet as well.
<P>
	Why would we want to restrict the access of used books to these 
people and others, that it could suddenly become a problem? I do 
not think people who are attending university need to be concerned 
about limited access. I say if used books can be found by the bus 
load, bring them in and sell them at half price, let the students 
benefit. After all, many scholarly books are only scholarly for that 
short university period. Let us recycle them, use them up and give 
the students a break.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Comox-Alberni, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to continue in the vein of my colleague on used books.
<P>
	The government is proposing a penalty on used books. Used text 
books which are largely used by college students or universities 
could not be imported.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> That is false.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilmour:</B> A member across is saying it is false. We do not 
share that opinion. We feel this clause should be deleted. It is 
redundant.
<P>
	Who does this penalize? It penalizes the students. I also address 
my comments to the nine pages in the House. These students spend 
time in the House learning about our parliamentary system and at 
the same time they attend university. These pages should not have 
to pay double for textbooks.
<P>
	However, there is a deeper picture here. Why is the government 
penalizing students? Why is it not letting business take place? 
Business should operate on its own and should not be subsidized by 
government. If it cannot do that, it will go under.
<P>
	On the one hand the government is saying it is going to charge 
students $5 million more for books. On the other hand there is an 
$87 million gift to Bombardier. What kind of picture does this paint 
of the Liberal idea of business? It is absolutely wrong.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9011"> 9011 </A></B>
<P>
	This will be pushed forward. The Liberals will have loaded up 
the Senate. There will be no restriction in the Senate because the 
Liberals will push it through, another dysfunctional system.
<P>
<B>(1340 )</B>
<P>
	I would like to go back to my university days. When I was in 
university books were a major cost. The fact that I was able to sell 
those books the next year either back to the university or to other 
students was part of my accounting for going into the next year. If I 
was not able to sell those books it would have been an additional 
cost, a cost I could not afford.
<P>
	I again go back to where the Liberals are coming from. Why 
penalize students? Look at the pages here. Why should they be 
forced to pay another $5 million because the government wants to 
penalize them? It is absolutely wrong.
<P>
	There is nothing wrong with recycled books. A book can be used 
many times. Why should it only be used once? It is because these 
people across the way are saying they will subsidize the publishing 
industry. That is basically wrong. This motion is redundant, wrong 
and should be deleted.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
think it might be of value to take a look at part of the proposed act 
here that we are saying is redundant and wrong.
<P>
	Clause 45 states that notwithstanding anything in this act, it is 
lawful for a person to important copies made with the consent of 
the owner of the copyright in the country where they were made of 
any used books. As far as that goes, that is fine, but the government 
is adding ``except where textbooks of a scientific, technical or 
scholarly nature for use within an educational institution in a 
course instruction''. How can the government say it is not relevant 
or not redundant?
<P>
	It defies any logic to understand how even in a place like this 
where there is heckling from time to time, certainly not from our 
side, government members can possibly heckle and say that this 
clause does not have anything to do with textbooks. How can they 
say it does not have anything to do with the words I just read when 
those are the words they want to put into the act?
<P>
	The result of this is going to be very detrimental not only to 
students but to businesses serving students who presently have a 
situation where there is a flow of textbooks back and forth. We 
have an open border situation that works very well. In fact, there 
are thousands of people who are either part time students or who 
are working on campus who are involved in this particular 
business. There is a business going back and forth. What the 
Liberals want to do, for whatever reason, is stop this business. The 
result is it will not only cost students many tens of thousands of 
dollars and perhaps millions of dollars additional to the cost of 
their being  able to get themselves educated with the textbooks 
prescribed by their institutions, but it is also going to put in 
jeopardy literally thousands of jobs of either part time students or 
people working on the campus serving the students.
<P>
	How in the world can government members turn around and say 
that it does not have anything to do with textbooks when the 
amendment states ``textbooks''?
<P>
	To give the House an idea of where some of these concerns are 
coming from I will read from a news bulletin put out by the CAUT 
entitled ``Ambushed by the Heritage Committee'': ``Angst, 
combat, defeat and endurance, rather than terms describing warring 
nations or Olympic co-operation, have been the hallmarks of the 
proposed Canadian copyright legislation known as Bill C-32''. For 
those who are just tuning in to the copyright saga, angst refers to 
the cumulative facts of the CAUT, the Association of Universities 
and Colleges of Canada, the Canadian Association of Research 
Libraries, the Association of Canadian Community Colleges, the 
Canadian school boards and the Canadian Teachers Federation. 
These people are deeply concerned not only about this part of the 
copyright law but other parts of it. Let us just stay on this part.
<P>
<B>(1345)</B>
<P>
	What is the net result of the entire process? It is being held 
together with chewing gum and baling wire. As a matter of fact the 
scotch tape is starting to show. This entire process has been so 
flawed that the members cannot even read the bill where it says 
``except textbooks of a scientific, technical or scholarly nature''.
<P>
	These people who are after all educators or are involved in 
higher education in Canada state, as is pointed out in this article: 
``The manner in which the amendments were pushed through the 
committee in just a few hours, many without prior consent from 
representatives of the jointly responsible Industry Canada, left 
onlookers aghast''.
<P>
	We are involved in a process that the government does not seem 
to understand. I will admit to a degree of partisanship when I speak 
about the heritage minister and the way that she has handled this, 
but really this bill has nothing to do with partisanship. This bill has 
everything to do with attempting to create a balance between the 
creators and the users of material, whatever that material is, 
whatever those creations are.
<P>
	To give the House an idea of what I am talking about, there was 
some discussion in committee about another section of the bill and 
the term ``commercially available''. This has a real impact as well 
on universities and teaching institutions.
<P>
	For example, under educational institutions, section 29.4, 
because of the committee amendments to commercially available, 
would impact educational institutions if they were to photocopy a 
poem or any  document created by Margaret Atwood for an 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9012"> 9012 </A></B>
<P>
overhead projection in a high school class. That would be an 
infringement of copyright.
<P>
	If an educational institution was to make a photographic slide of 
a painting by Alex Colville, a living Canadian artist, that could be 
projected on to the screen for purposes of teaching an art class, that 
would be an infringement of copyright.
<P>
	If that institution was to photocopy a chapter from a very hard to 
find book and the class was asked to write a short literary criticism 
or an explanation of that document, that would be an infringement.
<P>
	If, as part of an examination students were required to translate a 
poem into French, this invokes both reproduction and translation 
under section 29.4(2).
<P>
	Libraries and archives or museums are being impacted if they 
make a cassette production for use by patrons of an original 
recording of a Canadian artist, now deceased, reading his own 
poetry in the early sixties, the condition of the original is such that 
it could not be handed directly to the patrons. This entire bill is 
patchwork and many of those patches, many of the holes do not 
even line up any more.
<P>
	I return to my original thesis. I do not know the reasons why this 
clause was inserted into the bill. It is going to create a very serious 
situation for students. We will be increasing the costs to people 
getting an education as a result of the oversight or the accidental 
inclusion of this clause. There does not seem to be any particularly 
good reason for the inclusion of it.
<P>
	The problem is that the entire bill from stem to gunnel is a 
patchwork that is falling apart and the scotch tape is not going to do 
the job.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I wish to intervene because what I am hearing is totally 
wrong, and people should not be allowed to say such utter 
nonsense.
<P>
	First of all, this morning I took great pride in being in this House 
to consider Bill C-32 which concerns phase II of the copyright 
modernization process. For many years, the performing arts 
community has been waiting for this bill, and the government had 
to do something to update the existing legislation.
<P>
	As I said this morning, in committee we worked long hours and 
heard more than 65 groups of witnesses from across Canada, 
people representing performers, radio, television and various 
educational institutions and museums. We did a very thorough job 
in committee because we felt that all the groups and associations 
that appeared before the committee had important things to say and 
some very specific recommendations to make.
<P>
	We made a point of carefully listening to and considering what 
was said, bearing in mind the objective of Bill C-32 on copyright, 
which is to introduce new rights, including neighbouring rights, for 
performers, to add other mechanisms and forms of legal recourse 
for artists, and, as far as book distribution is concerned, to make 
some major changes to prevent parallel imports.
<P>
	We also did a major job in committee when we considered this 
bill with all the amendments. The Bloc Quebecois alone proposed 
75 amendments. The government also worked very hard on 
proposing amendments after hearing all these groups. However, I 
must say that while the committee worked very hard on this bill, 
the Reform Party members were conspicuous by their absence. 
They did not attend the discussions on the amendments, and were 
absent throughout the process of determining what was useful and 
what should be included in the bill. Today, they stand up and say 
that this bill was hastily cobbled together and that there were some 
last minute amendments.
<P>
	I may recall that this bill goes beyond political considerations. 
This bill concerns performers and the very important cultural 
industry, and the official opposition will not tolerate members in 
this House criticizing the work of a committee and its approach, 
while they were conspicuous by their absence.
<P>
	Today, people who worked with very specific objectives in mind 
are being accused of proceeding with undue haste and proposing 
amendments at the last minute. Speaking for the official 
opposition, I say no, that is not what happened.
<P>
	I wanted today to be a memorable day in this House when, at 
last, the Copyright Act, which goes back to 1924, was revised the 
first time in 1988 and is aimed at serving the interests of creators 
and authors as well as the interests of those who use their works, 
will now follow the legislative process and move on to third 
reading.
<P>
	I strongly urge the Reform Party to rise above its own partisan 
considerations and this attempt at obstruction, and work on this 
bill, instead of trying to make political mileage at the expense of 
creators, young people, students and our pages, no less. Talk about 
rhetoric!

	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Madam Speaker, a point of order. I realize I am

wish he would withdraw that word.

understanding is that it was said in a general context and not 
directly at a member in particular.

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> Madam Speaker, I would 
like to point out that the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage 
held nearly 25 meetings, heard 68 witnesses, spent a total of85 hours on committee work, analyzed in excess of 190 briefs. It is 
unacceptable for Reform Party members to accuse committee 
members from the government and the official opposition alike of 
having done a poor job, of having botched this bill, especially when 
the hon. member saying so chose to absent himself from the 
committee and to practice empty-chair politics.
<P>
	He has just voiced concerns about the amendment relating to 
photographers. I would remind him, since he had difficulty 
understanding that amendment, that I took my inspiration from the 
British copyright legislation. There has been much reference to 
copyrights in other countries. He ought to try to understand the 
amendment in the light of the British copyright legislation.
<P>
	Today we must refuse any attempt to dispose of a major bill in its 
second review phase, which must be revised in five years.
<P>
	This bill refers to collective societies, which represents authors 
and creators. We worked very hard on this major instrument, which 
is aimed at making it possible for these societies to speak with 
users and reach agreements with them. There is also a copyright 
board to govern the mechanisms.
<P>
	I invite the Reform Party to rise above partisan politics and to 
give this bill a chance to survive, for the good of creators and users 
both.
<P>
	This will be a great day if we manage to rise above political 
interests and to work strictly on behalf of authors and the cultural 
industry.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleagues, we will get back to this if 
necessary after Oral Question Period.
<P>
	It being almost 2 p.m., the House will now proceed to Statements 
by Members.

Israel were murdered in an ambush today. Our hearts go out to the 
families, friends and those who were injured. So too our hearts are 
heavy with the knowledge that on this day one year ago 16 children 
and their teacher were massacred in Dunblane, Scotland.
<P>
	While these incidents and others such as the massacres in 
Montreal and Tasmania are always heart wrenching, they are even 
more so when children are the targeted  victims. Innocent children 
in Israel and in Scotland were in the wrong place at the wrong time. 
The world lost unrealized potential and some of its innocence.

death at age 76 of Paul-Émile Robert, the ``figurehead of the 
nationalist movement'', as he was referred to in yesterday's <I>Le 
Devoir</I>.
<P>
	I had the honour to know Paul-Émile Robert when he was 
president of the Société Saint-Jean-Baptiste de Montréal in the 
early 1960s. I held the same position for Saint-Jérôme, so we had 
occasion to meet regularly.

Saint-Jean-Baptiste de Montréal's commitment in favour of 
Quebec sovereignty.

<B>(1400)</B>
<P>
	His militancy in defence of the French fact led him to create a

Montreal municipal scene, where he was a municipal councillor for 
close to 15 years.

	<B>Mr. John Duncan (North Island-Powell River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Canadians of all walks of life and persuasions agree on a 
vision which includes protecting endangered species.
<P>
	When the government first proposed endangered species 
legislation last year it entered into consultations and a committee 
process. The consultative process excluded rural Canada and 
Canada east of Ontario.
<P>
	The way the bill has been amended in the most recent version 
has changed the thrust of the legislation so significantly that 
original supporters are now in open revolt.
<P>
	A grand coalition including business, workers and communities 
in British Columbia is appealing for the bill to be scrapped and 
replaced with responsible endangered species legislation. It feels 
strongly that species protection must be designed both by scientists 
and democratically accountable officials and not in the courts.

	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I thank members of the Standing Committee on Natural 
Resources who participated in the preparation of the report on rural 
development tabled yesterday in the House.
<P>
	The report identifies a fairly well defined road down which we 
can travel to restore economic health to rural communities. The 
problem is that the prescription is three years too late.
<P>
	Even the Liberals understand that their own policies during the 
last three years have taken a lot out of rural communities. For us on 
the prairies the loss of the $720 million annual contribution known 
as the Crow benefit means that every rural elevator point on the 
prairies loses about $1 million in local farm income every year.
<P>
	Liberal government decisions like that one have made it difficult 
for rural communities to maintain the jobs they currently have let 
alone work to create new ones. It is important to acknowledge how 
valuable rural Canada is to the overall well-being of our nation. We 
must work toward rebuilding it, but let us not forget that the 
Liberals created a lot of the obstacles we now have to jump over.

I take this opportunity to congratulate John Craig, a student from 
Haliburton Highlands High School.
<P>
	At the age of 16, John has started his own business. John's 
business is a fitness facility in the village of Haliburton, Ontario. 
Along with the business, John gets great grades, plays on the 
football and cross-country teams, participates in drama and works 
weekends at an electronics store.
<P>
	The idea for the business came when the old fitness facility in 
Haliburton closed. John leased the facility, brought in weights from 
his house and purchased additional ones. All this cost him $5,500 
and if he gets an aerobics class it will cost him another $700.
<P>
	His brother, Dan, has helped him considerably, along with his 
friends. His rent is considerably less than that of the last tenant but 
the most important factor will be his client base. John is working 
on that by placing flyers around the community and placing ads in 
the local paper.

pleased to address the House about the impact of the Harris

Ontario.
<P>
	I feel obliged to dispel certain falsehoods about the issue, 
namely about the reduction in transfer payments to the Ontario 
government from 1993-94 to 1998-99, which amount to only11.4 per cent. This represents at most 2.5 per cent of Ontario's 
revenues.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In the light of these statistics, the Harris government cannot say 
logically that the cuts in transfer payments are behind the cuts to 
health care and the closures of hospitals like the Montfort. The real 
reasons for these cuts and hospital closures is no doubt the decision 
of the Harris government to cut taxes, including personal income 
tax.

	<B>Mrs. Dianne Brushett (Cumberland-Colchester, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on April 1, three provinces in Atlantic Canada will 
implement a harmonized sales tax which will simplify tax 
collection, provide a greater input tax credit for business and 
thereby stimulate the Atlantic economy.
<P>
	The blended rate of 15 per cent will effectively reduce the tax 
rate by nearly four percentage points in Nova Scotia and New 
Brunswick and nearly five percentage points in Newfoundland.
<P>
	The harmonized sales tax will finally put an end to consumers 
paying tax on tax. Books will be exempt from the provincial 
portion of the tax, as they have always been, and books for public 
schools, colleges and university libraries will be tax free.
<P>
	A harmonized sales tax will not only benefit Atlantic Canada; it 
will benefit the entire country. I sincerely hope that as other 
Canadian provinces realize the value of a single national sales tax 
system they too will sign on very quickly and then we will have a 
tax-

	Despite the vitality of the women's movement, women have yet 
to be recognized as a social force that cannot be ignored. Thérèse

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="SOMALIAINQUIRY">SOMALIA INQUIRY</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Somalia inquiry has been eventful from the word go. 
We saw generals suspected of a cover-up, we heard witnesses 
contradict themselves, we saw a minister make a hash of things and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9017"> 9017 </A></B>
<P>
in the end lose his job. We even saw an operation to look for lost 
documents; the  whole army on alert to look for documents hidden 
by the chief of staff.
<P>
	Nevertheless, a number of things are clear. First of all, there was 
at least one murder in Somalia. Not unfortunate accidents but a 
murder. Second, senior army officers and senior officials with the 
Department of National Defence tried to hide these facts. And 
finally, now that the Commission of Inquiry on Somalia is winding 
up, we still do not know exactly how many people were involved in 
the cover-up.
<P>
	Considering that the Commission of Inquiry on Somalia will not 
be able to offer full clarification of this case and all the 
consequences within the time frame it was given, why does the 
minister persist in refusing to extend the commission's mandate so 
that it can do a good job?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, today it will be 
nearly two years since the commission of inquiry started 
investigating the events that took place in Somalia.
<P>
	The government gave the commission three extensions, 
including the last one. However, we have asked the commissioners 
to submit their report no later than the end of June. We could have 
continued this inquiry for another year or two or three, and by the 
end of this whole exercise, the conclusions and recommendations 
would probably have had some historic value.
<P>
	As the hon. member is aware-I was going to say ``Leader of the 
Opposition'', but this may be a bit premature-I am to report to the 
Prime Minister of Canada and the government on the future of the 
armed forces and how we should proceed. The former chief justice 
of the Supreme Court, Brian Dickson, has agreed to investigate and 
report on the whole military justice system as well as on the way 
investigations should be conducted.
<P>
	I am sure it would probably have been impossible to obtain full 
clarification of all the events that occurred before, during and after 
the situation in Somalia.
<P>
	I think that for the sake of the Canadian Forces and for the sake 
of the future of this institution which is very important for Canada, 
we had to wind things up. As soon as a report has been submitted to 
the government and the Commission of Inquiry has made its 
recommendations at the end of June, I hope Canadians will realize 
why it is important to turn the page.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if we are celebrating the commission's second birthday, I 
am not sure the word celebrate is particularly apt, it is because their 
people are responsible for the situation. We would not be in this 
mess if people had not run around hiding documents. That is what 
happened at army headquarters. At that level, we have an  
establishment that protects its own and prevents the truth from 
coming to light.
<P>
	To restore credibility within the armed forces, would it not be 
preferable to finish the inquiry and, if necessary, produce a 
preliminary report in June, let the minister do some house cleaning 
and then continue this inquiry into a number of major events, to 
identify who was responsible for what?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I fully 
understand the hon. member's concerns. The incidents that 
occurred in Somalia are absolutely intolerable. The way the 
institution reacted to these incidents is entirely unacceptable. That 
is why we promised to try to find ways to prevent such incidents 
from recurring, but in a less than perfect world, we know it is 
always a possibility. We had to find a way to set up mechanisms for 
dealing appropriately with all eventualities.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	I never commented on the way the commission decided to do its 
job of hearing witnesses, on its work schedule or on the testimony 
as such.
<P>
	But I can say to the hon. member that I believe Canadians realize 
that for the past two or three days, we have heard witnesses who 
were directly involved in the incidents that occurred in Somalia. 
They are being heard two years later. I am just stating a fact. This is 
not a comment.
<P>
	If two years later, we now hearing testimony from two people 
who were involved in the incident in Somalia, I think it says quite a 
bit about the time it would have taken to receive conclusions and 
recommendations that would be useful, in the current context, to 
try to deal with the problems and the challenges facing the 
Canadian Forces.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, surely the minister would agree that had there not been a 
cover-up, we would not have the problems we have today. If senior 
officers had co-operated instead of trying to sabotage the inquiry, 
we would not be where we are today. If the minister's predecessor 
had not spent his time protecting senior officers instead getting the 
army to do what it is supposed to do, we would not be in the mess 
we are today. There are guilty parties. If certain acts, certain 
criminal acts were committed, surely there are people who are 
guilty.
<P>
	Considering that this commission will not be able to finish its 
work, does the minister realize that soldiers will have trouble 
identifying who among their superiors was innocent and who was 
guilty? And that is a serious matter.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the  hon. 
member is referring to a situation in which there may be certain 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9018"> 9018 </A></B>
<P>
things that prevented the commission from doing its job or that 
meant the commission needed more time to do its job than would 
have been the case had the circumstances been different.
<P>
	However, some allegations regarding purported cover-ups and 
all the rest have been checked by other institutions. I may remind 
the hon. member that for instance, in the case of allegations 
concerning the former chief of staff, a government institution 
conducted an investigation and found that General Boyle was not 
responsible for doing things which, according to the commissioner, 
were unacceptable.
<P>
	The important thing for us is that by the end of March, when we 
will have reported to the Prime Minister and Canadian people, 
people will be able to evaluate the work we have been doing for 
three months. At the end of June, Canadians must be able to 
analyze-

	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of National Defence.
<P>
	Three weeks ago, a number of Canadian police officers and 
soldiers stationed in Haiti stated that their lives were endangered 
by the lack of co-operation by local authorities. Today the situation 
has not improved. On the contrary, Canadian patrols are the victims 
of repeated attacks by Haitians throwing stones.
<P>
	Does the minister agree that these statements are troubling, and 
can he tell us whether his department has initiated an inquiry to cast 
some light on the situation?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, we are not in the 
process of investigating who is throwing stones in Haiti. But I can 
tell you, as I stated yesterday to those concerned about these 
statements by two members of the Canadian Forces, which were 
picked up by the press, that when our people are sent into a 
situation like the one in Haiti at the moment, it is obvious that they 
are not being sent to the local Club Med.
<P>
	They have gone to a dangerous spot, one where there is danger 
not only for our troops, but also for the President of Haiti. We are 
not there in a babysitting role. This is a military situation in which 
military personnel will certainly be exposed to a certain degree of 
danger.
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
	Make no mistake: when Canadians go to a country like Haiti that 
has been torn apart by internal strife for years, it is not a 
comfortable situation. There is, of course, some level of danger, but 
I believe that the military personnel who are there, as well as the 
police officers,  and the Canadian public in general, consider that 
the objective of the mission is a valuable one, in light of the 
realities they face daily.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, can the 
minister explain to us why the two soldiers who dared reveal the 
truth concerning the increasingly dangerous situation in Haiti, for 
both police officers and the military, have been moved to 
administrative positions?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the two soldiers 
expressed concerns about their safety.
<P>
	If the two persons in question were uncomfortable with the 
mission they had been asked to carry out, it was important not only 
that they say this to the general public, but also that they discuss it 
with their colleagues who are also there to fulfil the objective of 
this very important mission.
<P>
	They have not been disciplined. They were nervous where they 
were, close to the President of Haiti, and so they have been put in a 
position where, I hope, they will feel more at ease.

	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Liberal government is collecting more taxes than any other federal 
government in the history of Canada. It has the record.
<P>
	Not surprisingly, Canadians have suffered a $3,000 pay cut in the 
last three years. What do they get in return? They get 1.5 million 
Canadians unemployed, 800,000 people having to moonlight just 
to make ends meet and the highest number of young Canadians 
dropping out of the workforce since the 1960s.
<P>
	My question is for the finance minister. When is the government 
going to realize that high unemployment is a direct result of high 
taxes? When will it get the connection?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
first of all the hon. member's numbers are wrong. He ought to 
know that since we have taken office the federal government's 
share, revenues as a percentage of GDP, has dropped.
<P>
	He ought to know while disposable income dropped 
substantially under the Reform Party's kissing cousins, the 
Conservatives, in 1993 when we took office it stabilized.
<P>
	Third, he ought to know that as a result of the government's 
actions, massive purchasing power through the reduction of 
interest rates has gone back into the pockets of Canadians.

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9019"> 9019 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, by 
trying to defend an unacceptably high unemployment rate, the 
Liberals are sounding exactly like Brian Mulroney: productivity 
up, interest rates down, low inflation, rosy IMF predictions 
and-listen to this-the best job creation record in the G-7.
<P>
	These are exactly the same arguments that Brian Mulroney made 
in this place in 1992 to try to defend another government that 
promised and failed to deliver on jobs, jobs, jobs for 1.5 million 
Canadians. It is exactly the same rhetoric.
<P>
	Instead of using Brian Mulroney's arguments from 1992, why 
does the government not actually do something for the 1.5 million 
unemployed? Why does it not lower taxes?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we reduced taxes in the last budget by $2 billion over the next three 
years.
<P>
	The government has set out a very clear and comprehensive plan 
for job creation. It is, first, to clean up the nation's finances which 
has led to an unprecedented drop in interest rates.
<P>
	Second, we have a short term plan for the infrastructure 
program, which the hon. member had the nerve yesterday to call 
rinky-dink. He cast aspersions on every mayor and municipality in 
the country. We have the Prime Minister's trips abroad.
<P>
	We also have a long-term plan, a reinvestment in education, a 
reinvestment in research and development. If the Reform Party is 
sincere about jobs, then it will support the government's budget. It 
is the most comprehensive plan that has been set out.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we are 
certainly not going to support a rinky-dink government with its 
rinky-dink budget.
<P>
<B>(1430 )</B>
<P>
	A single income family of four making $30,000 will pay 90 per 
cent less in taxes under a Reform government. That is 1.2 million 
low income Canadians who will be lifted completely off the tax 
rolls under a Reform government. Those are Reform values.
<P>
	Is it Liberal values for the government to tax the working poor so 
they can give money to their buddies at Bombardier which just 
announced a $400 million profit? Is it Liberal values to try to 
explain away one and a half million unemployed just like Brian 
Mulroney did?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Reform Party members want to talk values. They want to cut $3.5 
billion from health care. We will not do it.
<P>
	Reform Party members want to talk values. They want to cut $3 
billion from equalization. They want to deprive seven provinces of 
decent public services. We will not do it.

	<B>Mr. Stéphan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Minister of National Defence.
<P>
	In February, the CBC revealed that, contrary to what the 
Minister of National Defence has been promising students signing 
up for subsidized university programs, the Canadian Armed Forces 
are requiring participants to meet their contract commitments or be 
forced to repay huge sums even after changing or ending their 
program of study.
<P>
	How does the minister explain that students registered in good 
faith, like those whose course of study was cut out from under them 
with the closure of the Collège militaire de Saint-Jean, are forced to 
meet their contract obligations and even to pay back the salary they 
received, when he is not fulfilling his part of the bargain?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I think everyone 
who signs a contract must try to fulfil it and I think most people 
expect this sort of contract to be met.
<P>
	However, in certain cases, a person may have been forced to 
change career or been unable, for some reason, to continue his or 
her studies.
<P>
	In some instances, there may be a way to resolve the problem, 
but, in general, because the costs involved are very high- whether 
in Saint-Jean or at the Royal Military College in Kingston 
-Canadian taxpayers expect everyone to fulfil their commitments 
as in the case described by the hon. member.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
quite prepared to talk about costs, as a career change for a young 
person often involves considerable cost.
<P>
	Since we know that those recruiting students lead them to 
believe that the course of study they choose will continue, would 
the minister not agree that this practice is outrageous and that his 
department should act quickly to settle the case of the dozens of 
students who were lied to by his department?

circumstances, where it can be shown that the changes had an 
effect, the government should look closely at the situation. Each 
case must be decided on its own merits. I am prepared to review the 
cases the hon. member would care to put before me and the 
department.
<P>
	But I would explain to him that a person who has agreed to take 
courses in a civilian institution must honour the debts he has 
incurred or the commitments he has made if he decides to leave the

	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on April 1, 1993, while he was still in opposition, the 
Prime Minister was quoted as saying: ``Canadians have reached the 
saturation level with respect to taxation''. Yet the reality is that 
since his Liberals have come to power the average Canadian family 
has suffered a $3,000 pay cut because of the government's tax 
hikes.
<P>
	Did the Prime Minister really mean what he said when he was in 
opposition or was he just pulling a cruel April fool's joke on the 
Canadian people?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member can stand in this House and spout nonsense all he 
wants, but it is still going to be nonsense, no matter how much he 
repeats it.
<P>
	There has been an increase in the government's revenues. That 
increase has occurred overwhelmingly as a result of economic 
activity, which is exactly what anybody should want.
<P>
	At the same time there has been a tremendous reduction in the 
cost that consumers have to pay for refrigerators, for houses and for 
cars. It is estimated by most economists that over $5 billion in 
additional purchasing power has gone back into the hands of 
Canadians as a result of the actions of the government. The hon. 
member ought to recognize that.
<P>
	There is not much use of me standing in the House and 
responding to nonsense. What I would really ask is that the Reform 
Party's researchers go back and come up  with the odd question that 
reflects the economic realities.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr.

	We constantly hear about how good low interest rates are. What 
good are low interest rates to the unemployed? When was the last 
time the minister heard of a bank manager approving a loan or a 
mortgage for someone who does not have a job?
<P>
	There are 1.5 million people out of work in Canada. 
Unemployment has remained high ever since the Liberal 
government came to power. Even though in other countries 
unemployment rates have been decreasing over the last two years, 
it has become a distinctly Canadian problem.

this is not a distinctly Canadian problem. There is no doubt that the 
government is not happy with the level of unemployment. It is for 
that reason we brought in programs to help youth unemployment, 
programs to help our exports and programs to help small and 
medium size businesses.
<P>
	In terms of the world, and the Prime Minister has said it, outside 
of the United States, if we look at the G-7, we have stronger job 
creation than any of those countries. We have done very well.
<P>
	That does not mean we are happy. That does not mean we will 
rest as long as there is one Canadian unemployed. This government 
will work on it.
<P>
	Where was the Reform Party three years ago, two years ago and 
one year ago? Every day in the House its members stood and said 
cut, gouge, slash, burn, ignore health care, ignore unemployment. 
We on this side said that we would not do that. We will protect the 
Canadian worker. We will protect the Canadian social fabric. The 
Reform Party ought to recognize that.

<P>
	The Middle East peace process is in crisis. After announcing 
plans to build a new Jewish settlement in East Jerusalem, an 
occupied territory since 1967, the Israeli government has just 
decided that it would return only 9 per cent of the West Bank 
territories, rather than the 30 per cent expected by Palestinian 
authorities.

West Bank territories, and would continue building settlements.

<B>(1440)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Christine Stewart (Secretary of State (Latin America 
and Africa), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, Canada continues to be very 
committed to the peace process in the Middle East and we 
encourage all parties to the process to remain committed 
themselves.
<P>
	We experienced today a very unfortunate incident in the Middle 
East and we send our condolences through Mr. Netanyahu of Israel 
to the families of the victims. With him we wish that the rhetoric in 
the Middle East were diminished to avoid these kinds of 
unacceptable incidents.
<P>
	Just to say that Canada does remain committed to the peace 
process, we are not in a position to demand that Israel take certain 
actions but we feel that through dialogue and negotiation peace can 
prevail in that region.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
secretary of state did not exactly answer my question.
<P>
	I asked her what Canada's position was following Israel's 
announcement that it would withdraw. We can all say what we 
would like to see and offer condolences, but this does not sort out 
the immediate problem.
<P>
	Because I was unable to get an answer on Canada's specific 
position regarding Israel's withdrawal, I would like to ask the 
secretary of state if she can assure us that the government will do 
everything in its power to bring an end to the cycle of violence and 
to help salvage the peace process, before it is too late.

	When the parties to the conflict have negotiated solutions we 
would hope in the name of peace that they stick to their own

[Reformers] are exploiting us at all. They are the ones standing up 
for us, speaking out for us. If there is anyone who is exploiting this 
situation it is the justice minister. He is the one who should be 
ashamed. We are confident that all Canadians will remember that 
Clifford Olson's platform was built and maintained by the Liberal 
Party of Canada''.
<P>
	Being as the Liberals voted not to apologize, just what does the 
Prime Minister have to say to these victims today?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the hon. member for his question.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice has met with many people who have lost 
loved ones and friends. It is out of respect to these loved ones and 
friends and out of respect to the victims that certain changes have 
been made to section 745 of the Criminal Code.
<P>
	First, the code was changed to allow for victim impact 
statements in these hearings. Second, there was a change to 
prohibit serial or multiple murderers from making use of this 
application. It was also changed to put in a screening process so 
that frivolous applications would not be allowed. Third, it was 
changed to ensure that the jury verdict had to be unanimous in 
order for an applicant to receive a reduction in parole ineligibility.
<P>
	Finally, the minister has sent letters to his provincial 
counterparts requiring that all prosecutors tell people who have lost 
loved ones exactly what the circumstances of section 745 are at the 
time of sentencing.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, when 
we refer to a rinky-dink finance minister we should refer to a 
Tinkerbell justice minister. Tinkering around with this stuff is not 
the answer.
<P>
	Two days ago on ``Canada AM'' Jana Rosenfeldt, the sister of 
one of Olson's victims, said: ``Actually we met with the justice 
minister last year. He had a chance to stop this. He basically spit on 
the graves of all these kids. He had a chance to stop it, he left it to 
the last day in Parliament and of course it didn't go through. I 
blame him''.
<P>
<B>(1445)</B>
<P>
	Ms. Rosenfeldt is referring to Bill C-45. Why did this 
government not move immediately to ensure that Jana Rosenfeldt 
and the families of other victims did not have to relive their 
nightmares by listening to Clifford Olson?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of

what I view as absolutely appalling about the situation is that the

745 could somehow be removed from the Criminal Code  in the

	I have news for Reformers. Why do they not tell the victims of 
crime the truth? If this section were removed from the Criminal 
Code today all people who are in the system already could still 
apply up to 25 years in the future. That is the abuse of the victims.

	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, on Tuesday 
March 4, at 4.30 p.m., a company in the process of setting up 
operations in my riding learned from the mouth of the president of 
the local Liberal Party of Canada association herself that it would 
be receiving over $50,000 in grants, and learned this less than an 
hour after the minister had signed his agreement. The following 
day, the offices of the Minister of Human Resources Development 
and the President of Treasury Board released to the press certain 
confidential information on the business plan of that company.
<P>
	Can the Minister of Human Resources Development, or the 
President of Treasury Board, explain in this House how it happens 
that, on the eve of an election, the Liberal riding president,Mrs. Mathieu, is the one to announce grants to the riding of 
Portneuf, on behalf of the government?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I am 
not familiar with the facts referred to. I would ask my hon. 
colleague to provide them to me.
<P>
	However, I believe that, if there any accusations to be made 
about MPs who have revealed infrastructure program projects 
before all parties have approved them, these would be directed to 
the party across the way.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, to set 
things straight, first of all, the fund involved was the transition job 
creation fund. Second, the money does not come from the Liberal 
Party, but from the people. What I am referring to is not a favour 
from the Liberal Party, but application of a non-partisan 
government program. You will have understood, what we are 
talking about here is political morality.
<P>
	I am asking my question of the minister, who has just opened the 
door to me. Yes, I will provide the information, and does he 
commit, in this House, to investigating his own department and 
that of his colleague in Human Resources Development, to find out 
how information provided confidentially to a departmental 
employee ended up in the newspapers?

will look into the facts once I have them, in  order to see if there are

claiming.

is for the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	The community of Grand Rapids is located north of the 53rd 
parallel and is a four hour drive north of Winnipeg. In 1990 the 
Mulroney government decided that Grand Rapids was a southern 
community and that taxpayers there did not qualify for the northern 
tax benefit. The full impact of this Tory decision has been felt for 
over a year now.
<P>
	Will the minister listen to the people of Grand Rapids and 
consider changes to the northern tax zones?
<P>
<B>(1450 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
want to thank the member for Churchill for his question. He has 
been a very fervent advocate for northern residents on this issue. I 
have certainly appreciated his efforts and I will continue to listen to 
him and indeed to the residents.
<P>
	I should, however, like to provide some history on the topic. The 
current northern resident reduction was implemented in 1991 
following the report of a task force that was set up. It concluded 
that the original community based approach was unfair and 
unworkable. It proposed that only residents of broad northern 
intermediate zones receive tax benefits. These zones were defined 
using objective criteria relating to both environmental factors and 
community characteristics.
<P>
	While I appreciate that members of the community may well be 
disappointed, they were set up on the basis of an objective system 
which was regarded to be substantially superior to the old system 
which was much more subjective.

comes with the perception that senior leadership has escaped 
investigation?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and

in the past to the hon. gentleman who brings a great deal of 
knowledge to the way the Canadian forces work that obviously I 
would not be able to comment on the way the commission of 
inquiry conducted its agenda or relate to the specific testimony of 
any witnesses.
<P>
	However, I want to thank the hon. member and his party. I have 
been looking for input because he asked how we could deal with 
some of the problems and challenges facing the Canadian forces.
<P>
	Finally, I have a document that I gather is from the Reform Party 
called ``The Right Balance'' by Andrew Davies who I understand is 
a candidate for the Reform Party. In his article he asks what is 
wrong with the Canadian forces. I encourage Canadians to read this 
article because it is input from the Reform Party on what it thinks is 
wrong with the Canadian forces and what it thinks some of the 
solutions would be. It is very illuminating and I would be happy to 
table this document.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
did not hear an answer to my question. I was not talking about the 
Somalia inquiry. I was asking what the minister intends to do to 
restore trust in the Canadian forces by completing this 
investigation. Without full disclosure, these issues will never be 
resolved. This is far from being in the best interest of the defence 
department or the Canadian forces.
<P>
	How do we fix something if we do not know what is broken? The 
inquiry was following terms of reference laid down by this 
government. Having disrupted that process, does the minister now 
intend to let the matter just drop and hope it will go away?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, obviously I 
think it will be a very long time before the very deep wounds that 
were inflicted on the Canadian forces and its reputation go away.
<P>
	However, I do think we have to begin the healing process and put 
in place the corrective measures that are required to ensure that this 
kind of situation does not occur again.
<P>
	With respect to that, we have asked a retired chief justice of the 
Supreme Court, Brian Dickson, to bring to the government and to 
the people of Canada specific  recommendations, and they are wide 
ranging, with respect to the reform of the military justice system 
and the military police and their role.
<P>
	In addition, we will be submitting to the government and to the 
Canadian people a wide ranging set of recommendations with 
respect to how we can deal with problems and challenges facing the 
Canadian forces. We will do that before the end of March, as I 
undertook to do on December 31. Then the Canadian people will be 
able to see what people who are serious about the future of the 
Canadian forces have done and proposed.

<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I think the hon. member 
raised a very important issue which concerns market access. In 
fact, the French government's current policy on dubbing is costing 
Canada jobs because it will not accept films dubbed by a country 
other than France, claiming that the accent is wrong, in fact rather 
rustic.
<P>
	We are working together with Ms. Beaudoin, the Quebec 
Minister of Culture, to ensure that following representations made

supported by France today.

considering that the Minister of Canadian Heritage says she is 
working together with the Quebec minister, I may remind her that 
broadcasting is under federal jurisdiction, that Telefilm Canada is 
under federal jurisdiction, and that in both cases, the minister has 
the authority to inform the Canadian film production and television 
production industry that it is important to have their dubbing done 
in Quebec.
<P>
	Will the minister promise to use every means at her disposal to 
deal with this matter?

closely with the Quebec Minister of Culture, Ms. Beaudoin, who 
has already indicated that she wants to adopt a joint policy on the 
subject. I believe the French minister, Mr. Douste-Blazy, will be in

	The House resumed consideration of Bill C-32, an act to amend 
the Copyright Act as reported (with amendment) from the 
committee and Motions Nos. 6, 44 and 60.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise to speak on the Group No. 4 motions. I mentioned 
earlier today the problems caused for book distributors by this bill 
and the problems it would cause for consumers of book products as 
a result.
<P>
	At this point I would like to cover some objections to the bill that 
have been raised by the Canadian Association of Student 
Associations. With some information that they sent earlier today, 
they have calculated that the average spent on books by students 
during a university degree is around $4,800, which is a significant 
amount of money.
<P>
	All of us who have been through university in the past know that 
it is always a struggle to pull together enough money to buy the 
textbooks for the year and $4,800 is not an insignificant amount of 
money. This figure is based on 10 courses per year with an average 
figure of about $75 per book. As those of us who have been to 
university know, many courses require more than one book but this 
calculation is based on one book per course.
<P>
	The amount that students are able to save on the trade of used 
books, according to an average worked out by the Canadian 
Association of Student Associations, is about $1,600 or one-third 
of the total they spend. That is enough to pay for an entire semester 
of tuition and fees.
<P>
	Students run into problems where professors choose to change 
the edition of a text from one year to another, which happens fairly 
often. I see some nods of assent from the other side from members 
opposite. I know they have experienced the harrowing experience 
of having professors change the edition of a text.
<P>
	Students are unable to pass their texts to another student 
following behind. Therefore, there has been quite an export trade in 
books which enables the students to make between 40 and 50 per 
cent of the original cover price as they trade those books back 
across the border on export.
<P>
	If the import trade is stopped, then obviously the export trade 
will end. That will be a direct result of this bill, which maybe the 
government side did not anticipate. Certainly those who are 
directly affected can see it quite clearly and they have not hesitated 
in pointing it out.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9026"> 9026 </A></B>
<P>
	That was not something that came from the member for North 
Vancouver in isolation. It came directly from the Canadian 
Association of Student Associations. There are many unintended 
effects. As a result of this part of the bill we will end up with 
poorer service and higher prices for a Canadian used textbook 
system.
<P>
	Ernst &amp; Young did a study which concluded that book publishers 
were much slower at fulfilling orders than the used textbook 
distributors. Another unintended effect would be that the supply of 
Canadian used textbooks will be reduced by perhaps 50 per cent. 
Blocking reimports will prevent the very recycling of Canadian 
used textbooks that the publishers say they support.
<P>
	This really is a badly thought out bill. Unintended effects make it 
obvious that its drafters should have consulted in a more 
meaningful manner with those who would be affected, in this case, 
university students.
<P>
	The basic facts are that used textbooks are a small percentage of 
the overall textbook sales at Canadian universities and colleges. 
That is true. There is about $18 million or about 8 per cent based on 
the Ernst &amp; Young study for the Canadian Publishers Council.
<P>
	Canada has a net balance of trade in used textbooks. The 
Follett's Canadian operations, for example, actually buy and export 
more textbooks from Canada than are later re-imported for resale 
across Canada. The export trade is very important. If we start 
playing around, blocking the incentives for re-importation, then we 
are going to create a major problem for the export industry, which 
is very large.
<P>
<B>(1510)</B>
<P>
	In 1995-96, for example, 42 per cent more textbooks were 
exported than re-imported. That is a major trade imbalance in 
Canada's favour. In 1995-96, 29 per cent of Canadian used 
textbooks which were exported and re-imported were actually 
Canadian material. As I mentioned a few minutes ago, if this bill is 
implemented, it will interfere with the re-importation of Canadian 
material. That will actually interfere with the trade which the bill is 
supposed to assist.
<P>
	The conclusion reached is that Canada is not being overrun by 
foreign used textbooks. In fact it is recycling its own used 
textbooks through export and re-importation.
<P>
	The figures of the Association of Students Association, which I 
mentioned earlier, suggest that the average student is spending 
about $4,800 on 10 courses per year. Universities and students will 
lose to the tune of at least $5.4 million each year as a result of the 
implementation of this bill.
<P>
	Students will lose about $2 million in revenue from the sale of 
their used textbooks, which are currently being recycled through 
the U.S. If the sale of imported used textbooks turns into new book 
sales, students will  end up paying an extra $3 million for the same 
textbooks they could have obtained through the recycling system.
<P>
	These figures come directly from the Ernst &amp; Young study. 
These are not figures which are being pulled out of the air. They 
come from legitimate studies done by very reliable sources.
<P>
	Canadian universities and colleges, through their bookstores, are 
estimated to lose at least $375,000 in gross profits and will face 
higher inventory costs and greater risks.
<P>
	These are very serious problems. As I pointed out earlier in the 
day when I was talking about my constituent who is a book 
wholesaler, representing a United States company, there will be 
major impacts on the free market with this system. At the moment 
the free market has adjusted itself to the point where there are 
really good values in books available directly through importation 
from the United States. When these additional layers of 
protectionism are introduced, which will supposedly protect 
Canadian culture, in fact it will interfere with the availability of 
books and cause problems with pricing at the consumer level, as 
indicated in the concerns raised by the students.
<P>
	This is a very ill-informed set of clauses. Frankly, they need 
attention. As has been indicated in a number of speeches made by 
my colleagues, the bill should be withdrawn. The best solution 
right now would be to withdraw the bill and take another look at it. 
We should start again from scratch and investigate whether we 
need to be using these sorts of tactics to try to protect Canadian 
culture when in fact we will be interfering with the consumer 
marketplace.
<P>
	I am pleased I had the opportunity to bring the concerns of the 
students' association to the attention of the House. I join with my 
colleagues in opposing the bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mauril Bélanger (Ottawa-Vanier, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
want to cover a few points which have been raised on used 
textbooks. Hon. members are shortchanging the ability of 
Canadians to take care of business.
<P>
	I refer to my experience a few years back when I was at the 
University of Ottawa. We had the problem of not being able to 
access used books. We set up our own used bookstore. Nothing in 
this bill prevents Canadians, be they students, be they 
entrepreneurs, be they book publishers, from doing that. Nothing 
prevents people from putting in place organizations and 
mechanisms to recycle books.
<P>
	To make the argument that somehow, some way, this bill would 
banish the recycling of textbooks is erroneous. I believe it is 
appropriate to highlight that point.
<P>
<B>(1515)</B>
<P>
	Be they campus driven books, used book stores, Canadian 
publishers and so forth, nothing in this  legislation will prevent that 
from happening. The intent of the legislation is to prohibit those 
who would circumvent the legislation from doing that by selling 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9027"> 9027 </A></B>
<P>
into Canada books which have not initially been sold according to 
exclusive distributorship agreements. That is what is intended and 
nothing else.
<P>
	I would hope that the members speaking to this point would 
understand that and not create a false sense of alarm.
<P>
	That is essentially what I wanted to point out on this particular 
amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to once again address Bill C-32 and in particular the issue 
that has been discussed over the last several speeches.
<P>
	I am concerned that not necessarily through malice but through 
neglect the government is placing an inordinate burden on young 
people today in many different respects. It is not limited to what we 
are discussing today. There seems to be a theme developing here.
<P>
	We have 17 per cent youth unemployment in the country today. 
We have a situation where the government has just announced that 
it is going to drive CPP premiums through the roof. It will be young 
people who bear the great burden of that. They will be paying more 
and more to get less and less. We have a situation where the 
government reneged on its promise on the GST on reading 
materials.
<P>
	I am going to mention it one more time for people who have not 
heard me raise this in the past. The government did promise before 
the last election to get rid of the GST on reading materials. It 
promised in policy conventions to do that. It has not happened, so 
students have to pay the GST on textbooks that they purchase.
<P>
	We have tuitions that have gone through the roof as a result of 
cuts to transfers to the provinces. The government has cut $7 
billion plus in transfers to the provinces. The result has been that 
tuitions have been raised for young people.
<P>
	I would point out that my party would reverse that trend by 
putting $4 billion back in.
<P>
	Now we have a situation where the government has snuck a 
clause into Bill C-42. In fact, it is a clause that a lot of its own 
members were not even aware of and there is a good reason for 
that. A lot of the changes that happened occurred this morning, so 
there was not adequate time for reflection on what was done. 
Nevertheless, it is in there. Now we have to contend with it. It is 
onerous. It is quite painful for students.
<P>
	As the member for Vancouver North has pointed out, students, 
young people, in addition to all the other burdens they have to face 
because of what the government has done or has failed to do, are 
now going to be in a situation where they cannot resell their  
textbooks. They cannot get the money back that they would like to 
get and will be paying $3 million in extra costs because they will 
not be able to purchase used textbooks.
<P>
	A $5 million hit for university and college students is 
unacceptable. The government has already nailed them on the GST. 
It has nailed them with tuition costs. It has nailed them with higher 
premiums on CPP. They have a 17 per cent youth unemployment 
rate. What does the government do? It turns around and gives it to 
them again. It is giving them one more shot.
<P>
	Let me say as forcefully as I can that the government should 
rethink this provision of Bill C-32. It is completely wrong for 
students today.
<P>
	A lot of my colleagues have talked about pages in this place. 
They work very hard both here and in university. Now they are 
going to be facing this additional burden. I would say that young 
people are our future. It is said by all political parties that we 
should cut them some slack, that we should find ways to make it 
easier for them, not hit them harder.
<P>
	I want to urge hon. members across the way, including the 
parliamentary secretary and all other people who have shown an 
interest in this bill, that the government should truly rethink this 
section of the bill. It has demonstrated in a way that really deserves 
our attention that perhaps in particular case it has not thought out 
the implications for all Canadians.
<P>
	That is unfortunate. This bill has been coming to the House for 
nine years. For nine years we have been dealing with this 
legislation. One would think that they would not have to force 
through pieces of legislation like this at the last moment with 
obviously little or no forethought. As a result young people are 
going to face very high prices.
<P>
<B>(1520)</B>
<P>
	I will conclude simply by saying that there have been a number 
of changes to the legislation which have penalized people who do 
not deserve to be penalized. Young people, in particular, seem to be 
picked on by the government.
<P>
	As I pointed out previously, we do have an extremely high 
unemployment rate for young people, 17 per cent as the national 
average. It is much higher in other places. We have seen the big 
CPP premium increases that will impact young Canadians and hurt 
them the most. The government reneged on its promise of 
removing the GST from reading materials, textbooks et cetera. 
They already pay a much higher price than they would have if the 
government had kept its promise.
<P>
	We have seen the cuts in the transfers that the government has 
enacted, driving up tuitions across the country. Now this amend-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9028"> 9028 </A></B>
<P>
ment which is part of Bill C-32  is going to cost students $5.4 
million more a year for books.
<P>
	I would urge all fair minded members of the House to vote 
against this amendment or, ultimately if it is not removed, to vote 
against Bill C-32.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Duncan (North Island-Powell River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, with regard to Motion No. 44, the Reform amendment to 
the bill deleting the section which would prevent textbooks of a 
scientific, technical or scholarly nature from use within an 
education institution in a course of instruction to be imported in the 
used book category.
<P>
	I did hear the intervention by the member for Ottawa-Vanier. I 
do not think it clarified anything. It certainly did not clarify 
anything to me. I find it to be a very cute clause that has the effect 
of preventing reimportation of Canadian textbooks.
<P>
	When there is a government that whispers the concerns of the 
three <I>r</I>s, reduce, reuse, recycle, this certainly flies in the face of 
that. I also listened to the intervention from the Bloc member, who 
seemed quite concerned that we would not support the bill as it is. 
The Bloc has also put forth amendments. This is part of the 
democratic process, so I think it is quite in order for us to be talking 
about these clauses.
<P>
	I listened closely to what the member for Prince George-Peace 
River had to say about used books. His intervention was very 
timely. I do know something about textbook publishing. My family 
has an educational background. My father has authored portions of 
textbooks. My brother is an academic and writes for internationally 
published journals. I know that the textbook industry is a very 
special industry. It is a very profitable industry and we all know 
that the setting of curriculum determines very often which 
textbooks are going to be used.
<P>
<B>(1525 )</B>
<P>
	There is a lot of attention paid by the publishers in trying to bring 
curriculum setters on board and influence decisions as to which 
textbooks become the preferred textbooks of the day and so on.
<P>
	I do not think we need to add another layer of exemption or 
special circumstance through this clause dealing with importation 
exemptions to this piece of business. I left university 25 years ago 
but during my time in that institution I certainly did use used 
textbooks. There was a thriving trade in used textbooks. Students, 
of all people, are very aware of the value from the day they 
purchase their books to the day they take them back and try to get 
reimbursement. They try very hard to keep the value up. A used 
book in good condition is obviously worth more than a used book 
in poor condition.
<P>
	I had many advantages when I went to university from the 
standpoint that I was able to work my way through. I  left 
university without indebtedness. That is very difficult to do these 
days. It is much more difficult for a student to obtain employment 
that will pay enough for them to pay all of their expenses for the 
year as well as for their education.
<P>
	Therefore I recognize that any advantage we can bring to the 
student body is important, particularly on this financial end. If we 
restrict the supply of used textbooks in any way, what that will do is 
drive up the price of the remaining used textbooks. That will hurt 
the pocketbooks of our students.
<P>
	I do not see anything redeeming about this clause. Our 
amendment would delete that exemption and I believe that is the 
way to go. The clause, as it currently reads, is counterproductive. 
The textbook publishing industry is already profitable.
<P>
	The environmental concerns, reducing, reusing, recycling, are 
met by any encouragement we can have to keep those textbooks 
reusable and in free flow position.
<P>
	Those are the points I wanted to make on that clause. I will be 
quite happy to speak to some further clauses when we arrive there.

	He said: Mr. Speaker, I would like to talk at this stage about the 
amendments in Group No. 5 for a very specific reason, which is 
that the collective societies are the issue, the focus of recognition in 
this bill.
<P>
	It was in 1988 that we recognized and expanded the collective 
societies. SOCAN is one that is particularly well known.
<P>
	When the bill was tabled, we immediately drew the 
government's attention to the exceptions in the bill, because it 
concerns the recognition of moral and economic copyright. The 
new bill-phase II of the modernization effort-provided for a 
great many  additional exceptions, including educational 
institutions, museums, libraries and archives, thereby seriously 
undermining the rights of authors and creators.
<P>
	We drew the government's attention to and criticized this aspect 
of the bill, which was very detrimental to creators in releasing 
some major sectors from the obligation to negotiate with authors 
and to recognize copyright, because everyone could now retrench 
and hide behind the law. What we said is that it promotes 
irresponsibility. They took away people's responsibility by inviting 
them to negotiate with authors or with the collective societies 
representing copyright holders.
<P>
	This morning, I said these exceptions were like a huge black 
cloud hanging over the bill. At this point I would like to mention 
what two groups, one group and one person in particular, who 
appeared before the committee had to say about what the 
exceptions meant for them. Quebec artists represented by their 
collective society came to tell us that it was truly a unacceptable 
step backward. Margaret Atwood, very well known in English 
Canada, described the exceptions as outright theft of copyright.
<P>
	Having heard the observations of collective societies and of 
artists, we put great effort into trying to present, first of all for us, 
for the Bloc Quebecois, an amendment to the effect that the 
exceptions not apply where there is a collective society.
<P>
	The government has really made progress in trying to reduce the 
number of exceptions, to keep them to a minimum, but their efforts 
notwithstanding, we are returning to the charge in the House today 
and calling on the government to listen to reason and to agree to 
full recognition of collective societies, to agree that where such 
societies have been set up, exceptions should not apply.
<P>
	With respect to exceptions, we think it important to point out, 
first, that they are the most negative aspect of the bill, although we 
have managed to reduce their impact, and second that allowing 
exceptions is expropriation of copyright. And this needs to be said.
<P>
	I call on the government to support the Bloc Quebecois 
amendments and recognize the usefulness of collective societies, 
which for a number of years now have truly done a good job. The 
Copyright Board recognizes that collective societies are doing a 
good job, that this approach, which is still in its early days, should 
be extended and, above all, should recognize the right of authors, 
creators and artists to negotiate their own works. Their own moral 
and economic rights must be recognized throughout the bill. I urge 
the government to support the Bloc Quebecois amendments.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
probably never recognized before the differences in the thought 
processes between the Bloc Quebecois and other members of the 
House.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois, with the greatest respect, seems to see 
collectives, no matter which area of society we are talking about, as 
being the answer. It makes me think of some of the stories we see in 
the English news media of the language police in Quebec. The 
concept of language police outside the province of Quebec is so far 
from the minds of people outside Quebec that we cannot even get 
our minds around it. Perhaps it is an indicator of a different 
background, a different approach to living together that the Bloc 
Quebecois and the Parti Quebecois are actually exhibiting.
<P>
	This is an attempt by the Bloc Quebecois to create more teeth for 
collectives. It does not take into account the reality that there is 
presently a difference in terms of collectives among artists, 
composers and authors in Quebec, how they have banded together, 
versus artists, composers and authors in other provinces.
<P>
	I recognize the member's motivation. He has clearly stated it. He 
sees collectives as being the cornerstone of enforcement for the 
bill.
<P>
	There are a lot of things that businesses are finding very onerous 
in terms of continued government infringement through 
regulations and inspectors among other things. The other day a 
person from an asphalt and concrete plant was telling me he had 35 
different inspections and fees. If we consider the area we are 
discussing, which is more in the area of people who are using the 
creations of various people, we see inspectors coming in, more and 
more paperwork, and more and more big brotherism.
<P>
	The purpose of the copyright bill is to create a situation where 
the authors and composers of work are properly compensated for 
their intellectual and creative property. There is a place for 
organizations such as SOCAN. There are successful collectives 
that have worked their way into a good working relationship with 
the users of the works of the people they represent.
<P>
	However, this is a further encroachment into business and the 
people who want to enjoy these works. It is another regulation and 
another level of bureaucracy, albeit not directly a government level 
of bureaucracy. It is something I have an unbelievable amount of 
difficulty with.
<P>
	I happen to disagree most profoundly with the presentation made 
by Margaret Atwood at our committee hearings. I would like to 
parenthesize for a second.
<P>
	Speaking of exceptions, I took some exception to the notion put 
forward by the Bloc heritage critic that the  heritage critic for the 
Reform Party, namely myself, had not participated in the hearings 
and in the committee process. The reason I took exception was that 
I have a totally different recollection of the process. I recall that he 
and I, while we were coming at these things from different points 
of view very frequently, nonetheless are part of a functioning 
committee where it was the Bloc, it was Reform or it was the 
Liberal members and we were working together and indeed we did 
spend many countless hours together listening to input from 
people.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	I think it is unfortunate that because I visualized the rapid fire 
conclusion of the committee process that was forced by the 
minister of heritage, and I would not dignify that process because it 
was a process out of control, I find it really unfortunate that the 
Bloc member would suggest that Reform had not been part of the 
process in any event.
<P>
	The point I am trying to drive at with respect to this proposed 
amendment to Bill C-32 in the simplest possible terms is this. We 
must have the ability to create within copyright law a proper 
balance, truly a balance, a balance between people who are 
contributing to our society by their creative genius and the people 
who enjoy those works or the people who indeed are using those 
works such as people who are using them for commercial purposes. 
This is all part of what the heritage committee even now is talking 
about doing in terms of the definition of Canadian culture.
<P>
	To my mind the simplest definition of Canadian culture is what 
Canadians do, just those three words. What Canadians do to my 
mind is the simplest, most profound definition of what Canadian 
culture is. Canadians have access to architecture, to writings, to 
music, to all sorts of things that are created by their fellow 
Canadians and they form part of Canadian culture and those 
creations, whatever they may be, are part of the intrinsic value of 
who we are as Canadians and what our nation truly represents.
<P>
	By so doing the interesting problem that is created is that when 
those creations, whatever they may be, get out into the public 
domain, they become a legitimate part of the public domain. We 
have to have a balance between the people we will call the 
consumers of those creations versus the artists who create those 
works, whatever they may be.
<P>
	By the insertion of a heavy handed and dare I say a police like 
attitude toward policing the Copyright Act, in particular now that 
the Copyright Act has gone to such a gross imbalance in favour of 
the artists, authors and composers, by creating even more teeth in a 
very heavy handed collective way, I fear that we are going to end 
up killing the goose that is creating the golden egg. Truly it is the 
creativity and the greatness of Canadian artists that we are here to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9031"> 9031 </A></B>
<P>
try to balance, what they are creating  against those who want to use 
that work that is in the public domain.
<P>
	Therefore I say in conclusion that there is no possible way that I 
would see myself recommending to the Reform Party that we 
support these clauses proposed by the member from the Bloc.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Guy H. Arseneault (Parliamentary Secretary to Deputy 
Prime Minister and Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to rise to debate Group No. 5 of the 
amendments. There are three amendments here, Motions Nos. 7, 54 
and 57.
<P>
	Bill C-32 introduces a number of exceptions to facilitate access 
and reduce costs for the benefit of public institutions and persons 
suffering from perceptual disabilities.
<P>
<B>(1550 )</B>
<P>
	To ensure access for certain types of users of copyright 
materials, the Copyright Act recognizes certain exceptions for 
reasons of public interest. The exceptions contained in Bill C-32 
respond to the real concerns from certain types of users and, in 
some cases, the bill stipulates that certain exceptions do not apply 
where there exists a collective which can negotiate a blanket 
licence for the use of those works.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois has tabled amendments which would extend 
this principle to all exceptions. This, in the government's view, 
would nullify the very exceptions the government has been 
promising to reintroduce over the past nine years. The government 
believes that the collective management of rights is a cost effective 
and efficient means of enhancing access to works.
<P>
	The government will therefore continue to encourage the 
collective management of rights but in certain circumstances, such 
as those that are described in the bill, the government believes that 
exceptions are required.
<P>
	With this group of amendments, I think we have to be very 
straightforward with regard to the tactics that are being used in this 
House today to debate certain groups. I am going to give an 
example. Here we have Group No. 5, Motions Nos. 7, 54 and 57. 
The Bloc Quebecois is in favour of these motions and want them 
passed. The Reform critic for Canadian heritage has stood up and 
said they are not ready to support that. The parliamentary secretary 
for Canadian heritage is standing in his place now saying that we 
are not ready to support it either.
<P>
	There are some very serious debates that have to be done on Bill 
C-32, debates that members want to hear, the ephemeral transfer 
format. Unfortunately they only occur in Group No. 7. It is a very 
long list of amendments. I am anxious to hear what members have 
to say about those amendments because I think they go a long way 
in satisfying the Reform Party and our critics with regard to when 
the bill was first tabled in the House.  That was the biggest concern 
we heard from the Reform Party with regard to ephemeral transfer 
format.
<P>
	We heard other concerns from the Bloc with regard to the 
creator's side, so we tried to strike a balance. At this point I see no 
need for Reform members to reiterate over and over again that they 
are against these three and for government members to reiterate 
over and over that they are against them. I think we should let Bloc 
Quebecois members explain again why they are in agreement and 
convince us that they want to go with this. I would certainly be 
ready to put the question now.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is too bad 
some members are not paying attention. When you recognize 
somebody on debate why are they asking for the question?
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary has pointed out that we are debating 
Group No. 5, Motions Nos. 7, 54 and 57. He has also insisted that 
anybody who does stand up and debate should not go off on a 
tangent and should not elaborate on anything else. They should 
stick to the issue.
<P>
	Now all of a sudden they are applying the narrowest sense of the 
terms and rules of this House which, up until now, certainly a lot of 
members and the Speakers who have monitored the debate have 
given a lot of discretionary variance to for members to bring up any 
particular issue on these amendments that we are debating.
<P>
	What concerns me is that we have a process and a system in the 
House of Commons whereby we have three stages to a bill and after 
second reading it goes to committee. It can go to committee after 
first reading for debate and discussion. Going through the fine print 
is the responsibility of standing committees. It is their 
responsibility to try to improve and point out flaws in bills and to 
make sure that the interpretation of all members and all parties is 
the same so that when the bill becomes law Canadian citizens can 
understand it.
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	When people look at an issue, when they want to know what the 
law is, what they can or cannot do, they can pick up a bill, for 
example Bill C-32, go to this page, which is being amended with 
these three motions, read it and understand it.
<P>
	I am not a lawyer. Maybe I should be. I will bet a dollar to a 
doughnut that if we took this bill and some of these amendments 
with the language being used to lawyers out there who are going to 
be hired to interpret the copyright act, to interpret who has to pay 
and who does not have to pay, to interpret collective agencies, who 
qualifies and who does not, what they can charge for and what they 
cannot charge for, there will be a difference of opinion out there. 
They will not understand the wording.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9032"> 9032 </A></B>
<P>
	It is amazing to me that we try to introduce bills that are very 
complicated. Instead of using fewer words, being clear and 
concise, they carry a lot of baggage.
<P>
	I have given this preamble for a purpose. I had a fight about 
seven or eight years ago with the people of SOCAN. There was 
another one. It was called PROCAN. We had two collectives 
coming after my butt for running a nightclub in Calgary, playing 
music and having live entertainment. These people professed that 
they had the right to charge me money because I was playing 
music.
<P>
	I said that makes sense. I guess it is performing arts and I have to 
pay it. I looked into it. The reason I bring up this story up is for a 
better understanding of why I would be voting against the Bloc 
member's amendments on this bill. The more collective agencies 
there are, the more people who claim they have the power to 
protect the rights of the originators of copyright information or 
copyright material, the more confusion there is.
<P>
	When I had my nightclub, they came to me and said ``here are 
the fees''. They had a list of the artists and entertainers. Because I 
was playing this type of music, because my establishment had a 
certain number of seats and a certain amount of square footage, the 
fee was <I>x</I>.
<P>
	I wondered what right they had to do that. I questioned their right 
to do that and what law forced me to do that. After all, if I had a live 
performer in my club, I paid them perhaps $5,000 a night. I paid 
good salaries because we only brought in the best entertainers.
<P>
	Mr. Ian Tyson was a favourite of mine. We had him in our club 
quite often. I paid this fee to the artist. Then I questioned why, on 
top of that, I had to pay a performing arts fee to SOCAN and 
PROCAN.
<P>
	When I buy an album or a tape, we are all paying the fee for the 
artist. The artist makes money from live performances, records, 
tapes and videos that are put together. Members may argue that 
they might not get enough of a percentage from it but they have 
agents who negotiate that.
<P>
	Certainly someone like Garth Brooks makes a heck of a lot more 
now than he did when he first started. Yes, it was an opportunity for 
me at one time in my club to book him for $5,000 a week. Now he 
is getting $150,000 an hour or more, who knows what he is paid 
now.
<P>
	These collective agencies then come forward and say ``because 
you are playing this kind of music, on top of what these people 
make, we have to collect more money from you because you are 
repeating it''. Radio stations play their music. They have to pay.
<P>
	Then along comes another association called PROCAN, another 
collective agency. The Bloc is recommending we create more. It 
says to me ``you have to pay because you are playing this kind of 
music, these people originated from the States, it is a bit of a 
crossover''.
<P>
	I said ``I am not paying. I am already obligated. Some other 
association said I had to pay it. Before I pay anybody, I want to see 
the lists of the artists you represent''. I made both of them bring me 
the list. I had a file so thick of all the different artists and all the 
different venues they represented. When I cross referenced it with 
the other list, lo and behold some names of artists were on the two 
separate lists. I asked how they could be charging me double. 
Either one had them or the other had them. I raised quite a fuss and 
I refused to pay both of them until they got it clear who represented 
which artists.
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	That lasted for a year and a half. I was able to get my back up and 
directly fight the system. Through that I may have been one of the 
people in Calgary, Edmonton, Winnipeg and Vancouver who forced 
these people to get their act together and create just the one.
<P>
	My point to the Bloc member is that the fewer collective 
agencies there are the better, and the clearer it is who you have to 
pay for the rights to use somebody's music or work. I agree with 
the principle that a fee should be paid for that since after all artists 
are at the low end of the totem pole and they get the least. I 
understand that principle and I would certainly support making 
sure they get some money.
<P>
	Let us not go overboard. In the process of trying to protect these 
artists, performers and professional entertainers there are all these 
fat middle people called agents, producers and everybody else who 
take the cream off the top. The tougher you make it for the person 
who tries to hire these people to perform on a stage in theatre, the 
more expensive they are.
<P>
	One of the reasons the philharmonics across the country are in 
trouble-they raise some money but it is hard to raise money and 
hard to pay them-is because the performers are asking too much. 
You can bankrupt the system. If we go overboard with this 
copyright bill by having too many collective agencies, which will 
confuse the general public that uses the copyright material, we will 
be in trouble.
<P>
	The point in my intervention on these motions is to argue why it 
is not wise to have a number of collective agencies. They become 
like tax collectors. Lord knows we have enough tax collectors in 
this country and we pay enough taxes already. The point is that yes, 
we are interested in protecting the creators of original material and 
yes, we are interested in protecting intellectual property. Those 
people should be rewarded for their efforts, especially if they have 
talent and if they create a reusable product.
<P>
	I do not know all aspects of this bill. I was not on the standing 
committee when it was debated clause by clause, but I hope that 
somewhere along the line the members of the committee and the 
parliamentary secretary  recognize that there are a lot of people 
involved here and everybody has his or her hand out. I hope we are 
able to tackle the layer of fat of the different people who want a 
bunch of money before the people who should get it get their fair 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9033"> 9033 </A></B>
<P>
share. By going too far in protecting artists are we satisfied and 
clear in our mind? Do members of all parties have an 
understanding before this bill gets passed that we are not just 
padding the pockets of the producers, the agents and all these other 
people rather than the artists?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as 
we go through these groupings today it is interesting to try to work 
back and forth between the groupings from the Order Paper that 
were dumped on us this morning, the bill we have in front of us and 
the comments.
<P>
	As the parliamentary secretary pointed out, it is unfortunate that 
this part of the debate does not lend itself to questions and answers. 
Maybe a guy could support some of this stuff more willingly if he 
could ask a couple of questions about it at this stage. It is a very 
lengthy amendment and it is difficult to try to figure out.
<P>
<B>(1605 )</B>
<P>
	I wonder if there would be unanimous consent to ask for 
questions and answers to be part of this debate so that we could ask 
the hon. member from the Bloc whether that was-
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is there unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Arseneault:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I turn the floor over to Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Minister of Canadian Heritage on a point of order.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Arseneault:</B> Mr. Speaker, a point of order. We were quite 
co-operative this morning on the last request by the Reform Party 
for unanimous consent. But as soon as they got unanimous consent 
then they started playing tricks with the rules. They wanted to 
adjourn the debate. I do not know how sincere they really are about 
this. I would have to say no under the circumstances.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> That would appear to resolve the issue.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Mr. Speaker, a couple of things the parliamentary 
secretary mentioned in his remarks on this motion I thought were 
proper. He mentioned the idea of public interest exceptions and to 
have certainty whenever possible in these clauses and take most of 
the arbitrariness out of it. In government bills generally it is a very 
wise move.
<P>
	For example, in this amendment it states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Notwithstanding section 77, where the act for which a licence is being sought is 
administered by a collective society referred to in section 70.1.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a) the application shall be made to the collective society;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(b) the collective society shall determine whether the conditions set out in 
subsection 77(1) have been met;</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Is that the proper way to do it? Is the collective society that is 
making the application the one determining whether the terms and 
conditions have been met? That is not normally done. It 
collectively can make its application but it is not the one that 
determine whether everything has been met. It would be an outside 
body or an outside arbitrator. I am not sure exactly what is meant 
by that because it seems to me it is a self-fulfilling prophecy in a 
sense. I am not sure that is a wise way to term it. However, again 
we cannot debate that. I just raise it as a concern.
<P>
	I also want to point out that although the parliamentary secretary 
is interested in certainty in the bill, there is a trend in a lot of 
government bills to move away from certainty and toward 
decisions made outside parliamentary consent, this clause 
notwithstanding.
<P>
	In bills that state ``that regulations may be referred to a standing 
committee for examination''-not will, but may. Parliament may 
examine this at a certain interval, not that it will or it shall.
<P>
	I agree with the parliamentary secretary. These should be 
exceptions and not the rule. Increasingly in the legislation before us 
we find that power is taken away from Parliament and given to the 
front benches. When we talk about changes, whether it is 
regulatory changes on gun control, or at the discretion of the 
minister under the new wheat board bill, that directors of the wheat 
board shall not be liable to prosecution for Criminal Code 
violations at the discretion of the crown. That is too much power to 
leave with the government. It should be left with Parliament or at 
the very least with a committee, some public forum where at least 
questions could be asked.
<P>
	However, in this group of amendments, 7, 54 and 57, because of 
the inability to cross-examine, I would have to agree with the 
member for Kootenay East. It is impossible to agree with these 
given that I am not convinced the intent is obvious. As the 
parliamentary secretary has mentioned, it introduces the 
uncertainty that a bill should not have and that we should move 
away from that whenever possible.
<P>
	Lo and behold, I am going to agree with the Liberal government 
on this point. We will be opposing this amendment. I will oppose 
the bill too. I am sorry I cannot cross-examine the Bloc member. 
Perhaps he has answers to some of my questions.

<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
government has proposed a very interesting change in MotionNo. 13. It certainly is a massive improvement over what was 
contained in the proposed legislation and the legislation coming 
out of committee.
<P>
	Of all the people who contacted my office-and perhaps this is 
true of the Liberal and Bloc offices-the people who were the most 
concerned about the copyright legislation, believe it or not, were 
not the people who were concerned about the collectives and not 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9035"> 9035 </A></B>
<P>
the people who were concerned about the money aspects of 
neighbouring rights and so on. The greatest outcry of  concern 
seemed to come from the people who were concerned about access 
to geneology.
<P>
	We do not want to beat the issue to death. The reality is that only 
this morning we received a number of these motions, this one 
included. We have not had an opportunity to seriously digest what 
the government is attempting to achieve.
<P>
	I give the government at least a passing grade in that it has made 
a very significant improvement to the legislation as proposed. For 
the reason that we created our own proposed amendment, Motion 
No. 15, we feel very comfortable with it. We think it would achieve 
what the people concerned about these issues, the archivists and the 
genealogists, want to achieve.
<P>
	As we said before, though, in the arduous process we have been 
through we have heard from a lot of people and there has been a lot 
of discussion. I do not know if the parliamentary secretary would 
agree with me, but this is a relatively substantive amendment. It is 
a major clarification of what was contained in the proposed 
legislation. It begs the question, if that is the case, as to why we did 
not have something of this nature prior to this point.
<P>
	Clearly we have a badly flawed process and a badly flawed bill, 
particularly in light of the fact there was so much concern on the 
part of genealogists and people concerned about the issue who were 
coming into the offices of all members involved in Bill C-32.
<P>
	The whole issue of following geneology, following family trees 
and recording history, is something that has come into focus but not 
into vogue. I do not want to say vogue because that sounds stylish. 
It certainly has come into focus for a lot of people around the 
world.
<P>
	Last summer when I was in England I had the good fortune of 
tracing my father's heritage. I tried to get my hands on documents 
over there. I looked through the various databanks. It was 
personally rewarding. To that extent I understand people who are 
keen on the idea of geneology.
<P>
	To be very precise, our amendment to the proposed legislation 
states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The archive may make a copy of an unpublished work that was deposited in the 
archive before coming into force of this section unless the author of the work advises 
the archive in writing that the work is not to be copied-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I am not a lawyer but as the legislation was explained it was to 
create a situation where there would be a bank of information that 
would simply not be available to people for 50 or 60 years.
<P>
	We want to make sure there is not an undue infringement of 
copyright of people's writings. On the other side of the coin there 
must be structured access to any legitimate request for copies for 
information purposes of the archive and for purposes of geneology.
<P>
	It continues:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-except where the archive receives written notification from the author that the 
author has given permission to the person for whom the copy is to be made to 
obtain the copy, in which case the archive may not make a copy of the work 
unless it receives such a notification.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1620 )</B>
<P>
	People were explaining to me that there would be a problem 
because many people do this as a hobby. As a result it is not 
revenue producing. As a matter of fact it is probably revenue 
spender.
<P>
	The ability to be able to transmit information, either by E-mail 
or by fax, and the ability to make a photocopy of that information, 
place it into a fax machine or scan it into a computer, is a very 
important issue. I am not sure it will be handled with the same 
liberalism in Motion No. 13.
<P>
	It will be interesting over the next period of time to see the input 
we will receive from the people who are concerned about these 
issues, assuming that the government will force through Motion 
No. 13 and not vote in favour of our Motion No. 15.
<P>
	This speaks to the whole issue of the availability of information 
to concerned people. It speaks to the whole issue that the Reform 
Party has been attempting to drive home all day, that we must have 
a balance between the people who have a legitimate use for control 
of their creation and the people who want to have access to that 
information.
<P>
	It would have been most helpful if the government had not at the 
11th hour-as a matter of fact it was past midnight-come forward 
with the amendment. That really is an unfortunate part of the 
process. If the government motion had been out in the public 
domain and if we could have received responses from people who 
are concerned about the issues of geneology and the retrieval of 
archival information, we would have been able to vote with more 
intelligence on the government motion. We would have been able 
to decide whether it would do the job.
<P>
	As a consequence, it would be my recommendation to my 
colleagues in the Reform Party that we vote in favour of Motion 
No. 15. We have crafted that motion with the help of legal services. 
We believe it will achieve the objective we want to achieve.
<P>
	Unless there is some time between the debate, now that this is 
out in the public domain, and the opportunity for concerned people 
to have their say on the issue, we will be inclined to vote against the 
government amendment. We will be very happy to change our 
position if the people concerned about these things have an 
opportunity to give us their input.
<P>
	We have said this again and again all day and probably on the 
next group of motions I will be saying it again. This is a process 
which is designed to protect the creators  of work, whoever those 
creators are and whatever their work may be. It will give them 
protection. At the same time it will give people the freedom to use 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9036"> 9036 </A></B>
<P>
it so they will be encouraged to generate more work. That is really 
what the bill is about.
<P>
	Because of that, although this is a partisan House and many parts 
of this debate are partisan, the bill should be non-partisan. It should 
reflect the values of all Canadians in a very technical way. It is not 
an emotional issue like many of the hot button issues we get into in 
the House. We are trying to create a balance.
<P>
	I hope the government will do its part. We will do our part to 
distribute the government's wording. We will elicit input from 
people concerned about these issues so we can vote intelligently 
when the time comes to vote on these motions.

	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Just before I recognize the hon. member 
on his point of order, it is my duty pursuant to Standing Order 38 to 
inform the House that the question to be raised tonight at the time 
of adjournment is: the hon. member for The 
Battlefords-Meadowlake-Railways.

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="TIMEALLOCATIONMOTION">TIME ALLOCATION MOTION</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise on a point of order regarding a motion moved this morning by 
the Minister of Labour. I refer to Beauchesne's sixth edition, 
citation 318(2), which is based on a ruling of July 14, 1977. It 
states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A Member cannot rise on a point of order to move a motion-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	If you will review the video and the audio tapes you will note, 
Mr. Speaker, that the Minister of Labour clearly called out point of 
order and the Speaker clearly recognized him on a point of order. 
While on that point of order the minister moved a time allocation 
motion on Bill C-66.
<P>
	For a more recent ruling on this matter, I refer to a Speaker's 
ruling of November 20, 1996 at page 6503 of <I>Hansard</I>. The 
Speaker then ruled that there is only one kind of motion which can 
be moved on a point of order. He said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In fact, there is only one motion that can be made on a point of order and that is 
the motion that was made by the member for St. Albert.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The motion that the member for St. Albert moved was:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the member for Medicine Hat be now heard.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That being the only motion that can be moved on a point of 
order, the minister's motion for time allocation cannot be accepted 
because he violated the rules of the House. These rules must be 
followed to the letter because  they are the only protection that the 
minority in the House has against the tyranny of the majority.
<P>
	The minister was clearly out of order in moving his motion to cut 
off debate on Bill C-66 and I ask that you rule on this point of order, 
Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. colleague was kind enough to 
give me notice of this point of order. I have been attempting to get 
the blues with respect to the points he just made.
<P>
	I am told by persons who were here this morning that the 
member is absolutely right that the words point of order were used 
by the Minister of Labour when he stood and moved closure. The 
member's point is one I raised earlier as a member.
<P>
	I am also led to believe, unless somebody can correct me, that 
the matter has been voted upon. Any member is obliged to raise 
that point at the earliest possible opportunity. Since the precise 
point about using the words point of order was not raised at the 
time, the matter has now been disposed of by a vote in the House.
<P>
	It is not as we say in Latin void ab initio, which means that it 
goes back like in a bigamist marriage and the matter becomes 
defective because you were married at the time of the second 
marriage. The matter was cleansed, if I can used that word, by the 
fact that nobody objected at the time the vote was held and the 
matter proceeded.
<P>
	I should hear from any other member wishing to speak on that 
point.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, not 
within the minute but within minutes the member for Lethbridge 
came in and addressed the Chair. He tried to correct that at the 
earliest possible moment. It was not in the crush of the yeas, the 
nays, the deferred vote and so on. It was, however, done at the 
earliest possible minute.
<P>
	As you know, Mr. Speaker, it takes a minute or two to get 
Beauchesne's out and crack open the section. Maybe some do but I 
certainly do not have it memorized. It takes at least a minute or two 
in order to get that book open and find the reference. It was brought 
to the attention of the Chair but it was not really dealt with or 
addressed as much as you have addressed it here.
<P>
	I wonder, Mr. Speaker, if you would reconsider in light of the 
fact that after it was raised the Speaker ruled on the acceptability of 
when the motion was moved. Perhaps the point was not clear at the 
time because our complaint was not when the motion was moved 
but how the motion was moved. In other words, it was during 
Government Orders but it was on a point of order, not to rise in his 
place. There is a significant difference.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="9037"> 9037 </A></B>
<P>
	The timing was fine. I do not have a problem with the timing. 
The problem was how the minister rose to his feet and how he 
brought that motion forward. He brought it forward in a clearly 
inappropriate manner.
<P>
<B>(1630 )</B>
<P>
	The Chair initially ruled on the when, not the how. It is the how 
that was the problem. The inappropriateness was really what the 
member for Lethbridge was trying to get out of the Chair at the 
time. We did bring that up at the earliest possible moment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Arseneault:</B> Mr. Speaker, I was in the Chamber at the time 
of the motion this morning. The Speaker was seized with it this 
morning. She consulted with the clerk and she made a ruling. There 
was another point of order this afternoon. You have since made a 
ruling. Mr. Speaker, with all due respect I would say to you that the 
matter is closed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be very brief. The reason for the 
delay on the part of the Reform Party is that we also had to review 
the tape.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I listened to the hon. member for Fraser 
Valley East. Although I was not here, I believe the question that 
was raised concerned at which time the motion was being moved, 
whether it was under Government Orders or under motions. That 
matter was ruled on by the Speaker.
<P>
	The question of the fact that the minister had apparently used the 
words point of order was not dealt with at that time, and 
accordingly it is too late now to raise those words as words that 
somehow obviated what had gone on at the time.
<P>
	Therefore I have to move on. I realize the House is not sitting 
tomorrow so I do not think I should reserve on that matter.

	The House resumed consideration of Bill C-32, act to amend the 
Copyright Act, as reported (with amendments) from the 
committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Duncan (North Island-Powell River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I wish to support the amending of clause 18 of Bill C-32 
by replacing lines 15 to 22 on page 37. Our replacement reads that:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The archive may make a copy of an unpublished work that was deposited in the 
archive before the coming into force of this section unless the author of the work 
advises the archive in writing that the work is not to be copied except where the archive 
receives written notification from the author that the author has given permission to the 
person for whom the copy is  to be made to obtain the copy, in which case the archive 
may not make a copy of the work unless it receives such a notification.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Many members on this committee have toiled with improving 
this massive document which deals with amendments to the 
Copyright Act. They must all know that deficiencies and 
imbalances still exist within this document, not the least of which 
is the section dealing with archives. As it stands now the bill is 
unrealistic and unreflective of the input and representation to the 
contrary that came before the committee.
<P>
	I have received numerous representations on this element of the 
bill. One of my constituents who is a genealogist/archivist made a 
written submission to the committee on this restrictive section,Ms. Judy Norberg of Campbell River, British Columbia. Her 
representation characterized the issues of accessibility and freedom 
of information in Bill C-32 as truly regressive and a definite step 
backward for the work of genealogists. Without the right to 
photocopy unpublished documents the hands of thousands of 
students, historians and genealogists will be effectively tied.
<P>
	The amendment before us unties this restrictive section and is 
reflective of conscious and realistic thought on behalf of that sector 
of the population that requires access to unpublished information.
<P>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
	As it stands now, those individuals who help all Canadians to 
better understand their history, their origins, their background, 
those people chronicling our history are at a severe disadvantage if 
the bill sits the way it is right now.
<P>
	It is not possible for everyone to take advantage, for example, of 
in person viewing at an archival facility. We are all at a deficient 
position if this amendment before us is not supported by the House.
<P>
	During committee some amendments were adopted that will 
benefit archivists and genealogists. Archivists are now allowed to 
make a copy of an unpublished work for research or private study 
under specified conditions.
<P>
	These conditions differ according to date of deposit and the date 
of the author's death. For example, copies would be made of 
archival material deposited when the bill is proclaimed in force and 
whose author had died over 50 years previous to proclamation date. 
These dates, however, are overly onerous. There are some things 
that could be fixed there.
<P>
	Reform feels further refinement and amendment is sought by 
archivists and genealogists to better reflect their need for better 
access and authorization to use certain documents which would 
really be of no consequence to the rest of the world.
<P>
	It is not like this would somehow infringe on other people. It is a 
productive, constructive arrangement. In our view, it is not an 
infringement of copyright for either  an archivist or a person acting 
under the authority of an archive to make copies for research or 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9038"> 9038 </A></B>
<P>
private study of a work that is contained in an unpublished forum. 
However, the bill without this amendment would prevent this.
<P>
	There is currently a fair use provision for published works. 
Access to non-published works is essential for archivists and 
genealogists in their research of family historical records for 
example.
<P>
	The bill originally created tremendous restrictions for archivists, 
historians and genealogists. Amendments have improved the 
original bill but the conditions of the current bill still leave these 
researchers concerned because they would not have unfettered 
access to archival material such as is provided in jurisdictions 
outside Canada.
<P>
	While some of the improvements have been made to the bill, it is 
essential to not hamstring archivists for making a copy of an 
unpublished work that was deposited into the archive before the 
coming into force of clause 6, unless the author of the work advises 
the archive it is not to be copied.
<P>
	The amendment we are putting forth also states where the 
archive receives written notification from the author that the author 
has given permission to the person for whom the copy is to be made 
to obtain the copy, in which case, the archivist may not make a 
copy of the work unless it receives such a notification.
<P>
	Genealogists are concerned that genealogists and family history 
researchers have uninhibited access to study, extract and copy 
archival material whether published or unpublished as part of their 
research efforts.
<P>
	They have a concern that this bill places severe limits on rights 
of reproduction which would have the effect of depriving major 
sections of the population of this country access to the information 
required to learn about their Canadian backgrounds and thus inhibit 
the chronicling of our nation's history.
<P>
<B>(1640 )</B>
<P>
	I feel that this amendment ensures that archivists and 
genealogists are allowed to practice their profession or hobby. It is 
not threatening intellectual property. It also ensures that all 
Canadians will benefit from a better understanding of our roots, 
heritage and history. I would urge all my colleagues to move 
forthwith and support this amendment.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Arseneault:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order, I think the 
agreement was a mover and seconder were named. I thought that 
was the agreement this morning and I do not see that in the House 
at the present time.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The Chair was not aware of that. The fact 
is we are not supposed to mention the fact that members are not in 
the House. It therefore seems to be doing no violence to anybody to 
ask a colleague to be a seconder.
<P>
	It seems that is not acceptable.
<P>
	I have the blues from this morning, thanks to our most efficient 
table. The member for Fraser Valley East said we had an 
unfortunate situation with a very ill member who is not able to 
attend the House today for the debate. He wondered if there would 
be unanimous consent of the House for the motions presented in the 
name of the member for Edmonton-Strathcona to be tabled by the 
member for Kootenay East, the Reform critic in the area and 
leading the debate for that party. He then asked if there would be 
unanimous consent for those motions to have been deemed moved 
and seconded.
<P>
	I gather there was unanimous consent.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	The fact is the deemed mover is here.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> The deemed seconder is not.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> That is exactly the point. The part I read 
from the blues would not seem to indicate that the matter was clear. 
I think it is common ground here that the mover is the important 
one, the seconder is not.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> No, no.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I will hear representations on this matter.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a 
point of order. As you read out from the blues it is quite clear to me 
that our whip asked for unanimous consent. Since our member who 
put forward that motion is gravely ill we asked that our critic for 
the area be the mover and that it be deemed to be carried.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, the word ``deemed'' is in there if you want to reread 
that for the minister of heritage and the parliamentary secretary 
because those are the two who are objecting to this. Maybe they 
will see that your interpretation is the correct one and that the 
seconder is deemed and therefore the motion should move forward 
and not be objected to by the government as is the case.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Perhaps the parliamentary secretary 
could shed some more light on this, but as I have indicated the 
word ``deemed'' is very clearly in the blues. This Chair was not 
here this morning. I assume the parliamentary secretary was and 
perhaps he can add some light on this.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Guy H. Arseneault (Parliamentary Secretary to Deputy 
Prime Minister and Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, with all due respect there was a request this morning for 
unanimous consent to have the mover and a seconder and we 
agreed to it.
<P>
	I think there should have been a request if the hon. member was 
not here to second it. We would have been glad to allow someone 
else to second the motion. We will go along with that. We would go 
along with allowing someone else to second the motion.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The member for Fraser Valley East is 
now here.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise on a point of order. I tabled earlier today with the table the 
request in which I did say at that time that the motions would be 
deemed moved and seconded. I put forward that they would be 
deemed moved and seconded and that is what we asked unanimous 
consent for.

	She said: Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to 
share with the House the reasons I am introducing amendments to 
Bill C-32. I appreciate the consideration that members will give the 
amendments and I am asking for the support of the House as I 
believe the amendments address a number of concerns expressed to 
me by local radio stations across Canada and, in particular, the 
radio station situated in Guelph-Wellington, CJOY-AM and 
MAGIC-FM.
<P>
	I want to say from the start that I understand, appreciate and 
support the need for Canadian artists to be compensated for their 
work. We should all recognize their contribution. They deserve our 
encouragement.
<P>
	Canadians are rightfully proud of their artists. We must 
recognize the artistic contribution of performers and sound 
recording producers.
<P>
	This is an issue in which I have been involved for quite some 
time. I had the privilege of participating in the national Liberal 
caucus subcommittee on neighbouring rights, chaired by the hon. 
member for Essex-Kent. I  have met in Kitchener with 
representatives of the broadcast industry and I hosted a meeting of 
the national Liberal caucus committee on economic development, 
which I chair, on April 17, 1996.
<P>
	I represent the very proud community of Guelph-Wellington. 
Like many smaller communities, Guelph is served by a local radio 
station, a daily newspaper, the Guelph <I>Mercury</I>, weekly and 
bi-weekly newspapers like the Guelph <I>Tribune</I>, the Erin <I>Advocate</I> 
and the Wellington <I>Advertiser</I>, and a local cable company affiliate, 
Rogers, which has increased its coverage of local events.
<P>
	We can and do listen to radio from Toronto, London or even parts 
of the United States, but we rely on our local AM and FM radio 
stations for weather, sports, entertainment and news which affects 
us locally.
<P>
	I know, for example, that my family listens to CJOY or MAGIC 
to hear whether the school buses will be late in the event of a 
snowstorm. This is an important service which cannot be replaced 
should our radio station cease to operate. I can personally attest to 
the importance of this medium when I, as a member of Parliament, 
need to get a message across to my constituents.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance recently visited Guelph. He was able to 
participate in a call-in show with my constituents because a radio 
station exists in my community. I am certain that most, if not all, 
members of Parliament know the value of a local radio station in 
their own communities.
<P>
	Our radio station is a vital part of Guelph-Wellington. CJOY 
went on the air in 1948. That means it will be celebrating its 50th 
anniversary next year. CJOY and MAGIC not only broadcast 
music, news and weather, they participate in the life of 
Guelph-Wellington. The station provides airtime for the Guelph 
Little Theatre and for productions at War Memorial Hall at the 
University of Guelph. It has promoted the new Guelph Performing 
Arts Centre. It provides scholarships for the annual Kiwanis music 
festival.
<P>
	There is no doubt that my community and hundreds like it would 
be lessened should they lose their radio stations.
<P>
	This brings me to my concern. Total losses for private radio in 
1993-94, for example, amounted to $28 million. The industry has 
been unprofitable since 1989-90. In fact, in the years between 1990 
and 1994, radio lost $180 million in Canada. Many stations have 
continued in operation because they are cross-subsidized by more 
profitable stations in the same corporate family. That is one of the 
reasons I asked for some consideration for smaller and unprofitable 
stations in this legislation. To an extent the minister of heritage has 
agreed and I am pleased by that.
<P>
<B>(1700 )</B>
<P>
	Radio is part of the daily life of listeners and remains the most 
intimate of media. Radio is often the primary source of local news. 
It has a low concentration of ownership with the five largest owners 
together owning only 19 per cent of all radio stations. Most 
important, radio is a vital source of influence in the purchase of 
music recordings in Canada.
<P>
	Study after study indicates that radio promotes the sale of CDs, 
cassettes and videos. In 1993, for example, a Decima Research poll 
found that 51 per cent of teens who decided on their purchase 
before buying at a record store stated that the main influence on 
them was hearing the selection on the radio. Video ranked second 
at 25 per cent and word of mouth was third.
<P>
	Studies continue to point in the same direction; that is, airplay on 
radio represents the single most important source of promotion for 
recordings and is the most influential factor on the decision to 
purchase a record, tape or CD. That is good news for our artists, 
sound producers and music authors.
<P>
	Radio continues to introduce Canadians to new music. I do have 
a concern that without the amendments smaller unprofitable radio 
stations will begin to close across Canada. That means that there 
will be less performers being heard and less variety for Canadians. 
Does this really help anyone? I think the answer to that is clearly 
no.
<P>
	The amendments I propose essentially deal with time shifting 
and transfer of format. Let me explain. The local Rogers Cable 
television station in Guelph, for example, records the annual Santa 
Claus parade. We all know that this taping is often replayed several 
times on the station. The bill presently allows Rogers to show the 
event without paying copyright charges for 30 days from the day 
the event was held. The amendments I am introducing will extend 
that period to 60 days, allowing Rogers to play the show at 
Christmas time or on Christmas day.
<P>
	Transfer of format allows stations like CJOY to transfer music to 
its hard drive and back up without having to pay additional fees. 
Without this amendment, radio stations will pay three times to play 
one piece of music.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9042"> 9042 </A></B>
<P>
	Other amendments allow radio stations to archive the recordings 
in their own system rather than force the station to archive in an 
official archive and would allow a network show to rebroadcast 
without the local station having to pay again for the right to play it.
<P>
	I recognize the importance of rewarding the artistic 
contributions of our artists and the people who produce the 
recordings. I do not believe that the amendments take anything 
away from what they deserve. What the amendments do is protect 
local radio, help keep it alive  and assist it in its important work at 
promoting Canadian talent.
<P>
	I do not believe there is one member of Parliament who 
represents a community with a local radio station who can say that 
the community would be better off without that station. That is why 
I am asking for support of my amendments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of the amendments by the member from the Liberal Party 
who just spoke.
<P>
	Our critic will elaborate a little more extensively on the one 
difference I would like to make which is that the exemption should 
be more than just 60 days. If radio is as important as the member 
has said, if radio does as much as it does in that riding of hers and 
allows the finance minister to spread his words of wisdom and 
myth in that community, then certainly the hon. member would 
want more than a 60 day exemption and the member would 
appreciate a six month exemption which our critic has 
recommended. I think that is about the only difference on this 
particular amendment that we would have.
<P>
	There are a couple of other things I would like to say on this 
whole issue of broadcasting and radio. What the member failed to 
say in her speech is that radio is already paying rights to play the 
music, the rights to record and to delay broadcast and so on and it 
pays a hefty fee. I have had representations from radio stations in 
Calgary but obviously SOCAN is charging the music composers 
and now it wants to extend this and pay royalties to the performers 
and the record producers. I have a problem with this.
<P>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
	What the radio stations really do is in the process of paying for 
their right to play the music and to play the artist's production they 
are promoting the very artists who then are trying to increase, like a 
tax on the radio stations which makes it very difficult for radio 
stations to survive. It is not that lucrative, as some may think, and 
to raise their prices and to raise their costs to promote the very 
artists who now want more money from them is a problem.
<P>
	The problem is if we look at performers, they get paid, they get 
money. The good ones go on to make big money. Record producers 
charge a hefty fee to get into that studio, to get into an area where 
they can put an artist on a CD, on a single or on an album. These 
people get paid for their services and they get paid handsomely for 
their services. Yet it is the radio stations that promote these artists 
and now these artists thank them very much by saying ``we want to 
tax you more''. This government is going to comply and go along 
with that. I do not think that is right. It is unacceptable.
<P>
	The other thing this brings up is the possible conflict with our 
neighbour the United States. As we all know, Canadian radio 
stations do not just play Canadian artists.  Canadian radio stations 
also play U.S artists. By making radio stations pay extra for the 
Canadian talent is going to put them at a disadvantage to their 
American counterparts who will not have this extra fee imposed on 
them. They have an association similar to Canada, similar to 
SOCAN, and they are not doing that.
<P>
	It is also possible that we might be contravening some of the 
agreements and rules within the North American Free Trade 
Agreement with respect to the use of these extra funds by groups 
like SOCAN and where does that money go and are we then giving 
a special advantage or favour to the Canadian artists.
<P>
	SOCAN, the collective which is apparently in charge of 
collecting the 3.2 per cent royalties from Canadian broadcasters, 
has an overhead of $19 million annually. This poses a reasonable 
question. How much of this additional levy imposed on Canadian 
broadcasters is going to end up in the hands of Canadians artists? 
The projected annual revenue of neighbouring rights is in the $12 
million to $14 million range.
<P>
	Another reasonable question is where is this additional levy 
imposed on Canadian broadcasters going to go. The artists tabled a 
report showing an administrative cost of collecting the 
neighbouring rights of $1.6 million to $1.8 million annually. This 
is not credible given the overhead of SOCAN performing a 
comparable function.
<P>
	When this legislation was introduced in the spring of 1996 
following consultations between the government and the industry a 
compromise had been reached whereby all radio stations with 
revenues under $1.25 million would be assessed an annual fee of 
$100. The neighbouring rights percentage would be applied per 
station on all revenues in excess of $1.2 million. These were to be 
phased in over a five year period.
<P>
	The committee recommendations were that the bill required that 
a $100 basic royalty be applied to those stations with ad revenues 
under $1.25 million. Full royalty tariffs would apply to stations 
with ad revenues above that threshold. However, those stations 
above $1.25 million ad revenues originally were going to be 
granted a five year phase in.
<P>
<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
	These amendments have reduced that phase in period to three 
years. Sixty-five per cent of the radio stations come under $1.25 
million ad revenue.
<P>
	This reduction from five years to three years is in direct response 
to demands by artists and pressure from the Bloc Quebecois during 
committee hearings. Again, we feel the Liberals and the Bloc have 
worked to the advantage of a small group of Quebec artists at the 
expense of the users.
<P>
	The heritage minister did not include ephemeral exemptions in 
the original legislation and now she is forced to further jeopardize 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9043"> 9043 </A></B>
<P>
the industry's compromise in  an attempt to get the co-operation of 
artists, composers and performers.
<P>
	With respect to the aspects of this amendment, which we are 
supporting, I want to point out that in all cases what this bill is 
doing is trying to ensure that certain people get paid for their 
creativity.
<P>
	The system we have now has been designed in such a way that 
the industry itself is supposed to take care of those people who 
create the product.
<P>
	The industry itself should be ensuring, through the collection of 
the SOCAN fees on radio, on television, in entertainment theatres, 
et cetera, every place where their product is being played, that 
money gets to the artists.
<P>
	The artists have, in conjunction with complaining all along, said 
that they do not get enough of the action from an album, that they 
do not get enough fees when they perform somewhere, that their 
agent takes away too much commission, that record producers 
charge too much, that the money is not distributed fairly, that there 
are too many layers of administrative red tape just like 
government. Then what have they done?
<P>
	What we have to be careful of in this House is that we do not 
give in to their representations totally and willy-nilly without 
recognizing that the industry has a responsibility to these artists as 
well, not just government, not just the Copyright Act.
<P>
	If these artists come to parliamentarians like us and say they are 
not getting enough money, and record producers and performers 
say they are not getting enough money, it is not the Copyright Act 
that is supposed to ensure that they get enough money. The 
Copyright Act already guarantees them that they get something for 
the creative product they have produced.
<P>
	It is the industry itself that has a responsibility. Members should 
look into what publishing companies charge for their piece of the 
action when somebody composes a piece of music.
<P>
	What do agents get when they represent certain entertainers, 
certain performers and certain Canadian artists? I know some 
Canadian artists. I used to book Canadian artists. I know what these 
people charge. I know what record producers charge to go in and 
cut an album in their studios.
<P>
	They are getting paid. If these artists are being taken advantage 
of, it is not by the government and it is not by the laws of this 
country. The law in place is good enough to ensure they get paid.
<P>
	It is the industry itself that should take a look at itself. The artists 
should be complaining to the industry and the whole layer of 
bureaucracy on how to get the money to them.
<P>
	Alanis Morissette apparently has sold 20 million CDs around the 
world. At $20 each, that represents potentially $400 million. What 
do members think she  gets out of that $400 million? Do the 
politicians here think she gets 10 per cent? Do politicians here 
think she has now made $40 million, that she has receivables of 
$40 million? No. She gets a lot less. She has generated that music. 
She has generated and made her value worth $400 million on CDs 
alone.
<P>
	I will continue. We have some other amendments to continue 
and debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Guy H. Arseneault (Parliamentary Secretary to Deputy 
Prime Minister and Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the debate has been going on all day.
<P>
<B>(1715 )</B>
<P>
	We are now at Group No. 7 which has a number of amendments 
that deal basically with the ephemeral. It was well noted by the 
hon. member in opposition that when we first presented the bill in 
the House there was no ephemeral exception. Now we have that 
ephemeral exception which is before the House in the amendments 
the House is proposing.
<P>
	There was some concern about whether networks and cable 
television would be involved with the ephemeral exception. They 
are under the same package. The government moved amendments 
in order to clarify that. It felt they were coming out of the 
amendments in December. We felt they were covered but the 
industry felt it needed some more reassurance that it was covered. 
That is why I think that in many cases the hon. member for 
Guelph-Wellington has withdrawn some of her amendments. 
With the input from caucus, with her input and the input of a 
number of others, that is why some of those amendments were 
made.
<P>
	We also felt quite strongly that the transfer of format was 
probably in the bill. Due to requests from caucus members and 
members of the public who wanted that clarified, who wanted 
assurance, the government clarified that.
<P>
	This section goes to the bill in a certain way especially for the 
Reform members who have been lobbying to have this done, but 
also for some of our members as well. Credit goes to all parties for 
the type of balance we have worked for.
<P>
	It is also important to note that there is a balance. No matter what 
part of the bill is looked at, some feel we are leaning too far to the 
creator's side and others feel we are leaning too far to the user's 
side. We say that we have created a balance. We have taken some, 
we have given some, we have negotiated some. We have listened to 
the witnesses.
<P>
	We listened to over 65 witnesses. We listened to the public and 
we read the briefs sent to us. We have reacted to them. We said all 
along that it was a complicated bill. No one would deny that.
<P>

	The House resumed consideration of Bill C-32, an act to amend 
the Copyright Act, as reported (with amendments) from the 
committee; and of Motions Nos. 17, 19, 20, 24 to 38, 58 and 59.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the issue 
of ephemeral exemption or time shifting as it is sometimes referred 
to falls into the category of the discussion the parliamentary 
secretary and I had previously. Frequently measures are brought 
forward by the government that are not what we would consider to 
be adequate. Although I recognize that they were brought forward 
in response to the concerns that had been expressed over the issue 
of ephemeral or time shifting, the measures that have been 
proposed by the government, unfortunately in my judgment are 
singularly inadequate.
<P>
	It is going to put a tremendous onus on charities and cable 
companies. I recognize that tapes can be maintained for a period of 
time. But it is my judgment that period of time is simply not long 
enough.
<P>
	Many programs that are captured by the local cable companies 
during the late summer and fall are broadcast at Christmas time. I 
do not see how the amendments brought forward by the 
government would capture that. In other words, the exception 
proposed by the government will not permit that to happen.
<P>
	I would like to look now on the impact of copyright in Bill C-32 
on francophone broadcasters in general. I read from a brief I 
received: ``Even if the proposed  ephemeral exemptions limitation 
respecting the promotion of a cause or institution were removed, 
other qualifications of the exception would still make it possible 
for the stations to use the exception. The proposed exception is 
currently worded so that it will not apply where a collective can 
licence an ephemeral reproduction''.
<P>
	It is in this area of collectivity that we were speaking earlier 
today. As a matter of fact, in the province of Quebec with 
SODRAC, Société du droit de reproduction des auteurs, 
compositeurs et éditeurs au Canada, because a collective exists and 
because of the patchwork the legislation actually represents, a 
problem remains in spite of the government's move to try and 
alleviate it.
<P>
	The bill was originally intended to take 1924 legislation and 
bring it forward into 1997. It has not occurred in this instance. I 
used the example earlier today of a small market radio station 
where a person would be faced with row upon row of CDs that 
someone will be taking down manually and putting into the CD 
player as opposed to going into a medium or larger market area 
where cuts from those CDs have been transferred on to a direct 
drive and can be accessed at the drop of a pin.
<P>
	This bill does not recognize the difference between physical 
manual labour filing and electronic filing. Electronic filing is 
simply lifting those digital impressions from the CDs or from other 
medium and transferring them to a direct drive or some other 
medium. The legislation does not reflect the reality of electronics 
today. That is a real shame.
<P>
	Broadcasters across Canada are going to be squeezed as 
undoubtedly the government is going to be forcing neighbouring 
rights through. This means that some of the larger operations are 
going to be looking at a fairly sizeable bill. It is not the $100 bill for 
the small operation, it is the larger bill for the larger operations. 
Because of the sheer size of these operations and the number of 
people that work for them, they will be able to make choices to use 
electronic equipment, possibly to replace some of their staff so they 
can pay the neighbouring rights. Then they are going to be faced 
with a dilemma because they do not have a true ephemeral 
exemption. There is really no transfer of medium possibility that is 
a sure thing. We could end up with some kind of a collective or 
some artist coming after us because we electronically transferred a 
signal back and forth. Then they are caught on double horns of the 
dilemma.
<P>
<B>(1725)</B>
<P>
	The first dilemma is that the government is asking them to pay 
higher fees in the form of neighbouring rights. The second 
<P>

<B><A NAME="9045"> 9045 </A></B>
<P>
dilemma is that they do not know if they will be able to pay for that 
by laying off one or two people or whatever it is going to take to 
pay that bill. They do not know if they are going to be able to make  
use of the electronics that are available today because there is no 
surety with this legislation.
<P>
	It was repeated time and time again in committee that what the 
broadcasters and those in the broadcasting business so desperately 
need is the assurance of knowing where they are going.
<P>
	I respect the artists who came before us as I respect the 
collectives and the artist organizations when they say: ``We do not 
intend to use our privilege of having these copyright privileges''. 
That is all very well and good but if a business is making a $20,000, 
$200,000 or $200 million decision on what it is going to be doing 
about new electronic equipment, would it not be nice if it had a bit 
of an idea of what the rules were going to be when a new crop of 
artists or perhaps some new people are involved in managing that 
collective?
<P>
	This is one of the most flawed parts of the legislation in that a 
dollar and cent number cannot be applied to it. This is going to 
create an insecurity within the broadcast industry that should have, 
would have and could have been resolved with a little bit clearer 
intent expressed by the government. I think it is a shame.
<P>
	All I can say is that contrary to all of the wonderful catcalls that 
we get from the other side, I really believe that at some point, 
probably in this next election, Reform is going to prevail and when 
we become government we are going to straighten this sucker out.

	The House resumed consideration of Bill C-32, an act to amend 
the Copyright Act, as reported (with amendments) from the 
committee; and Motions Nos. 17, 19, 20, 24 to 38, 58 and 59.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, listening to this prolonged 
debate and looking at the eleven and a half pages of amendments in 
the Order Paper, I cannot help but think there must be a lot of 
disorganization in the background of this legislation. I wonder why 
the  government does not go back to the drawing board and start out 
with something that makes sense to all concerned and the public 
can use.
<P>
	However, we are now debating these amendments line by line. 
The question of the ephemeral exemptions is a particularly trying 
one in my riding. Although it is a vast area, probably about 
one-fifth the size of the province of Ontario, there are within that 
area only three radio stations, one cable outlet and one independent 
television station. They are all going to suffer from this legislation. 
Some of them are going to suffer so much that I am afraid they 
might be lost.
<P>
	That does not make any difference to the government members 
or to their friends and accomplices on the separatist side who have 
been working hand in glove devising this legislation.
<P>
	As a somewhat technical person, one of the things in this 
legislation that I find most offensive is the lack of any real 
exemption for the transfer of formats. Most smaller radio stations 
have fairly extensive libraries, some of them in two, three or even 
four formats. It is a dog's breakfast. It is that way because they 
cannot afford to make a massive conversion. Now we are going to 
tell them, when we pass this bill, that their libraries, unless they are 
willing to pay for the transfer of formats every time they take 
something off the shelf, have become basically useless.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am very sorry to interrupt the hon. 
member. He will have eight minutes left in his intervention when 
we revert to this matter after Private Members' Business.
<P>
	It being 5.30 p.m., the House will now proceed to the 
consideration of Private Members' Business as listed on today's 
Order Paper.

	The House resumed from December 13, 1996 consideration of 
the motion that Bill C-214, an act to provide for improved 
information on the cost of proposed government programs, be read 
the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to participate in the debate on Bill C-214, sponsored by 
my hon. colleague from Durham.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9046"> 9046 </A></B>
<P>
	Just by way of background, there is a kinship between us. During 
the 1993 election the member for Durham and I were the only two 
chartered accountants to be elected to the House of Commons. That 
is a shame because one of the things that we have found is that  
virtually everything we touch in this place eventually has 
something to do with dollars.
<P>
	This is a very important bill from the standpoint that the member 
has asked somewhat of a rhetorical question of the House to 
consider and that is whether we have all the information we need to 
do the job we have to do. Certainly, as members well know, there 
are many items which come before us for consideration.
<P>
	I just had a quick look at the House business summary. I was 
somewhat taken aback when I looked at the second session of the 
35th Parliament. We have had quite a substantial number of 
proposals come before the House. There were about 84 government 
bills presented to the House. I believe there were 176 private 
members' bills, a third of which were votable items. There were 
another 276 private members' motions. About a third of those were 
also votable items. There has been one Senate bill in this session.
<P>
	The member raises an interesting issue. There are an awful lot of 
matters which come before this place for consideration. In his 
speech the member quite correctly pointed out that sometimes 
members come to this place to vote on an issue and they are not 
familiar with the bill, the motion or the item before the House. It is 
fair to say that it is not possible for members of Parliament to be 
fully apprised of absolutely everything that comes before the 
House. Indeed, that is why there are committees on which members 
participate more fully in the issues coming before them. Members 
cannot possibly even read them, never mind appreciate the 
complexity and the implications of them.
<P>
	The member raised a very important point and that is with 
respect to fiscal accountability. Recently in the tobacco bill there 
was a report stage motion which was passed by this place and 
incorporated into the bill which has been referred to the Senate. 
The motion was proposed by the hon. member for 
Lambton-Middlesex. It basically said that the regulations 
associated with a piece of legislation would have to come back to 
the committee for review and for scrutiny prior to being approved, 
rather than going through the normal process.
<P>
<B>(1735 )</B>
<P>
	That tends to show the concern and the interest of the House to 
work toward ways to improve where possible fiscal responsibility 
and accountability so that we can say to our constituents that we 
have on those matters which we are directly involved in had an 
opportunity to fully scrutinize not only the intent and the context of 
legislation coming before us but certainly the financial and fiscal 
impact of any legislation, whether it be to do with programs or bills 
or modification of existing programs that the government may 
have.
<P>
	I looked at one of the most interesting questions that the member 
for Durham raised. It was how did this $600 billion deficit get 
created. Is it something that could have  been avoided had we been 
in a position to perhaps scrutinize more fully in history the matters 
that came before the House of Commons during the last 25 years 
when this deficit was created.
<P>
	The member will know that a substantial portion of that debt is 
interest and compound interest. Notwithstanding, it still is a 
substantial amount of dollars.
<P>
	On that point alone I do not believe and I am not going to accept 
the member's full analysis that the scrutiny might have dealt with 
the issue of the national debt. The member will well know that 
there are things which occur in our society which are very 
expensive. As an example, spousal abuse in our society is a very 
terrible thing. There was a joint Canada-U.S. forum last summer in 
which an analysis was done and papers were presented.
<P>
	In Canada it was estimated that the cost of spousal abuse to the 
Canadian taxpayer, health, productivity and other costs associated 
with it, was something like $2.1 billion. That is an awful lot of 
money. There is no amount of scrutiny of legislation or regulations 
that could help us avoid that cost and yet that cost is an incremental 
cost, a burden to the taxpayer which in fact eventually finds its way 
to the national debt.
<P>
	Second, there is the issue of alcohol abuse. Alcohol abuse is an 
issue which I have spent a lot of time on. I have given some 
information to the House from time to time about the cost of 
substance and alcohol abuse. The most recent information is that 
alcohol abuse costs Canadians something like $15 billion a year, 
not to mention the loss of life, to do with whether it be straight 
medical problems, or accidents, suicides and the like. There are 
some 19,000 people a year who die from alcohol misuse. That is a 
significant expenditure which is occurring on an annual basis, $15 
billion a year. We can imagine how those costs accumulate and 
compound and add to the national debt.
<P>
	I would then suggest a recent issue, the tobacco issue. It is 
another one that Canadians well know. It is a very serious problem 
in terms on its health impacts on Canadians. Forty thousand 
Canadians die each from it. There is a significant cost. I believe it 
was estimated that the provinces alone spend $3.5 billion on health 
care directly related to tobacco related problems. If we look at all 
of the other ancillary costs, that does accumulate closer to some 
$10 billion a year.
<P>
	I could give some examples to show that the principle is 
something that I support, the fiscal accountability and the 
responsibility and the ability to be able to communicate that, that I 
have done my job, or I have seconded that responsibility to those I 
feel have taken up the responsibility to do the work on my behalf 
and I will rely on them.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9047"> 9047 </A></B>
<P>
	That principle of secondment is extremely important. It is an 
element which perhaps the member did not develop as much as he 
might have in his speech.
<P>
	When I was a hospital trustee for the Mississauga hospital for 
nine years there was an awful lot going on there. The public 
hospitals act said that the full 100 per cent of the responsibilities 
for the operations of that hospital were in the hands of the trustees. 
There is no possibility that the delivery of the direct medical 
services, the administration and virtually every aspect of the 
operation of a major urban hospital could be handled by a board of 
trustees on a voluntary basis, some 20 men and women.
<P>
<B>(1740)</B>
<P>
	Under the Ontario hospitals act one of the things we had was the 
trustee's guide which basically said we are responsible to make 
sure that we hire responsible people. As a chief of staff, as a senior 
administrator we are responsible for making sure that we have 
people we feel have the credentials and to whom we can second 
that responsibility so as trustees we could discharge our 
responsibilities not directly but in a combination of direct and 
indirect secondment.
<P>
	In this case we do as members of Parliament second an awful lot 
of responsibility and rely very heavily on committees and other 
members to do the work. To that extent I am not as critical maybe 
of House operations.
<P>
	In summary I would simply like to say that the aspect of fiscal 
accountability responsibility is something I know the member has 
worked very hard for. I congratulate him on the initiative. It is an 
excellent example of how people in this place, backbenchers, have 
made a contribution to the thinking of this place. If more members 
of Parliament would think and show initiative like the member for 
Durham I think this place would be a better place for all.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Richard Bélisle (La Prairie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, this bill, 
C-214, was presented in this House by the hon. member for 
Durham. It is intended to provide for improved information on the 
cost of proposed government programs.
<P>
	I know the hon. member for Durham well, as he was vice-chair 
of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts when I was chair. 
From that time on, I have been aware of the interest the hon. 
member has in any administrative or legislative measure with a 
potential for improving the government's accountability and 
responsibility, more necessary than ever because of the 
astronomical amounts invested by the taxpayers annually in the 
workings of the federal government.
<P>
	Like the hon. member for Longueuil, who has already spoken on 
Bill C-214 on behalf of the Bloc Quebecois, I wish to assure the 
hon. member for Durham who introduced this bill of my support 
and to require the Liberal government, at the time of introducing a 
bill in Parliament that authorizes the program, or when the 
regulation that authorizes the program, to make a  declaration of 
the estimated annual cost of each new program, expressed as a total 
cost and as a per capita cost.
<P>
	The bill also calls for the auditor general to be involved, 
providing proof that the method of calculation of the costs is valid 
and a good estimate, as stated in the hon. member's bill. This 
evaluation of the method of calculating and estimating costs by the 
auditor general would reassure the public about the objectivity of 
the calculations and cost estimates.
<P>
	The objective of Bill C-24 is to require all departments to 
provide a financial analysis or a detailed cost breakdown of any 
new legislative measure. Assessing these costs on a per capita basis 
will enable each citizen to have a better grasp of what each new 
piece of legislation will cost him personally, what will really come 
out of his pocket each time the government creates a new program.
<P>
	This bill is also intended to make legislators and public servants 
more aware of the financial impact of the various legislative 
measures. It is also intended to get the public to scrutinize the 
various government expenditures more closely.
<P>
	The Liberal government prefers camouflage to transparency and 
to the analysis of the true costs of government programs. The 
Liberals' policy has always been: it is better to keep the public in 
the dark about the true costs of programs, and it is far better to keep 
the auditor general at a distance, for he could make an objective 
and transparent judgment of them.
<P>
	We saw this during the finance committee hearings on the 
transfer of $2 billion in Canadian capital to the United States, 
tax-free. The Liberal majority and the chair of the committee 
himself tried to back the auditor general into a corner for having 
dared voice a dissenting opinion on the controversial decision by 
Revenue and Finance concerning this unusual transfer of funds to 
the U.S.
<P>
<B>(1745)</B>
<P>
	In terms of political debate and public morality, we have seen 
better. Instead of going after the message, the Liberals go after the 
messenger. They want to continue to ensure that the Office of the 
Auditor General gets involved only after the fact, when the deed 
has already been done, and taxpayers' money has been committed 
and spent.
<P>
	Bill C-214, introduced by the member for Durham will not, 
unfortunately, be given the support of his party, because he calls for 
innovative administration, public transparency and objectivity 
defining the role of the auditor general. Such an honest, open and 
frank approach to voters and taxpayers is also totally foreign to the 
tradition and the culture of the Liberal Party of Canada.
<P>
	Bill C-214 will likely, regretfully, remain wishful thinking, 
whereas the astronomical debt of $600 billion will urgently require 
greater transparency and vigorous action, which the government to 
date has been unable to provide.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9048"> 9048 </A></B>
<P>
	The latest budget is indicative in this regard. The Minister of 
Finance could have done a lot better. He could have taken 
advantage of an extraordinary economic situation, shall we say, and 
real manoeuvring room-much more than he claims to have-to 
really help the unemployed and children in poverty.
<P>
	These diversionary tactics of which the Liberals are past masters 
may well abort Bill C-214, and its objectives will no doubt remain 
a dead issue.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Parliamentary Secretary to President 
of the Treasury Board, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to 
address the House in the debate with regard to private member's 
Bill C-214.
<P>
	This bill is an act to provide improved information on the cost of 
proposed government programs and has been introduced by my 
colleague, the hon. member for Durham.
<P>
	As members will recall, the bill purports disclosing in 
Parliament the estimated annual cost of every new program the 
government decides to implement.
<P>
	If a new program had to be authorized by legislation, this 
proposal would require that a disclosure be made when the bill was 
introduced. If enabling legislation was not required, the disclosure 
would be made at the time a regulation order or one of the 
instruments was issued.
<P>
	This proposal further requires that the auditor general provides 
an opinion on the validity of each cost estimate. The underlying 
objective of the proposed legislation is laudable but the results of 
such a bill, if passed, would be costly and administratively 
cumbersome. This act would result in such red tape for approvals 
of any kind that the business of the government would slow to a 
halt.
<P>
	Applying this legislation to all new programming proposals 
regardless of size would raise all sorts of issues of interpretation, of 
applying this act, what constitutes a new program, what should be 
included in the cost calculations, direct costs only, indirect costs, 
opportunity costs. This proposal itself would constitute a program 
for which costs and benefits have yet to be determined.
<P>
	This bill would also create a new role for the auditor general's 
office in the expenditure management process. The bill would 
require that the auditor general's office carry out detailed reviews 
of thousands of individual transactions before they take place to 
verify whether costing assumptions that the governments use were 
valid.
<P>
	This would create a huge additional workload for the auditor 
general's office to perform these pretransaction audits. It would 
have to divert most of its resources away  from the audits that focus 
on whether programs deliver value for money.
<P>
<B>(1750 )</B>
<P>
	Our auditor general and those in many other countries have 
moved away from this type of detailed pretransaction control and 
toward broader value for money auditing. The auditor general's 
mandate is generally one of an ex post review and critique of 
government spending. It is not likely that the auditor general would 
readily agree to validate cost estimates on this scale.
<P>
	I applaud the basic premise of the bill but unfortunately it 
presumes that we are currently not providing this type of cost 
information for government programs. This assumption is not 
correct. I am sure my colleagues would agree that the steps this 
government has taken toward more open and cost effective 
government are unparalleled in the Canadian federal government. 
Perhaps it would be useful to cast our gaze south of the Canadian 
border for a minute before considering this proposal.
<P>
	One will observe that there are a number of Republican 
representatives in the American Senate who want to institute 
extremely complex regulatory procedures. Implementing those 
procedures would so complicate the U.S. system that the regulators 
would be prevented from implementing regulations in the interest 
of the public good. One could characterize such a system as being a 
state of paralysis by analysis. Excessive red tape would slow the 
system down to a crawl in spite of the insistent public demand for 
more responsible government.
<P>
	In Canada we have taken a different approach to the regulatory 
process. Ours is a process that is concerned with cost effective 
regulation. The Canadian regulatory system already has 
mechanisms in place to get the cost information. Every regulatory 
initiative must be included in the Treasury Board's annual 
regulatory plan which lays out the government's regulatory 
initiative for the coming year.
<P>
	Departments and agencies have to list what is planned and why it 
is necessary. This includes a brief description of benefits, costs, 
alternatives considered and how the department and agency will 
consult. There is also a section that provides information on 
initiatives that are scheduled to be implemented in the coming year.
<P>
	For every initiative submitted the department or agency must 
make a cost declaration to identify the anticipated costs. The 
initiative is then classified based on both anticipated cost and 
degree of acceptance. For example, an initiative with an anticipated 
cost of $1 million will be considered a major initiative if it has a 
low degree of acceptance, but an intermediate cost initiative if it 
has a high degree of acceptance. From the beginning of the process 
regulators are mindful of costs.
<P>
	That is just the beginning of accountability for costs in Canadian 
regulation. In November 1995 the Treasury Board of Canada 
secretariat introduced federal regulatory policy which discusses the 
requirements for new regulations. The objective of this policy is to 
ensure the government uses its regulatory powers for the greatest 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9049"> 9049 </A></B>
<P>
net benefit to Canadian society, in other words, that its regulations 
are cost effective.
<P>
	When regulating authorities must ensure that they comply with 
six general policy requirements. First, a program or a risk exists, 
intervention by the federal government is justified and regulation is 
the best alternative. Second, Canadians are consulted and they have 
the opportunity to participate in developing or modifying 
regulations and regulatory programs. Third, the benefits outweigh 
the costs to Canadians, their governments and businesses. In 
managing risks, resources are used where they do the most good.
<P>
	Fourth, adverse impacts on the capacity of the economy to 
generate wealth and employment are minimized and no 
unnecessary regulatory burden is imposed. In particular, 
information and administrative requirements are limited and they 
impose the least cost possible, the special circumstances of small 
businesses are addressed, and parties proposing equivalent means 
to conform with regulatory requirements are given positive 
consideration.
<P>
	Fifth, intergovernmental agreements are respected and full 
advantage is taken of opportunities for co-ordination with other 
governments and agencies.
<P>
<B>(1755 )</B>
<P>
	Sixth, systems are in place to manage the resources effectively. 
In particular, to ensure that the regulatory process management 
standards are followed, compliance and enforcement policies are 
articulated as appropriate, and resources have been approved and 
are adequate to discharge enforcement responsibilities effectively 
and to ensure compliance where the regulation binds the 
government.
<P>
	The regulatory policy provides for cost effective regulation. It 
provides for regulation that is flexible, focused on ends rather than 
means, focused on high priority problems rather than unnecessary 
detail and based on a partnership model with other governments 
and those subject to the regulation. It guarantees an open and 
transparent development process and requires that the government 
consider all alternatives before choosing the regulation.
<P>
	This policy goes a long way toward to ensuring that Canadians 
have smarter regulation, free from unnecessary and costly burden. 
It provides for regulation only where it is the best alternative and 
only where the overall benefits clearly exceed the costs.
<P>
	In other cases the government provides a clear indication of 
costs either at the time a new program is  announced or in the 
budget if these costs are significant. In the budget of March 6 of 
this year the Minister of Finance emphasized the need for frugality 
in everything we do. Waste in government is simply not tolerated.
<P>
	We have put aside the notion that new government programs 
require additional spending. What they do require is the will to 
reallocate. In the March budget every initiative involved a shift of 
resources from lower to higher priority areas.
<P>
	The announcement in 1995 of the expenditure management 
system committed the government to making the best use of 
taxpayer dollars to deliver quality services to Canadians. The 
system is built on the principles of funding for new initiatives or 
priorities by reviewing existing expenditures and then reallocating 
money.
<P>
	The expenditure management system will foster greater fiscal 
responsibility and help the government to meet its fiscal targets. 
Using business plans will allow departments to set out strategies 
for changing their businesses to reflect budget targets and 
government priorities.
<P>
	The presentation to standing committees of departmental 
outlooks on program priorities and expenditures will help us to 
review expenditure trends and priorities for the coming years and 
provides a context for examining the estimates of the Government 
of Canada.
<P>
	On March 7, 1996 the government released its progress report on 
getting government right. We recognized that the people of Canada 
are concerned about the cost of government and how those costs 
are being controlled. They want better governance. We have laid 
out for them what we have done and what we will continue to do to 
achieve this.
<P>
	The program review exercise launched two years ago was the 
most fundamental review of federal programs and services since 
World War II. Its goal was to identify the federal government's core 
roles and to refocus resources on primary areas where reducing 
overall spending was important. The results of this review are 
changing the face of the federal government and will continue to do 
so for many years.
<P>
	The government continues to ask the important question of how 
can programs be delivered in the most efficient manner. The 
auditor general continues to provide advice in this area. As long as 
this remains a government priority, departments and agencies will 
continue to do a good job in following up on every opportunity for 
improvement.
<P>
	The combination of the two initiatives, the revamped 
expenditure management system and program review, opened the 
door for what we are now engaged in, an effort to bring results 
orientation to the information we in Parliament use.
<P>
	We are entering a new era of governance, an era that will be 
characterized by greater transparency and dialogue about policy 
directions.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough-Rouge River, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am please to continue the debate on this private 
member's bill moved and drafted by my hon. colleague from 
Durham.
<P>
	I endorse the bill. I support the bill. I endorse the concept. The 
member would agree that some fine tuning of all our bills which 
emanate from private members' business can best be done at 
committee.
<P>
	The bill causes the taxpayer, the parliamentarian and the drafter 
of a bill or statute to recognize at the front end the fiscal costs 
associated with the change, whatever it might be. It is not a new 
idea but it is the first time it has been proposed here. It is an 
excellent idea.
<P>
	The current procedure, as I understand it, begins in the executive 
branch of government where a bill is drafted and proposed. 
Although I have never sat at the cabinet table I understand that 
modern cabinets have financial assessment figures and projections 
at the front end whenever they consider legislation. As we are all 
aware a bill proposed in the House by the government has the 
support of cabinet. Before cabinet makes a decision cabinet knows 
what the numbers will be.
<P>
	I would have thought it would be a fairly simple operation to 
make the same numbers available when the bill is presented in the 
House of Commons. Someone has already done the work on the 
calculator. I would have thought it would be pretty easy to add one 
page to the bill or the proposal and make it available for 
parliamentary debate and committee perusal as the statute or 
reform is being considered.
<P>
	As it sits now, the House does not necessarily have this 
information as it considers a bill. It may in some cases be made 
privy to the departmental calculations as the bill goes through the 
committee process. In addition I have noted, as I am sure all 
members have noted, that most ministries deal with these issues 
publicly when they put forward a proposal. In any event I do not 
think it is a bad idea at all to nail this little procedure down at the 
front end.
<P>
	To draw two analogies of similar concepts at work, the 
parliamentary secretary referred to what is called the regulatory 
impact analysis statement, RIAS, which is now used for almost all 
government regulatory initiatives. That impact statement for 
regulations includes references to the cost. That is a useful tool. It 
does not show up in this House because it is regulatory. The field 
has already been delegated by another statute to the executive 
branch. The RIAS is a very useful document. My colleague's 
proposal would in effect put a financial impact statement on the 
front end of a bill.
<P>
	The second analogy is with environmental impact statements 
that are required by statute in many different areas now. They are
<P>
very useful in assessing the potential impact of statutes and 
changes in the way we do things in government.
<P>
	The backdrop of this should include a recognition that the 
parliamentary estimates procedure, the process by which 
Parliament is supposed to review government spending, does not 
always work as effectively as we would like. Over the years this 
has been reformed from time to time. Every few years we revise the 
estimates procedures to try to enable Parliament to get a better 
handle on what is a very large and complex matter these days, 
government spending. It is quite huge, exceeding the $100 billion 
mark. I understand there is ongoing work to improve, change and 
update this procedure in the House of Commons. The initiative put 
forward by my colleague from Durham can only enhance whatever 
process we might subsequently adopt in the House.
<P>
<B>(1805)</B>
<P>
	As I understand it, given that the government and cabinet already 
do calculations for all government initiatives put forward by way of 
statute or changes in policy, given that it already happens in camera 
in cabinet, and given that the information is not always made 
public in the process that brings bills into the House, I am very 
much in favour of a House mandated procedure that would cause 
the numbers to be placed in front of all of us as we debate, pass and 
not pass legislation.
<P>
	With tongue in cheek I might ask-and I do not need the 
answer-whether there is an estimate provided by the mover of the 
bill of its financial impact. It might have been a nice start. I do not 
know whether the hon. member has done that, but it is a great idea 
and I will support it.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Durham will sum 
up the debate, there being no further speakers wishing to rise.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it gives me 
great pleasure to honour the many speakers from all parties who 
stood in support of my Bill C-214.
<P>
	It shows what the House can be with all members working 
together for the common objectives of better visibility and better 
accountability of how governments spend. It empowers people.
<P>
	The last time I rose was in the first hour of debate on the bill. I 
would like to mention some organizations that support it. The 
parliamentary secretary made reference to the auditor general. He 
stated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We share your views that the cost of government programs and operations should 
be made more visible to Parliament and taxpayers.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Certified General Accountants' Association of Canada also 
support it.
<P>
	I would like to read a final comment from a letter that I received 
since the last time I was on my feet. It is from the Canadian 
<P>

<B><A NAME="9051"> 9051 </A></B>
<P>
Institute of Chartered Accountants annual letter to the finance 
minister. It states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We believe that government must provide cost information and analysis prior to 
making decisions that affect the delivery of existing programs or initiating new 
programs. We believe that this cost information should be made available to the 
public in order to foster greater awareness of government spending.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A private member's bill such as 214 that has been brought forward calls for the 
departments of governments to provide for financial or cost analysis of each piece of 
legislation on its introduction. In this way government would be more conscious of 
the financial impact that legislation would have and a greater scrutiny of government 
spending would be provided to the general public.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We urge the federal government to ensure speedy passage of this bill.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	On my way to the House this morning I heard a program on the 
CBC that talked about gambling. It occurred to me that quite often 
when individual members of the House rise to vote on various 
pieces of legislation that is what we are doing. We are gambling but 
we are not using our money. We are using taxpayers' money.
<P>
	The bottom line is that we have developed a system of taxation 
that is not consensual. The history of taxation, while some people 
at home might have a big yawn, is really quite fascinating. It goes 
back to the time of the Romans and others who tried to implement 
taxation systems.
<P>
	The one important thing about a taxation system that starts to fall 
apart is the day when people do not believe they consented to be 
taxed.
<P>
<B>(1810 )</B>
<P>
	In its simplistic form, when taxation first came into existence 
people could see what they were getting. They would invest in 
roads, local schools and services they communally decided to 
invest in and which they benefited from.
<P>
	When people look at their paycheques today, at the gross figure 
and the net, they do not understand the difference. Worst than that, 
many of those people do not believe they were part of the process 
that made the decision for that level of taxation.
<P>
	As a result people generally have a negative attitude toward 
government. They do not figure they are part of the process. They 
cannot control it. They cannot control the money that is leaving 
their wallets. They become cynical. Generally the electorate is 
cynical.
<P>
	The legislation is trying to let these people back into the loop so 
that they can be part of the process of change and can feel they are a 
part of the consensual process. Then they can say they understand 
how much it will cost and whether it is a good thing. It would let 
them have their say.
<P>
	Most important, it would empower members of Parliament in the 
Chamber who represent those people to make those decisions. In 
the case they do not want to make them themselves we would have 
the proper power to do that.
<P>
	In closing, this is not a new concept. We have estimates from 
Australia and other countries. It is a matter of simply putting those 
numbers in a bill, allowing the people in and shedding a bit of light 
on the government process in Ottawa.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is the House ready for the question?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Question.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the

<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Yes.

	The House resumed consideration of Bill C-32, an act to amend 
the Copyright Act, as reported (with amendments) from the 
committee; and of Motions Nos. 17, 19, 20, 24 to 38, 58 to 59.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The member for Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia has eight minutes remaining in his 
intervention.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, when I was interrupted I 
was making reference to the fact that many small radio stations 
depend rather heavily on their libraried material, which can be in 
several different formats depending on how old the station is.
<P>
	The legislation with its lack of considerations for transfer of 
format does not recognize advances in technology. As a matter of 
fact it penalizes radio stations that might want to advance their 
technology. It is somewhat like the weavers of Manchester 
breaking up the steam looms. We are moving into the 21st century 
but the government does not recognize that. The anti-technological 
biases of the Minister of Heritage being well known, I am not 
terribly surprised by it.
<P>
	The other question regarding ephemeral rights refers to the 
length of time people will be allowed to maintain  material in their 
files before it has to be destroyed or at least not used. The 30 days 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9052"> 9052 </A></B>
<P>
proposed is preposterously short. Six months, which is what the 
industry requested, would have been quite reasonable.
<P>
	I would like to read a letter received from the Kiwanis Club of 
Pembroke, Ontario. It may cast some light on how this lack of 
reasonable time shift will affect some of the charitable ventures 
that rely upon broadcast. I will read it in its entirety.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Kiwanis Club's efforts to ensure continued Easter Seal benefits for the 
children in our community, could be seriously jeopardized by provisions in the new 
Copyright bill currently being debated in Ottawa.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Dennis Runge, Chairman, said today that he is sure that it is just an oversight by 
the Members of Parliament, who have no idea that the fund-raising telethons Easter 
Seals have so successfully held with CHRO TV over the years could be really 
harmed by some small exceptions which have inexplicably been omitted from this 
proposed bill.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Runge explained that the problem is with the entertainment portions of the 
broadcast, which are so important in attracting viewers. ``CHRO has told us that 
under the proposed Copyright Bill, they could be fined, or else have to pay 
additional costs and undertake a major effort to clear the rights, just for taping local 
performers a few weeks ahead of the broadcast, and then playing it back during the 
telethon''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Kiwanis Club believes that if it loses the ability to showcase these 
entertainers, the broadcast will suffer. And, if either they or CHRO TV have to pay a 
second time just for the necessity to tape and playback these performances, the costs 
will add to the telethon budget, and not as much money will be able to be directed 
into Easter Seals.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Runge says that CHRO TV has indicated it wants to continue to do the broadcast, 
that it believes in the work of the Kiwanis Club and wants to support our valuable 
work in the community. However, CHRO TV has also said that if the Copyright 
legislation is passed as is, the future of the telethon will have to be seriously 
re-examined.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Kiwanis Club says ``local Members of Parliament have to tell the government 
that broadcasters should be giving `time shift' and `transfer of format' exceptions in 
the proposed Copyright Bill, which would eliminate the problem, and permit 
Kiwanis and CHRO TV to continue working for the benefit of people in Pembroke 
and surrounding area.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``Sometimes it is not clear that new legislation can have detrimental effects in a 
community'' said Runge. ``But this time we have been able to see the problem 
coming, and hopefully our MPs will understand that it is up to them to see that the 
people of our town don't lose out by a careless decision made in Ottawa''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1815)</B>
<P>
	It is signed by Dennis Runge, chairman of the Kiwanis Club of 
Pembroke, Ontario.
<P>
	This is a very typical example of the way in which people with 
good intentions try to protect everybody from everything 
imaginable and end up creating severe problems for other people 
who do not deserve to have problems. I am sure they have received 
letters similar to  this. They must have received them by the 
hundreds. I would hope that they would start to give a bit of 
consideration to what they are doing and make serious amendments 
to this bill, not just to gratify the Quebec entertainers who have 
been getting everything they want, but to think about the service 
clubs and the small community stations all over Canada that are 
going to suffer under this legislation.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, there are 
times in this parliamentary life when one has to wonder what in the 
world the government is up to. This particular blank tape levy 
certainly is one of them.
<P>
	It was pointed out by the consumers association in its 
presentation to the committee that the mark-up, which is going to 
be applied by the government as an additional  cost to everyone 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9055"> 9055 </A></B>
<P>
buying blank tapes, will be applied at the point of entry into 
Canada. As everyone knows, about 95 per cent of all of the blank 
audio tapes sold in Canada are imported.
<P>
	Therefore, if a nominal 35 per cent charge is applied on to a60 cent tape, now it becomes a 95 cent tape. When it was a 60 cent 
tape it would have gone from the original importer to some kind of 
a jobber or distributor, possibly to a wholesaler but more likely 
directly from the jobber or wholesaler directly to a K-Mart, a 
Wal-Mart or Eaton's or wherever it would go and we would have a 
lot of 99 cent tapes or $1.29 tapes with the mark-up applied to the 
60 cent landed cost of the tape.
<P>
	We have been promised what will now happen is the addition of 
35 cents, more or less. I do not buy that but let us take 35 cents. 
Instead of a starting point of 60 cents it will be 95 cents and we will 
never see 99 cent tapes again. We are going to see a sale price of 
$1.49 or $1.89 instead of a 99 cent tape.
<P>
	I do not understand the thought process of the government 
because if the $12 million it says this tape tax will end up creating 
was going to be ending up in the hands of the people who they 
intend for it, I would like to ask who is going to pay the 
administrative cost to collect the money in the first place? Who is 
going to pay the administrative costs to be able to distribute the$12 million?
<P>
	We are going to create a business of collecting and distributing a 
certain portion of the money that will be extracted from the 
consumer. The consumer will be paying substantially more because 
of the decision not only to apply, if it is indeed a 35 cent charge, but 
the place in which it is applied in the feeding change of the 
mark-ups. It is applied right at the very start.
<P>
	If the 35 cents is applied to a 60 cent tape, 95 cent starting point, 
$1.49 sale price, then on top of that will be the provincial tax and 
GST applied to the mark-up that was applied to the 35 cent charge. 
It is absolutely crazy.
<P>
	This money is not going to get to the people who the government 
says it is going to get to because of the cost of administration, 
collection and distribution, really makes me wonder why we are 
doing this. The minister seems to pride herself very frequently on 
talking about protecting Canadian culture.
<P>
	What really goes on more often than not-we just need to take a 
look at <I>Sports Illustrated</I> for an example-is we end up punching 
Uncle Sam in the nose. Unfortunately the people on the other side 
of the 49th parallel have a tendency to get a little bit agitated when 
we do that.
<P>
	The industry in the United States is going to say now: ``Just a 
second. Is it not true that the majority of the things that are being 
recorded from, in other words the CDs and the tapes, is it not a fact 
that the majority of the  music in that medium that is being 
purchased in a Canadian store is actually an American product?''
<P>
	The answer to that question is, yes, the vast majority of it is. 
About 70, 80 to 90 per cent of the product that is being purchased in 
a store comes through U.S. distribution.
<P>
<B>(1830)</B>
<P>
	How much logic does someone need to realize that the industry 
on the other side of the 49th parallel is going to say ``you say you 
are collecting $12 million, we want 80 per cent of the $12 million, 
we want to collect the money that is due us because the music that 
is being copied is our property in the first place''.
<P>
	To turn around and make this money available, which will be 
coming from the blank tapes, exclusively to Canadian based artists 
and organizations is absolutely going to draw the attention of the 
U.S. We have already had a warning shot across our bow on this 
one.
<P>
	If we are going to be saddling the Canadian taxpayer with taxes 
on taxes on mark-ups that are created to create this $12 million 
pool which is going to be attacked by the U.S. government, what 
are we accomplishing? We are just creating another trade irritant. It 
does not make any sense.
<P>
	Furthermore, there is the matter of principle, which we have 
talked about from a very pragmatic perspective. When the minister 
was before the heritage committee she said that the vast majority of 
the 44 million tapes purchased in Canada every year, and there is 
some question about that number, are being used for the illegal 
copying of prerecorded material.
<P>
	What about the churches? What about the colleges? What about 
the reporters? What about the people putting on sale seminars? 
What about people who have a legitimate use for these blank tapes? 
They are guilty by association and they are guilty by virtue of 
having the audacity to buy a blank audio tape. Suddenly they are 
guilty of some kind of crime. They are not guilty.
<P>
	Any law in Canada that as a matter of principle assumes the guilt 
of a person who is undertaking a normal commercial transaction or 
indeed doing anything fundamentally in principle is wrong.
<P>
	In collecting this $12 million, I predict this here and now. I look 
forward unfortunately with some chagrin to knowing that five 
years from now we will look back on this speech and be able to say 
``He was right, we created a trade irritant. That trade irritant 
actually spilled over to something to do with lumber and to 
something to do with wheat. It spilled over to something to do with 
the wool suit trade we have out of Quebec. It was a trade irritant 
that became part of a conflict between Canada and the United 
States, all over $12 million that the artists, composers and 
producers will never ever see''.
<P>
	Why are we doing this? The only answer that I can come up with 
is that it is very typically Liberal and with due respect to the 
minister, very typical of the way she does things. If the government 
does not do it, it will not get done. If the government does not 
interfere, if the government does not mandate, if the government 
does not take control, it will not get done.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9056"> 9056 </A></B>
<P>
	The mischief that is going to be caused by the blank tape levy I 
predict within five years will be very measurable. I hope I am 
wrong but unfortunately I know I am right.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is with 
pleasure that I rise to voice my strongest objections to this part of 
the bill.
<P>
	I really would like to urge the minister, who is listening 
carefully, and all the other members who in the red book promised 
to have free votes, to exercise that free vote, to vote against this bill 
unless this part is amended right out of there.
<P>
	I remember when I was a young man in high school, there was 
one time our biology teacher had to leave the classroom. I was 
busily working quietly. We had a rule in my generation that 
whether the teacher was there or not, there was a lot of silence in 
the classroom. It was strictly enforced.
<P>
<B>(1835 )</B>
<P>
	Some of my classmates started talking. Bless his heart,Mr. Harold J. Newlove, my famous biology teacher, came into the 
classroom to find the place in general pandemonium. He declared a 
penalty. Everyone would stay after school.
<P>
	I tell you the truth, Mr. Speaker, I was not involved in that. I 
went to Mr. Harold J. Newlove and I said to him: ``Sir, I have to 
catch a bus because I am one of these rural students. I have to get 
home to help my family with farm chores. I have to get away from 
here. Otherwise I need to walk four miles to get home. Can I please 
be exempted on the assurance that I was not involved? I am not 
guilty''. Mr. Newlove said: ``If I make an exception for you, where 
will it end? You will stay''. You do not know how injured I was 
because I was innocent.
<P>
	This is the fundamental premise in this part of this bill which is 
false. It assumes that if I go into a store to buy a tape that is blank I 
am going to commit a crime with it. What backward thinking that 
is. Why would even the Liberals, as they believe in the common 
goodness of all people, now suddenly come to the conclusion that 
there would be even one person in the country who would break the 
copyright laws?
<P>
	I recognize the harsh reality is that some people do this, but to 
pass a law that causes every other person to pay the penalty for the 
person who actually did break the law I think is a violation of our 
fundamental sense of justice. We should all be outraged, as I was 
when I was in  high school. That is the first point. We ought not to 
be punishing people for crimes they did not commit.
<P>
	Second, and this I think is just as important, I believe that it is 
wrong to, by supposing that someone is going to break the law, 
make them pay the penalty in advance.
<P>
	I read a statistic not too long ago that in the city of Ottawa the 
average person drives about 20 kilometres an hour over the speed 
limit. Judging by the cabs I have ridden in it is about 100 per cent 
over. Instead of going through that costly exercise of having police 
persons with radar and all of these other things, why do we not put 
a boundary around the city and everyone who comes in we will 
charge them all $100, a payment in advance of their speeding fine 
which we know that they will commit?
<P>
	If we did that we could say to them go ahead and speed. Would 
we say that? What is the purpose of that speeding law? Is it not to 
protect, in the case of vehicles, the lives and the property of all of 
us?
<P>
	If we have a copyright law, the copyright law has the purpose of 
protecting the property of the creator of the property. I know of 
which I speak. I happen to be a mathematician, a low level one but I 
casually sometimes admit to it, and I have some experience with 
computing. For a while I used to write computer programs and I 
used to then sell them. I used to first give them away because 
people liked some of the things I did and I was a generous guy and I 
said go ahead and have a copy of that program. Then someone said 
why not sell them.
<P>
	When desktop computers came along, we had these little 
diskettes and I could put my programs on to those diskettes. I 
realized very quickly that there were some people who were 
making illegal copies, even of my stuff. I found out about it 
surreptitiously. I accidentally found out about it.
<P>
	I put a notice in all of my programs that said: ``If you have made 
a copy of this program and you did not pay for it to Epp Software, 
here is the address where you can send your royalties''. I received 
some money in the mail because there were some people who said 
they liked that program and wanted to know where they could get 
it. Everybody who had a copy of the program said ``copy it and 
send Ken Epp 10 bucks and he's happy''.
<P>
	I got a bit of money, not very much, I will admit that, but I got a 
bit of income from that because I asked people to be honest. For the 
others, I cannot do that. I do believe in the ownership of property 
but I do not believe that I would want to charge a person a penalty 
for stealing my property before he does it in the anticipation that he 
will. This raises a very very fundamental question of justice.
<P>
<B>(1840)</B>
<P>
	Picture me walking into a store and buying a case of C-60s, the 
little cassette tapes. Included in the price is an amount which will 
come to about a dollar by the time we  are all finished, as my 
colleague mentioned, because we will pay GST and HST and BST 
and mark-ups and all of this stuff on that original 30 cents to50 cents, which I predict will soon grow to $1 or $2. Once the 
<P>

<B><A NAME="9057"> 9057 </A></B>
<P>
government gets its fingers on a source of income it loves to make 
it greater. I will have paid on my little case of C-60s maybe $10.
<P>
	My teenage son will now say to me ``dad can I take one of your 
tapes because I want to make a copy of this CD I have to give to my 
friend?'' When my kids even suggested they would do that I gave 
them a blanket ``no, that is not legal and we do not do that''.
<P>
	Is it now legal? Can my son now argue with me and say we have 
already paid for the copyright on that thing by paying this special 
levy on the tapes we bought? Is it now legitimate that this Liberal 
government would say it will put a tax on the tape to allow people 
to break a law? That is absurd.
<P>
	That is why I emphatically ask the minister to reconsider, to use 
some commons sense and think this through. I urge the members of 
that huge majority governing party to think about what they are 
doing and to read their red book again. Remember the one that said 
more free votes? Here is one. Here is a point.
<P>
	My point is that they have it in their power to force the minister, 
to cajole the minister, to persuade the minister or whatever method 
they use, to get this very offensive part out of this bill. One way of 
doing that is to simply vote in favour of our member's amendment. 
It is the motion that says let us rescind this part that pretaxes 
breaking the law or that causes me to pay the penalty for other 
people breaking the law. Let us rescind that. If all members vote in 
favour of that it will pass and we will have accomplished 
something. We in this House will have done the right thing on this 
issue. I strongly urge them to do that.
<P>
	I will be watching because if they do not, then when I go back to 
my people during the next election campaign I will have a moral 
obligation to tell them that they have had, courtesy of this Liberal 
government, this very strange law passed. I think they would even 
be ashamed at that. I am sure they will all support it and I 
appreciate the opportunity to speak on this.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to make a point.
<P>
	The hon. member's approach does not seem to correspond with 
the intent of the bill. We should remember that the use of blank 
tapes is a matter of piracy. In committee we heard many groups, 
including the Consumers Association of Canada, confirm that in 
fact everyone was copying cassettes. You take a cassette, and you 
can make endless copies.
<P>
	I wonder whether anyone in this House could say that neither 
they nor their family members had ever used a cassette to tape 
music from a record. I have some figures for the hon. member.
<P>
	First of all, this type of private copying compensation system has 
been adopted in 25 countries. It is not a tax but a levy. A certain 
amount is levied, and it is called a levy because it is more or less a 
salary for performers who are entitled to receive it because they are 
the ones who create and produce.
<P>
	Last year alone, 44 million blank tapes were sold. According to 
the report of the task force on the future of the Canadian music 
industry in 1996, at least 39 million of these cassettes are used for 
copying purposes, resulting in a total loss of about $325 million to 
the recording industry and performers.
<P>
	Think about it. I think it is a very good idea to collect a levy from 
the source, from the manufacturers, and redistribute it as a salary to 
performers who are losing money because people are copying their 
cassettes.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is the House ready for the question?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Question.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The question is on Motion No. 47. Is it

<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> On division.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The motion is lost on division. The

<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The next question is on Motion No. 55. Is 
it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Nay.

	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> In my opinion the nays have it.
<P>
	<I>And more than five members having risen:</I>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> A recorded division on the motion stands 
deferred.
