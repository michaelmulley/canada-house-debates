</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.)</B> 
moved that Bill C-26, an act to amend the Canada Transportation 
Act, the Competition Act, the Competition Tribunal Act and the 
Air Canada Public Participation Act and to amend another act in 
consequence, be read the second time and referred to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Madam Speaker, I am pleased to rise this morning to 
debate Bill C-26 which was introduced on February 17 as the final 
step in the government's action plan to restructure Canada's 
airline industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I get into the substance of my remarks, I want to thank 
my colleagues in the opposition parties for agreeing to limit 
debate at second reading so we can send this to committee at the 
end of the day at 1.30 p.m.  We have agreed to certain limits of 
time.  I know I am entitled to 40 minutes but I will try to 
finish in about 20. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot has happened in the last few months but we have now 
embarked upon a very exciting phase in this particular 
restructuring process.  It is far from perfect and certainly 
improvements can be made, but we are now seeing the positive 
signs of that restructuring. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this bill, the government is addressing the challenges 
arising out of a radical change in Canadian air travel: the 
passage from two air carriers competing for customers to a 
single dominant carrier with a total monopoly on certain routes. 
The overriding objective of this bill is, therefore, to protect 
consumers and communities from the effects of a monopoly and to 
promote competition. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, much has happened since we took the step last summer. 
I will outline some of the things that led up to what happened 
last summer.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We became very concerned in the spring of last year about the 
financial plight of Canadian Airlines.  It approached us on a 
couple of occasions to tell us how difficult the situation was. 
It officially wrote to us and asked us to find a way to bring the 
matter to a head.  In so doing, we used section 47 of the Canada 
Transportation Act.  Air Canada also raised this in private 
discussions with my officials. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not going to revisit the past but it was somewhat 
controversial.  For those people who believe that the government 
was unsure of what it was doing from the start, all they have to 
do is go back and look at the statements that I and my colleague, 
the Minister of Industry, made on August 13 last year and read 
the subsequent statements to know that we had a game plan.  I 
admit that in the game plan not every move could be anticipated. 
In fact, what happened in the fall was very controversial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a myth that we did not know what we were doing.  That 
was false.  There was another myth that we somehow dealt the 
commissioner of competition out of the action.  That was false. 
What we did was try to get private sector solutions to the 
problems facing Canada's airline industry and it worked.  In 
using section 47, we did not deal the Competition Bureau out of 
the action.  In fact, the competition commissioner was very much 
a part of the action.  However, certain aspects of the 
Competition Act had to be suspended for that period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The commissioner sent me a letter in the middle of that 90 day 
period with many suggestions.  Subsequently, many of those 
suggestions were part of the policy framework that I issued last 
October in front of the standing committee.  The commissioner of 
competition very much had his say in this particular exercise. In 
fact, the framework was the second step in the process.  I asked 
the committees of the House and the Senate to review the 
framework and come up with ideas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committees of both the House and the Senate worked very 
hard.  They should be congratulated for putting in many hours, 
many more than are normally spent in the course of deliberation. 
They did this because they knew that restructuring the airline 
industry in Canada was essential for the benefit of all 
Canadians.  I thank my colleagues in the House and in the Senate 
for the work that they did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was encouraging to note the degree of consensus that we saw 
between the two committees on the key issues relating to 
fostering of competition and protecting the consumer.  On a 
number of issues it was clear that once we had seen the 
committees' recommendations we could see the support for the 
initiative set out in the policy framework. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members know, the response to the recommendations of the 
standing committee of the House was tabled, as is required by the 
rules, on February 17.  I felt it was useful to table the 
government's official response at the same time as we brought in 
our bill to restructure the airline industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to focus on the link between the October policy 
framework, much of it rooted in the advice from the commissioner 
of competition, and this bill which is now before the House, Bill 
C-26.  The policy framework outlined two overriding principles 
and five key areas of public concern that I first spoke of last 
September.  The principles were that safety would not be 
compromised and that the Official Languages Act would apply to 
Air Canada or any future dominant carrier and be effectively 
implemented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The five areas of concern for Canadian travellers were the areas 
of pricing, fostering competition, Canadian ownership and 
control, service to small communities and a fair treatment of 
employees.  We also indicated that we would put in place a 
special review process for mergers and acquisitions in the 
airline industry and make the terms and conditions of approval 
enforceable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it became clear that the Air Canada offer to acquire the 
shares of Canadian remained the only proposal on the table, after 
the withdrawal Onex last fall, our attention turned to trying to 
see that the conditions for approval were fair, just and met the 
terms and conditions of the policy framework. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We allowed this transaction, the acquisition of Canadian 
Airlines by Air Canada, to take place based on undertakings 
negotiated between the commissioner of competition and Air Canada 
on commitments made by Air Canada to me. 
These details were contained in an exchange of letters between 
Air Canada, myself and the commissioner of competition that have 
been made public. Again the whole notion that we saw in some of 
the business press that the commissioner of competition and his 
staff were not involved in this process was totally false.

<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are now engaged in the fourth and final step in the process. 
That is the legislative step.  It is the most important step 
because it will give the statutory framework that will allow 
implementation of our policy and will enshrine measures to 
enforce the commitments and undertakings made by Air Canada to 
the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our goals in this legislation are to enhance consumer protection 
and to foster competition.  Our key objective is to ensure that 
we effectively protect consumers from any abuse by the dominant 
carrier.  We have a number of measures in the bill to deal with a 
wide range of issues including monopoly pricing, conditions of 
carriage, market exit, official languages and monitoring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On monopoly pricing, there is no question that there will be 
some routes in the country especially in smaller communities 
where there will only be Air Canada offering service. That is a 
monopoly.  We have to make sure that the people in those 
communities are not taken advantage of. We will not tolerate 
price gouging. That is why we are amending the Canada 
Transportation Act by this legislation to ensure that the 
Canadian Transportation Agency has the authority and the ability 
to look at the prices on monopoly routes and has the power to 
roll them back and the power to deal very rigorously with Air 
Canada to protect the consumer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Transportation Agency can do this, not just as it 
is now with a complaint from a member of the public.  Many people 
are upset about prices but they never take the time to complain. 
They think that somehow their complaint will not be heard.  That 
is not true.  There is a provision for complaints to be heard. 
What we are doing in this bill is we are saying that the Canadian 
Transportation Agency will have the authority on its own 
initiative to monitor the prices, to audit the prices much like 
national revenue audits taxation, audits taxpayers, to see where 
there are abuses.  That will go a long way in giving comfort to 
the consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Incidentally this will apply not only to passenger fares on 
monopoly routes but also to cargo rates on monopoly routes. 
Business of course will also have the advantage there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have also moved to some degree on what we call the conditions 
of carriage.  This is a complementary consumer protection measure 
that will restore the Canadian Transportation Agency's authority 
to review the terms and conditions of carriage on domestic 
service which cover such things as compensation for lost baggage 
or being bumped from flights.  This already exists on 
international services but now it has been restored to the agency 
for domestic services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been some discussion recently about a bill of rights 
for passengers.  I am very interested in looking at what happens 
in the committee and hearing the views of members of the 
committee.  Perhaps there will be amendments offered to make sure 
that we give comfort to passengers that they are not going to be 
abused not just on pricing but on the terms of carriage, that 
they indeed will have quality service which is fair to all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously a lot of the onus is on the airlines themselves.  If 
airlines do not give good service, then in the normal course of 
events people can go elsewhere. They can do this with charter 
companies; if they do not like a particular charter company they 
can book through some other operator.  It becomes of great 
concern when we are going to a dominant carrier. That is why I 
really do look forward to some of the suggestions that will come 
from my colleagues on this front. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We always said that we were going to protect communities and we 
are going to protect communities.  As is known, in the deal that 
was announced, Air Canada has agreed to provide and to maintain 
services to communities that were receiving services by Canadian 
Airlines for three years.  That is a guarantee that smaller 
communities will not be left out of this particular 
restructuring. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1020"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are also doing is amending section 65 of the Canada 
Transportation Act to ensure that the exit provisions are 
toughened up.  Right now the last and second last carrier can 
give 60 days notice before they exit but that is not good enough. 
We are making it 120 days.  I know some people will say to make 
it longer but quite frankly, if we make it too long, no one will 
venture into a market in the first place. If they feel that the 
market might not work out, why would they get in if they cannot 
get out easily?  We are saying that 120 days should do the trick 
in this sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also we are saying in the legislation that there is an 
obligation by those carriers that remove service to consult with 
the local communities.  That will be rigorously enforced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The experience has been in the last 10 to 15 years even in the 
most remote communities in northern Canada that wherever a 
carrier withdraws, some other carrier comes in because there is 
always a market to be served.  It could be served in other ways 
with smaller aircraft or with different kinds of frequencies. 
Our experience has been that communities always maintain their 
service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were four communities that unfortunately, because they 
were served by InterCanadian, got left out in the cold recently. 
I am pleased to note that in Stephenville service has been 
restored by other competitors.  Air Canada has agreed to go into 
Charlo and provide some services. This shows that if a market is 
there, it has to be served and it can be served by the dominant 
carrier or it can be served by others coming into the field. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing that is very important to us in government is the 
Official Languages Act.  We also acknowledge the necessity for 
consumers to be served by the national carrier in both official 
languages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For this reason, we are proposing to amend the Air Canada Public 
Participation Act, in order to make it responsible for ensuring 
that services provided to its customers by the carriers in its 
group, both present and future, comply with the Official 
Languages Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Air services provided by the regional carriers in its group 
operating in eastern Canada should comply immediately after this 
bill is passed.  Subsidiaries in the rest of the country will 
have a year to meet requirements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian Airline Internationals Ltd. would have three years to 
comply, from the time they became a subsidiary of Air Canada, 
with the possibility of a one year extension determined later on 
a case-by-case basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, when Canadian Airline Internationals Ltd. replaces Air 
Canada or one of its affiliates on a route, they would be 
required to comply as if Air Canada were continuing to supply 
the service. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On monitoring, it is not good enough just to bring in the law 
and make the changes that we are proposing today; all of the 
measures here have to be surveyed.  The consumer has to be 
protected.  We have to make sure there is some oversight. That is 
why I will shortly be naming a very prominent person to oversee 
the behaviour of the carriers, to make sure that consumers are 
protected, to look at how the agency is handling the changes and 
indeed the Competition Bureau and Transport Canada to make sure 
that all of this restructuring goes as smoothly as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second goal of the bill is to foster competition.  We are 
doing this in a number of ways.  I will not relay all of the 
undertakings Air Canada has made to the commissioner of 
competition and to the government.  However, these undertakings 
are indeed very important to foster competition: surrendering 
slots at airports and facilities at airports; the selling of 
surplus aircraft to other Canadian operators; to put Canadian 
Regional Airlines up for sale, and that evaluation is now 
ongoing; to provide access to frequent flyer programs; to provide 
access to interlining and joint fare agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words if they are not part of the Air Canada empire, 
take First Air for example, they can book from Iqaluit to Los 
Angeles through Montreal then on to Air Canada. There is no 
discrimination.  They get the full benefit. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1025"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT5"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT5"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1025
<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>People do not understand that interlining allows for every 
single carrier, whether it is First Air, Bearskin, or any of 
these carriers, to feed in to the Air Canada network.  They may 
not get the frequent flyer points unless they make a deal with 
Air Canada and agree to purchase them, but certainly it shows a 
seamlessness of service so that there is no discrimination, 
especially against smaller communities. It is okay for people 
like me who live in Toronto.  Those of us in big cities have 
access, but smaller communities need to know that this 
interlining will give this.  And as my colleague from up the 
valley has said, Pem Air is one of those carriers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are very important measures.  We are also proposing to 
change, by the deal that the bureau made, the way that override 
commissions are paid to travel agents.  There are also measures 
for Air Canada to refrain from starting a discount air operation 
in eastern Canada for a specified period of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Failure to comply with any of the undertakings made under this 
particular agreement with the commissioner is subject to very 
severe fines and imprisonment.  Some people say we are being too 
hard, but those penalties are in the Competition Act now.  If 
they are good enough for any other business person in Canada, 
they have to be good enough for the people who run Air Canada and 
the airline industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That certainly will help a lot to foster competition, but there 
are other means.  The commissioner has called for very strict 
measures on predatory pricing.  Quite frankly I wonder why we 
have not done this before.  When I say we, I mean the collective 
we of governments in the past. We might not have been in this 
situation today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to make sure that predatory behaviour in air services is 
properly identified, monitored and that actions are taken against 
it, so that we do not see Air Canada, the dominant carrier, drive 
the WestJets and others into bankruptcy by the use of predatory 
pricing. This bill will give the commissioner of competition the 
power to issue temporary cease and desist orders where he sees 
cases of predatory behaviour in the airline industry.  That is 
very significant in protecting consumers and promoting 
competition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems that just about everyone in the business schools and 
business newspapers says that the only way we are going to get 
competition in the airline industry now is to let the Americans 
in, to have reciprocal cabotage; let United Airlines with its 
1,100 planes, American with its 900 planes, Delta and US Air with 
hundreds of planes, come in and provide the competition.  They 
say that would be great for Canadian consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What would that do if we did that right now?  Air Canada would 
go down the tubes.  We have not gone through all the heartache 
with Canadian Airlines over the last 10 years to now wash Air 
Canada down the drain. We have to give Air Canada the chance to 
establish itself.  It is now the 10th world airline in terms of 
size.  We have to give Air Canada the ability to compete. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One airline industry analyst, Mr. Jacques Kavafian, who is often 
quoted and is one of the few people I read, actually knew what he 
was talking about.  He said that if the American carriers applied 
3% of their capacity to the Canadian market, Air Canada would be 
gone within six months to one year.  We are not going to allow 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all those people who say that we have to let the Americans 
in because that is the only way we are going to get competition, 
what are they saying about Canadian businesses?  What are they 
saying about Canadian entrepreneurs?  The government has faith 
that Canadian entrepreneurs will come forward and provide the 
service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could speak longer under the rules and there are a lot of 
other things I want to talk about, especially about how we have 
helped travel agents and other measures for the protection of the 
consumer.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk about the fair treatment of employees, because 
one of the five principles that we had to make sure of was that 
employees were protected in the best way possible.  The way we 
have done that is to entrench certain commitments in this law. 
Air Canada is making commitments to employees that no more than 
2,500 will be let go over the two year period, and not for two 
years, and then only by attrition or by negotiated packages.  I 
assume that Air Canada will come forward with packages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the newspaper this morning, a deal has been made 
with the CAW, the two bargaining units for Air Canada and 
Canadian, which is good.  Pilots have made a deal and it is to be 
hoped there will also be a deal with the flight attendants and 
others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have made Air Canada commit to the protection of their 
unionized employees.  There is to be no forced relocation or 
involuntary layoffs of employees of Canadian Airlines or their 
wholly owned subsidiaries for a period of two years.  It appears 
that the airline is doing its best to meet those commitments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that hon. members will forgive me if I use a bit of 
hyperbole.  This was a tough file.  I have had a lot of tough 
files in my political career, but this was really tough.  I think 
it was an accomplishment for the government.  This government has 
had a lot of accomplishments, but this was an accomplishment 
because in no other country the size of Canada, a member of the 
G-7, a wealthy country with 30 million people, has a country been 
able to take the number one airline and the number two airline 
and put them together with minimum disruption to service, no loss 
of jobs, no bankruptcy and not a nickel in subsidy or bail out by 
the taxpayers.  I say that is an accomplishment and we should be 
proud of that accomplishment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that when the bill is finally passed and given royal 
assent it will be seen as a landmark piece of legislation that 
will give us stability in the sky.  It has given Air Canada the 
underpinning it needs to compete with the biggest and the best in 
the world.  Everybody will know that the Canadian airline 
industry is in good shape.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Madam Speaker, I find it ironic that the minister 
is taking all the credit for what happened.  I think that the 
companies involved deserve a lot of the accolades for taking a 
bad situation and dealing with it to minimize the damage to the 
travelling public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would agree that the legislation is a response to the airline 
merger wars that we saw last year.  The Standing Committee on 
Transport and the Senate committee dealt with those issues and 
heard many witnesses who shared with us their concerns and their 
problems.  I would not disagree with the minister that it was a 
difficult file. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think the preferred outcome that Canadians really 
wanted was to have one dominant air carrier.  I think many 
Canadians, like myself, would rather have seen two Canadian air 
carriers providing competition in the marketplace.  However, it 
was quite clear that the reality was that would not happen, that 
either we would have a bankruptcy, which would put the one 
dominant carrier in a monopoly position, or we would have a 
merger.  I think Canadians can be somewhat pleased that the 
outcome was a merger rather than a bankruptcy.  At least it is to 
be hoped that will be the outcome. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reality is that we now have a company which controls 80% of the 
domestic market.  That is the result of previous government 
interference and involvement in the airline industry.  Previous 
government regulation is largely responsible for the situation in 
which Canadian and Air Canada found themselves. 
Years of poor legislation and regulation put those companies in 
the very vulnerable position where they were unable to compete in 
the international market.  Given the situation of the industry 
last fall, some would say that this bill is a reasonable response 
to that situation.  It gives Air Canada a period of time to 
reorganize after the acquisition of Canadian Airlines and its 
debt.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-26 holds Air Canada to the commitments it made to the 
government and to the competition commissioner in the letter of 
December 21.  Air Canada will be held to its commitments, 
including the promise to smaller communities to provide air 
service, at least for a period of three years, and the promise to 
employees that there will be a controlled reduction of the 
employee force after a period of two years, and that the 
reduction will occur through attrition.  We hope that this bill 
will hold it to that commitment.  It also agreed to give up slots 
in some of the major airports and to sell the surplus aircraft to 
domestic companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-26 makes a lot of these commitments enforceable.  That is 
important.  There has to be some way to make sure that those 
commitments which Air Canada made in its presentations to the 
government, the standing committee and to Canadians are met.  It 
made commitments to Canadians, the Canadian travelling public and 
Canadian taxpayers.  I think it is important that there be some 
way of holding it to those commitments, and Bill C-26 tries to do 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also tries to make sure that those commitments made by Air 
Canada are enforceable and that there is some way to make sure 
the corporate entity responds in kind to those commitments and 
promises. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some would say that the $10 million fines and the five year 
incarcerations are quite heavy.  The minister has said that they 
already exist in the Competition Act.  Canadians would feel a lot 
more comfortable if those fines and levels of incarceration were 
also to apply to the government when it makes commitments that it 
fails to follow through on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is trying to hold corporate Canada accountable to 
commitments it made, and that is a good thing.  It would be nice 
if it would expand that to include itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also is an attempt to have some control over increased air 
fares.  The travelling Canadian public are very concerned that 
now that we have a dominant carrier, which controls 80% of the 
air routes, fares will rise to a level that they will no longer 
be able to afford.  The intent of this bill is to put into place, 
through the Canadian Transportation Agency, the means to make 
sure that does not happen, that controls and monitoring can be 
imposed on the company without needing the individual traveller 
to complain about these sorts of increases in airfares before 
they can be dealt with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are problems with this bill.  One of the problems that I 
foresee, and I am sure others have as well, is that in giving the 
Canadian Transportation Agency these new powers to do the 
monitoring there will be a tendency to hire a lot of new staff 
who will create work to justify their positions.  In creating the 
work to justify their positions, they expand and develop an 
empire.  That is something which the government must ensure does 
not happen.  There must be some control in the development of the 
bureaucracy that develops the need to monitor beyond the point 
that they really need to be doing that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bureaucratic empire will also create an equal response from 
the airline industry, and not only Air Canada.  It will not only 
affect Air Canada, but any other small airline that is in a 
monopoly position. 
It will create an equal response from the airline.  How many 
people would they have to hire to react to this bureaucratic 
empire which might be built?  There is an onus on the government 
to make sure that does not happen.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Transportation Agency must also determine which are 
monopoly routes.  Many of the monopoly routes flown in this 
country will not be flown by Air Canada but by smaller airlines 
like First Air and Bearskin Airlines.  They will be brought into 
this monopoly route situation with the Canadian Transportation 
Agency overseeing them.  I am not saying that should not happen, 
but we have to make sure that it does not happen to the degree 
that it overexceeds the need.  This would result in the situation 
where the smaller airlines would either start asking the CTA for 
advice before they entered a route or before they asked for an 
increase of the fare, or they would end up having to provide the 
resources to those small airlines to compete with the demands 
being placed on them by this bureaucratic agency which had been 
given this new role. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have to be controls and there has to be an understanding 
of what is a monopoly route.  We will have to be more careful in 
that area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the other problems is the inclusion of cargo in the fare 
increase.  Yes, there may be a reason for including cargo, but it 
has not been made clear.  Evidence has not been presented to 
justify including cargo in the new agency's responsibilities. 
This measure would concern many of the smaller airlines which 
service the north.  It is not realistic for any airline to be 
expected to transport cargo below cost.  It is going to have to 
be shown through concrete evidence that there is a requirement to 
include cargo in the provisions of the CTA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other area I have some concern with is the exit provision. 
I know that with Inter-Canadien there were great problems in the 
way it was handled.  It created a discontinuation of services 
which caused a lot of problems for the travelling public. 
However, the exit provisions in the new legislation require a 
carrier to give four months notice if it intends to withdraw 
services, not only all of its services, but 50% of the service 
provided to the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is hard to test a market if the airlines have to be in it for 
four months.  It is expensive for a smaller airline to be 
committed to four months of service.  I wonder if WestJet would 
have gone into Abbotsford, which was its first major test of the 
market, if it had had to stay for four months.  I am a little 
concerned that this might eliminate competition in the 
marketplace because it puts a heavy burden on the airlines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister feels that the 120 days will not do that.  I would 
like to think that the committee would hear from smaller airlines 
which might be concerned about the exit provision.  I will take 
the minister at his word that he will look at the amendments and 
the recommendations that come out of the committee hearings to 
improve the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The competition commissioner feels that the best way to ensure 
reasonable airfares is competition.  Airlines are extremely 
expensive.  They need a lot of capital to operate, buy equipment 
and fly that equipment.  The 25% limit on foreign ownership is 
very restrictive.  The 25% limit is a regulation that can be 
changed at any time. 
There is no commitment from the government in the legislation to 
consider that in the future. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1045"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT8"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to think that the government will at least 
entertain the thought that after a two year period the 25% 
limitation on foreign ownership will be lifted to 49% to allow 
more capital to come in to support Canadian carriers in providing 
the competition that Canada will require. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The competition commissioner has also suggested that there be no 
limitations on Canadian carriers as to foreign investment.  I 
agree that Air Canada should be given the two years, but at the 
end of that two year period there has to be a commitment to 
increase the competition if it has not been created through 
Canadian carriers.  Canadian carriers might be more able to 
increase that level of competition with Air Canada if it had 
access to foreign investment and ownership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another concern I have is that there is no mention or commitment 
that the monopoly carrier cannot use its influence to restrict 
access to airports for other Canadian carriers.  Today we see it 
might be an issue where a Canadian carrier is being restricted to 
an airport by the airport authority.  I do not think that should 
be allowed.  I do not think Canadians want to see an airport 
authority having that kind of decision making ability and being 
able to refuse a Canadian carrier access to Canadian airports.  I 
think that should be addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another area the bill does not deal with to the extent 
I feel Canadians would like.  The Government of Canada should not 
be involved in limiting Canadian ownership in Canadian companies. 
In the Air Canada Public Participation Act the extension from 10% 
to 15% just does not cut it.  It is irrelevant.  The whole issue 
is that the Government of Canada should not have the right to 
restrict Canadian ownership in a Canadian company.  I would 
suggest that needs to be addressed.  It needs to be looked at and 
removed completely from the books. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know there have been problems with the acquisition of 
Canadian Airlines by Air Canada.  We are starting to see them 
happen every day at the airport.  I know it is difficult for Air 
Canada to try to rationalize the service of the two airlines, 
putting them together and getting rid of the overcapacity. 
However, the complaints from the travelling public are starting 
to get very loud. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Flights are being significantly overbooked.  Fifteen or twenty 
people were left standing at the airport when I flew to Ottawa 
from Vancouver.  They had arrived at the airport thinking they 
had a seat on the aircraft.  That is not acceptable and has to 
stop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Schedules are being changed with passengers not being informed. 
Passengers are arriving at airports to find that the connecting 
flight they were going to take has already left or has been 
changed or that they have been rebooked on a later flight without 
being told.  Those sorts of things are not acceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am hoping that they are growing pains, that they are something 
we are seeing in the short term and will be addressed in the long 
term.  My fear is that the public will only accept a certain 
level of this kind of treatment.  Seeing as how they do not have 
a viable alternative, there will be a pressure for more 
regulation.  That is not a direction I would like to see the 
government go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The answer is not to get back into overregulating the airline 
industry.  The answer is to hold Air Canada accountable for being 
a good, responsible corporate citizen and for being upfront and 
honest in the commitments it has made to the travelling public.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The difficulties we are seeing are not just with the travelling 
public.  They are also with the employees.  The minister said 
earlier that one of the conditions was that there would be fair 
treatment of the employees in this transition period.  I think 
Air Canada made that commitment to the minister.  He certainly 
made that commitment to the Standing Committee on Transport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is evidence out there today that some issues have to be 
resolved.  Two unions have come to an agreement and that is good 
news.  Some of the unions are realizing that it is the new 
reality and they have to come to an agreement.  I do not disagree 
with the company that the unions have to deal with seniority 
lists, but there are still the issues of seniority lists and of 
fair treatment of employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not just seniority lists.  An incident happened in Ottawa 
where the language requirements have come into play.  I agree 
with the minister that part of the legislation is that the 
airlines comply with the Official Languages Act.  The act is 
quite clear.  There are designated bilingual areas and there is a 
percentage of population that is required in order for the second 
official language to come into effect.  I would like to think 
that the requirements for the airlines will not be any higher 
than the Official Languages Act stipulates, that there will not 
be any additional requirement placed on the airlines that go 
beyond the Official Languages Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue that came up in Ottawa was that 60 baggage handlers in 
the Ottawa airport were given layoff notices apparently because 
of an inability to speak French.  One has to ask where was Air 
Canada's commitment not to lay off employees for a two year 
period of time.  I would like to think that this will stop after 
the legislation passes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened to people being able to work in the language of 
their choice?  The argument from the bilingualism proponents is 
that supervisors need to be bilingual in order to speak to the 
workers in either language, but that is not the case here.  It 
has to be addressed with Air Canada that it cannot be allowed to 
continue to allow one employee group to lord over the other ones 
and to place expectations that should not be placed on them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the official opposition will allow the bill to go 
to committee because we think that is where it needs to go.  We 
will give it very close scrutiny in committee to make sure that 
all players and all stakeholders have an opportunity to look at 
the legislation, how it will affect them, and to make suggestions 
on how the legislation can be improved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister said in the House this morning that he would listen 
to the recommendations from the committee and would consider the 
proposed amendments.  I take him up on that.  I take him up on 
the commitment he made this morning to give consideration to the 
outcome of the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition is quite prepared to play the watchdog 
role with Air Canada to make sure that Air Canada meets its 
obligation and the commitments it has made to the government, to 
the opposition and to the Canadian travelling public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the dominant air carrier with 80% control of the domestic 
marketplace Air Canada is close to a monopoly.  If it becomes 
disrespectful of the travelling public because of its position, 
the official opposition will substantially increase its efforts 
to increase the foreign ownership component in the Canadian 
airline industry to provide real competition.  We are prepared to 
give Air Canada two years to make the adjustments to make the 
merger work, but not if it continually abuses the travelling 
public.  I support the government in sending the bill to 
committee for further study.

each type of fuel, be indicated separately from the sale price 
on any document or bill confirming the sale.

indicate separately the fuel tax on sale confirmation documents.

force retailers to comply with section 12 of the Quebec

</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, I would like to quote from the industry minister. These 
are his very concerns.  This does not come from the press. This 
is a direct quote.  He said “When I first became responsible for 
ACOA we talked about the credibility of these job forecasts. They 
have proven to be lacking in credibility”. That was the actual

the Liberal side of the House voted against it because they had 
concerns about how much actual job creation it would give. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government is manipulating Canadians.  The minister 
can stand and blame the press, blame the opposition, blame anyone 
he likes, but he knows that Cape Bretoners are reeling right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is on record as saying that these programs do not 
actually create long term jobs.  Cape Bretoners deserve better 
than this.  I am sure the minister would agree with me that these

just benefit politically?

Wheat Board's stranglehold over farmers, grain companies and the 
railways.  When will the Minister of Transport introduce 
legislation to implement these recommendations? 
<P><A NAME="LINK97"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, this has been a very complex process. We appointed 
former Justice Estey to look at the matter.  He brought forward 
landmark recommendations that were then analyzed by a former 
deputy minister of the federal government, Mr. Kroeger.  We have 
been analyzing those recommendations internally.  We have been 
discussing the various options. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am still hopeful that despite the heavy legislative load the 
House has, we will be able to bring in a bill after the Easter 
recess.  If we do, I hope that the opposition will co-operate 
with us fully. 
<P><A NAME="LINK98"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it looks as if the Canadian Wheat 
Board tail is wagging the Liberal dog.  The presidents of 
Canada's five major grain companies have joined the farmers' call 
for transportation reform, including the role of the Canadian 
Wheat Board.  The savings from the grain transportation reform 
would be $15,000 per year per farmer.  This is $4,000 more than 
the government's AIDA program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is mismanaging money in HRDC and preserving the control of 
the Canadian Wheat Board more important to the government than 
farm families? 
<P><A NAME="LINK99"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member has taken great licence with the 
facts here in talking about one subject dealing with HRDC and 
another with potential grain reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone is in general agreement that there must be a more 
competitive system in the marketing and transportation of grain. 
Certainly the role of the Canadian Wheat Board has been a very 
important one to Canada's economy and will continue to be in the 
years to come. The question is to what degree the board will 
continue to have an involvement in the transportation of grains. 
These are all issues we are looking at currently.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is not in possession of the facts. 
We have to find a balanced solution that deals with the rights of 
producers, that deals with the efficiencies and the viability of 
the grain companies.  We have to look at the viability of the 
railways.  We also have to look at the role that the wheat board 
has played in the last 60 years in ensuring fairness in the

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unfair to talk about one particular component in this

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords—Lloydminster, Canadian

largest single expense.  What is killing western farmers is the 
heavy duty freight rate.  Half of the producer's cheque on his 
produce goes to freight and elevation.  That has to change. 
Three hundred million dollars in gained revenues for farmers is 
real money.  It is not smoke and mirrors public relations money

Mr. Speaker, the government works collegially, but it is quite 
obvious from the tone of the questions that the Reform Party is a

What it is doing is siding with the railway companies, siding 
with the grain companies and it is not thinking about the

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CANADA TRANSPORTATION ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK166">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-26, an 
act to amend the Canada Transportation Act, the Competition Act, 
the Competition Tribunal Act and the Air Canada Public 
Participation Act and to amend another act in consequence, be 
read the second time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK167"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
speak to Bill C-26 and to tell the members of the House the few 
reservations the Bloc Quebecois has with respect to this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will, of course, support the principle of this bill at second 
reading.  This bill amends the Canada Transportation Act, the 
Competition Act, the Competition Tribunal Act and the Air Canada 
Public Participation Act and amends another act in consequence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at the context of the bill, we realize that it 
follows on a series of federal government disasters in air 
transportation.  After putting the entire industry at risk and 
leaving the regions to their own devices and after showing 
political favouritism toward its Onex friends, Canadian Airlines 
and American Airlines, the Minister of Transport was obliged to 
accept the opinion of the Bloc Quebecois.  It was high time and 
we were very pleased at that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why will we support this?  Essentially, it is because, since 
1993, the Bloc Quebecois has been asking the government to stop 
artificially buoying up Canadian Airlines International at the 
expense of Air Canada, to the tune of hundreds of millions of 
dollars.  For six years, the Bloc Quebecois has been saying 
Canada could not support two international carriers.

<A HREF="#LINKT25"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government's attitude has blocked the expansion of 
Air Canada, and thus the economy and employment situation in the 
Montreal region, out of political opportunism.  We are therefore 
in favour of the bill, because its purpose is to provide a 
framework for the merger of Air Canada and Canadian 
International Airlines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another reason is that the Bloc Quebecois has been involved 
throughout its whole existence in decrying the lax manner in 
which the Official Languages Act is applied by the federal 
government. 
The fact that this government was heavily subsidizing Canadian 
International Airlines, which was not subject to the Official 
Languages Act, was insulting.  By allowing the merger of two 
carriers under the Air Canada banner, this bill will ensure that 
the new carrier is subject to the Official Languages Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This represents some progress, particularly since the bill picks 
up the main thrust of the recommendations in the Bloc Quebecois 
dissenting opinion, rather than those of the Standing Committee 
on Transport.  Compliance with the Official Languages Act, 
however, requires more than merely making this carrier subject 
to the act.  It needs to be enforced, and it is the federal 
government's responsibility to see that it is.  We all know that 
its record in this area is none too good.  A careful eye must 
therefore be kept on the situation. 
The Bloc Quebecois will make itself the Official Languages Act 
watchdog. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another reason why we approve in principle of this bill on 
second reading is that it also contains a whole series of 
measures aimed at reinforcing competition.  This is particularly 
important because Air Canada will become the dominant carrier in 
Canada and in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where international connections are concerned, there is not much 
risk of a monopoly developing, because Air Canada will have to 
compete with the other international carriers.  Where the 
regions are concerned, however, particularly isolated ones, 
competition is far from assured. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill contains some worthwhile measures, but is far from 
guaranteeing that these measures will be sufficient to provide 
decent service at decent prices in the regions. 
I will get back to this a little later on. It is one of the 
reservations I alluded to a few minutes ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, this bill contains provisions relating to the effective 
control of air carriers in Canada. We know that, last fall, the 
Minister of Transport, the minister responsible for carriers, 
was prepared to sell both air carriers to American Airlines, 
through Gerry Schwartz, a Liberal friend. It took a superior 
court ruling to put an end to this folly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister seems to have returned to a better frame of mind 
with this bill, but it is difficult to understand why he wants 
to increase the individual share ownership limit from 10% to 15% 
in the case of Air Canada. We think that the existing limit of 
10% has served Canadians and Quebecers very well. To increase 
that limit to 15% seems to be a futile measure on the part of 
the minister, who probably just wants to save face. 
But the fact is that he could once again lose face instead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this bill, the minister maintains his power to unilaterally 
amend by order in council the 25% limit on an air carrier's 
capital fund that can be owned by foreign interests. This 
provision is totally unacceptable and constitutes a denial of 
our parliamentary institution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If, some day, the minister decided that he wanted to change this 
provision, why would he not introduce an amendment in the House? 
The fact is the minister is giving himself or maintaining this 
arbitrary power, because he knows full well that he has lost the 
confidence of this House, of the air transportation industry and 
of Quebecers and Canadians at large.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the bill is to provide a framework for the 
restructuring of the airline industry following Air Canada's 
acquisition of Canadian Airlines International and its 
subsidiaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is therefore necessary, but is flawed as it now stands. 
Several problems remain, especially those having to do with 
regional service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, let us take another look at the Bloc Quebecois' 
dissenting opinion in committee. 
In December, the Bloc Quebecois decided to present a dissenting 
opinion to the Standing Committee on Transport in order to 
express its disagreement with the majority report on the 
following points:  Air Canada's share ownership, foreign 
ownership in Canadian carriers, airline safety, compliance with 
the Official Languages Act, airfares, service to outlying 
regions and, finally, the future of regional carriers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take a brief look at each of the points in the 
dissenting opinion.  I will add one thing, however.  When I 
mentioned airline safety, I should point out that this is not 
addressed in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, there is Air Canada's share ownership.  In its dissenting 
opinion, the Bloc Quebecois recommended that the rule limiting 
to 10% the volume of voting shares in Air Canada that may be 
held by a single individual or group be kept. 
The bill proposes raising this limit to 15%.  The Bloc Quebecois 
does not agree that this change is necessary.  A 5% increase in 
this limit, however, would not present an obvious risk of 
control in fact being taken of Air Canada.  A 5% increase is 
clearly not huge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, if it is not a huge percentage, why is any increase at 
all needed if the bill's definition of control in fact is not 
amended? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Carriage by Air Act contains a definition of control in fact 
but it was not helpful in the case of American Airlines' 
takeover of Canadian. 
In the bill before us, the definition is strictly limited to 25% 
of voting shares. This is not enough, because some recent cases 
have shown that such a limit is not sufficient to prevent 
foreign control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois is of the opinion that this definition must 
include a reference to control of operations and investments. 
For example, AMR held only 25% of voting shares in Canadian 
Airlines International, and yet it controlled the company 
through a service contract and a right of veto on important 
decisions by Canadian Airlines International, which gave AMR de 
facto control over the company. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sadly, we must keep reminding the government, a nationalist 
government that shows its colours everywhere, of this. It is sad 
that the government has to be reminded of the Nagano games with 
regard to its desire to be nationalist and to show it.

<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just think about the ultranationalist speeches the Liberals made 
when we wanted to discuss the possibility of a continental 
currency. Just think about the tens of millions of dollars spent 
each year by the Liberal government to promote Canada in a way 
that, more often than not, looks like crude propaganda. In that 
context, is control of an international air carrier not of the 
utmost importance? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Jobs in that industry are, for the most part, strategic, good 
paying jobs that bring valuable knowledge. A healthy air 
transport industry is essential to an advanced economy. Rhetoric 
seems to be enough for this government. But it is not for the 
Bloc Quebecois. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last fall, we found ourselves in the rather ironical situation 
of bearing, as the Quebec sovereignty party, the standard of 
Quebec's interests of course, but also of Canada's interests, 
against the Government of Canada, which was prepared to hand 
over control of the industry to Americans.  Ridicule does not 
kill.  That illustrates our basic positions.  We are 
sovereignists and we are proposing partnership with Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This example illustrates our position perfectly, because in the 
Onex-Air Canada matter, Quebec's and Canada's economic interests 
were mixed.  We got calls from Toronto, Ottawa, the Maritimes 
and elsewhere in Canada. Canadians wanted us to continue our 
fight.  They were ashamed of their federal government and they 
were right.  The minister has to understand that and not start 
this business all over again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With Bill C-26, the minister continues to give himself the right 
to amend the 25% limit by order. 
As I said earlier, this is totally unacceptable.  If the 
minister wants to amend the rule sometime, let him do so in the 
House.  Let him introduce an amendment to the laws concerned and 
allow it to be debated where it must, where the representatives 
of the people sit to debate it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to return to the Official Languages Act.  The 
government adopted the Bloc Quebecois's position on official 
languages.  Our position essentially reiterated the opinion 
expressed by the commissioner before the Standing Committee on 
Transport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are satisfied with these legislative measures, but the Bloc 
Quebecois remains somewhat concerned about the application of 
these principles.  Although, Air Canada has long been bound by 
the Official Languages Act, its affiliated regional carriers 
have frequently been lax in their application of this law. 
It is not enough to pass legislation. Legislation also has to be 
enforced. On that, this government's record is none too good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would now like to say a few words on the price of airline 
tickets. These prices are often out of line, particularly in 
smaller communities. To counter this practice, the bill 
establishes some measures, based on competition and price 
monitoring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The two organizations responsible for enforcing these measures, 
the Commissioner of Competition and the Canadian Transportation 
Agency, have seen an increase in their powers and in the means 
at their disposal. However, the bill should provide that an 
assessment be made every year in the first three years after its 
passage, to validate the results obtained through these measures and 
to ensure that the commitments made by Air Canada management 
have been honoured. 
Fine promises have to be kept, and that requires regular checks.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as the service to remote areas is concerned, the bill 
deals neither with services provided or not provided by the 
airline companies nor with the quality or diversity of these 
services, except to require carriers to consult with elected 
officials in the region before abandoning a regional route and 
to inform them of their intention to do so. As well, the 
minister reserves the right to reduce the 120 day period that 
the airline companies have to abide by before abandoning a 
route. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is completely unacceptable, because it leaves to much room to 
arbitrary decisions. 
In this case also, the bill should provide that an assessment be 
made every year in the first three years after its passage, to 
validate the results obtained through these measures and to 
ensure that the commitments made by Air Canada management have 
been honoured. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When one feels one is being watched, one is always more careful 
to comply with self-imposed policies and directives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is huge, and so is Quebec. People living in remote areas 
need an efficient, affordable and well maintained transportation 
network. This government's policy goes in the opposite way. For 
this government, it would appear that regions are not 
financially viable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an inept way of dealing with the issue of regional 
transportation. It is certainly not a coincidence that the 
government has serious political problems in the regions. 
The government has abandoned the regions, and this is best 
exemplified by transportation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk also about the future of regional carriers. This 
issue is tackled only indirectly in the bill through the 
provisions dealing with competition, mainly. The Bloc Quebecois, 
in its dissenting opinion, was against the creation of a new 
regional carrier under the control of a dominant carrier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since Air Canada has given up that project, we are satisfied 
with the measures dealing with competition. However, the bill 
should provide that an assessment be made every year in the 
first three years after its passage, to validate the results 
obtained through these measures and to ensure that the 
commitments made by Air Canada management have been honoured. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois is consistent in its positions. On three 
occasions we asked that an assessment take place every year to 
make sure the goals are being met. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also would like to speak about the problems of service to 
remote areas. The two main problems faced by people in remote 
areas are high air fares and lack of frequency of flights. 
Moreover the quality of aircraft and the use of French might 
also be a problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The possible solutions, apart from strict regulation, all 
involve increased competition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Access to adequate air service must be looked at in the context 
of the deterioration of the transportation infrastructure in 
remote areas. These areas are increasingly isolated, which 
hampers their economic development. 
As we know, safety has been compromised by the minister. I would 
like to say a couple of words on this topic to illustrate my 
point.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The crash of the Air Satellite plane, which killed seven people 
on December 7 last year, only minutes after take off from the 
Baie-Comeau airport, and the crash in Gaspé, which took the lives 
of four people on April 13 last year, have brought back to the 
fore the issue of air transportation safety, an issue the Bloc 
Quebecois had already started examining. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should also be pointed out that the air traffic control 
system was privatized and sold to Nav Canada in December 1995 
for $1.5 billion. 
The auditor general underlined in his report of October 1997 
that the value of this monopoly had been estimated at $2.4 
billion by Transports Canada's financial advisers, while the 
Department of Finance estimated it at $2.6 billion. Yet, it was 
sold for $1.5 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before November 1, 1996, air navigation services were provided 
by Transports Canada and mainly financed through the air 
transportation tax paid by airline passengers. These services 
are now provided by Nav Canada. Since November 1, 1998, they are 
exclusively financed through fees paid by the airlines. The air 
transportation tax has therefore been eliminated pursuant to the 
Civil Air Navigation Services Commercialisation Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For Nav Canada, the customers or users are not the passengers 
but the airline companies. 
Therefore, Nav Canada's concerns are based on those of its 
clients, whose natural imperative remains net profit. I would 
not go as far as to say that passenger safety has become a 
secondary issue, but the fact that Nav Canada is not directly 
responsible to voters but to its corporate clients has an impact 
on the way it perceives its role. This is why we fear that this 
agency, in its decisions, might not fulfil its primary 
responsibility, which is to ensure passenger safety with the 
greatest prudence, diligence and even zeal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet, a quote from Nav Canada's Internet site suggests that this 
is not the case. I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The corporation will be all the more successful in serving its 
customers if it is able to allocate its resources where they are 
the most needed. 
This is why it has undertaken a review of the levels of service 
provided in all its facilities, so that they will match the 
volume and type of traffic in each location. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is another quote from Nav Canada found on Internet: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a matter of fact, under the Civil Air Navigation Services 
Commercialisation Act, we are only allowed to collect revenues 
necessary for the provision of services, including the reserves 
necessary to make investments and to maintain a stable financial 
structure. This is what we have done. Any surplus has to be 
given back to customers , in this case as deferments. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consequently, Nav Canada last year returned $65 million to the 
users of its services, mainly Canadian Airline Internationals 
and Air Canada.  It is clear that Nav Canada's interest lies not 
with the passenger-user, but with its customers.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Considering that Air Canada and Canadian Airline Internationals 
recorded losses in 1998 of $16 million and $137 million 
respectively, one can well imagine what happened, with the 
airlines wishing to pay less, Nav Canada adopting a cost-benefit 
approach, and the government being concerned about a company 
disappearing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Need I remind hon. members that Canadian Airline Internationals 
could not have survived without the $20 million annual fuel tax 
reduction, without the heavy dose of favouritism in awarding it 
the most lucrative air links, without a great deal of 
flexibility as far as the repayment of interest-free loans are 
concerned? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By allowing the establishment of less costly standards for the 
airlines, Transport Canada has played along with Nav Canada's 
priorities.  What are these priorities?  Are they the right 
priorities? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a press release on September 30, 1997, Nav Canada stated the 
following: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The company aims to reduce annual expenses by approximately 
$135 million, in constant dollars, by August 31, 2000. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last August, Nav Canada returned $65 million, as I have already 
said, to users of these services, mainly to Canadian 
International Airlines and Air Canada. 
Would it not have been preferable to reinvest these amounts in 
passenger safety?  But the question is whether the right 
priorities were selected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Eliminating the Baie-Comeau airport control centre on April 1, 
1995, which was not even replaced by a flight information 
station, is not an example of promotion of air transportation 
safety in the region, nor is the elimination of the flight 
information station at the Gaspé airport in 1998 and the 
threatened elimination of the flight information station in 
Roberval. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, the presence on site of air traffic control specialists 
or professional skywatchers, and take off and landing runways 
help lower the risks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the subject of risks, we are focussing particularly on the 
risks of being unable to detect quickly that an aircraft is in 
difficulty or to locate quickly a crash site near an airport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also focussing on the fact that, without a flight 
information station at an airport, it is impossible to provide 
pilots with precise weather information, in real time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We note that the Minister of Transport wrote the following on 
June 15 to our leader, Gilles Duceppe: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nav Canada's aeronautical study must prove to me that 
interruption or reduction in levels of service would not 
unacceptably increase risks to air safety. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would appear that the minister believes that there can be an 
acceptable increase in safety risks. That is what he believes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to say a few words about high prices. 
The regular plane fare from Sept-Îles to Montreal is about $800. 
This creates a vicious circle in that higher prices lead to 
decreases in the number of travellers, and decreases in the 
number of travellers lead to ever higher prices, until the route 
is not longer profitable.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are the possible solutions? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The great majority of those surveyed believe the only viable 
solution is increased competition. WestJet and, to a lesser 
extent, Air Montreal, have shown that it is possible to offer 
interregional services at low prices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, Air Montreal offers a one way ticket from Québec to 
Îles-de-la-Madeleine for $170 or from Québec to Mont-Joli for $125. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most people believe that the solution lies in increased 
competition. However, the various decision makers may consider 
different solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Among the other solutions being considered there is of course 
the abandonment of regional subsidiaries by Air Canada. Others 
believe that all regional carriers should have access to Air 
Canada's network for reservations, transfers and airport 
terminals. Some are looking at regulating airfares instead, 
while others, including the Bloc Quebecois, are looking at a tax 
reduction for regional carriers. Others yet are considering 
allowing foreign carriers, including American operators, to do 
cabotage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of frequency, few solutions have been proposed so 
far. However, the lower the airfares, the more people will fly, 
thus making it profitable for air carriers to maintain a line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say a word on the duopoly of Air Canada and Canadian 
Airlines International. This duopoly had flights at the same 
times, with planes that were half empty. 
We are of course talking about regional transportation. Many of 
these lines were not profitable but the two carriers could put 
up with some losses because they would make up for them by 
transferring regional travellers onto their international 
flights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take an example. As I mentioned earlier, a traveller from 
Sept-Îles can buy a ticket to fly from Sept-Îles to Quebec City to 
Paris for about $800. A company such as Canadian Airlines could 
afford to lose $100 on the Sept-Îles to Quebec City flight, since it 
was making $150 on the one between Quebec City and Paris. This 
makes a difference of at least $50. The two companies had an 
interest in losing money between Sept-Îles and Quebec City, since 
the planes were full between Quebec City and Paris, thus 
allowing them to make up the loss incurred during the first leg 
of the trip. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the two companies had merged, the planes would have been full 
from the start in Sept-Îles and travellers could have enjoyed 
even lower airfares. 
That is why the two carriers were ready to run the domestic 
flight in order to be able to take passengers on international 
flights and make the passenger who only wants a domestic flight 
pay a hefty price.  This sort of passenger is not desirable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same logic applied when the two carriers dropped their fares 
in order to maintain their duopoly over certain domestic 
markets.  The logic of the international market therefore played 
against the logic of the domestic market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can hope that profits will enable Air Canada to lower its 
fares but other measures will undoubtedly be necessary to 
resolve this problem.  The Bloc Quebecois will suggest some 
solutions in committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That concludes my remarks on Bill C-26 at second reading. 
We hope that the government will be receptive to any future 
amendments the Bloc Quebecois may wish to move during committee 
deliberations, so that insofar as possible we can find a long 
term solution to this transportation problem, which is not new 
in Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, today 
I am speaking on behalf of the New Democratic Party in opposition 
to the bill as it is.  We have agreed that we will do what we can 
to get the bill to committee as quickly as possible, recognizing 
the seriousness of addressing the issues concerned with the 
merger of our two major airlines and the reality of there being 
one dominant carrier in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must say that I was disappointed with the Liberal government 
on this bill.  As the New Democratic Party representative on the 
transport committee I worked very hard on this issue as did all 
the committee members from all the parties.  Last fall the 
committee heard from literally dozens of expert witnesses on this 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was disappointed but not surprised that the Liberal government 
and the transport minister ignored what Canadians had been saying 
all these months.  Instead it came up with a bill that fails to 
address the key concerns of Canadians.  Even the minister, I 
know, recognized that the bill is far from perfect, but I do not 
think there is anything wrong with our looking for that 
perfection when we get to committee and fixing the bill where it 
has fallen short. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government still does not understand the basic problem 
facing Canada's airline industry.  Our airline industry has gone 
from crisis to crisis since the Mulroney government deregulated 
it in 1987. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Deregulation has been a disaster for Canadians.  The cost of 
flying in Canada has gone up massively since deregulation began. 
Ticket price increases have been rising faster than inflation. 
The overall cost of flying has gone up a whopping 76% since 1992. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not what was supposed to happen under deregulation.  Bay 
Street lobbyists said that deregulation would bring competition 
which would drive prices down, not up.  They said there would be 
more airlines flying to more destinations than ever before.  So 
where is the competition? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been almost 13 years since deregulation began and we have 
fewer airlines, not more.  Deregulation has resulted in fewer 
airlines flying to fewer destinations and Canadians are being 
charged more for those tickets.  This is what happens when we let 
market forces take the place of smart public policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The New Democratic Party is not against markets. Often when we 
criticize the government for pandering to the market, people say 
we are against the market.  That is not the case. We are not. We 
recognize to have a strong country we need a strong market 
economy, but a healthy market is not the only thing we need for a 
healthy country.  We need to balance a strong market with 
sensible public policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not the ideology of the Liberal government.  Call it 
corporatism, call it laziness, call it lack of vision, call it 
whatever we will.  The Liberal government refuses to accept that 
the market alone cannot solve every problem. When it comes to the 
airline industry the government cannot see the forest for the 
trees. This is what happens when we are dealing strictly with 
that ideology. The Liberal government's uncritical faith in the 
free market blinds it to that reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the reality.  Under deregulation Canadians have less 
choice and are paying more for flying.  The airlines have cut 
service to small and medium size communities across the country. 
The government had to spend millions of dollars to bail out 
Canadian Airlines and then it wound up collapsing anyway.  There 
have been job cuts and wage cuts for airline employees. By 
anyone's standards deregulation has been a public policy 
disaster.  Yet the Liberal government still clings to this policy 
with the blind faith of ideology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk about the effect of deregulation on my own riding 
of Churchill.  Few areas of the country are more expensive to fly 
to than rural and northern Manitoba.  It costs more to fly from 
Thompson to Winnipeg than it does to fly from Halifax to 
Vancouver.  Airfares have skyrocketed and passengers are not 
satisfied with the service quality and availability. What this 
demonstrates is the Liberal government's short-sightedness in 
letting market forces replace public policy.

<A HREF="#LINKT33"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the logic of the market, the airlines have made decisions 
to maximize their profits by charging the highest fares they can 
get away with without concentrating on service.  This makes 
perfect sense from a narrow market point of view but makes no 
sense at all from a public policy point of view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Market driven decisions in remote areas kill economic growth. 
They deter people from moving to rural and northern areas and 
setting up businesses there.  If the Liberal government was 
looking at the big economic picture, it would see this and do 
what it could to keep airfares and the cost of doing business in 
remote areas down.  But the Liberal government is not looking at 
the big picture.  It is ignoring the fact that deregulation is 
killing jobs and businesses in rural and northern Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It gets worse.  Not only has deregulation nailed ordinary 
Canadians with higher airfares and less service, not only has it 
killed jobs and hurt rural and northern Canada, it has not been 
good for the airlines.  From the minute deregulation kicked in, 
Air Canada and Canadian Airlines were in a death match that has 
taken a huge toll on both companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Competition can be a good part of the market economy or it can 
be destructive.  We have to distinguish between healthy 
competition and destructive competition.  Healthy competition 
delivers low prices and better services to the consumers. 
Destructive competition does the opposite and leads to 
monopolies.  Need I say more? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The competition between Air Canada and Canadian Airlines was the 
destructive kind.  As we have seen, it led to higher prices, not 
lower prices.  It resulted in less service to communities, not 
more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Healthy competition thrives in a stable market with rules and 
boundaries.  Under deregulation there are no rules and 
competition turns destructive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>New Democrats want to see healthy competition in Canada's 
airline industry.  That is why in the minority report I called 
for modern regulations to promote competition and protect the 
Canadian public.  I do not want to see a return to the kind of 
regulation we had 20 years ago. Over-regulation is as bad for 
competition as is deregulation. What Canada's airline industry 
needs is the balanced approach. This bill does not provide the 
balanced approach to Canada's airline industry needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's approach once again is selling Canadians short. 
At best this bill is a baby step.  We are facing a monopoly in 
our airline industry, a monopoly caused by deregulation, and the 
Liberal government will not let go of the very cause of the 
monopoly.  This monopoly is an unprecedented threat to Canadian 
consumers.  If there was ever a time to protect the public 
interest, now is that time, yet the Liberal government has to be 
dragged away from regulation kicking and screaming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The transport minister has said that this bill would protect the 
Canadian public.  Sometimes something is so ridiculous that it 
seems funny.  This was one of those times.  Saying this bill as 
it is will protect the public from a monopoly is like giving 
someone one boot when it is 40 below and saying it will keep his 
feet warm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not to say that this bill is all bad. Before I talk 
about what is wrong with it, I am going to talk about what is 
good about it.  The bill implements four recommendations from the 
transport committee that I supported and fought to have included 
in the report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, it doubles the amount of notice an airline has to give 
the community before it abandons it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, it improves the official languages section of the Air 
Canada Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, it gives travel agents the right to negotiate their 
commissions collectively with the dominant airline.  This will 
help keep travel agents in business and continue to provide 
affordable service to the public. One message which was loud and 
clear was that travel agents are a critical and valuable link to 
the air transportation system. As a committee, I was extremely 
pleased that we all agreed and that the government implemented 
this within the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, the bill gives the Competition Bureau expanded power to 
stop predatory pricing. I want to talk a bit about this fourth 
point because I like to give credit where credit is due. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the big problems with a monopoly is the dominant airline 
can crush any small competitors that come along and try to 
compete with it.  With broader powers to prevent predatory 
competition, the Competition Bureau should be able to prevent 
this from happening.  This will eventually make it possible for 
the market to correct itself and bring a return to some form of 
competition.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recognize the minister in his statement indicated that if 
there had been intervention earlier on, we might not have been in 
the situation we are in right now. I commend the government for 
this part of the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to talk about the extended notice period for 
community abandonment.  This is also something I fought for in 
committee and I am glad to see the government has accepted this 
recommendation. However, extending the notice period alone does 
not go nearly far enough to protect small communities.  All it 
does is give communities more warning before an airline pulls 
out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that there be a mechanism to make sure small and 
medium size communities in Canada have decent service. This needs 
to be done in a way that balances the public interest with the 
market.  It is not reasonable to expect an airline to lose money 
hand over fist serving a community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, airlines have a public trust to make sure all 
Canadians have reasonable service. The government has a 
responsibility to make sure the airlines live up to that trust. 
Operating an airline in our country is a privilege.  The airlines 
have a responsibility to serve small and medium size communities 
even if they do not make quite as much profit as they do from 
serving Montreal and Toronto for example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government is not making Air Canada live up to its 
public trust with this bill.  All it does is force Air Canada not 
to abandon any communities for three years.  After that it will 
be open season for community abandonment.  There is no review 
mechanism to make sure these abandonments are justified.  This is 
another example of putting blind faith in a market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other area the Liberal government has bungled is that of 
airfares.  This is an area that most Canadians are concerned 
about as a result of a monopoly.  The anti price gouging measures 
in this bill, if we can call them that, will only be in effect 
for two years, possibly four.  These measures are not even that 
strong. The Liberal government is relying on the Canadian 
Transportation Agency to regulate fares and is giving it slightly 
wider powers to do it.  This is not going to work. The CTA is 
already mandated to control fares.  It has been completely 
ineffective until now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the Minister of Transport think he can just wave his magic 
wand and overnight the CTA will become effective?  All this bill 
does is it broadens the CTA mandate slightly and gives it the 
ability to be a bit proactive for the next two years. Expecting 
the CTA to stop this new airline monopoly from price gouging is 
like sending one person with a shovel to stop the avalanche. 
There must be ongoing measures in the bill to prevent price 
gouging. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third major flaw with the bill is in the area of labour 
relations.  I have often wondered if the government has had any 
respect for unions or the democratic right of collective 
bargaining.  This government has used back to work legislation to 
stop legal work stoppages more than any other government. This is 
the government that fought like mad to keep from giving pay 
equity, simple equality, to its own employees.  It is no wonder 
it has completely ignored the thorny issues that this bill 
represents in the area of labour issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill needs to ensure that labour disputes, including the 
issues relating to seniority, can be dealt with in a timely 
manner.  We need to ensure that airline unions are in a position 
to bargain effectively during this restructuring.  We need to 
ensure that disruption in service with this new dominant carrier 
does not bring the country to a standstill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party would suggest that we do not allow the airline 
employees to have the right to collective bargaining or the right 
to strike.  We need to ensure that the present Canada Industrial 
Relations Board has enough resources to give any disputes 
resulting from this merger top priority without it affecting any 
of its other cases.  That is what we need to do to make sure that 
this works. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of the day this all comes down to priorities.  All 
that Canadians want from their airline industry is safety, 
affordability and decent service to communities.  If the Liberal 
government shared these priorities, it would have done something 
meaningful to address them in this bill.  Instead the Liberal 
government is turning an airline monopoly loose on Canadians with 
little protection for consumers, workers and communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot help but make a point of commenting on some of the 
thoughts that came from one of my opposition colleagues and that 
would be the Reform member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> There are no Reform members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais:</B>  My apologies.  I do recognize there 
are no longer any Reform members.  In all fairness, Reform has 
been somewhat critical of the people in the House but it has been 
some time that things have been up in the air about that party's 
name. 
It may take some time before people realize that they finally 
have come up with a finalized name. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1300"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT35"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In all fairness to Canadians, they voted for certain people at 
election time and they voted for them as belonging to a certain 
party.  When that party saw the need to change in midstream, one 
wonders if perhaps people should have the right to change their 
vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member from the Canadian Alliance commented on the airport 
authorities having too much power.  I cannot help but reflect on 
everything that has happened in the last number of years with 
that party pushing the government to get out of regulating 
transportation and to turn over the airports to someone else. 
Now those airports have some authority and want to do things to 
try to make things work.  That party was hand-in-hand with the 
government in divesting itself of authority over airports, but 
now it is complaining, perhaps because some of its friends are 
not making quite what they thought they would because the 
airports are operating independently, trying to survive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. colleague as well mentioned that her party did not want 
to see only one airline.  Had it not wanted to see only one 
airline in Canada, where the heck was the official opposition for 
the past number of years as Canadian and Air Canada struggled? 
Why was it not saying “Put some regulations in and get some kind 
of capacity controls to make sure that these airlines can 
survive”?  Then we might have been able to see more than one 
airline operate in Canada.  We might still have Canadian and Air 
Canada, ensuring competition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the issue of increased foreign ownership.  Is that the 
answer to everything?  American Airlines increased its investment 
in Canadian Airlines.  Did that save it?  I do not see it here. 
Has increased foreign ownership helped western farmers?  Tell 
western farmers how selling off the railways and increased 
foreign ownership has improved producers' profitability.  It sure 
improved the profits for the rail lines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member also mentioned that passengers have to sit and wait 
at the airlines because of overbooking.  Some people do not get 
on the plane if everybody shows up.  The business argument is, 
that is good business.  They do not want to leave if the seats 
are not filled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does anyone here want to reflect on all of the times the 
Canadian Alliance members have commented that we have to do 
whatever is best for business and that businesses should be able 
to do whatever they want to make a profit?   Sometimes we have to 
eat our words and recognize that it was not the right way to make 
things better for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If my Canadian Alliance colleague is truly concerned about 
passenger rights, I look forward to that party's support for a 
passenger bill of rights and amendments to this bill which will 
reflect those concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite our opposition to this bill, the New Democratic Party 
will make an honest effort to improve it.  Canadians deserve no 
less than for us to do our best to improve this bill in whatever 
way we can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will be proposing a number of amendments to fix some of the 
shortcomings I have identified to make this bill address the very 
real concerns of Canadians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK169"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I welcome the comments made by the hon. member for 
Churchill.  She is not happy with the bill and she wants to bring 
forward some constructive amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would hope that she could show us a better way to deal with 
price gouging than what is already in the bill.  If she is 
advocating a return to total regulation, then I would say that 
the consumers would not benefit in the long run because prices 
would be higher. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will be looking very carefully at suggestions and amendments 
that come from her party, because I think the best way to deal 
with price gouging is that which is provided in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais:</B>  Madam Speaker, I think I made it 
quite clear that I do not think the answer is to return to a 
totally regulated system, but I think there has been recognition 
through all of the committee meetings we had, 156 hours of 
meetings, meeting with numerous witnesses and numerous people, 
that there needs to be some regulation.  Quite frankly, there was 
no question that what was going on between Canadian and Air 
Canada was not the answer to provide a stable airline industry in

</I></B></P><P align=left>These regulations could possibly be in the area of capacity, the 
same way we regulate internationally.  We have a very strong 
international air service.  Those things could have happened. 
Then we would have competition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Competition for the sake of competition is not the answer.  If 
that is the case, what we end up with is like the street markets 
in Tijuana, where the competition is to get the item down to the 
last penny.  Canadians do not mind paying for a service, but they 
want to pay fairly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What appears to be happening now, and the CTA has not been able 
to address it, is that costs have been going up.  People have to 
say that they are not getting the service.  We know that wages 
have not gone up.  We know the workers took numerous cuts, right, 
left and centre, to make things work.  They still were not able 
to bring down the prices.  Part of that was because the foreign 
investment of American Airlines had a stranglehold on Canadian 
Airlines, which could not make some of the changes it should have 
been able to make. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, Air Canada, in a cutthroat type of approach, did not 
make any effort, so everyone dropped prices just to survive.  No 
one survived and ultimately we were left with a dominant carrier 
that will be in a position to gouge the heck out of Canadians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK170"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it is certainly a pleasure to take part in this debate. 
I am going to focus on the impact on consumers.  Many of my 
colleagues have discussed several aspects of the bill and 
referred to the committee work that we spent so much time on, but 
I want to focus on consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel that the bill has left out the interests of consumers, 
considering that now there is a dominant carrier structure in 
Canada, whereby consumers have no choice in most of their airline 
service.  It is not like it was a year ago when, if they were not 
happy with one of the main airlines, they could go to another. 
Now if they are not happy with the airline, it is just too bad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that consumers need help to reach the parties that can 
effect change and deal with their protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recommendation No. 42 of the standing committee stated that an 
ombudsman be appointed by the government to deal strictly with 
consumer issues.  That recommendation was completely ignored in 
the bill and I believe that was a mistake.  That recommendation 
definitely should be followed and I intend to bring it to 
committee.  In fact, I have already submitted to committee that 
the recommendation be made part of the bill, that the bill be 
amended to reflect it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My focus on consumerism stems from several issues that have 
happened lately, from several observations I have made and from 
constituents in my riding who have been affected by changes in 
the airline since the amalgamation of the two main airlines. 
Calls have been made to my office, as I am the transport critic. 
I have spoken with other MPs and travellers who have experienced 
new problems which they had not experienced before.  I myself 
have experienced a significant increase in problems, delays and 
things of that nature, in the airline industry.  I believe that 
the appointment of an ombudsman is important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the vice-chair of the committee, the member for Thunder 
Bay—Superior North said in his report on the committee report 
that the Competition Act and the Canada Transportation Act, 
through their regulatory agencies, are not accessible to the 
average Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing accessible to the average Canadian without an 
ombudsman.  I strongly support the proposal to have an ombudsman. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a short term plan and a long term plan that I would like 
to talk about today.  The long term plan is the amendment to the 
bill to make the appointment of an ombudsman law and a part of 
the airline industry.  I believe that has to be a part of it, 
considering that there is no longer any competition to protect 
consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The short term plan is that I am inviting people to write to my 
office through e-mail, fax or regular mail to tell me about the 
problems they are experiencing now, especially if there is an 
increase in problems.  Some of those problems are delays with no 
explanation, the cancellation of flights, technical difficulties, 
overbooking, as mentioned by some of my other colleagues here 
today, abrupt service changes, luggage problems and communication 
problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I invite any consumer in Canada to write to my office.  Contact 
me and we will assemble these complaints and take them to the 
appropriate party, whether it is airline management, the 
Transportation Safety Board if it is a safety problem, or the 
Canadian Transportation Agency if it is a ticketing or scheduling 
problem. 
We would be pleased to take them all to the minister's office. 
We will do whatever is the appropriate thing to ensure that 
customers' complaints are addressed.

<A HREF="#LINKT37"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a short term, interim service that we will provide until 
the legislation is complete.  I will provide the addresses 
further on in my remarks if anybody is interested. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment I have proposed is exactly the same amendment 
which was already passed in committee.  It was passed by an all 
party committee and all parties supported it.  The proposal to 
establish the ombudsman simply states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thus, the committee recommends that:— 
</I></B></P><P align=left>42.  The government appoint an independent ombudsperson to 
monitor the commitments of a dominant carrier, to oversee a 
public complaints process and report annually to Parliament and 
to the appropriate committees of Parliament on the state of the 
airline industry.  This person must be selected in accordance 
with a public and transparent selection process, and must possess 
expertise in such areas as airline policy, public interest 
advocacy, and regulatory legislative processes. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is my long term goal and I believe that would address the 
problems with consumers in the long term.  But again, in the 
short term I am making my office available to receive complaints 
on any issue.  Again, if it is a company policy issue or a 
specific problem, we will take it to the airline.  I feel 
confident that they will address it, as they have with me in the 
past on any issue we have brought to their attention.  With 
respect to safety issues, we will take those to the Canadian 
Transportation Safety Board, and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If anyone wants to contact my office with a complaint with 
respect to the airline service they are experiencing now or have 
recently, they can write a letter to Bill Casey, MP, House of 
Commons, Ottawa, K1A 0A6.  They can e-mail me at 
caseyb@parl.gc.ca.  They can fax me at 613-943-2295.  Or they can 
check our website at www.pcparty.ca. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Air Canada is not the only company that is involved with 
aviation.  One thing we learned at the committee is that there 
are dozens of airlines in Canada.  They are smaller airlines, but 
there are dozens of them and they are all aggressive and all 
entrepreneurial.  Really, it is an exciting industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Air Canada has the vast majority of business now and any time I 
have brought a problem to the attention of Air Canada it has been 
addressed very quickly, and I appreciate that.  In fact when I 
called the offices of Air Canada yesterday to tell them that I 
would be proposing this interim ombudsman office just to get us 
through until the legislation is passed, to my surprise their 
reaction was that it was a great idea.  They were very positive 
and they agreed to work with us.  If there are problems, with 
that company at least, they have agreed to address them and work 
with us to solve the problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the typical issues that we get in our office concern the 
increased delays in flights.  That is only part of the problem. 
The other part is that the consumers who are victims of the 
increased delays are given information which is wrong, delayed or 
incremental.  They say that the flight is delayed 15 minutes, and 
then after 15 minutes it is delayed another half hour, and then 
it is delayed another half hour.  Instead of saying at the 
beginning that the flight will be delayed two hours, or whatever, 
and give the consumer a choice of whether to go home or take a 
different mode of transportation, they seem to keep consumers at 
the airport by giving these incremental news briefs and 
information in little pieces, which I do not think is correct. 
That should be addressed and it should be changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are inconsistent explanations as to why planes are 
delayed.  In one case I was given three different explanations. I 
was told it was an equipment problem, then I was told there was a 
crew shortage and then I was told there was a storm.  I do not 
know what the truth was, but I was given three different 
explanations.  I believe that consumers are entitled to an 
explanation if their travel is delayed or interrupted.  If the 
airline knows what the problem is, it owes it to consumers to 
tell them exactly what is the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Monday I was at the Montreal airport and I met a constituent 
of mine.  When I asked him what he was doing there, he told me 
that his flight had been cancelled.  When I asked him why it had 
been cancelled, he told me that he had no idea because they would 
not tell him.  He told me there was hardly anybody on the plane 
and he thought they had cancelled it because there were not 
enough people.  As there was another plane at 5 o'clock and there 
would not be many people on that flight, they just cancelled my 
constituent's flight and made him wait four hours.  I believe 
that consumer is entitled to an explanation.  I would like to 
have an answer too, and we will be seeking an explanation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing happened to me this week. 
After flying into Montreal, I went down to get my luggage. Before 
I even got to the luggage carousel, I was paged to go to the 
luggage counter where I was told that my luggage had not arrived, 
that it was not on the plane.  I could not go to Ottawa because I 
did not have any clothes, other than the jeans and the sweater I 
had on, so I went home.  I was told to call the Moncton airport 
the next day to find out the status of my luggage. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1315"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT39"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT39"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1315

<A HREF="#LINKT38"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next morning I tried to call information for the phone 
number of the Moncton airport and I was told that it was an 
unlisted number.  I did not know what to do so I called the 1-800 
number. I could not get through that number so I called my local 
travel agent. My travel agent said that there was a special 
number for luggage and she gave me the number.  I called that 
number and had to go through the code business.  I got a neat 
recording which said “We are sorry, but this call will take 
longer than we anticipated, but do not hang up because you will 
lose your place in the line”.  That was all right.  I waited for 
awhile and got another recording to that effect.  I then got a 
recording saying “If you hang up and go to the Internet you can 
check on your luggage there, but do not hang up because you will 
lose your place in line”.  The point I am making is that I 
waited 25 minutes before I was able to speak to a person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The person finally came on the line and I explained that I had 
lost my luggage in Montreal and that it was supposed to go to 
Moncton.  He said “No, I do not think you have lost your luggage 
because it is not on the computer”.  Anyway, this went on and on 
and on.  The system and the service just was not good enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I challenge the president of Air Canada, Mr. Milton, to apply 
his standards to his own company and to pretend that he is a 
consumer of Air Canada.  Would he go on hold for 25 minutes to 
find out where his luggage is?  Would he accept that level of 
service?  I do not think he would.  I would challenge Mr. Milton 
to review and fix that problem on the luggage communication 
system.  People are already upset when they lose their luggage 
and they do not need that system to make it worse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last night a lady called me and told me that she had spent two 
days trying to get through to the frequent flyer program.  She 
said that she was on hold for more than an hour on one occasion 
and still did not get through.  The only way she said that she 
finally got through was by trying at 7 o'clock. on Sunday 
morning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again I ask the senior management of all airlines: “If you were 
trying to get a product or to check on the service of your car, 
would you accept a one hour wait on the phone, or even 25 
minutes?”  I do not think so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the senior management of the airlines that have 1-800 
numbers to review them.  I propose that they put in a standard. 
If a customer has to wait for five minutes he or she should be 
told that the call will be so many minutes, whether it is 25 
minutes or an hour or whatever, or it should just ring busy. 
However, do not play tricks on people and get them on the line, 
hold them there and lead them to believe they and their problems 
will be dealt with shortly when they will not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My approach is not adversarial on this issue.  I think it is 
important for the airline management to know what is going on. In 
the turmoil surrounding the transition, with all the plane 
changes, the union negotiations, the scheduling and everything 
else, I believe consumers are getting left by the wayside in this 
whole issue.  My goal is not to be adversarial with the airlines. 
My goal is to help them realize and understand what their 
consumers are going through.  I hope that if people register 
their complaints with me I can then seek assistance and relief 
for these problems from the senior management of the airlines. I 
am confident that I can to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Air Canada was recently recognized as the best airline in the 
world.  That was because they have superior service.  It is 
important to me that Air Canada maintain that standard as the 
best airline in the world because Air Canada is in many respects 
our ambassador all over the world.  It is the most tangible 
symbol of Canada that is ever seen in many countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having the best airline in the world reflects well on our 
country.  My goal is to help Air Canada and all other airlines to 
maintain the very highest standards of customer service and 
safety.  If I get good responses from my invitation to receive 
complaints and if they are addressed properly, the airlines will 
be able to maintain those high standards.  My goal is to help 
them maintain their reputation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My experience with Air Canada and all other airlines is that 
when I go to them with a problem they act extremely quickly at 
management level, but consumers do not have that access. They do 
not have access to anything other than a 1-800 number, which is 
extremely frustrating.  I believe in the long term the ombudsman 
would serve to make sure that the airlines are aware of what 
their customers and consumers are going through.  In the short 
term, I would like to provide that service myself until the 
legislation is passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My proposal is to act as an interim ombudsman through my office 
until the legislation is passed. 
It not only refers to Air Canada, but also to airlines such as 
WestJet, First Air, et cetera.  No matter what airline consumers 
are using, if they have a problem I, and I am sure the minister 
and the company itself, want to hear about it. We guarantee that 
if we get a complaint we will see that it goes to the proper 
authority and the proper company, whether it is the company 
itself, the Transportation Safety Board, the Canadian 
Transportation Agency or the minister's office.  We will monitor 
the complaints and make sure they are addressed.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I offer anyone who has a problem or complaint with the aviation 
industry to write to me, Bill Casey, MP, House of Commons, 
Ottawa, K1A 0A6, or e-mail me at caseyb@parl.gc.ca, or fax me at 
613-943-2295, or check our website at www.pcparty.ca and all that 
information will be there.  We invite everybody to send us their 
remarks and we will share them with the appropriate body. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the long term the ombudsman must be there.  If Mr. Milton, 
the president of Air Canada, for instance, has a car problem and 
is not satisfied with the service he gets at the dealership, he 
can go to another dealership.  However, if Canadian consumers, 
who use most of the airline's service, are not happy there is no 
place to go and there are no options.  I think it is important to 
have an ombudsman who will make sure that Air Canada is aware of 
consumer complaints and that they are dealt with in an 
appropriate fashion.  In the interim, we would be pleased to 
provide that service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage people to communicate with us.  If we have a good 
response, if there is a substantial problem or a consistent 
series of complaints, then it will help us to get this amendment 
through for the ombudsman to be added to Bill C-26.  A poor 
response will of course indicate that there is no need for it, 
and I can live with that as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe there is a problem and that consumers are frustrated 
with overbooking, cancelled flights and delayed flights.  There 
is a big problem in communications with the major airlines.  If 
those complaints are filed with us then we can do something about 
them.  I am sure that the all-party committee, which has already 
supported the amendment I am proposing today, will again support 
it in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I want to say that if anybody wants to contact me my 
address is caseyb@parl.gc.ca for e-mail.  My fax number is 
613-943-2295.  Check our website at www.pcparty.ca. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to this bill going to committee.  It has been an 
enlightening experience for all of us on the committee.  It was a 
tremendous experience to go through the debate about the airline 
merger.  We met some incredible people in the industry.  We were 
all impressed with the industry officials.  I look forward to 
this coming back to committee and dealing with all the amendments 
from all the parties.  I am sure that we can come up with a good 
bill that will protect consumers, the industry, the airports and 
the minister.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I listened very attentively to my colleague's 
speech and I am not sure it is appropriate for a member of the 
Conservative Party to use the vehicle of a debate on a bill in 
the House to solicit memberships by offering his phone and fax 
numbers.  I am just wondering if the fortunes of the Conservative 
Party are such that it has to resort to this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like his assurances that if he is inundated, as I think 
he will be with all manner of consumer complaints for having 
repeated this three times in the speech, that he will not come 
back to the Speaker or the House administration to request 
additional resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey:</B>  Madam Speaker, I am surprised that the 
minister would suggest that there is a big problem out there, but 
I appreciate his support for my proposal.  If he is correct and I 
am inundated with complaints, then there is a problem.  That is 
good for all of us.  We should all know that.  The airlines 
should know it.  The minister should know it.  The Transportation 
Safety Board and all the agencies should understand this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe there is a bottleneck in communications between 
consumers, the airlines and the agencies involved.  The 
vice-chair of the committee said that consumers have no access to 
the system, which is what I propose to provide. 
I propose to provide access to the system so consumers who have 
problems can approach either the airlines through an ombudsman, 
through my office, through the Transportation Safety Board or 
whatever.  If anyone wants to join our party, it is

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from February 28 consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-238, an act to amend the Canada Post Corporation Act 
(mail contractors), be read the second time and referred to a 
committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK175"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Jordan (Leeds—Grenville, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
just want to speak very briefly to the bill.  I know we cannot 
ask questions in Private Members' Business so I will make a 
speech with a question in it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the sponsor of the bill, the member for Winnipeg Centre, who 
I believe will get a few minutes at the end of Private Members' 
Business to wrap up, could listen to the question, he perhaps 
could work an answer into his remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I personally will support this legislation.  I have had a lot of 
contact with the rural mail couriers in my riding.  It does seem 
to be quite an anomaly that mail service in a rural area would be 
treated differently than in an urban area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although I agree in principle with the intention of the bill, I 
am wondering if anywhere in this process there are safeguards or 
guarantees for the existing contractors who are conducting the 
service presently.  I was on the phone with them this morning and 
I know they are very supportive of the bill.  However, my fear is 
that what might be happening here is an expansion of the 
membership of the postal union, and these particular contractors, 
having fought for the right to be part of the bargaining unit, 
may very well in the end not be the actual people who end up 
getting these jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I realize that concern could be addressed in committee, but 
hopefully the sponsor of the bill would reflect on that a little 
and perhaps outline some options or processes that we might want 
to take a look at to make sure it is not necessarily a thinly 
veiled attempt to push these contractors out; that they will 
actually be the ones who are in the queue and have access to 
these more secure jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I again congratulate the member for bringing the bill before the 
House.  I look forward, if he gets a chance, to his speaking to 
that issue in his rebuttal at the end of the hour. 
<P><A NAME="LINK176"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo—Alberni, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to speak to Bill C-238 put forward by 
the member for Winnipeg Centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill basically is an act to amend the Canada Post 
Corporation Act to repeal section 13(5) of the act dealing with 
rural route mail couriers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What section 13(5) deems is that rural route couriers are not 
dependent contractors and are therefore not eligible to 
collectively bargain or form an association so they can negotiate 
contracts with Canada Post.  In other words, they cannot form a 
union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Repealing this section would allow rural route couriers 
basically to join the public workers' union.  Although we agree 
with the concerns that the bill highlights, we do not agree with 
the solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently rural route mail couriers must submit a tender for 
their jobs and then negotiate with Canada Post.

<A HREF="#LINKT41"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is that Canada Post does not have a tendering or 
contract guideline to ensure that the process is fair.  This is 
the crux of the problem that the rural route couriers have.  Many 
members in the House have rural areas in their ridings, as I do, 
and have heard about this issue many times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result, many rural route mail couriers feel they are 
working under extremely poor conditions and substandard wages. 
For example, Canada Post officials are forcing independent 
contractors to lower their bids in order to maintain their 
contracts.  Unfair limitations are being placed on their ability 
to act as independent contractors.  These problems need to be 
addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Four years ago when the Canadian Alliance was the Reform Party, 
I was critic for public works.  George Radwanski tabled an 
exceptionally good report dealing with Canada Post issues.  A 
couple of the issues are quite relevant to this discussion.  One 
is that Radwanski found: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The corporation is not subject to any adequately effective 
accountability mechanisms.  Neither the minister responsible for 
Canada Post, nor any branch of the government, nor even the 
corporation's own board of directors has any way of providing the 
sustained supervision necessary to ensure that its priorities and 
behaviour are fully consistent with the public interest. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the crux of the matter.  We have people in Canada Post 
who are running their own show.  It is supposed to be a 
corporation for all Canadians, yet it is not being run in that 
manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We agree with the member that rural couriers are being done in. 
They are not being treated fairly.  However, where we disagree 
with the member is on how to deal with this problem.  We feel the 
mechanisms within Canada Post need to be addressed rather than 
unionizing those postal workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Radwanski also found that Canada Post businesses practices were 
aggressive and unfair.  It is no surprise to hear the concerns of 
the rural route couriers coming forward.  However, as I have 
said, we feel that repealing subsection 13(5) of the Canada Post 
Corporation Act, as proposed in the bill, is not the answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Eliminating subsection 13(5) will eliminate the tendering 
process and prevent anyone other than a union member from vying 
for the job of a rural route mail courier.  We think that is 
wrong.  In other words, the bill overreaches what we feel is the 
stated intention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-238 creates an ungainly situation where several unions 
may be competing for the same members.  The bill may also lead to 
a conflict of interest between what a dependent contractor is and 
what their employers are.  We feel that there are other options 
available.  As it stands, the tendering and contract process is 
not fair, not honest and is simply not above board.  The way to 
go is to fix that problem and the rural route problem will be 
fixed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The basic issue is that we need a mechanism that obliges Canada 
Post to conduct fair and open tendering processes within its 
contracts.  Everyone needs to know what the conditions are.  This 
is the principle of the issue we are facing today.  If we could 
fix the contract tendering process I believe we would solve the 
problem.  As well, if the mechanism is not put in place to 
guarantee these conditions, the Canadian Alliance will 
investigate the possibility of making treasury board contracting 
policy applicable in this case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, we agree there is a problem that has clearly been 
identified by the member.  We disagree with his manner of solving 
it.  We do not believe that eliminating the section is the 
solution.  We believe the solution is to deal with Canada Post to 
get fair tendering processes in place which will solve the issue.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise today to speak to the bill.  I begin by 
congratulating the member for Winnipeg Centre for introducing the 
bill, which is an act to amend the Canada Post Corporation Act. 
I also acknowledge the member from the Liberal Party who 
indicated that he was planning to support the bill when it comes 
to a vote next week and for correctly describing it as an 
anomaly.  Rural route mail couriers are somehow treated much 
differently and much worse than members of the Canadian Union of 
Postal Workers and other employees.

<A HREF="#LINKT42"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it passing strange that a few short weeks ago we had a 
backbench Liberal MP stand to ask a pointed and loaded question 
to allow the cabinet minister responsible to highlight the new 
three year agreement between Canada Post and the Canadian Union 
of Postal Workers.  At the same time here we are two or three 
weeks later turning around and apparently not going to offer 
reasonable rates and working conditions to folks who are 
delivering rural mail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to dedicate this speech to a woman who is a long 
time friend of mine, Doris Woodbeck.  For many years she was the 
rural route mail courier in picturesque Prince Edward County in 
the Bloomfield area.  Doris Woodbeck was virtually a second 
mother to me.  She delivered mail through snow and sleet and 
freezing rain and all other things that our mail couriers are 
expected to do.  She is a wonderful individual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people who have followed in Doris' footsteps, perhaps in her 
snow tires, are having some real problems these days because of 
the wages and working conditions.  Most rural route mail couriers 
barely earn minimum wage.  Their working conditions are 
reminiscent of another era. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada Post Corporation can terminate their employment with 
just 90 days of notice.  There are no standard work rules.  Some 
RRMCs have more than one route.  They get paid for delivering 
certain products on one route although they do not get paid for 
service on another.  Work rules are changed arbitrarily and often 
with virtually no notice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During snow storms RRMCs are routinely forced to shovel out the 
group boxes on their routes, again without compensation.  They 
have to train and pay their own replacements.  They are provided 
with basic supplies.  Postal workers at some offices collect used 
elastic bands and give them to rural route mail couriers because 
Canada Post refuses to provide such basic necessities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the members present to listen to what some mail 
couriers are saying: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With a working relationship like this, it's almost impossible for 
us to obtain better wages and working conditions on our own.  And 
we're not allowed to bargain collectively like other workers. 
Section 13(5) of the Canada Post Corporation Act prohibits RRMCs 
from having collective bargaining rights.  This is a denial of 
basic rights. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This the subsection the member for Winnipeg Centre is trying to 
have repealed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps one of the biggest problems is in the tendering process, 
as has been acknowledged, because the mail couriers have to bid 
on their routes.  When they submit their bids they are often told 
they must accept the contract for less than they were making 
before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The argument is that if they do not like it they can always 
quit.  As a rule mail couriers find it difficult to complain 
about their working conditions because they know that their 
contracts can be pulled on 90 days of notice.  With a working 
relationship like this one it is almost impossible for them to 
obtain better wages and working conditions.  They are not allowed 
to bargain collectively as other workers are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1986 the Canada Post Corporation applied to the Canada Labour 
Relations Board to review the structure of bargaining units at 
Canada Post.  The Association of Rural Route Couriers applied for 
a standing at those hearings.  A year later the labour relations 
board issued its decision which noted that the definition of a 
defending contractor included two basic criteria: economic 
dependence and an obligation to perform duties for another 
person. 
These criteria are reviewed from the perspective of 
administrative control and integration.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CLRB decision was overturned by the Federal Court of Appeal 
on the basis that while mail couriers may meet the requirements 
of employees under the Canada Labour Code, the CLRB exceeded its 
jurisdiction when ruling that subsection 13(5) did not apply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal court recognizes that without this section the 
employees concerned would have benefited from all rights provided 
in the code.  The federal court notes that subsection 13(5) is 
legal fiction designed to set aside reality.  It also clearly 
recognizes that the purpose of this provision is to deny these 
workers the right to collective bargaining. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We move forward to today and the Liberal government did not 
ensure that the RRMCs were protected and that their conditions 
were improved.  It simply denied them the right to protect 
themselves and to improve their conditions through collective 
bargaining. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Depriving collective bargaining rights is a denial of basic 
rights; a violation of the principles conveyed and promoted in 
the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which came into 
effect a full 15 years ago now; a violation of our international 
commitments including the North American Free Trade Agreement; 
and a violation of the ILO, which the government proudly 
frequently says was one of the first signatories and which 
concerns itself with freedom of association and protection of the 
right to organize in the international covenant on civil and 
political rights and economic, social and cultural rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two years ago in the first budget, which I had the honour and 
privilege of being in the House of Commons to hear, the federal 
government promised us that it would “look at new ways to 
deliver information and programs so that rural Canadians are full 
participants in Canada's future prosperity”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hope the government's promise to look at new ways of 
delivering information and programs is not just another way of 
saying that it will find cheaper ways of exploiting rural 
Canadians who deliver information and programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To date we feel the Liberal government has dodged the thorny 
issue of subsection 13(5).  Postal critics for the Bloc, 
ourselves, and the party to my left have already sent letters on 
the issue to the minister responsible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, it is generally recognized that subsection 13(5) 
is a denial of basic rights, which helps Canada Post keep the 
wages and working conditions of rural workers at an unfair and 
impossible level.  There is growing consensus that it should be 
repealed quickly.  It is time that rural route mail couriers had 
access to collective bargaining rights which would allow them to 
protect themselves and to improve their working conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Getting rid of subsection 13(5) would allow RRMCs to do this in 
a variety of ways.  It would allow them to have access to the 
provisions of the Canada Labour Code.  It would give them time to 
change the system by which they are forced to sign long term 
contracts.  It would enable them to establish reasonable work 
rules so that CPC managers no longer respond to complaints by 
saying that if they do not like it they can quit.  It would 
provide a method of submitting grievances when rules surrounding 
workloads or starting times are arbitrarily changed.  Most 
important, it would end the pattern in which the financial 
objectives of Canada Post have been pursued by driving increasing 
numbers of rural route mail couriers into poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For Doris Woodbeck and the 5,000 rural route mail couriers who 
are currently on the job, we wish them well.  We trust that when 
this comes to a vote on Tuesday there will be a clear majority in 
the House of Commons to repeal subsection 13(5) of this act. 
<P><A NAME="LINK178"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
certainly want to engage in this debate and to comment on what 
the hon. member was saying and on some of the faults in the 
private member's bill he brought forward. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1345"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT44"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is obvious to those of us who live in rural Canada that rural 
mail couriers are not treated fairly and that the tendering 
system has numerous and obvious faults in it.  However our 
argument would be that unionization of rural mail couriers is not 
the way to deal with this issue specifically. There are a number 
of issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member's bill forth not only allows for unionization of 
rural mail couriers, it also allows for unionization of numerous 
other postal employees. They are all lumped together in one bill. 
For that reason mainly the bill is extremely flawed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member speaks specifically to section 13(5).  Section 13(5) 
is why the Conservative Party still supports rural mail couriers. 
Some people have argued that this section discriminates against 
rural mail couriers.  I remind hon. members that the Federal 
Court of Canada ruled on May 29, 1990 that there were no grounds 
for a claim of discrimination on the basis of gender or 
differential treatment between urban and rural residents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that this bill is not the answer to the shabby treatment 
rural mail couriers have received from Canada Post.  As much as I 
appreciate and support the efforts by the member for Winnipeg 
Centre to deal with this issue, he really has not dealt with it. 
What can we do? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>MPs from my party, especially the member for Tobique—Mactaquac, 
have met on numerous occasions with individual mail contractors, 
with representatives of the Organization of Rural Route Mail 
Couriers and with representatives of Canada Post to try to 
resolve some of these outstanding issues.  We have made a 
difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier this year the post office introduced a series of new 
measures which I hope will alleviate a great number of the 
difficulties contractors have had in the past.  These include the 
following.  Rural routes will be contracted on an individual 
contractor basis.  Contractors who in turn subcontract out their 
routes at a reduced price known as master contractors will no 
longer be eligible to renew their rural contract.  If a master 
contractor previously held the route, the previous employee or 
the subcontractor actually performing the work will be the first 
potential supplier offered the contract at renewal.  Rural 
contracts will be issued for five years with a five year renewal 
option based on satisfactory performance and tendered after 10 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many other changes have been instituted as well.  A negotiated 
adjustment will be included for the five year renewal option to 
ensure that market conditions such as inflation are considered. A 
quality and performance component will be included in the 
contract renewal and awarding process to recognize the past 
performance of incumbent contractors.  The evaluation of tenders 
will be based on criteria such as experience, service performance 
and reliability, image and then cost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition when the contracts are up for bid, Canada Post will 
make contractors aware of the specifications of the routes they 
will be performing such as the number of points of call, daily 
kilometres, number of stops for personal contract items and the 
amount of ad mail they can expect to deliver. These numbers will 
be updated annually or more frequently if a significant change 
occurs, and contractors will be compensated for these changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The post office has prepared a handbook, what it calls a 
delivery reference manual, for its mail contractors.  The purpose 
of the manual is to provide assistance and guidance with a 
reference book and a phone directory of key individuals at Canada 
Post they can call when a problem arises.  In conjunction with 
this, local supervisors and postmasters will be provided with an 
operator's handbook and support training material to assist them 
in working with contractors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These measures probably will not prevent disputes from arising. 
However I feel that the changes announced will bring much greater 
fairness and openness to the relationship between rural mail 
contractors and the post office.  It also does not preclude 
additional changes to be made to further affect rural mail 
couriers to give them a better opportunity to make a living and 
earn a fair wage.  It certainly does not preclude changes being 
made to the act in the future.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party will continue to work with and listen to rural mail 
contractors to ensure that they earn a fair wage, that they are 
treated fairly and that Canada Post deals with problems that 
arise in a timely and equitable manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, we have to move away from the tactics that Canada 
Post has employed against rural mail couriers in the past. 
Frankly, many of those tactics would have been better off in 
Chicago in the 1930s than in Canada in the 21st century.  We 
obviously have to make a change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member reviewed his bill and made some fundamental 
changes to the way it was written, it would be a better piece of 
legislation.  It would be something that would actually help 
rural mail couriers, and would not confuse the issue of rural 
mail couriers with a lot of other issues and a lot of other 
subcontractors at Canada Post. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can continue to provide service in rural Canada.  I depend 
upon a rural mail courier.  He is a very good friend of mine.  I 
have to cross the road to reach my mail box.  I understand the 
difficulties facing mail couriers.  The weather is only one of 
the things they face.  The other thing is that quite often my 
mail box may not be shovelled out as well as it should be. I 
appreciate the extra work that all Canadians get from rural mail 
couriers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can continue to support rural mail couriers.  We can continue 
to look for opportunities for them to make a better living. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-238 is not a bad bill, but it has some serious flaws and 
that is why we will not be supporting this piece of legislation. 
I would certainly encourage the hon. member to review the bill, 
to improve it, to take some of the obvious mistakes out of it and 
to bring it back to the House.  We would then take another look 
at it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK179"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I too want to say a few words on the private member's 
bill put forward by the member for Winnipeg Centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a very enlightened bill in that it is fair minded and very 
balanced in terms of dealing with the basic rights of people who 
are being discriminated against compared to other letter carriers 
in the same business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say at the outset that I was very disappointed to hear 
the member from the Reform Party and the member from the 
Progressive Conservative Party say that they would not support 
this bill which would allow rural mail couriers to unionize as 
letter carriers in the city who do similar and comparable work 
can unionize.  I ask those hon. members, where is their sense of 
fairness and their sense of balance in terms of a basic 
fundamental human right, the right to organize, the right to free 
collective bargaining and the right to have equality in the same 
company or the same corporation?  I am not so surprised that the 
Reform Party will oppose this bill, but I am surprised to hear 
that the Progressive Conservative Party, which tends to be a bit 
more enlightened on these matters, say it will oppose this very 
positive bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> It is the new Canadian Alliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  Madam Speaker, maybe there is a new 
alliance.  Certainly there is on this particular issue, unless 
that member was speaking only for himself and not for his party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Winnipeg Centre wants to repeal section 13(5) of 
the Canada Post Corporation Act.  That section explicitly 
prohibits 5,000 rural mail couriers from forming a union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Forming a union should be a basic fundamental human right in a 
country with a modern constitution and a modern charter of rights 
that talks about the freedom to associate, the freedom to 
assemble and the freedom of speech.  This is a modern country in 
the 21st century which is still denying the basic human right of 
organization into a trade union for 5,000 employees in the public 
domain. It will be very interesting to see how individual members 
of the House vote on the bill which is about this basic human 
right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As has been said before, rural route mail couriers are a very 
important part of the link between the people in rural Canada and 
the rest of the country. As a small child of four, five or six 
years old on our farm in Saskatchewan, I remember waiting twice a 
week for the mailman to deliver the mail.  We were some 20 miles 
from the nearest village. 
This was an event that connected us to the rest of the country 
and the rest of the community.  It is very important that this 
link be there.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What most people do not realize is that many of these people are 
really underpaid, in some cases it is not much more than the 
minimum wage.  Their salaries are much lower than those of the 
letter carriers in the city.  They do not have the benefits that 
people in the city have.  They sign a contract and if they are 
not there to deliver the mail, if they want to take a holiday or 
go to a funeral or to some family function or event, they have to 
hire someone to take their place.  They have to pay the person 
who takes their place a salary or a stipend for that day.  It 
does not come from Canada Post. They can also be dismissed with 
90 days notice, if I recall. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no protection.  There is no association.  There is no 
seniority.  There is none of that stuff for the rural mail 
couriers in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have here is a bill that speaks to basic fundamental 
human rights, the right of assembly, the right to organize, the 
right to free collective bargaining, which should be a basic 
right for each and every citizen of Canada.  It will be very 
interesting to see how members across the way vote on this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suppose I am making this appeal to people who do not want to 
support the bill at this time.  I wonder if they would be willing 
at least to send the bill to committee.  If this bill went to 
committee, we would have a chance to study it further, maybe make 
some amendments and minor changes.  We could call as witnesses 
many rural mail couriers from different parts of the country so 
they could tell their story about how they are discriminated 
against in terms of benefits and salaries, working conditions, 
the lack of protection, the lack of seniority, the lack of basic 
rights that most people in this country take for granted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the very least, let us vote for the bill at second reading so 
it gets to committee.  It could then have the proper study. These 
people would have in the proper forum the podium from which to 
state their case. If they stated their case and told their story, 
I am sure all members of the House of Commons would agree that 
they deserve the same basic fundamental rights of every Canadian 
citizen, which are the right to organize and the right to free 
collective bargaining, the right to a decent salary and the right 
to decent benefits in all parts of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again I congratulate the member for Winnipeg Centre. I 
appeal to the House to support the bill.  It is a positive step 
forward in basic human rights. 
<P><A NAME="LINK180"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
will just take a couple of minutes because I am somewhat 
disappointed that anybody in the House would not support sending 
the bill to committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the opportunity about a year and a half or two years ago 
to go with the Minister of Labour to Chile to meet on labour 
issues.  We were meeting with different ministers from the 
Americas, the secretary of state for labour in the U.S. and 
numerous ministers from the Americas.  I am talking about South 
America and some of the countries within it that have not the 
best labour standards in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things the Canadian group and the Canadian minister 
presented was that countries need to look at being able to 
address the changes in workforces where more and more workers are 
contract workers and are not protected with the same rights that 
workers who are under collective bargaining agreements and unions 
are protected. One of the declarations made was to look at ways 
of getting those contract workers the opportunity to be part of 
associations and collective bargaining.  Once again we were 
seeing a situation where the government and the country were out 
there saying “Do as we preach, not as we do”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look to members within the House to support the rights of all 
workers, of all Canadians to be treated fairly and not to make 
rural workers second class citizens in this country.  Give them 
the same rights as all other workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us send the bill to committee and give it the opportunity to 
be discussed.  Let us not be afraid to let Canadians make the 
decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Since no other member 
is rising on debate except for the hon. member for Winnipeg 
Centre who is the sponsor of the bill, I want to make sure that 
everybody understands that his will be the last intervention on 
the bill.

Bill C-238 seeks to remedy an historic injustice.  In 1981, when 
Canada Post Corporation was formed by virtue of the Canada Post 
Corporation Act, the drafters of the bill knew that it would have 
one specific impact on labour relations.  The employees would no 
longer be covered by the Public Service Staff Relations Act and 
would be covered under the Canada Labour Code. This new crown 
corporation would fall under the Canada Labour Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The postmaster general at the time, André Ouellet, realized that 
under the Canada Labour Code the definitions of dependent 
contractor and independent contractor are different.  As 
postmaster general he realized that rural route mail couriers 
were definitely dependent contractors under the definition in the 
Canada Labour Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He had to take speedy measures because he thought it might cost 
money.  If this group of people could be considered employees or 
dependent contractors they would have the right to bargain 
collectively.  They did not want that so they specifically took 
measures to deny this group of workers the right to bargain 
collectively.  That is where the source of the problem we are 
trying to deal with today lies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rural route mail couriers are the only group of workers in the 
country who are specifically barred from the right to free 
collective bargaining by legislation, strictly for economic 
reasons.  Other groups of employees do not have the right to 
strike if it is an issue of confidentiality, national security, 
or some reason to that effect.  However there is no reason in the 
world to deny this group of workers the right to bargain, the 
right to organize, or the right to withhold their services other 
than sheer monetary issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other speakers have pointed out that in the U.S. rural route 
mail couriers are allowed to bargain collectively.  In Mexico 
rural route mail couriers are allowed to bargain collectively. 
Even private sector rural mail couriers, people who deliver mail 
for instance through Zipper or one of these places, are allowed 
to bargain collectively and have formed unions to better 
themselves.  Yet this group of 5,000 employees in Canada are not 
allowed to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As pointed out by the previous speaker, the right to free 
collective bargaining is one of the basic tenets of a free 
democratic system.  We find it galling that the government of the 
day took specific measures in 1981 to deny these workers their 
rights.   Given the opportunity to correct this historic 
injustice and given the speeches we have heard from the other 
side, it sounds like it is not prepared to do it at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rural route mail couriers are very well organized.  They are 
very committed and very dedicated.  They have been lobbying on 
the Hill trying to garner interest on the issue.  One item raised 
by the Liberal member who spoke today was a misunderstanding of 
what Bill C-238 would do to eliminate subsection 13(5) with 
regard to labour relations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I may answer the question put in that speech, if the 
employees are allowed to form or join a union it may not be CUPW, 
the Canadian Union of Postal Workers, but a completely different 
union.  They may form their own independent association.   Even 
if they joined CUPW there would be no bumping as such.  They 
would be considered an independent bargaining unit, a separate 
bargaining unit represented within the corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To alleviate any fears, there is no danger of existing mail 
couriers losing their jobs by virtue of being bumped, should they 
join that organization.  There is again no guarantee that they 
would choose to join any one union.  It is just that they would 
have the right to bargain collectively.  History has shown us 
that the only way working people can move the terms and 
conditions of their employment forward is by bargaining 
collectively.  It is a given. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my best hope that the House would allow the bill to go 
forward to the committee stage, at which stage I would like to 
move some amendments to the bill that I consider to be friendly 
amendments.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must make sure everyone understands that we only seek to 
alter the relationship for rural route mail couriers, not other 
mail contractors.  We have no interest in trying to cloud the 
issue about trucking companies that may be contractors for Canada 
Post or the airlines that have contracts to carry mail, et 
cetera.  We are talking about them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do have language drafted now which would clarify the matter 
that the only people we are seeking to deal with are rural route 
mail couriers.  Should members of the House see fit to allow the 
bill to go to committee stage, it is our intention to co-operate 
with amendments that would clarify any misconceptions in that 
regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In argument to show why these actions are necessary, it is 
useful to hear what some rural route mail couriers have told us 
in the previous months leading up to the bill.  Many have told 
stories of finding it more and more difficult to do their routes 
and make any profit whatsoever.  The tendering process has been 
so corrupt, flawed and loaded against the employees that they 
found it impossible to raise their bidding price with the cost of 
living.  As such all their costs and expenses are going up as all 
our costs and expenses are going up.  Fuel costs, car insurance 
and the things they have to pay are through the ceiling, but they 
are unable to obtain fair compensation through current tendering 
practices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a quote from a female rural route courier who said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been serving rural Canada customers for 17 years. After 
that much time, I gross $70 a day, out of which I have to pay 
average expenses of about $30 a day for things such as gasoline 
and car repairs.  I have hurt my back at work.  I don't have any 
sick benefits.  For a while, I was able to work half time. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>She had to hire someone to do the other half of her job and had 
to pay them $50 a day.  For the period of time that her back was 
injured and she could only work half time she had to pay more 
than she earned in a day to hire a replacement.  She could not 
hire someone for half a day for less than $50.  By the end of 
last year she was unable to work at all and her replacement was 
getting the full $70 a day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can see the difficulty.  I know rural jobs are hard to come 
by. In many places these are off farm jobs that provide a second 
income for a farming family, but there is no reason why there 
should be a huge gap between the conditions for delivering mail 
in the city and the conditions for delivering mail in the 
country.  It becomes a rural-urban split and a rural-urban bias 
which these people are starting to resent.  Another women said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I haven't had a holiday since I started at Canada Post seven 
years ago.  I can't afford to take one.  I gross only $87 a day, 
out of which I pay all my operating expenses.  When it came came 
time to renew our contract I was told by Canada Post that I had 
better lower my price or I won't get it again this time, so I 
actually bid myself down. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not a fair tendering practice.  I am from the building 
industry and I know about contracts and contract letting.  One 
does not put out a tender, phone people back and shop the price 
around saying that their price was pretty good but somebody else 
was lower and if they want it they had better come in lower.  In 
the industry I come from we call that crooked.  It is offensive 
to hear that it happens in this regard.  She went on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since I got the contract, I have on many occasions had parcels 
that would not fit into my car, especially after loading all my 
other mail.  I have had to make extra trips to be able to deliver 
those large parcels.  That means extra costs and more work time 
for me, but I don't get the additional compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With take home pay of $900 per month after expenses, I could 
stay home and make more money on welfare. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are pages and pages of stories of anecdotal evidence which 
leads us to believe that something has to be done.  Rather than 
try to impose some solutions on these workers, let us listen to 
what they are asking us to do.  What they want is the right to 
collective bargaining, not to try to put band-aids on a tendering 
system that is actually broken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appeal one more time to members of the House to vote for the 
bill at second reading so that we can get it to committee.  I 
will have the bill amended to alleviate many legitimate concerns 
that were raised.  I think we could do a service for these 5,000 
employees and meet their concerns about their jobs.
