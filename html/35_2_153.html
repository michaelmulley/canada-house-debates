	In response to concerns expressed by representatives from the

<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, as it is customary for the mover of the 
motion to say a brief word about the purpose of the bill, I want to 
say that this bill proposes the establishment of a national DNA 
databank. This is the second phase of our strategy to enable DNA 
evidence to be used in solving crimes. The first step was the 
legislation to enable DNA samples to be taken by warrant, which 
was passed a year ago.
<P>
	I am very pleased to continue our commitment and to table 
legislation to carry out the second phase of the creation of a DNA 
databank.

<B>(1010)</B>
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to rise in the House today 
to present my first private member's bill, an act to amend the Bank 
Act respecting amalgamation.
<P>
	This bill addresses recent proposals by a number of Canadian 
large banks and financial institutions to merge with smaller 
institutions in Canada.
<P>
	The primary substance of the bill is to prohibit that process only 
in limited circumstances, for example where one of the institutions 
<P>

<B><A NAME="9514"> 9514 </A></B>
<P>
under the advisement of the  Superintendent of Financial 
Institutions could demonstrate insolvency.
<P>
	The health of the Canadian financial sector would not be served 
by these kinds of amalgamations. Most Canadians feel very 
uncomfortable with some of the banks, particularly at this time, 
amalgamating even more power. With the help of my colleague, the 
hon. member for Trinity-Spadina, we propose to table this today.
<P>
	We believe it will contribute in a very substantial way to the 
ongoing debate in financial institutions in Canada.

to make certain amendments to the Criminal Code.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure today to table my new 
private member's bill which would repeal Bill C-68, a gun control 
bill masquerading as a crime control bill, which imposes an unfair 
and unjust requirement for law-abiding owners of rifles and 
shotguns to pay new fees and register their legal firearms while it 
does nothing to punish the criminal misuse of firearms.
<P>
	My new private member's bill will restore the Criminal Code as 
it was before the introduction of Bill C-68 and replace Bill C-68 
with serious minimum penalties for the criminal misuse of 
firearms.
<P>
	My bill will amend the Criminal Code to require a minimum 
sentence of five years for using a firearm to commit a crime or to 
escape from a crime scene, that penalty increased to ten years if the 
gun is fired. People convicted of such criminal misuse of firearms 
would receive a lifetime prohibition against owning a firearm, 
ammunition or an explosive device.

<P>
	She said: Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to introduce a bill entitled an 
act to amend the Canada Elections Act. The intention of this bill is 
threefold. First, the bill amends the Canada Elections Act to allow 
registration of a political party by the Chief Electoral Officer when 
the party nominates candidates in at least 12 electoral districts 
throughout the country, down from the present requirement of 50 
electoral districts.
<P>
	Under the present act, the Chief Electoral Officer must 
deregister a party that does not meet the conditions set out in 
section 28(2) of the act.
<P>
	Second, the bill removes the obligation placed on the chief agent 
of a political party to liquidate the assets of that party when it is 
deleted from the registry of political parties by the Chief Electoral 
Officer of Canada.
<P>
	Finally, the bill lowers the amount required for deposit with the 
returning officer at the same time the nomination papers are filed.

it is currently used in wife slaughter cases inappropriately and 
unjustly changes the focus of the criminal trial from the behaviour 
of the accused's intention to murder to the behaviour of the victim 
who from then on is identified as the one responsible for the 
accused's violence.
<P>
	My constituents do not believe that any amount of provocation 
should excuse the act of murder. Therefore, the petitioners request 
that Parliament review and change the relevant provisions of the

violent behaviour.

sense. It speaks against the notion of fairness.

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be able to start off the 
second reading debate on Bill C-92, the Income Tax Budget 
Amendments Act, 1996.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance has asked the House to approve this 
procedure so that it can be passed quickly, while allowing members 
to examine the bill in detail.
<P>
	We cannot emphasize enough how important it is for this bill to 
be passed quickly. It includes a whole series of  important measures 
for increasing the fairness and effectiveness of the Canadian tax 
system. The measures were initially unveiled in the 1996 budget, a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9516"> 9516 </A></B>
<P>
budget that received the support of the Canadian public and of this 
House.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Since that time a large number of Canadians have planned their 
affairs on the basis of these measures, many of which are of a 
relieving nature.
<P>
	The introduction of this bill was delayed for an important reason. 
Most of my colleagues will recall that the 1966 budget included 
provisions to enhance the working income supplement of the child 
tax benefit, the so-called WIS.
<P>
	In the period following the 1996 budget it became clear to the 
government that it had the opportunity and the obligation to do 
more to advance the well-being of Canadian children. This meant, 
among other things, revisiting the proposed changes to the working 
income supplement set out in the 1996 budget.
<P>
	After extensive discussions with the provinces and territories, 
the federal government decided to propose in the 1997 budget the 
Canada child tax benefit. This new benefit would eventually 
combine the working income supplement with an enriched child 
tax benefit. This proposal represented a major step toward a 
national child benefit system. As a result, the changes to the WIS 
that would have otherwise been contained in the bill have not been 
included.
<P>
	The bill was available to taxpayers in draft form late in 1996. 
Since that time, in keeping with the government's usual practice, 
taxpayers have had the opportunity to comment on the legislation 
and consult with the Department of Finance.
<P>
	Let me now review briefly some of the measures included in the 
bill before us. As the legislation deals with taxation, probably the 
most important point to note is that it does not raise taxes, not 
corporate, not excise, not personal. Indeed, as my hon. colleagues 
know, the government has never raised personal income tax rates in 
any of the four budgets it has brought before the House. This is no 
small achievement, given the magnitude of the fiscal problem we 
inherited. Moreover, the Minister of Finance has made it clear we 
will lower taxes once we can afford to do so and once we know that 
it is permanent.
<P>
	What the government has done in the meantime, and what was 
done in the 1996 budget, was to propose a number of measures to 
enhance the fairness of the tax system and ensure that it operates as 
effectively as possible. These measures included changes affecting 
registered pensions plans, RPPs and registered retirement savings 
plans. Those changes will help to ensure the sustainability of those 
programs while better targeting assistance to modest and middle 
income Canadians.
<P>
	For instance, the bill proposes the elimination of the seven-year 
limit on carrying forward any unused portion of a maximum 
allowable RRSP contribution. This will make it easier for many 
Canadians who find it hard to make full RRSP contributions in 
their younger years to eventually benefit from the RRSP system 
when they can afford to do so. This is a very important change.
<P>
	The bill also proposes to increase tax assistance to students and 
their families.
<P>
<B>(1025 )</B>
<P>
	First, in the area of registered education savings plans or RESPs, 
the bill proposes to increase the annual contribution limit from 
$1,500 to $2,000 per beneficiary. It would increase the lifetime 
limit from $31,500 to $42,000. The 1997 budget proposed to 
enhance tax assistance delivered through RESPs further still. The 
bill also proposes to increase the amount in which the education tax 
credit is calculated from $80 to $100. Once again this is an amount 
the 1997 budget has proposed to increase still further.
<P>
	The bill will also increase from $4,000 to $5,000 per year the 
limit on the unused tuition fees and education amounts that 
students may transfer to spouses or parents. This measure will also 
be further enhanced by the proposals in the 1997 budget.
<P>
	Today's bill will also improve access to training and retraining 
for many Canadians who have young families to care for. 
Specifically, it proposes to broaden eligibility for the child care 
expense deduction by allowing parents who are full time students 
to claim the deduction against all types of income.
<P>
	The bill will also raise the age limit for children for whom child 
care expenses may be claimed from 14 to 16, thereby providing 
increased tax savings for families with older children. A further 
measure in the bill that will benefit taxpayers caring for children is 
the change to the rules governing child support. The bill provides 
that child support paid under a court order or written agreement 
made after April 1997 not be deductible by the payer nor included 
in the recipient's income. This change reflects the widely held view 
that the old system of deduction inclusion was not working for the 
benefit of children.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This tax measure is one in a series of measures affecting child 
support payments that were recently approved by the House. In 
addition to the tax changes in the bill, this series of measures 
includes guidelines for the fair and uniform awarding of child 
support, as well as new measures for enforcing related orders.
<P>
	Not only does the bill increase support for education and 
assistance to children, but it also increases tax assistance to the 
charitable organization sector. The bill reflects the government's 
policy of giving charitable organizations the tools they need to do 
their work.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9517"> 9517 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	For that reason the 1996 budget increased from 20 per cent to50 per cent the annual limit on the amount of a taxpayer's net 
income eligible for tax assisted charitable donations. Once again 
this is an area in which the 1997 budget has further substantially 
increased tax assistance.
<P>
	I will skim very quickly over some other major measures in the 
bill. I begin with labour sponsored venture capital corporations. 
Generous federal and provincial tax credits have helped these 
funds, sponsored by labour organizations, attract large amounts of 
venture capital for investment in small and medium size 
businesses. By the time of the 1996 budget they had more than a 
three-year supply of capital. In view of the substantial level of 
capital accumulation, the bill includes a range of measures that will 
help keep the level of special tax assistance to these funds in line 
with current fiscal realities.
<P>
	The bill also includes some important measures for the energy 
and resource sectors. For the oil, gas and mining industries, the bill 
would modify rules relating to the resource allowance, thereby 
resulting in a more stable and consistent tax structure. As for the 
oil, gas and mining industries the bill proposes significant 
improvements to the flow through share regime, improvements 
that will make the system less restrictive and will remove existing 
incentives to economically inefficient corporate decisions.
<P>
	The bill also includes measures designed to promote sustainable 
development of energy resources by providing an essentially level 
playing field between certain renewable and non-renewable energy 
investments.
<P>
	The measures I have outlined will make the tax system fairer and 
more efficient. They were announced as part of a budget that has 
been debated and approved by the House and favourably received 
by Canadians. Sending the bill to committee before second reading 
will expedite its passage while it enhances the ability of this House 
to review the bill intelligently. With these considerations in mind I 
have no hesitation in urging my hon. colleagues to approve today's 
motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise to address this issue.
<P>
<B>(1030 )</B>
<P>
	I must answer the parliamentary secretary's comments. He 
asserted at the beginning of his speech that the government had not 
increased personal tax rates. That is true but there are more ways 
other than raising personal tax rates to take more money from 
Canadian taxpayers. It is very important to point that out.
<P>
	Another way the government can take money away from 
Canadian taxpayers is to change how it defines income. That is 
exactly what the government has done, and we must point that out.
<P>
	The 1997 budget documents say that the only way to judge the 
impact of taxes is to measure the increase in taxes against growth in 
the economy. That is a good way of doing it. When we look at the 
growth in personal income taxes in Canada versus the size of the 
economy since the government came to power they have gone up 
over 14 per cent. The government has done that by redefining 
income. It has removed legitimate deductions so that overall 
Canadians have faced an increase in taxation. Ultimately that 
means that Canadians are paying more and more money.
<P>
	That is why revenues have gone up over $24 billion in four 
years. That was not because of growth in the economy. Growth in 
the economy would not come anywhere near to accounting for that 
growth in revenue. Obviously the government has closed up 
legitimate deductions that Canadian families rely on. The result has 
been that the government does not need to make the cuts in 
departmental spending that it promised to make in the 1995 budget.
<P>
	In other words the government cut the heart out of health care 
and higher education. They were cut by 40 per cent. It has closed 
more hospitals in the country than any premier. That is a fact. It has 
cut the heart out of higher education. Many university students are 
struggling to pay back loans because the government has cut back 
so dramatically in areas of higher education.
<P>
	When it came to departmental spending, when it came to cutting 
in its own backyard despite its promise that it would cut by 19 per 
cent, the government failed to cut anywhere near that. It came up to 
about half that amount. The government went on a spending binge. 
It spent money on flags, on television production funds and all 
kinds of ridiculous things. It gave away money to Bombardier 
which just announced a $400 million profit.
<P>
	The government has completely failed Canadians in the vital 
areas where the government should be responsible. It failed to 
provide the levels of health care funding that Canadians deserve 
and want. It failed to provide levels of higher education funding 
that Canadians truly deserve.
<P>
	Contrary to what the parliamentary secretary says the budget 
deserves even more debate. We need to talk more about all these 
changes. We do not need to force it through committee before 
second reading. We need to have some real debate.
<P>
	I want to follow up a bit more on what the parliamentary 
secretary said. He talked about personal income tax rates and I have 
addressed that. He failed to mention the government raised taxes in 
other areas: $1.5 billion for fuel taxes. We cannot ignore that. 
Canadians drive a lot. It is a big country. That impacts on all kinds 
of people.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9518"> 9518 </A></B>
<P>
	Let us not try to suggest that because the government did not 
raise personal income tax rates people have not felt the rise in 
taxes. That is ridiculous.
<P>
	Let us also talk about the massive $10 billion increase in CPP 
premiums the government has spearheaded. We just had the former 
parliamentary secretary for finance, the member from Winnipeg, 
saying in the newspaper in Winnipeg the other day that in 15 years 
we would have to revisit CPP. As he pointed out, young Canadians 
know that the changes being made are simply not adequate. They 
do not address the concerns of young Canadians. It is just like 30 
years ago when the Liberal government brought in the CPP on an 
unsustainable footing. We will be put in the same situation because 
of the changes the Liberal government is bringing in now. We will 
be put in that same situation.
<P>
<B>(1035)</B>
<P>
	The member from Winnipeg has been honest with Canadians in 
pointing that out. There have been $10 billion in increases on hard 
working Canadian taxpayers. Ultimately the Canada pension plan 
will not be put on a sustainable footing. I am glad the member from 
Winnipeg had the courage to point that out. He deserves some 
credit.
<P>
	I want to talk about some specifics in Bill C-92, for example the 
child care expense deduction. The government will raise the 
maximum age of children with respect to who may claim the 
deduction from 14 years to 16 years of age. How many people put 
children who are 16 years old in child care? Is that really a good use 
of precious government resources right now? It is ridiculous.
<P>
	When people in Ontario were polled a margin of 7:1 said they 
would much prefer tax relief for the entire family as opposed to 
putting more money into child care. Effectively that is what this 
change does. Instead of listening to the bureaucrats, instead of 
using our own petty reserve of judgment which the government has 
done, let us listen to the Canadian people. They are telling us, said 
by a margin of 7:1, that they want tax relief for the entire family.
<P>
	Not coincidentally that is exactly what the Reform Party 
proposed in our fresh start platform. We say that parenting is 
valuable irrespective of whether the child goes to day care or a 
parent chooses to stay at home and raise children. We proposed 
changing the child care expense deduction to a credit and extending 
it to every family in the country who has children 12 years of age 
and under. That will put more money in the pockets of all 
Canadians and not discriminate against those people who choose to 
stay at home with their children. I cannot believe the government 
allows that to continue when Canadians have spoken out so clearly 
in favour of the plan we propose.
<P>
	Another change in Bill C-92, which I noticed the parliamentary 
secretary did not focus on, was government was requiring RRSPs
<P>
to mature at age 69 rather than at age 71. The Canada pension plan 
is under tremendous pressure today. People have admitted in the 
Liberal caucus they do not have confidence the Canada pension 
plan will be there to serve them well. This is what the member from 
Winnipeg was talking about the other day.
<P>
	Why in the world are we saying that from here on in people will 
only be able to contribute to their RRSP until age 69? The two 
years between 69 and 71 are precious years for compounding. That 
is when they have the most money in their RRSPs. If there is 
another two years to contribute and to allow compounding to 
happen it would mean a lot more income. Unfortunately the 
government seems to take the approach that people should be 
penalized for trying to provide for their own retirement.
<P>
	I fail to understand why we should be allowing the bill to be 
pushed through so quickly when it is an important issue. Canadians 
obviously feel very concerned about the viability of the Canada 
pension plan, especially considering the sorry record of previous 
federal governments and this one too in ensuring that the Canada 
pension plan has the necessary funding to provide for all 
Canadians.
<P>
	I will touch for a moment on the issue of foreign reporting rules. 
I will allow my hon. friend from Calgary Centre to speak on this 
issue in a bit more detail. With respect to foreign reporting rules the 
government is proposing that people with offshore assets of over 
$100,000 must declare them and fill out the paperwork. I do not 
deny that there are some people who abuse the reporting of income 
from assets held offshore. Undoubtedly that happens. It happens in 
Canada as well. That is why we have auditors who go around 
checking these things. To all of a sudden make the assumption that 
all people are cheating and we have to record all their assets is 
absolutely ridiculous. If we apply that principle we should be doing 
it in Canada as well.
<P>
<B>(1040)</B>
<P>
	The government should be focusing its resources on doing more 
audits, if it is suspicious about people not reporting income, instead 
of creating one more massive bureaucracy. There will be 
truckloads of forms that will have to be filled out. It will ultimately 
cause some people to leave the country because they will not want 
to face that kind of scrutiny from big brother.
<P>
	My time is up, but I invite my colleagues in the Reform Party to 
have another go at this ridiculous bill.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak to Bill C-92, which in a way 
brings the Income Tax Act and another  act related to the Income 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9519"> 9519 </A></B>
<P>
Tax Act in line with the 1996 budget, last year's budget in other 
words.
<P>
	Before I begin, I would like to indicate my agreement with my 
hon. colleague from the Reform Party when he says:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``This government closed more hospitals than was ever done 
before by any other government''. He is absolutely right. That is 
the reality of things.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	There was absolutely nothing new in the 1996 budget and, ever 
since it came to the House, the Bloc Quebecois has, as you know, 
been calling for a complete reworking of the Canadian taxation 
system in order to bring it up to date. Since our arrival, we have 
been recommending an item-by-item analysis of all government 
expenditures.
<P>
	This was not to be found in last year's budget, nor will it be in 
this year's. At the very most, the Minister of Finance announced in 
the last budget the creation of a technical committee on corporate 
taxation, or more specifically on tax havens.
<P>
	The mandate of this committee is, however, too narrow for these 
recommendations to lead to the changes required to get Quebecers 
and Canadians back to work. It contained no measures specifically 
related to employment or to ensuring an equitable division of the 
tax burden between individuals and businesses on the one hand, 
and major corporations and small and medium size businesses on 
the other, the latter being the true creators of employment in both 
Canada and Quebec.
<P>
	There are still serious doubts about the objectivity of the 
members of this committee. Several come from big private 
companies which advise wealthy clients and major corporations on 
how to avoid paying taxes. Certain members of the committee are, 
therefore, in a definite conflict-of-interest situation, and we spoke 
out against this situation last year.
<P>
	We know that this committee has had an extension and must 
table its report by the end of 1997, after the election of course, and 
we also know that the majority of members of the committee 
examining the use of tax shelters by corporations themselves make 
use of tax shelters, and often have businesses in the tax havens they 
are supposed to be studying.
<P>
	Yet, in its 1996 budget, the government attacked one tax 
measure, perhaps the only one, while unemployment is still 
rampant, and the Liberals have not succeeded in meeting their 
election promise of jobs, jobs, jobs. It has not been said often 
enough, nor can it ever be said often enough: the Minister of 
Finance has directly attacked a priority tool for job creation. The 
Liberal government has cut the tax assistance to workers' funds, in 
particular by reducing the federal tax credit linked to these funds,  
and by decreasing the annual maximum that can be invested in 
them.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois was very critical of this decision, as you 
know, and even suggested, when tabling its documents on tax 
reform, that the maximum annual amount should be restored to the 
level it was before the cuts were made. We must not forget that the 
purpose of these funds is to create or protect jobs, mostly in 
Quebec. The FTQ fund alone was able to preserve or create 38,000 
jobs.
<P>
	The government remains inconsistent. It talks about job creation 
and then savagely attacks the only tax measure we could be 
absolutely sure would create jobs. This measure, as we said before, 
mainly affects Quebec, because half of the money in these funds 
comes from Quebec. The Bloc Quebecois has constantly been after 
the government on the tax system. We did so in the case of family 
trusts, and although the response was not always satisfactory, we 
have done this systematically. We did so in the case of the GST, a 
government promise that was not kept, and in the case of the 
shocking abuse of tax havens.
<P>
<B>(1045)</B>
<P>
	From the outset the Bloc has been asking for a thorough review 
of both corporate and personal taxes. This aspect of our tax system 
has not been updated for many years.
<P>
	But we did more than criticize. Since we were well aware that 
last year the government did nothing and had no intention of doing 
anything in this year's budget, which has been confirmed, the Bloc 
did some research and drafted two papers, one on corporate 
taxation which received the approval of the Minister of Finance, 
who said we did a professional job. He took the report we wrote but 
has now probably dumped it in file 13.
<P>
	We produced two analyses that consider all aspects of corporate 
and personal taxes, something that normally should have been done 
by the government. I may remind you it has been quite some time 
since Canada's tax laws were reviewed. I may also remind you that 
this is the first time an opposition party did the government's job 
by doing its own analysis of the tax system, something the 
government should have done.
<P>
	The opposition parties have a relatively small budget for 
research and compared with the government, their resources are 
extremely limited. Nevertheless, we took the trouble to produce 
this study and do a full analysis of the tax system.
<P>
	I would like to give you some idea of the work that was done on 
corporate taxation, for instance. But first, I would like explain, for 
the benefit of our listeners, what a tax expenditure is. When we sit 
on committees, the first thing tax experts tell us when they come to 
meet members and individuals sitting in is: ``Tax laws are 
extremely complicated. You will need our help plus a  whole 
battery of lawyers to understand the system''. I would say that tax 
laws are 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9520"> 9520 </A></B>
<P>
purposely obscure so the general public cannot understand what 
they mean.
<P>
	I recommend reading Linda McQuaig's book recently published 
in English in Toronto as <I>The Lion's Share</I> and translated into 
French as <I>La part du lion</I>. The book shows, over a period of 30 or 
40 years, precisely how wealthy Canadians used tax leverage to 
their advantage and to the disadvantage of the ever poorer middle 
class.
<P>
	Fiscal spending occurs when a tax deduction is accorded for 
some reason to a corporation or an individual. When an individual 
is accorded a tax deduction of $1,000, it is as if the government 
sent them a cheque for $1,000-because this amount was owing to 
the government-as in the example given, but it looks better.
<P>
	Clearly if the government sent a $50,000 cheque to a company, 
the public would understand what was happening and would object, 
so it gives a $50,000 tax credit under some provision described in a 
book somewhere in a huge pile of books. Nobody sees what goes 
on, but the $50,000 will be paid by someone other than the 
company-the general public.
<P>
	So, if this sort of tax arrangement is made for all companies, 
which is what is happening in Canada, little by little, the tax burden 
is displaced and transferred from corporations, the rich, to the 
middle class, which is becoming poorer for having to pay others' 
taxes.
<P>
	I would like to point out that we used the Carter report from 
1962, which remains valid today in many cases, to prepare our 
analysis, which comprises some 100 pages on corporate taxes 
alone. We have clearly shown this in a table based on statistics on 
personal taxes for the 1993 taxation year taken from government 
documents.
<P>
<B>(1050)</B>
<P>
	We have clearly shown that, since 1950 to date, more and more 
taxes have been transferred from companies that should be paying 
them to individuals who are in fact paying them now. I would like 
to cite five key dates as examples, even though the trend remains 
constant from year to year. These five dates reveal the extent to 
which the tax burden has shifted from the companies-the 
wealthy-to individuals: in 1952, 51 per cent of Canada's income 
taxes were paid by corporations; in 1962, 36 per cent; in 1972,20 per cent of taxes were paid by companies; in 1982, 17 per cent; 
and, in 1992, 7.6 per cent. These figures are from Statistics Canada.
<P>
	As we can see, from 1950 on, the burden has shifted, with the tax 
load being transferred from the rich to the middle class. So, today, 
when we look at the number of unemployed, the number of people 
on welfare and the number of poor people in Canada, we see that 
the rich have succeeded in transferring their tax debt to the people 
in the middle class, who are becoming increasingly poorer.
<P>
	We would have liked the Minister of Finance to really examine 
and utilize both last year and this year the reports we provided, 
which he himself described as highly professional and which are 
based on Statistics Canada figures.
<P>
	I close on this point. In the 1996 and 1997 budgets, we saw no 
effort by the minister to look hard at Canadian taxation.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough-Rouge River, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to engage in the debate on this motion which 
would advance the government's bill to implement elements of the 
1996 budget.
<P>
	I could not help but reach a conclusion earlier this morning that 
some of the opposition comments are bordering on the hysterical. I 
refer to some remarks of colleagues in the Reform Party. Some of 
the remarks are less than accurate.
<P>
	I want to attempt to put some balance into the record. For 
example, there was a suggestion that there was a 40 per cent 
reduction in the transfer payments from the federal government to 
the provinces which impacted on education, social programs and 
health care.
<P>
	What the Reform Party fails to acknowledge, and I stand 
corrected if I am wrong, is that at the time those transfers were 
renegotiated with the provinces there were tax points transferred as 
well. Tax points are the equivalent of cash.
<P>
	This is a process whereby the federal government actually turns 
over to the province the equivalent of a tax point, 1 per cent or a 
portion of a point of taxes. That is worth money, just as a transfer of 
cash is.
<P>
	For someone to stand in the House and not include that in their 
remarks in discussing transfers to the provinces, whether 
equalization or the old CAP or whether it is under the current 
Canada health and social transfer, is less than accurate.
<P>
	There was also a remark that the federal government has closed 
more hospitals than the premiers. This could not possibly be a fact. 
Most Canadians know that the federal government does not 
administer hospitals.
<P>
	Hospitals are administered locally and by provinces. To my 
knowledge, the federal government has not closed a single hospital 
unless there is some reference to the national defence medical 
centre which is not closed but which continues.
<P>
<B>(1055 )</B>
<P>
	I think that is less than accurate, if I can continue to use that 
euphemism, in suggesting it. It is utter nonsense for the Reform 
Party of Canada to say, and I am quoting what the hon. member 
said, that the federal government has closed more hospitals than the 
premiers. Please set me right if I am wrong on this.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9521"> 9521 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> You are wrong.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee:</B> The member will have an opportunity to speak later.
<P>
	I am also struck by the degree and amount of what I will call the 
retropromise. It seems that anything that has moved within the last 
three or four years is now being characterized by the almost 
hysterical Reform Party and sometimes members of the Bloc 
Quebecois as a promise. If I per chance two or three years ago had 
told someone I intend to be in Ottawa on Thursday, hon. members 
opposite seem to have a penchant now for characterizing those 
words as a promise.
<P>
	Day in and day out now in this debate we have constant reference 
by members opposite to what I call the retropromise. If it moved it 
was a promise and in the event that I did not happen to show up in 
Ottawa on Thursday, I broke my promise. That is not fair. I think 
Canadians see through that.
<P>
	Aside from these deliberate acts, misleading revisionism 
involving the retropromise, there are a couple of other areas I could 
not help but note and I think Canadians noted as well. They are 
references to tax increases. I have heard members opposite talk 
about increases in taxes. What they are really talking about is that 
there has been growth in the economy, there has been population 
growth, there have been increases in business revenues. Everyone 
knows that when that happens there is an increase in tax revenues.
<P>
	If hon. members opposite want to call that tax increases, they can 
do it but I do not think that is fair. I think that is misleading. When 
this government says that it has not increased taxes in a certain 
area, that is the truth. When members here say that, it is the truth 
and they mean it. When members opposite say there has been a tax 
increase, they seem incapable of speaking straight on the issue and 
what they really mean is the economy has grown, business 
revenues have increased, the population has increased and 
therefore tax revenues have increased.
<P>
	I hope members opposite will forgive the growth in the economy 
and forgive the increasing prosperity of this country for generating 
more tax revenues.
<P>
	I do not have any illusions that my remarks today will make 
much of a difference in the rhetoric around this place, but I thought 
I should put that on the record.
<P>
	I want to address as well one of the items in this important bill 
dealing with the budget. I want to talk about the proposal to reduce 
the age limit for maturing registered pension plans, RRSPs, the 
reduction in the age for contributing to those plans from 71 to 69. 
What that means is simply that individuals will not be able to 
contribute to RRSPs or accrue pension benefits after age 69. They 
will also have to start drawing income out of those plans by the end 
of the year in which they turn 69.
<P>
	This change is being made for a number of important reasons. 
The first reason is that it will help to move the maturation age for 
retirement savings and pension plans closer in line with the ages at 
which most Canadians will start retiring. The simple fact is that 
very few Canadians are saving for future retirement when they are 
in their seventies.
<P>
<B>(1100)</B>
<P>
	A second and closely related consideration is that the proposed 
measure will limit the use of RRSPs for estate planning purposes, 
that is, what will happen to a person's cash and assets after they are 
no longer with us. The use of the RRSP for that purpose is outside 
of scope of what was originally intended. The RRSP is for the 
living. It is for the person who is retiring, and the type of generous 
tax assistance provided to the RRSP mechanism was never 
intended for estate planning purposes.
<P>
	There is the broader question of cost. The federal revenue cost of 
tax assistance for retirement savings is now quite significant. 
Technically, inside government it is called tax expenditure. It is 
really a question of tax revenues forgone in assistance of the 
retirement savings mechanism. In 1993 that tax expenditure 
totalled nearly $16 billion. As the finance minister has made very 
clear, the government is firmly committed to preserving Canada's 
retirement assistance program which serves a vital function. It does 
so in a very effective way, measured in both Canadian and world 
standards.
<P>
	However, steps had to be taken to ensure that this program 
remained financially sustainable. The cost of the program was 
limited while assistance was targeted where needed. Even with the 
changes announced in the 1996 budget, the system will remain a 
generous one.
<P>
	As this is an important debate on important legislation, I return 
to my opening theme which is to encourage colleagues in the 
House to try to stick a little closer to the straight line of accuracy 
when they use terms like those I have mentioned. I respect the need 
of the opposition parties to hit hard at things. They do not think our 
policies are the way they should be but it would help us all if we 
would use a standard of rhetoric and a standard of language. We 
should use terminology that keeps us straighter to the line and that 
allows Canadians to better understand the public policy issues that 
we debate here.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise to add 
my two cents worth to this debate and to talk about the 1997 
budget. I will discuss five or six points.
<P>
	First, the budget projects a deficit of $19 billion. That is an awful 
lot of money. Yet the government is bragging that this figure means 
that the back of the deficit has been broken. It spends $19 billion 
more than it brings in and it claims that it has broken the back of 
the deficit. It came in with a deficit around $42 billion. It boosted it 
to $42 billion from $38 billion. It has reduced it to $19 billion 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9522"> 9522 </A></B>
<P>
which is a little over half. It has taken the  government four years to 
cut the deficit by $23 billion. In my estimation that is just half a 
job. It is only half good which means it is also half bad.
<P>
	It is a shame this finance minister brags to the nation that our 
finances are in good order. We are spending more than we bring in. 
He is giving the Canadian public a false sense of security. It is one 
thing to hold out hope-which is important-but it is another thing 
to claim victory before you have won the battle.
<P>
	There is another thing I do not like about this budget and the 
finance minister. The finance minister plays games. He cooks the 
books. He does what the previous member just talked about. He 
borderlines on representation and sometimes comes close to 
misrepresentation. He reduced the social transfer by $7.5 billion, 
which I believe is an accurate number. I believe it covers health 
care, welfare and education. I believe it affects all the provinces. I 
believe it means they have less money to put into health care, 
education and welfare, which means they in turn have to do 
something and the problem has been transferred to them. It is 
called downloading, I believe. I believe all those statements are 
accurate and true and not a misrepresentation.
<P>
<B>(1105)</B>
<P>
	To justify this painful decision, which I also agree had to be 
done, the government said it would cut $9.5 billion or $9.8 billion 
from departmental program spending. That is the amount of money 
that is spent, excluding these transfer payments to provinces. After 
four years only $4.6 billion has been cut. There are $5.2 billion 
missing.
<P>
	The President of the Treasury Board tried to explain it to our 
finance critic and our deputy critics. He almost had them 
hoodwinked. Talk about misrepresentation. Talk about cooking the 
books. Talk about keeping on the straight and narrow and being 
honest with the people and telling them the way it really is.
<P>
	I am not going to distort this, I am going to be very accurate. 
What really happened in this case is that the government, in order 
to come up with an explanation on why it is $5.2 billion short of its 
projected $9.8 billion promise after four years said, ``wait a second, 
there is another year''. Plus the government has changed the 
definition of departmental spending between what it was in 1995 
and today. That is accurate because it came right from the Treasury 
Board officials when we met with them.
<P>
	That is how the government can claim that it kept to 18.8 per 
cent and how $4.6 billion now represents 18.8 per cent in program 
spending reductions versus the $9.6 billion, the definition in 1995. 
This is how the government plays games, and I am tired of it. I 
hope that the Canadian public is tired of it as well.
<P>
	The finance minister has gone against generally accepted 
accounting principles. The auditor general slapped his wrist for it 
in the last budget.
<P>
	The public accounts committee will be meeting in two weeks. I 
have asked for finance minister's presence but he cannot make it 
because he is busy. However, the deputy minister will be there. I 
want to know how they can get away writing off $961 million on 
the harmonization of the sales tax in the budget two years ago when 
the money just went out last October.
<P>
	There are $800 million for the foundation for innovation that 
will be spent over the next five years which is written off in this 
budget. That is not right. There had better be a darned good 
agreement with that foundation. There had better be a darned good 
signed agreement with all the provinces on where the money is 
going and who is going to get the money for innovation. If not, the 
books are being cooked. Public sector companies get fined by 
Revenue Canada for doing things like this.
<P>
	Money cannot be written and charged off to a year's expenses 
unless that money has been spent or there is an agreement in 
writing in which the money is committed to be spent in a short 
term, meaning one year, not five. We will see. The meeting is 
coming up in two weeks.
<P>
	I have already heard government members say twice now that 
the government has not raised personal taxes. I agree. It is a true 
statement. Then the finance minister and even the Prime Minister 
in question period say, ``We have not raised taxes,'' which is a 
much different statement. Is that not misrepresentation? Is that not 
borderline with what the member just talked about and that he 
wishes members would not do? I wish he would talk to his finance 
minister and to his Prime Minister and tell them not to do it 
because they are giving Canadians a false sense of reality.
<P>
	Finally, after being pushed by our finance critics they agreed: 
``Yes, if you mean that we have eliminated loopholes for wealthy 
companies, yes, we have increased taxes. If you mean that we have 
done insurance things, yes, we have increased taxes''. We finally 
got it out of them. Then a day later they said: ``We have not raised 
taxes''.
<P>
	There are two ways to raise taxes. If it is the personal tax rate, 
they have not done it. I agree. But they have raised taxes through 
the elimination and reduction of the sizes of exemptions and what 
can be deducted. Therefore, they have raised taxes 35 times.
<P>
	Let me give another example of the games they play. My 
colleague from British Columbia submitted a petition prior to the 
1995 budget about not raising taxes on gasoline. We are afraid of it, 
and were saying, do not do it. They claim they have not raised 
excise taxes. We know they have. We know that two years ago they 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9523"> 9523 </A></B>
<P>
raised the  excise tax on gasoline by 1.5 cents. Is that true or not 
true?
<P>
<B>(1110)</B>
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> That's true.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> A Liberal said: ``That's true''. They raised excise 
taxes on gasoline by 1.5 cents per litre, which amounts to an 
increase in government revenue of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion. That 
is a tax increase, is it not? It is a tax increase. I got that concession 
as well.
<P>
	In response to the petition, here is what the Department of 
Finance, perhaps under the influence of the finance minister, 
claims: ``-that the past two budgets presented to the House of 
Commons in March 1996 and February 1997 contained no tax 
increases in any area. In particular, these budgets did not propose 
any increases in the excise tax on gasoline''.
<P>
	It went on to say: ``Since taking office the government's budget 
savings have been secured principally from expenditure reductions 
rather than tax increases. Ninety-one per cent of the $28 billion 
reduction in the 1998-99 deficit is due to expenditure reductions. 
These budget initiatives will enable the government to keep 
moving toward budget balance''.
<P>
	Let us see how close that is to the truth. Let us see how close that 
is to borderline misrepresentation.
<P>
	These are bureaucrats that work for the Canadian people. Are 
they not supposed to be honour bound? What they said in the first 
sentence is true. They did not increase the excise tax on gasoline in 
this budget or in last year's budget. The increase was contained in 
the budget previous to that.
<P>
	That is playing mind games. That is playing word games. We all 
know that. This kind of stuff makes me sick. It is one of the reasons 
I am getting out of politics. We do not have enough people who are 
prepared to tell the truth and hold the course. That is why 
politicians are held in such low esteem in the country. They do not 
keep their election promises.
<P>
	Provincially it is slowly changing. Alberta especially has done 
an excellent job of holding the line. Ontario appears to be 
following, although it might be wavering on a few promises 
because of the pressure of the 98 federal Liberals in Ontario who 
want the Ontario government to start spending money.
<P>
	There have been 35 tax increases. The department says there 
have not been revenue increases, but that there have been 
expenditure cuts. That is not true. Tax revenues have increased by 
$30 billion. Yes, a lot of it is due to growth in the economy.
<P>
	Let us talk about that wonderful growth. It is 2.5 per cent. Boy, 
that is a booming economy. Darn, that is almost the rate of
<P>
inflation. It has been just a bit higher in the last couple of years. 
Boy, they have done a great  job. Two per cent per year for four 
years. That is wonderful. We should all clap and be happy.
<P>
	Yes, that has increased tax revenues. However, the 35 tax 
increases, which represent $30 billion in revenue, amount to about 
$12 billion in extra tax revenue due to tax increases. It is not all 
attributable to growth in the economy. If any member opposite says 
it is all due to growth in the economy they are misrepresenting the 
issue. He knows that.
<P>
	Do I have time to wrap up my comments, Mr. Speaker?

<P>
<B>(1115)</B>
<P>
	The subject of income tax raises the spectre of government 
digging into the pockets of individual and corporate taxpayers in 
order to cover its expenditures.
<P>
	I cannot help but notice that our finance minister's insatiable 
appetite is caused by the fact that, for many years, government 
spending has exceeded government revenues. The Minister of 
Finance spends more than he earns. In fact, he is like the captain of 
a boat that is taking on water. Because the Minister of Finance has 
failed to plug the holes, the ship is sinking.
<P>
	The finance minister did reduce the deficit. He did slow down 
the rate at which the water is flowing in. But do you know how he 
did it? Not by plugging the holes, but by throwing bucketfuls of 
water onto the provinces' ships. His financial needs and appetite 
remain unsatisfied. He needs more and more money, which, of 
course, comes out of the pockets of taxpayers.
<P>
	It must be realized that the overall situation as regards taxation 
and public spending, both at the federal and at the provincial level, 
including in Quebec, is not good, and the basic problem that gave 
rise to all these difficulties originated in this House, right where the 
finance minister sits.
<P>
	We saw how the Harris government, in Ontario, and the Quebec 
government headed by Mr. Bouchard were forced to take drastic 
measures and to make deep cuts to the health and education sectors, 
and even to their own human resources, the provincial public 
service. Indeed, we witnessed very sad situations experienced by 
people in Quebec, in Ontario and in other provinces. The public 
must realize that these problems are not created by the provincial 
governments, but that they have their roots in this House, right 
where the finance minister sits.
<P>
	The minister simply dumped his problem on the provinces, by 
cutting the funds that were supposed to go to the provinces. He did 
so in two ways. First, by reducing transfer payments. What is a 
transfer payment? Under this process, the federal government 
essentially gives back to a provincial government the money paid 
by the taxpayers of that province. However, in this case, the federal 
government simply decided not to do so, with the result that the 
provinces are no longer getting the money to which they are 
entitled. We are talking about $2 billion, which was earmarked for 
health services and higher education.
<P>
<B>(1120)</B>
<P>
	It comes as no surprise that the provinces, including Quebec, 
were forced to cut services and budgets relating to health and 
education, given that the $2 billion paid to the federal Minister of 
Finance by Quebec taxpayers was never given back to the province.
<P>
	But there is something else which, in a way, is even worse. The 
minister has developed the bad habit of  taking $5 billion a year out 
of the employment insurance fund, which used to be called the 
unemployment insurance fund. Five billion dollars is an awful lot 
of money. In fact, what the Minister of Finance has done is to 
artificially create a tax on the backs of workers and their 
employers.
<P>
	If we look at it in terms of proportions, we could say that each 
time a worker or an employer pays a dollar in premiums to the EI 
fund, 30 cents of this dollar will be skimmed off; not borrowed, not 
put into a separate fund for the eventual benefit of workers and 
employers but, when it boils right down to it, diverted from its 
initial purpose, which was to provide for the future needs of the 
unemployed, and used to reduce the finance minister's deficit.
<P>
	Of course the Minister of Finance can then say he has reduced 
the deficit. Let us be clear. He has not eliminated the deficit, he has 
not prevented the ship from taking on water, he has not pumped out 
the water that is already slowing us down. No. He has just reduced 
the amount of water in the hold. How did he accomplish that? By 
passing on the problem to employers and employees throughout the 
country, using 30 cents of every dollar to mop up the consequences 
of the deficit. It is a tax in disguise that the Minister of Finance will 
not admit to publicly.
<P>
	Fortunately the official opposition is here to denounce it, to 
explain it and to see that people understand clearly that what is 
happening provincially is not the cause, that the provinces are not 
to blame, but rather the method of operating imposed by the 
Minister of Finance, here in the House.
<P>
	Something must be done about what is going on and, as my 
colleague mentioned earlier, the Bloc Quebecois has proposed in 
this House appropriate, detailed and carefully thought out measures 
to rectify the discrepancies that now exist in tax measures. In fact, 
with respect to individual taxpayers, the Bloc Quebecois has 
produced a well researched document in which it proposes to the 
finance minister ways of eliminating unfairness and introducing 
new measures that would help families and others.
<P>
	With respect to corporations, old tax loopholes that are to all 
intents and purposes no longer used, except by corporations rich 
enough to do so, should be eliminated and replaced by measures 
more likely to encourage businesses to create jobs.
<P>
<B>(1125)</B>
<P>
	One of the things I should perhaps point out in closing is that it is 
unfortunate that the Minister of Finance has not at least 
implemented one of these measures, which was intended to prevent 
corporations from deferring taxes indefinitely. As things stand 
now, corporations are in a position to avoid paying taxes today, 
next year 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9525"> 9525 </A></B>
<P>
and  for years to come, because of certain provisions in the Income 
Tax Act.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois has asked, and will continue to ask the 
finance minister to take action to eliminate these measures and 
replace them with new measures that are effective and productive 
and that, above all, show respect for the citizens of Quebec and of 
Canada.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to debate Bill C-92 at second reading. The parliamentary 
secretary well laid out the principal features in Bill C-92. I do not 
propose to repeat them. He has done an excellent job.
<P>
	I take this opportunity to put on record my views on an issue that 
has been raised in my constituency by a number of my constituents, 
particularly seniors. It is modifications to the RRSP rules, 
particularly with regard to the lowering of the age at which 
contributions can be made down from 71 to 69.
<P>
	There has been much written in seniors publications about this. 
One need only look at who is offering these publications and these 
articles. One has to assess what their motivation might be.
<P>
	An article has been circulating by a former member of this place, 
Garth Turner. He is suggesting this change is awful, that it will cost 
anywhere from a $36,000 reduction in the value of an RRSP 
account for a Canadian.
<P>
	I want to attempt to explain how one might account for this 
apparently significant number and why it is very misleading. The 
maximum contribution under RRSPs is currently $13,500. To the 
extent that a taxpayer would not be making contributions in either 
their 70th or 71st year, it means that $27,000 will not be 
contributed to the plan. Therefore naturally the planned value will 
not be as high if those capital contributions have not been made.
<P>
	Second, there would be an additional two years of interest 
accumulation on all contributions that have been made throughout 
the contribution lifetime of the taxpayer which would not be 
accumulating and compounding during those two years.
<P>
	Of the $30,000-odd that the accounts would be lower, this 
represents some $27,000 of capital which Mr. Turner, if entirely 
honest with Canadians and with seniors, would say that although 
their RRSP account will be lower by $27,000, their bank account 
would be higher by $27,000 because that contribution was not 
made.
<P>
	It is absolutely intellectually dishonest for anyone to suggest that 
there is this loss of principle simply because it is not in one pocket 
but in another. We have to look at value of the wealth of an 
individual in all its forms.
<P>
	I want Canadians to reflect on what is happening when RRSP 
time comes around. There is a feeding frenzy of people trying to 
sell RRSPs. One has to wonder why it is  important for them that 
we buy from this one or that one. There is one very simple reason 
why they are trying to alarm the public about this. This is when 
they earn their living. This is when they make these massive 
commissions on selling.
<P>
	These commissions are charged through to the funds that we are 
investing in and passed on to us through management fees and 
general expenses of the fund management. They have a vested 
interest in selling more and more simply because it means money 
in their pockets.
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	I want the ordinary taxpayer and those seniors watching the 
proceedings or will read <I>Hansard</I> to know there is another part of 
the story they have to look at. It is not in the best interest of any 
taxpayer to see how much money they can put into an RRSP. The 
real issue is how much can they put in and what plan do they need 
to get it out with the lowest possible tax consequences.
<P>
	Many Canadians are fortunate to earn substantial amounts of 
money which allow them to buy $13,500 of RRSPs and effectively 
obtain a 50 per cent tax savings as a result of that contribution. If 
they turn around and purchase an RRSP for a spouse who is not 
working and come retirement time take their corporate pension and 
the spouses who are working in the home take out the RRSP 
moneys, they have effectively split the income and are both paying 
at a lower rate.
<P>
	The tax rate at which the contribution was put in was high. The 
tax rate at which the contribution is paid out is low. There is an 
automatic windfall in rate. Never mind the savings by the virtue of 
the fact that they have government money on which they are able to 
earn investment income. Everybody is entitled to that. High 
income earners are entitled and have an opportunity to income split 
or by set up their income averaging annuities in a way that allows 
them to stream the income out at the lowest possible rates.
<P>
	The best advice in my view for Canadian taxpayers is not how to 
get the total amount of money into the RRSP. When it is one's time 
to go and there is no surviving spouse, the full amount collapses 
and is taxed in the year in which a taxpayer is deceased at the 
highest possible rate.
<P>
	Canadians have to look at their spousal situation. They have to 
look at their personal health situation and they have to anticipate.
<P>
	Although I am a chartered accountant I do not propose to give 
advice to anybody on how to manage their affairs, but I raise these 
issues for them to ask the questions of people who would suggest 
that somehow not being able to put money in an RRSP is bad. My 
own personal view it is best to wonder how to get it in and how to 
get it out at the lowest possible rate.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9526"> 9526 </A></B>
<P>
	On top of that taxpayers should know that once the moneys 
come out of an RRSP and are taxed in taxpayers' hands at a lower 
rate they have an opportunity to do something with the cash. One 
of the best recommendations I had for some family members I 
have talked to was to help out their family members who do not 
have the cash flow they need to invest in their own RRSPs so they 
can start building up and preparing for their retirement income.
<P>
	When gifts of cash given to family members who are 19 years of 
age or over there is no income attribution back to the person who 
gave the money to them. It is important for taxpayers to look at the 
long term plan of not only building up an RRSP fund and getting a 
good return but also finding out a strategy on how to stream that 
money out for the best tax advantage for the family as a whole.
<P>
	I hope Canadian taxpayers and certainly seniors in my riding 
will be cognizant of the other questions to ask experts in RRSPs 
whose only interest is that they want to sell more. They have to ask 
them: ``What is my plan to get that money out? How can I make it 
work the best for me, for my spouse, for my children and for other 
family members?'' Families do care about the financial health and 
the physical health of all family members. That is the way it should 
be.
<P>
	Mr. Garth Turner and others tend to bring forward rash 
generalizations about what a terrible thing it is. They have been 
intellectually dishonest with taxpayers if they suggested the change 
in years from 71 to 69 took cash from RRSP accounts without 
saying that it increased cash in their personal bank accounts. That 
is telling half the story.
<P>
	Canadians have to know where they are coming from. Canadians 
have to know why they are trying to push RRSP investments on 
them. It is because it is in their best interest with the high 
commission rates they are getting.
<P>
<B>(1135 )</B>
<P>
	I know some would think those are strong words, but every now 
and then Canadians have to be alerted to the fact that they need the 
whole story from the beginning to the end to ensure the decisions 
they make are in the best interest of not only their own financial 
planning but of the rest of their family members.
<P>
	I hope this insight into one aspect of the bill will help Canadians 
to ask questions that are important for them when looking at 
retirement planning.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as I stand to speak to the budget debate it would be fair to 
say that I speak for millions of Canadians from coast to coast to 
coast. If things are so good why do I feel so bad? If things in our 
economy are so good why do I not have any money?
<P>
	All Canadians appreciate that for all levels of government, 
municipal, provincial and federal-and the federal government 
especially has by far been the most devious-taxation no longer 
has much to do with income or resources. It has more to do with 
licensing. If the tax stream coming in from people is based on 
profit or income it is variable. Governments do not like variable 
income. They like income that they can depend on. Therefore far 
less of our taxes have anything to do with how much money we 
have, how much money we have made or our profit. It has more to 
do with the privilege of being either in business or having the 
privilege of earning income.
<P>
	I use as an example the recent changes to the Canada pension 
plan, perhaps the most nefarious of the worst investments any 
individual could make, particularly a young Canadian, with rates 
going up to 9.9 per cent. The finance minister and the Prime 
Minister are now the only two Canadians who say they are not 
taxes. They call them investments. It is a pretty rotten investment 
that takes 9.9 per cent of the working income of Canadians for their 
lives and gives them a return on investment of about $9,000 after 
40 years.
<P>
	Canadians have this ever increasing tax burden that is 
represented to them not as taxes but as licence fees, mandatory 
investments or whatever it is. It is almost impossible for a 
politician not to spend other people's money if it means there is a 
potential for the politician to be re-elected. That is the way it 
works.
<P>
	In my lifetime one did not get elected by telling people they had 
to live within our means or that we did not have any more money. 
One did not get elected by saying it is unfair to tax future 
generations of Canadians so that we can live beyond our means 
today.
<P>
	What government has ever been elected by looking people in the 
eye and telling them the truth? Certainly not this government and 
certainly none of the governments that got our country into this 
mess.
<P>
	The reason our country is in the mess it is in today is that 
politicians have had a free hand to spend other people's money, 
taxpayers' money, to get re-elected.
<P>
	How can we get ourselves out of this mess? We must say the 
only way to possibly reduce taxation levels is to reduce the size, the 
scope and the intervention of government in our daily lives. If we 
are not prepared as individuals to assume responsibility for our 
own lives, if we as individuals pass off responsibility for our lives 
to other people through governance, then it will take more and 
more and more resources of the nation to fund it.
<P>
	The first step is for Canadians to say they have had enough 
government; they want less government; they are sick and tired of 
it; and they are not going to take it any more. The only way we will 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9527"> 9527 </A></B>
<P>
achieve that is to elect people who will look us in the eye and tell us 
they must be  responsible for lives. We cannot ask others to be 
responsible for our lives.
<P>
	Collectively we will be responsible for each other. If we cannot 
first look after ourselves, how can we look after others? The 
interdependence we cherish is based on personal independence. If 
we cannot first be independent, how can we be interdependent?
<P>
<B>(1140 )</B>
<P>
	This brings me to the second item I would like to speak about, 
which also refers to the taxation by stealth the country has been 
living under for the last couple of budgets. It has to do with the 
changes to the support payments for parents who divorce or are 
separated.
<P>
	It used to be that when families unfortunately split up the 
custodial parent, the parent with the children, received money from 
the non-custodial parent. The paying parent earned a higher income 
and the taxes were paid by the receiving spouse, usually the female. 
She had the children. Her income was usually lower than that of the 
male and therefore she paid less tax.
<P>
	This situation has been changed in the budget. The taxes will 
now be paid by the spouse who makes the payments. The money 
will be received by the custodial parent. There are benefits to that, 
one of which is that at the end of the year the custodial spouse will 
not be nailed with an unexpected tax bill. In all cases they should 
expect it, but the reality is that most of us as human beings do not 
make provision for it and it comes as a surprise.
<P>
	That tax windfall, the changes in that tax ruling, will mean the 
federal government will take in an additional $200 million. The 
question is whether that $200 million will be turned back directly 
to the care and maintenance of children and whose children will be 
maintained by that.
<P>
	It should be the parents who make the decision on how the $200 
million is spent. There is no reason in the world why in the absence 
of an agreement on separation the taxes could not be split 50:50. 
There is no reason in the world the default position could not be 
50:50. With agreement by both parents in the court either parent 
could pay the tax. The taxes should be paid in the interests of the 
children so the majority of the money would stay with the children. 
Instead we have gone from all in one direction to all in another 
direction, which does not make sense.
<P>
	In the debate on the bill that spoke to the issue the point was 
made that there was no connection between access, custody and 
support payments. The only people who would make that assertion 
are people who do not know anything about it. If there is a problem 
in maintenance payments, in the regularity of the payments being 
made, obviously there will be a problem with custody. That is 
usually where the problems arise when there are problems. I do not 
know if it is possible for  legislatures to legislate common sense. In 
times when people's emotions are running on high it is difficult for 
the government to say: ``Wait a minute. You have to put the 
interests of your children first''.
<P>
	We can ensure the laws, the rules and the regulations we enact 
enure to the benefit of the children and make it less likely that there 
would be an explosive situation to be dealt with. It seems that 
maintenance payments are a tinderbox in relationships that have 
gone bad and that there is a continuing acrimony between the two 
parents. There might be a better way to handle the matter. I do not 
know what we have arrived at will achieve what it is hoped to 
achieve.
<P>
	Earlier the member opposite spoke about RRSPs and the changes 
in the budget which affect the collapsing of RRSPs. He did not say 
that it is the compounding of the money in the RRSP in a tax 
protected state that brings additional benefit to the people who own 
the RRSPs. RRSPs are the vehicle of savings for the vast majority 
of Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1145)</B>
<P>
	The vast majority of Canadians really do not have any savings 
outside of their RRSPs because there just is not that money. The 
increase in taxation by all levels of government, particularly by the 
federal government over the last few years, has sapped the total 
growth in the economy. When governments through taxation suck 
every bit of growth and money out of the economy then what is left 
to reinvest to create the new jobs?
<P>
	It is only through the decrease in taxation by all levels of 
government, particularly the federal government, that there will be 
money left in the hands of taxpayers that will be used as 
investments and purchases in a consumer economy.
<P>
	The changes through the seniors benefit were not mentioned at 
all. We are talking now about taxation by stealth. For the 
information of members opposite, there is a change to the old age 
security and the guaranteed income supplement. The seniors 
benefit which combines both ensures on a universal basis that all 
Canadians will receive $11,420 a year without tax but then the tax 
provisions that used to be on the guaranteed income supplement 
will be on the whole kit and caboodle. Old age security will be 
taxed by this government, which has said time and time again 
``don't worry, seniors, we are your protectors, nothing is going to 
happen''. It combined the two, changed the name and it is taxing it 
all back.
<P>
	That means that all pension income, including RRSPs, will be 
taxed back at 50 per cent on the first $12,500 after the new seniors 
benefit.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a 
point of order with regard to the terms of reference for Bill C-92 
and Bill C-93.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9528"> 9528 </A></B>
<P>
	Notice has been given to refer these bills to committee before 
second reading. The minister has already moved to refer Bill C-92 
to committee before second reading pursuant to Standing Order 
73(1). Bill C-93 is the next item on the government's list today 
and we have already received notice that this bill will also be 
subject to Standing Order 73(1).
<P>
	I bring this to your attention today because this is a new standing 
order and it is under test. We as parliamentarians have a 
responsibility to ensure that the intent of a new standing order is 
not distorted and we must ensure that any rights and traditions are 
not intentionally thwarted by any distortion of the use of a new 
standing order.
<P>
	On Monday, April 7, 1997 the House passed a ways an means 
motion which adopted the budgetary policy of the government. On 
Tuesday, April 8, 1997 the House adopted two ways and means 
motions upon which Bill C-92 and Bill C-93 are based. The 
procedure to send a bill to committee before seconding reading 
allows a committee to bring forward amendments that can alter the 
principle of the bill and go beyond the scope of the bill. That is its 
purpose. There should be no other reason for the government to 
send a bill to committee before second reading.
<P>
	I would argue that if the House adopts the budgetary policy of 
the government and then adopts a ways and means motion which 
leads to a bill, that bill cannot and should not be subject to a process 
that could alter the bill in such a way that it would be different from 
the ways and means motion. I will argue that the only process for a 
bill that is based on a ways and means motion is the traditional 
process where the bill is adopted in principle before being subject 
to committee study.
<P>
	I Refer to Beauchesne's sixth edition, citation 983:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(1) A bill, related to a Ways and Means resolution, must be based on-the 
resolution.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(2) The most desirable practice is for the bill to adhere strictly to the provisions of 
the resolution, and departures, if any, ought to be subject to the strictest 
interpretation.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1150 )</B>
<P>
	Citation 984 deals specifically with the committee 
consideration:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If any of the provisions of the bill should be found to go beyond the Ways and 
Means resolutions as agreed to by the House:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a) a further motion must be passed by the House before those provisions in the bill 
are considered by committee; or,</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(b) the bill must be amended so as to conform to the motions to which the House has 
agreed.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Citations 988:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Amendments must not exceed the scope, increase the amount or extend the 
incidence of any charge upon the public, defined by the terms of the Ways and 
Means resolutions, by which the provisions proposed to be amended are authorized.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Citation 989:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The motion by which a tax is proposed in the House is now treated as an effective 
expression of the financial initiative of the Crown, and therefore, as the standard in 
relation to which the admissibility of amendments is determined. Accordingly, an 
amendment is debarred, not only from increasing the rate of a tax but also from 
extending its incidence to new classes.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	We cannot have a process that recognizes the clear precedence 
that the bill must stay within the narrow confines of the ways and 
means motion, yet subject the bill to a process whereby the 
government is inviting amendments that may vary the principle of 
the bill and by inference go beyond the scope of the ways and 
means motion.
<P>
	If this is the case, then how can these bills be referred to 
committee before second reading? It does not make procedural 
sense to do so. It should not be allowed under our rules to do this 
because it is a departure from our tradition of dealing with bills 
based on ways and means motions and in particular a bill to 
implement certain provisions of the budget which is based on two 
ways and means motions adopted by the House.
<P>
	If we consider that the general principles of these measures have 
been adopted by the budgetary process and the details of the 
principles of these measures have been adopted by a ways and 
means motion, then how can we proceed to consider these bills in 
committee before second reading when the principle of the bill has 
already been fixed and determined?
<P>
	It is clear that these restrictions on the way bills are based on 
ways and means motions are dealt with disqualifies them from 
being considered by a committee before second reading.
<P>
	The committee cannot deviate from the ways and means motions 
that were passed by the House, so the proper procedure is to 
consider these bills in a traditional manner.
<P>
	It is clear to me that what the government is trying to achieve is 
to abuse the rules of the House in order to fast track its budget 
implementation bills.
<P>
	Not today, Mr. Speaker. I ask you to rule that these bills and any 
future bills based on ways and means motions cannot be referred to 
committee before second reading and that the motion we are 
currently debating is out of order.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I thank the hon. member for St. Albert for 
his representation which he has obviously thought out carefully and 
has presented very precisely.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
member for St. Albert is arguing that Standing Order 73 should not 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9529"> 9529 </A></B>
<P>
be applied to this bill. I  think it might be helpful to recall why 
Standing Order 73 was adopted unanimously by the House.
<P>
	It was in response to a concern among the public and 
parliamentarians that members of Parliament needed to have more 
ability to play a real role in the development of legislation and not 
to be constrained unduly by the government's intentions with 
respect to legislation. For that reason, the government did 
introduce into the House an amendment to the standing order 
allowing any bill to be referred to a committee before second 
reading so that the committee of ordinary members of Parliament 
would not be constrained by the intentions of the government in 
examining the issue of the bill and making the appropriate 
recommendations back to the House.
<P>
<B>(1155 )</B>
<P>
	As the member for St. Albert said, by referring a bill to 
committee before second reading, the standing order allows a 
parliamentary committee to look at the principle of the bill and to 
not be constrained in proposing amendments which are consistent 
with the principle. It allows those members of Parliament to 
examine the entire issue that the bill addresses and to go beyond the 
scope of the bill.
<P>
	My colleague quoted Beauchesne. I would like to point out that 
the citations he referred to predate the adoption of Standing Order 
73 and therefore are superseded by Standing Order 73.
<P>
	Both the government in introducing the change to the standing 
orders and the House in adopting it unanimously did not in any way 
limit which bills could or could not be referred to a committee 
before second reading. That was left to the discretion of the 
government in proposing that a bill be referred before second 
reading and, more important, to the members of the House to vote 
on the proposal to send a bill to committee before second reading.
<P>
	I do not think that citations and interpretations which were made 
before the House expressed its will to give members of Parliament 
more latitude and scope to influence legislation without restriction 
should supersede the views expressed by Parliament.
<P>
	This whole issue of members of Parliament having more 
influence, particularly on matters of expenditure and taxation, was 
studied for over a year by the subcommittee of the Standing 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs, of which I and the 
member for St. Albert are members. Throughout the study our 
discussions on Standing Order 73 concerned how to give members 
of Parliament more influence, in line with the wishes which we 
heard from Canadians. Hopefully the report of that subcommittee 
will be tabled before Parliament in the near future.
<P>
	Frankly I am astonished that the member for St. Albert is 
proposing that members of Parliament and the standing committees 
should not have the expanded scope that Standing Order 73 
intended to give them.
<P>
	Finally, the committee is constrained by the will of the House, as 
expressed in the ways and means motion. The member should be 
aware of that. The committee has to act within the authority it has 
been given by Parliament.
<P>
	What the member seems to be suggesting is that a committee, in 
exercising this new responsibility under Standing Order 73, should 
not be constrained by the directions of the House. I find his 
argument somewhat confusing. He says that because it is a decision 
of the House, the House does not have the authority to act in 
accordance with Standing Order 73, but if it does then the 
committee should not be constrained by other decisions of the 
House. There is a contradiction there.
<P>
	However, the fundamental principle is that Standing Order 73 
was adopted by the House to allow committees to have the scope to 
examine the principles of a bill, the scope of a bill, and to bring 
back its best recommendations to Parliament. Parliament will 
ultimately decide.
<P>
	The committee of course will exercise its new responsibilities in 
accordance with the directions it has received from the House, 
including the ways and means motion.
<P>
<B>(1200 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on the 
same point of order. When the hon. member who just spoke quoted 
Standing Order 73, she was thoroughly accurate.
<P>
	The purpose of sending bills to committee prior to second 
reading is to give the committee an opportunity to look into a bill 
thoroughly and to improve it before it comes back to the House for 
second reading. In that way, a lot of valuable time of the House is 
not tied up. There is no question that that is the intent, the scope 
and the purpose of that standing order.
<P>
	However, when you look at this bill and the other one we will be 
debating later today, what has to be pointed out is that the general 
principle of the measures contained in the budget have been 
adopted by the budgetary process.
<P>
	The details of the principles of these measures were adopted 
when the ways and means motion was passed. Why is the bill being 
sent to committee prior to second reading when, in principle, in 
scope, in containment, in its content it is a fait accompli?
<P>
	Puis parce que nous avons-I do not have very good French-to 
send it. Not to make light of this, how can we proceed to consider 
these bills in committee before second reading when the principle 
of the bill has already been fixed and determined? What is the 
Standing  Committee on Finance going to do? What is it going to 
amend? What principle is it going to change? What scope is it 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9530"> 9530 </A></B>
<P>
going to go back to? Will it spend less somewhere? Will it 
recommend cuts elsewhere? Will it change the amount of money, 
the $800 million, that is given to the foundation of innovation for 
science?
<P>
	This is a misuse of the standing order, plain and simple. The 
argument that we are trying to put forward is that neither this bill 
nor the other bill we will be debating today, Bill C-93, should be 
sent to committee prior to second reading.
<P>
	The very same point that the member from the Liberal Party, the 
former whip like myself, made about the purpose of Standing 
Order 73 is accurate and true. I support her when she makes that 
claim.
<P>
	When the rules of Standing Order 73 are applied, any good 
lawyer-I see one sitting beside her now-will say that this is just 
smoke and mirrors and that the purpose of the government is to get 
it out of the House so that debate is limited. When it comes back 
the rule states that debate is limited. We do not have the number of 
hours to debate the bill after it comes back from committee if we 
send it to committee prior to second reading.
<P>
	They are using a double whammy on the opposition members. It 
is another example of limiting the democratic rights and principles 
of the opposition parties. Our job here is to go through legislation, 
to go through ways and means motions, to decide whether it is in 
the best interests of the Canadian public to either support them or, 
if not to give them our full endorsement, then to make 
recommendations through amendments either here in the House, in 
committee or at report stage, then come back and work on them.
<P>
	There was an agreement at the start of the 35th Parliament. A lot 
of bills come here at second reading, prior to going to committee 
and we make a lot of amendments. It ends up being a big waste of 
time. For certain legislation, for complicated bills, there are 
advantages in sending them to committee where the job of the 
committee is then to thoroughly go through the bill. Sometimes the 
committee has done it but sometimes it has not.
<P>
	Agricultural bills have been sent to committee prior to second 
reading and the members in the committee just ram through clause 
by clause. They limit debate. We know all about the complaints we 
have had. They have misused their majority in committee. That is 
one thing.
<P>
	However on this one, there will not be any debate on scope. 
There will not be any debate on principle. It has already been 
adopted. It is the law of the land. It is a done deal.
<P>
	I submit very humbly that this point of order be considered, Mr. 
Speaker, and that you rule that this bill not be sent to committee 
prior to second reading for the very reasons that I have outlined. To 
summarize, it is  unnecessary. It is just a way that the government 
has figured out to once again stifle and limit freedom of speech and 
the time that is supposed to be allocated in the giving of opinions 
on bills.
<P>
<B>(1205)</B>
<P>
	This legislation will pass. We all know that. We all know how 
important the budget is to the nation. We all know it is necessary 
for the budget implementation act to pass, so money can be 
borrowed and that kind of thing. But what we object to is limiting 
the time that we can discuss the bills.
<P>
	I believe this bill should not be sent to committee prior to second 
reading because the principle and the scope are clearly established. 
Nothing will be changed. It should just remain in the House for 
second reading.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to rebut some of the 
points brought forward by the government whip. She stated that 
Parliament should not be constrained unduly. However, because the 
House voted on the ways and means motion, in essence we put a 
circle around that bill, a very definite circle.
<P>
	I would like to refer you, Mr. Speaker, to Commons <I>Debates</I>, 
page 962, dated February 7, 1994. It is about three paragraphs. It 
states regarding the adoption of the standing order change:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>There is, however, an important additional benefit to be gained. The broad role of 
standing committees with regard to a bill dealt with in either of these two new 
processes could substantially reduce the quasi-proprietary attitude of ministers and 
their officials toward their legislation. By the time such a bill is ready for second or 
third reading, it could be as much a committee's bill as it is that of the sponsoring 
minister. It has been suggested that a vote on second or third reading of such a bill 
could as a consequence of this be more difficult to describe as standing by itself, a 
confidence issue. Members on all sides of the House could find themselves freed 
more often of constitutional implications in voting and would be able to depart from 
the party position without concern about defeating the government.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In other words, the suggestion has been made to me that these two new legislative 
routes could be one way of increasing the number of so-called free votes.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The new procedures can also help avoid situations that all governments face from 
time to time. They result from bills being developed within departments without 
sufficiently broad and open public consultation. As a consequence, things could be 
overlooked and governments as a result are embarrassed, to say the least, when the 
bill must be dramatically changed or even withdrawn in the face of a strong 
expression of negative public opinion after the bill has been introduced.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This all points to the fact that a bill going to committee before 
second reading allows a process whereby major fundamental 
changes can be made, the principle of the bill can be changed and 
before the House has expressed its opinion in a vote.
<P>
	In this case we have had two votes, one on the budget and one on 
the ways and means motion. Those in essence  are first reading of 
this bill. The House voted and said that is it. We cannot allow this 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9531"> 9531 </A></B>
<P>
to go to committee before second reading. This motion is out of 
order.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Catterall:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not want to belabour the point. 
However, since there has been a response to my comments I would 
like to reinforce some of them and perhaps just point out to the 
member from Calgary Centre that unlike him I am not a former 
anything.
<P>
	Standing Order 73 is very clear. It is unlimited. It says ``any 
government bill''. I trust that Parliament knew what it was doing 
when it adopted Standing Order 73. It does not suggest any 
limitations to the principle, the scope of the bill. It makes no such 
references. Those are ways in which we have interpreted it in some 
of our debate on how Standing Order 73 might apply. But the 
standing order itself simply says ``any government bill may be 
referred before second reading''.
<P>
<B>(1210 )</B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I think I have heard enough. I thank all 
three members who spoke on this matter. Rather than reserve on it, 
I think it is important to give reasons now rather than later in the 
day.
<P>
	I note that Standing Order 73(1) states very clearly: ``-a 
Minister of the Crown may, after notifying representatives of the 
opposition parties-'' for any government bill, as was indicated. 
This is pretty all inclusive. The hon. member for St. Albert has a 
point in that this appears to be the first time that Standing Order 73 
has been used for a ways and means bill.
<P>
	Standing Order 73, however, does not alter directly the practice 
of the limits imposed by the ways and means motion. The ways and 
means motion was adopted by the House and the committee, as 
members will appreciate, is bound by it. Anything in the bill not 
directly related to the ways and means motion, however, would be 
open to the larger scope of amendments envisioned by Standing 
Order 73.
<P>
	I might add that it is not unusual for ways and means bills to 
contain matters which are outside the ways and means motion. This 
apparently has happened dozens of times. Those matters can be 
amended without reference to the terms of the ways and means 
motion. In that case, Standing Order 73 seems to be an applicable 
use and not necessarily an abuse, as was argued by the hon. 
member for St. Albert.
<P>
	Accordingly, the Chair finds, despite a most eloquent and 
carefully thought out argument by the hon. member for St. Albert, 
that Standing Order 73 would appear to govern in this situation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, after that 
half-hour procedural debate on the scope of Standing Order 73, I 
am going to enter the discussion on Bill C-92 to amend the Income 
Tax Act. The purpose of  this bill is to implement certain measures 
announced in the 1996 budget. I wonder why the government 
tabled this bill only yesterday, more than one year later.
<P>
	To begin with, the purpose of the 1996 budget, like its 
predecessors, was to battle the deficit. But the losers in the battle 
were the provinces, the workers, the unemployed and the most 
marginalized members of our society. This budget pretends to 
reduce the deficit by taking the $5 billion surplus from the 
unemployment insurance fund. We can see the consequences 
today: the bulk of the budget problems of the Government of 
Quebec today are, in fact, due to the 1996 budget, as well as the 
1995 and 1997 budgets.
<P>
	Many of the difficult choices the Government of Quebec has to 
make are the consequences of the cuts in social transfers to the 
provinces that have been decreed by Ottawa. I must state that it is 
immoral for the government to use the unemployment insurance 
fund surplus to solve its deficit problem. These funds do not belong 
to the state, to the government, in any way; they belong exclusively 
to the workers and to the employers.
<P>
	When Bill C-12 reformed the unemployment insurance system 
in Canada, it drastically reduced benefits, their duration, and the 
number of unemployed people eligible for benefits. Workers and 
especially the unemployed will not forget Bill C-12 when they vote 
in the next election.
<P>
<B>(1215)</B>
<P>
	Neither Bill C-92 nor the budgets brought down in 1996 and 
1997 contain any provisions for the kind of tax reform in this 
country that the Bloc Quebecois has been demanding repeatedly. 
The 1996 budget only went so far as to create a technical 
committee on business taxation, a committee whose appointees had 
a conflict of interest and whose members advise large corporations 
on how to save on their income tax. Moreover the committee's 
mandate, which was for a set term, has already been extended until 
the end of 1997.
<P>
	In the next election, taxation will be a central issue. The Bloc 
Quebecois will talk about Canada's unfair tax system. The tax 
burden must be shared equitably between private citizens and 
corporations. There should also be a greater measure of fairness in 
the tax system's approach to large corporations and small 
businesses, because small businesses are the sector that creates 
jobs.
<P>
	Our current tax system does not promote job creation, although 
unemployment is our number one problem today in Canada, 
Quebec, the maritimes and everywhere else. Again, we have to 
mention all those promises that were not kept by a government that 
was elected under the slogan: jobs, jobs, jobs. Today, 
unemployment has reached 12 per cent in Quebec and 10 per cent 
in Canada. The main victims are women, young people and 
workers around 45 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9532"> 9532 </A></B>
<P>
or 50 years old who can no longer  find work when they are laid off. 
Immigrants are also hit by unemployment.
<P>
	Last week in Montreal, I met several leaders of the Spanish 
speaking community who told me that 40 per cent of the members 
of this community are now unemployed in Montreal, more than 
half of the black population in Quebec, especially Montreal, is 
unemployed. These people want to work. They are even prepared to 
take on difficult jobs, to work the night shift, to work for the 
minimum wage, even without employment insurance. They want to 
work, but the government is doing nothing to create jobs.
<P>
	In my riding in Montréal-Nord, almost one third of the labour 
force is unemployed. People come to see me at my office and ask 
me to help them find a job. This is very sad, because there is almost 
nothing I can do to help them. Zellers, which is doing very well, 
announced it was closing its warehouse in Montréal-Nord, so 378 
employees will lose their jobs as of July 1.
<P>
	Last week, we attended a meeting called to create a committee to 
salvage these facilities. The meeting was attended by federal 
members, of course, and provincial members, representatives of 
the municipality of Montréal-Nord and the unions. I want to take 
this opportunity to ask Zellers not to close its warehouse in 
Montréal-Nord, an area that has a very well trained and highly 
skilled workforce with considerable experience in this field.
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	I also take this opportunity to appeal to business to develop 
social responsibility. Banks, for example, which made more than 
$6 billion in profits last year, more than any other business sector in 
Canada, also lay off the largest number of employees. That is 
unacceptable.
<P>
	Again, I think the government should introduce a bill imposing a 
minimum tax on corporations, and banks in particular.
<P>
	The situation in Montreal, and Montreal North in particular, is 
extremely difficult. More and more women, children and 
immigrants are living in poverty. A very large share of the 
responsibility for this most acute problem lies with the federal 
government. There are 1.5 million poor children in Canada. More 
than 5 million Canadians and Quebecers are living under the 
poverty line. In Montreal North alone, about 9,000 households, or 
20 per cent of the total population, rely exclusively on social 
assistance.
<P>
	Efforts have been made these past five years to establish a 
CDEC. I made this a priority when I ran for office. The CDEC has 
been in operation since February and is doing a great job. However, 
the federal government will not contribute $170,000 to the 
Montreal North CDEC, but at the same time, older workers are no 
longer covered by the POWA, the Program for Older Worker 
Adjustment, since it was abolished on April 1.
<P>
	For all these reasons, I can only find fault with this government, 
and all this will come out during the next election campaign.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to speak today to Bill C-92, the 
budget implementation act.
<P>
	I note that this is an act to implement parts of the 1996 budget. It 
seems more than a little odd that at this late date we are debating a 
bill which applies to different facets which were brought in under 
the 1996 budget, albeit in limited fashion because of the 
government's choice to use a procedure which was just argued 
against.
<P>
	What does this mean? Obviously it points to the ineptness of the 
present Liberal government since it has taken it approximately 15 
months to bring forward this legislation. As my hon. colleagues 
from St. Albert and Calgary Centre pointed out during their very 
eloquent presentations, it is a tragic misuse of Standing Order 73. It 
is a way in which the government is able to circumvent the 
democratic process and utilize a standing order which was agreed 
to by all members in the House very early in this Parliament. 
Perhaps we were naive enough to trust the Liberals. We do not do 
that very often, obviously for good reasons. We trusted the 
government not to abuse Standing Order 73 in this fashion. We 
took the Liberals at their word that the intent of Standing Order 73 
was to allow more input from rank and file members of Parliament.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Campbell:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order. I am sorry to 
interrupt the hon. member. I know it is disconcerting to have that 
happen. I believe the Speaker has ruled on this issue and the hon. 
member in the context of his comments in debate on the motion has 
returned to a matter on which the Speaker has just ruled, against the 
position the member is advancing.
<P>
<B>(1225)</B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> I know the hon. member 
was making comments about the tenor of the debate. I did not think 
he was reflecting on the ruling of the Chair. I think the hon. 
member knows it would be improper for him to do so. Bearing that 
in mind, I am sure he will continue with his comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Mr. Speaker, since I 
did not opt to rise, as a number of members of Parliament did, to 
take the time of the House during that point of order, I thought it 
was within the purview of my presentation to at least point out that 
you are quite right, Mr. Speaker, I was not challenging the decision 
made by the Chair, nor would it be appropriate for me to do so. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9533"> 9533 </A></B>
<P>
What I was clearly pointing out is the misuse by the  government of 
this standing order, not the decision arrived at by the Chair.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> The hon. member will 
want to be careful because the Chair has ruled that the procedure 
being adopted is correct in accordance with the rules. I invite him 
to be temperate in his remarks in discussing this issue. There has 
been a ruling from the Chair and I know he respects that. I invite 
him to perhaps address another subject. It might be safer.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was 
merely pointing out that I believed this standing order is broad 
enough and loose enough that potentially some abuse can exist. 
That was the point I was trying to make.
<P>
	Earlier in debate the hon. member for Scarborough-Rouge 
River attacked Reformers, saying that we were misrepresenting the 
facts on how this government is moving toward a balanced budget. 
I believe the Canadian public is coming to realize that how the 
Liberal government is moving toward a balanced budget is on the 
backs of taxpayers.
<P>
	Tax revenue has increased in the neighbourhood of $24 billion a 
year. There is a proliferation of user fees for various things that 
used to be provided for Canadian citizens. There is the 
downloading of approximately $7.5 billion to the provinces in 
reduced transfers through the Canadian health and social transfer. 
The government has been enjoying the lowest interest rates on the 
national debt in four decades.
<P>
	If taxpayers and voters really analyze who is responsible for 
gradually bringing the budget into line they will recognize that they 
are. They are the ones who are paying and making the advances 
that have come.
<P>
	It really galls me to no end when I hear government members 
saying it is because of the growth in the economy. Who has ever 
said that if we as a nation enjoy some growth in the economy big 
government should benefit by just taking more out of the economy 
to spend as it sees fit? It is the principle of the matter and I have 
great difficulty believing that principle is supported by the majority 
of Canadians.
<P>
	This bill deals with a range of subjects, tax credits for 
individuals, child care expense deduction, deferred income plans, 
foreign reporting rules whereby people with assets overseas will 
have to report not only the income derived from those assets but the 
assets themselves to the government. It deals with a wide range of 
issues.
<P>
	Earlier the member for Scarborough-Rouge River said Reform 
is not accurately representing the facts on the budget and the whole 
issue of bracket creep. People have asked me ``who is this bracket 
creep and what crime has he committed?'' They are really 
interested. They hear about this bracket creep and they wonder 
where they should direct their attention.
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
	To try to explain it as simply as possible, bracket creep is what 
happens to a taxpayer in a certain income tax bracket who, because 
the government has failed to index income tax to inflation, finds 
himself moved up into another bracket.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fewchuk:</B> That is the guy from Calgary.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> The hon. member 
opposite is suggesting that it is only millionaires who experience 
this. It is quite the contrary. This is falling on the already horribly 
overtaxed middle class of Canada.
<P>
	It is interesting to note what was said by some government 
members about bracket creep when they were in opposition. I 
remind those members of what they said by quoting from <I>Hansard</I>.
<P>
	Who do we suppose said the following? This individual was 
referring to the Tory finance minister, Michael Wilson:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>He said lower taxes. He told us there were no tax increases in this budget. That 
statement is false because taxes are going up in this country because of the 
deindexation of deductions which this government has done in its past budgets. The 
government knows it is going to get more money this year as a result of the removal 
of the indexation provisions on all deductions in the Income Tax Act and the 
removal of indexation on the rates of tax on various levels of income. Those have all 
been taken out so taxes will go up this year.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is a quote from <I>Hansard</I> of April 28, 1993. I am sure the 
House will recall that individual, the Liberal member of Parliament 
for Kingston and the Islands. It was you, Mr. Speaker. Back in 1993 
you recognized that bracket creep was a sneaky way in which 
governments, at the time the Tory government, could increase 
taxation on the already-
<P>
	<B>Ms. Catterall:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I am 
extremely concerned about the direction the debate has taken. 
There were approximately 84 Liberal members of Parliament in the 
last Parliament, any one of whom could be quoted.
<P>
	I trust the member is not trying to drag the Speaker off his 
neutral throne at the head of this Chamber and into this debate, but 
I am afraid that is the effect his comments are having. I would ask 
you to rule on whether he may in fact quote the Speaker who is now 
occupying the chair as part of his debate.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> I appreciate the kind 
words of the deputy government whip but I am always pleased to 
be quoted.

appreciate it if he could conclude quickly as his time has expired.

as a form of increase in taxes. I was merely applauding your 
insight.

same old story, when it comes to taxing, taxing, taxing.

appreciate the new term bracket creep, which I do not recall using 
and do not recall hearing before. It was a delight to hear it.

	Resuming debate. The hon. member for Saint-Jean.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bachand:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to speak-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> I am sorry. It is the other 
party's turn to have the floor.
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank 
you for being absolutely neutral, as you have just shown us.
<P>
	I am pleased to address Bill C-92 which, as we know, is a ways 
and means procedure to implement certain measures announced in 
the 1996 budget. That 1996 budget was yet another opportunity 
missed by the government to put its fiscal house in order and to 
make things somewhat more equitable.
<P>
	That budget was yet another missed opportunity by the 
government to review the corporate tax system. In order to put 
things off for a while and to make sure that corporate taxation 
would not be reviewed too soon, the 1996 budget provided for the 
creation of a technical committee. However, we recently learned 
that the mandate of this technical committee is now being extended 
until the end of 1997. Once again, the government is playing it safe, 
given the upcoming election campaign.
<P>
	As the official opposition, we have a duty to point out these 
things, and we will definitely do so during the election campaign.
<P>
	What did the government do to postpone this tax review and to 
make sure things remain unfair, as they currently are? It set up a 
technical committee. That committee is made up of people from 
the top consulting firms, people who are in the know and who try to 
make sure large corporations do not pay their fair share of taxes.
<P>
	I consider that a bit like putting the fox-or Colonel Sanders-in 
charge of the henhouse. The chickens, that is the people footing the 
bill, are told ``No problem, chickens, we have everything under 
control. The good old Colonel will look after everything''.
<P>
	But we have a major problem with that. The people advising the 
minister, advising the government, are just about in a conflict of 
interest situation. They will not be able to come up with solutions 
which might put their own clients in an awkward position.
<P>
	We understand that this is a stalling tactic, to ensure that the tax 
contribution by the major corporations is not looked at too soon. In 
this connection, my hon. colleague for Bourassa referred to the 
situation with the banks, which I feel has become scandalous. At 
the present time, bank profits are in the billions. Yet they are 
rushing to lay off as many bank employees as they can. There are 
virtually no measures proposed to reform the taxation system, to 
get these banks to pay a bit more of their fair share.
<P>
	And what is the situation in the meantime? The ones who are 
getting richer in Canada are the bankers; the ones who are getting 
poorer are the middle class. Everyone is contributing to support the 
state except the major corporations, which are making a small 
contribution, but far from enough.
<P>
	Another thing that is in the 1996 budget which Ways and Means 
will focus on is the venture capital corporations. This is another 
example of Quebec's distinctiveness. Unions such as the CSN with 
its action fund and the FTQ with its solidarity fund make it possible 
for people to invest a little more venture capital. This was a first of 
its kind when it started up.
<P>
	The central labour bodies said: ``We are going to get together 
with people, with workers who want to put money in a pension plan 
for their retirement and arrange it so that we can provide venture 
capital and maintain jobs''. Often, when companies are short of 
cash, the solidarity fund or the CSN action fund will provide 
assistance, helping not only to create jobs but often to maintain 
them.
<P>
	So what did the government do? In 1996, the government 
decided to reduce the tax credit it had introduced which had been 
an incentive for workers to put money into the solidarity fund 
because they would get a more substantial tax refund. Probably 
when the government saw this incentive was too successful-not as 
successful as the banks, but they did not touch the banks, they hit 
the labour-sponsored venture capital corporations-the 
government decided to reduce the tax refund, which meant 
reducing the tax credit. Furthermore, there would be a ceiling on 
the amounts people are allowed to pay into these funds.
<P>
	I think that was a pretty low blow, because we had workers and 
employers who were encouraging the public to do something 
socially responsible with their money, to use the money as a lever 
to create and maintain jobs.
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	Of course the government made cuts all over the place, and I 
think this is deplorable. As usual, when  decisions like that are 
made, it seems that Quebec is hardest hit because 50 per cent of the 
money in these venture capital corporations in Canada comes from 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9535"> 9535 </A></B>
<P>
Quebec. In other words, the government missed an opportunity to 
let this type of fund expand. It would been far better, as I see it, to 
set up a committee that would really do something about making 
the system more equitable as well as doing something about those 
who have all the capital, in other words, the banks.
<P>
	Another ways and means motion about to be implemented is the 
unemployment insurance fund heist. You will recall that in 1996, 
the fund had a surplus of $5 billion. Employers and employees 
make a contribution. Studies show that each time the contribution 
is reduced by 10 cents, up to 30,000 jobs can be created. It was 
maintained and artificially raised over the years.
<P>
	Naturally the minister decided this year to lower it by 10 cents. 
Will he create 30,000 jobs? I think so. But he had plenty of room to 
lower it much more than that and yet he did not. Why? Because he 
is taking the surplus from the unemployment insurance fund and 
paying off the deficit with that. Who is bearing the cost? Workers 
and employers, as I said.
<P>
	Finally, it almost amounts to an indirect tax, and the government 
is benefiting from it. Why is it benefiting? Not just because the 
employers and employees are paying, but also because it is 
tightening eligibility requirements and ensuring it is making people 
poorer and hustling them along to the welfare rolls. That is what is 
happening.
<P>
	If we look at the statistics since the Liberals formed the 
government, the number of unemployed in Canada declined from 
1.6 million to 1.5 million. The 100,000 no longer receiving 
unemployment insurance have probably thrown themselves into 
the clutches of welfare, which is under Quebec's jurisdiction.
<P>
	And so, on the subject of the unemployment insurance fund, it is 
totally deplorable that the government is not settling the matter by 
ensuring further improvements to the system and using the money 
to try to create jobs. It is not necessarily a question of giving the 
money to the unemployed, but some effort must be made to create 
jobs. But the government is not trying to create jobs; instead, it is 
using the surplus to pay off its deficit.
<P>
	In terms of the unfair tax system, the same thing is true. I talked 
about it to some extent earlier, but we can also talk about family 
trusts. There are also large corporations that do not pay tax. When 
asked when it intended to be pay its overdue taxes, which it used to 
defer, Consolidated Bathurst replied: ``Never''.
<P>
	I suggest that the taxpayers who are working on their income tax 
returns write on those returns that they never intend to pay the 
money they owe the government. I suspect Revenue Canada will 
get back to them in a jiffy and say: ``Look, you must pay your taxes 
and they are  overdue. There is a penalty for not paying and you 
will be charged interest on top of that''. But justice does not mean 
the same thing, depending on whether you are a large corporation 
or a middle or low income taxpayer.
<P>
	Family trusts are another case in point. The government never 
managed to settle this issue. There is some mention, in a ways and 
means motion, of a possible deferral over time that would shorten 
the length of time, but what does this mean for family trust owners? 
It means transfers. Family trusts are still there to transfer. They are 
transferred free of tax, benefiting once again rich financiers. The 
poor and the middle class cannot afford to establish family trusts 
for their young children.
<P>
	This is unfair all the way. There is also the $7 billion in federal 
expenditures that has been shovelled in the provinces' back yard 
with the last two budgets. What this government should do is listen 
to what the Bloc Quebecois is proposing to settle the personal 
versus corporate income tax issue. This is $7 billion that can be 
recovered.
<P>
	Unfortunately, the government is not listening to what we are 
saying, but we will make a point of bringing this up during the 
election campaign. This will all be settled in the next federal 
election. In Quebec, the voters will send a clear message to the 
Liberal government, which has strayed off course, and this will all 
be settled in the polling booth on June 2 or 9, probably.
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
was very pleased to hear the Reform Party member who spoke last 
acknowledge that Canadians are responsible for the very positive 
gains that have been made in terms of putting the economy of the 
country on a sound footing.
<P>
	That is something that members of our caucus, our cabinet 
ministers, recognize very strongly. The Prime Minister has spoken 
about it. The finance minister has spoken about it.
<P>
	They are the considerable sacrifices that Canadians have been 
asked to make and the understanding we have had to seek from 
them for some of the program cuts made over the last few years to 
bring our deficit, finally, from over $42 billion down to under $20 
billion, heading to under $10 billion for next year.
<P>
	The member spoke about growth in the economy and somehow 
seemed to think it a sin that with growth in the economy the 
government would be collecting more taxes. It is quite obvious that 
if there are a larger number of Canadians who are working, and 
there are close to a million more Canadians working now than were 
working three and a half years ago, more people earning, clearly 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9536"> 9536 </A></B>
<P>
there will be more people contributing to the cost of  running the 
country and delivering the programs that Canadians value.
<P>
	The member should also ask himself why we have enjoyed the 
growth in the economy that he has acknowledged. He talked as 
though lower interest rates are something the government should 
apologize for. We do not.
<P>
	Those lower interest rates have contributed tremendously to the 
growth in the economy that the nation is enjoying. It is because of 
the good fiscal management that this country has had for the last 
three years since the October 1993 election.
<P>
	I want to acknowledge that the Reform Party did, in the last 
speech, speak about the growth in the economy. We appreciate 
those comments about low interest rates.
<P>
	One of the items in the bill before the House today is the taxation 
treatment of child support. This bill changes the taxation of child 
support. The change is part of a larger package of reforms to deal 
with child support. The reforms include measures to try to address 
the problems of inconsistent child support payments, inadequate 
child support payments, support payments that often are not paid at 
all, intermittently or inadequately.
<P>
	The three reforms include the introduction of the federal child 
support guidelines to establish fair and consistent support awards 
in divorce cases. In addition, there is the enhancement of federal 
and provincial enforcement measures so that those awards decided 
by the courts would be paid. Finally, the item this bill deals with 
primarily, there is a change in the way that child support awards are 
taxed.
<P>
	Let me take a few minutes to explain how we have changed the 
rules and why. Traditionally support awards have been tax 
deductible to the paying parent and taxable as income for the parent 
receiving the payment, i.e., the custodial parent who also has the 
responsibility for the day to day care of the children.
<P>
	The 1996 budget announced that this system would be replaced 
with a system of no deduction, no inclusion. Perhaps some 
members need to be reminded that this is in line with the court 
decision delivered not that long ago that the practice of allowing 
the parent paying child support payments to deduct the payments 
before paying income tax and having the parent receiving it pay the 
tax on that amount was unconstitutional and contrary to the charter 
of rights and freedoms.
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	To suggest that the government should not somehow be dealing 
with that and correct a provision in tax law that is contrary to the 
charter and to the Constitution of this country goes a bit beyond the 
ridiculous.
<P>
	That is what we are trying to do. The court simply said that if we 
have two parents, both of whom are supporting their children, if 
one is still married to the  other parent, they pay tax on that money, 
but if one is divorced from the other parent, they pay no tax on that 
money. That is discriminatory between parents who are married 
and parents who are not married. Quite simply that is the issue we 
are trying to address here.
<P>
	In theory the old system could deliver a tax benefit that would 
make more money available to the children. That is because the 
paying parent usually had a higher income than the recipient or 
custodial parent and therefore was taxed at a higher marginal rate. 
If the paying parent saved money, that saving could in theory be 
passed along to the children.
<P>
	In practice that is not what happened. The system failed to 
deliver this benefit and actually made it harder to set fair and 
realistic awards in the courts. The system was fraught with a host of 
frustrations that were reflected in the well known case of Suzanne 
Thibaudeau, which I have just referred to.
<P>
	For one thing, the tax benefit was not targeted to reach children 
who needed it most, and complex tax calculations made it more 
difficult for parents to negotiate a realistic level of support that they 
both saw as fair. Many parents also found that waiting until year's 
end to receive a refund or to make lump sum payments created 
serious cash flow problems for both parents.
<P>
	This package of reforms we have made including the tax 
measures in this bill is the result of a supreme court decision but 
also the result of cross-country consultations held under the 
auspices of my colleague, the member for Mount Royal, in which 
we heard the real life experiences of families that had broken up, 
what was happening to children, what was happening to their 
parents and the real poverty created by the existing system.
<P>
	The Vanier Institute's last report found that two-thirds of women 
whose marriage breaks up walk out of the marriage and into 
poverty. That means their children walk with them. That is part of 
what we are trying to address by these reforms. It is part of the 
reason for this change in tax policy with respect to taxation of child 
support payments. It is a measure that is legally necessary but it is 
also necessary in justice and in fairness and putting the concerns of 
our children and their well-being first.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, normally I 
stand up to say that I am pleased to join in the debate on Bill C-92, 
but you did hear the point of order I raised earlier and the fact that 
Standing Order 73(1) has now become a time allocation standing 
order rather than a standing order that has real meaning. If we 
followed through with the real moral intent of the standing order 
we would never be having this time allocation today.
<P>
	I know the Speaker has ruled, not in our favour and we do not 
feel he ruled in favour of the people of Canada, but certainly on a 
narrow interpretation-

<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> I hesitate to interrupt the 
hon. member, but he knows it would be improper to reflect on a 
ruling of the Chair. I thought he was moving off that subject, quite 
smartly, as I had sort of cautioned him to do. I invite him to move 
off the subject immediately. I think it would be unwise to continue 
this line.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Mr. Speaker, Bill C-92 deals with a budget 
measure of 1996. It is now April 10, 1997, 14 months since that 
budget was tabled. The legislation is just now being introduced.
<P>
	I have a couple of children, one attending university. I saw that I 
was getting an extra deduction for his education. It has gone from 
$60 a month for full time attendance at university to $100 a month 
for full time attendance. I thought it was not bad, but I wondered 
when it went through. It is going through today. Here it is. Now we 
know why the government is in such a rush. It is here in Bill C-92 
after I did my income tax. After millions of Canadians have done 
their income tax we now find that the legislation is coming along 
like the tortoise after the hare. Unlike the tortoise, it does finish 
first and causes the income tax returns to fall into line, if I may say.
<P>
	Going through the summary of the act, it is complex and 
detailed. There are tax credits for individuals, charitable donations, 
child care expense deductions, child support payments, deferred 
income plans, foreign reporting rules, non-resident pensioners, all 
by and large things that are somewhat beneficial to individual 
taxpayers.
<P>
	Then I read on, scientific research and experimental 
development. It introduces a salary cap for SR and ED treatment of 
salaries of specified employees. This is a tax limitation on a tax 
break that corporations can get.
<P>
	No. 9, labour sponsored ventured capital corporations. It reduces 
the tax credit rate from 20 per cent of the cost of the LSVCC share 
to 15 per cent, another restriction on tax breaks for corporations.
<P>
	No. 10, flow through shares. It extends the look back rule to 
allow qualified expenses incurred at any time in taxation year to be 
treated as if they were incurred in the preceding years, again a 
reduction in benefit.
<P>
	No. 11, resources losses requires an add back to income or 25 per 
cent of prescribed resource losses, another one that increases the 
tax liability of corporations.
<P>
	No. 12, Canadian field processing excludes gas plant processing 
from activities eligible for the manufacture and processing tax 
credit, another situation where businesses will pay more tax.
<P>
	No.13, joint exploration corporations, repeals rules allowing for 
the renunciation of resource expenses by joint exploration 
corporation, another situation where corporations will pay more 
tax.
<P>
	No. 14, part 6 capital tax, extends the application of additional 
part 6 tax by one year for banks and other deposit taking 
institutions and by three years for life insurance corporations, 
another extension of a tax on corporations.
<P>
	The minister stood up and said he has not raised taxes. Right 
here is Bill C-92, coming from the budget of February 1996. 
Fourteen months later we now have the legislation in front of us. 
There it is, tax increase, tax increase, everywhere business turns 
there is a tax increase, all the while the government throws a few 
shekels to individuals. The government seems to think that there is 
no limit to how big business can pay more tax.
<P>
	That is despicable. Who creates the jobs in this country? 
Business of course. How can business create jobs if they are being 
taxed into oblivion? That is what the government is doing. It is 
taxing business into oblivion.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	The employment insurance program is turning out to be nothing 
but a blatant tax grab by the government. According to the latest 
numbers I saw in the ``Fiscal Monitor'', the government will run a 
surplus on employment insurance premiums that exceed benefits 
paid out under employment insurance by approximately $7.5 
billion. That is a $7.5 billion surplus in one year.
<P>
	The government has dramatically cut back the eligibility of 
individuals for employment insurance. It has cut back the amount 
of employment insurance it pays to individuals who manage to 
qualify. It has made a pitifully small decrease in the amount of 
premiums paid by individuals and employers. In the course of 
doing all that up comes the surplus. As more money is coming in 
and less money is going out, away the surplus goes. The Minister of 
Finance is taxing business to the point that it cannot create jobs. 
Then he stands in the House and says that unemployment is still 
over 9 per cent and he wishes it were coming down. He does not 
know why it is not coming down. Let me tell him.
<P>
	If he looks at Bill C-92 he will find out why the unemployment 
rate is not coming down. There are extra taxes for business under 
the scientific research and experimental development program, 
extra taxes for business under labour sponsored venture capital 
corporations, extra taxes on flow through shares, extra taxes on 
resource losses, extra taxes on Canadian field processing, extra 
taxes on joint exploration corporations and an extension of the 
capital tax for banks and insurance companies. We cannot have our 
cake and eat it  too. That has basically been the rule with Standing 
Order 73 excepted.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9538"> 9538 </A></B>
<P>
	The Minister of Finance thinks he can tax these businesses into 
the ground and then turn around and say it is their responsibility to 
create all these jobs. It is time the minister had a few economic 
lessons from somebody. It just does not work that way.
<P>
	Let us look at the benefits he has given to individuals. He has 
made changes to the child care expense. People can now claim 
child care expenses for people aged 16. We throw young people 
into young offender institutions long before they are 16. I wonder if 
that would qualify for a child care deduction. It is an interesting 
thought: a 16-year-old going off to day care with a lunch bucket in 
his hand and holding his mommy's hand too. I can see it now.
<P>
	The government is going too far in thinking it can buy votes 
from individuals and in taxing businesses into oblivion. I will leave 
it at that.

election of the Bloc Quebecois; second, the election of the Parti

to let me represent them at the next election, as a Bloc Quebecois 
member. Therefore, I sincerely thank the people of Repentigny, 
Charlemagne, Lachenaie, Mascouche and La Plaine, for their 
support in the past three and a half years, and for their renewed 
support last night in Charlemagne. Over 150 people were in 
attendance and showed they are eager to get on with the next 
election campaign.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Sauvageau:</B> Now we are going to get to the heart of the 
matter, the ways and means motion for last year's budget.
<P>
	I would like to quote from a book that I am sure you all read 
regularly a few years back, and that you were only too keen to 
forget about once we had read it too. I am talking about the red 
book. We are still waiting for the second volume, the one on 
promises kept, which will perhaps be as thick as this piece of paper. 
I would therefore like to quote from the red book. I will read what 
my friends across the way said on page 13:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Today, after nine years of Conservative government, Canadians are facing 
hardship: 1.6 million unemployed, millions more on welfare, a million children 
living below the poverty line, record numbers of bankruptcies and plant closings.</BLOCKQUOTE>
I repeat, this appears on page 13 of the red book.
<P>
	What has become of the fine words of the Liberal Party, of the 
compassion that we read about in the red book, but that never 
actually materialized, because in concrete terms we have seen 
nothing? What have they done after three years? We will give 
figures, but not the Bloc Quebecois's figures, because as our 
friends across the way tell us, the nasty separatists tend to play 
around with figures. We will therefore give figures provided by 
Statistics Canada, Industry Canada and Human Resources 
Development Canada.
<P>
	So, instead of the 1.6 million unemployed Canadians they 
complained about in the red book in 1993, there are now, according 
to Statistics Canada, 1.5 million Canadians without jobs. In 1993, 
they wrote about ``millions more on welfare'', but Statistics 
Canada tells us there are now 3 million Canadians in this situation.
<P>
	Instead of ``a million children living below the poverty line'', as 
they told us in 1993, Statistics Canada reports that there are now 
1.5 million such children, 500,000 more than before.
<P>
	In 1993 they wrote in the red book about ``record numbers of 
[-]plant closings''-they did not give a figure because it was not 
true-while today Statistics Canada tells us there were a record 
86,253 bankruptcies declared between January and November 
1996.
<P>
	Before speaking about the budget, it is very important to 
remember the compassion expressed by the Liberals in 1993, and 
the failure of the Liberals to take action since that time. The figures 
in the finance minister's budget can be interpreted any number of 
ways, as the secretary of state just demonstrated, and as other 
government members have shown, in trying to praise this 
government and cover up mistakes in the budgets and this 
government's failure to act or its blunders when it did.
<P>
	We could also go on about a number of things, a number of 
critical sectors of our economy, our society, our culture, our history 
and our trade. I believe that the most important figures, the ones 
that will really make the public sit up and take notice in the next 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9539"> 9539 </A></B>
<P>
election are  these: the unemployment rate, the poverty rate, and 
the bankruptcy rate.
<P>
	Before having a firm political ideology, before having 
intentions, projects, hopes, we need a bare minimum, that is to say 
enough money to realize our ideology, or enough money to realize 
our hopes and dreams for the future.
<P>
	With a record as pitiful as 3 million people on welfare, 1.5 
million children living below the poverty level, according to 
Statistics Canada, I do not believe the Liberals can pat themselves 
on the back and boast ``We are proud of our performance record. 
We can present you with a budget and describe it as having 
successfully bolstered the social and economic fabric of this 
country''. This is false, and who says so? Not us, but-I 
repeat-Statistics Canada, Industry Canada and Human Resources 
Development Canada.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	The government could, perhaps-and I suggest it do so, as it has 
in other sectors-tell us that the head of Statistics Canada must be 
wrong, that he ought to be sacked, that someone new should be 
hired who could change the figures. We know that is a Liberal 
tactic. They would put a good Liberal in charge, a few figures 
would get changed, and then something more attractive could be 
reported.
<P>
	Unfortunately for the Liberal Party, and fortunately for us and 
the man or woman in charge of Statistics Canada-I do not know 
which it is-this tendency, or way of doing things, from the past is 
no longer in use. The chief statistician and the heads of the other 
departments I mentioned will be able to stay put and keep giving 
the real figures, the results of this government's failure to act.
<P>
	As I said before, the government has nothing to be proud of in 
this respect, and I think it has an obligation to explain these results 
to the public. Meanwhile, what was the Bloc Quebecois doing? 
Was the Bloc Quebecois, as an opposition party, shooting down 
everything that moved? In a way yes, but in another way no.
<P>
	Yes, the Bloc Quebecois objected to various bills that were 
introduced and that, in our opinion, were skewed towards these 
figures. But at the same time, the Bloc Quebecois made certain 
proposals. We offered both negative and constructive criticism. So 
what did we propose? We proposed a plan for corporate tax reform 
and another one for personal tax reform.
<P>
	In the new riding of Repentigny, if the Minister of Finance 
bothered to listen to us and realized that the proposals made by 
three excellent researchers of the Bloc Quebecois, not the slew of 
researchers that can be found at the Department of Finance, if he 
bothered to consider and implement the recommendations we 
made, he would realize that what is needed is not new money or an 
increase in the deficit. By reallocating amounts that are  already in 
the tax system, an average family-for instance, a Repentigny 
family of two adults and two children with an average income of 
$40,000, these are not wealthy people, this is an average, modest 
income-if the Minister of Finance were to implement the 
proposals of the Bloc Quebecois, this average family in Repentigny 
would pay $821 less in income tax. This proposal would affect 
more than 50 per cent of the families in my riding.
<P>
	Unfortunately, this family will have to pay $820 more in income 
tax because of poor decision making by the Minister of Finance. It 
may not be a lot, but for the average family with a modest income 
of $40,000, this is a lot money that could be funnelled back into the 
economy and could create real jobs.
<P>
	However, the Minister of Finance has trouble going along with 
proposals made by an opposition party, a party that objects when 
something does not make sense, but also makes suggestions on 
how things should be changed in the interest of fairness.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Is the 
order of debate from the Bloc to the Liberal Party and then back to 
us under this order? Should a Reform member not be the next 
speaker?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> The last speaker before 
the hon. member for Terrebonne spoke was the hon. member for St. 
Albert.
<P>
	The rotation today has been from the beginning I am advised- 
and I was not here at the beginning of the debate-Liberal, Reform, 
Bloc. That is the way it has been going. It is now a Liberal's turn. 
Accordingly I recognize the hon. member for 
Haldimand-Norfolk.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Speller (Haldimand-Norfolk, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
gives me great pleasure to say a few words on Bill C-92. I know I 
only have a couple of minutes to speak to the budget. It is a budget 
that I think is notable.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	I want to say a little bit about rural Canada and the impact this 
budget has in the rural areas. Rural Canada is an area that has really 
been recognized for the first time in a budget by a government that 
directly looked at solving some of its problems.
<P>
	In the speech from the throne the government made a 
commitment to look at rural Canada and to try to make sure that it 
shares in the economic growth that is happening across the country. 
I would like to thank all our members from the rural caucus in the 
Liberal Party and the Minister of Finance for taking the 
opportunity, after listening to our concerns, to address some of the 
concerns that we have in rural areas so that we too can share in the 
economic growth in the country.
<P>
	I want to highlight a few areas that the minister has touched on. 
One of those areas deals with the Farm Credit Corporation. He 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9540"> 9540 </A></B>
<P>
made sure that the Farm Credit  Corporation had more money in 
which to invest in rural areas.
<P>
	The trade statistics show that agricultural exports have increased 
some 30 per cent over the last three years. We seem to be booming 
in exporting our products. One of the areas in which we need to do 
more is to make sure that the further processing of goods, 
especially in the agricultural area, can get to the export market. In 
order to do that the farmers, who have a lot of really good ideas, 
need some cash to invest in these products and to get them into the 
market.
<P>
	On the one hand the Minister for International Trade has done a 
good job in getting the information out to these small businesses, 
these farmers, and to make sure that they are represented in our 
embassies around the world and that their product is there.
<P>
	On the other hand, the Minister of Finance has made sure that 
cash is there. He has made sure that the Farm Credit Corporation 
has cash available to help invest in these small industries to make 
sure that they can get up, get running and get these further 
processed goods exported around the world. I want to thank him for 
that.
<P>
	I would like to highlight a point that the hon. member for Parry 
Sound-Muskoka was pushing very strongly and I know the 
Minister of Finance thanked him for that, and that is the whole of 
tourism and the importance of tourism to job creation in Canada. 
The rural areas have a lot to show. A lot of tourists come to the 
rural areas but there is not as much co-ordination and there are not 
the groups in place to help co-ordinate a tour group or a tourist who 
comes in to certain parts of Canada.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance in his wisdom and the cabinet agreed to 
put some money into tourism. I know all hon. members will agree 
it does a lot in helping to create jobs, especially in small tourist 
operations in rural and remote Canada.
<P>
	Obviously education and health care were in the budget. These 
areas are important for rural Canada. I want to thank the minister 
for investing in the Internet and making sure that we in the rural 
areas are up to speed so to speak in having access to the Internet.
<P>
	In fact our young people and our students can now in any 
community with a population of over 400 have access to the 
Internet. That is a very important initiative of this government that 
really helps in making sure that people in rural and remote Canada 
can get into the new technologies that I think are going to be 
important in rural areas in terms of job creation.
<P>
<B>(1320 )</B>
<P>
	It is also important to note this. I want to talk personally about 
my riding of Haldimand-Norfolk and the importance of taxation. 
In my nine years here, it seems that every year, the Minister of 
Finance has come up and once again increased the taxes on 
tobacco.
<P>
	I want to thank him from my constituents' point of view for not 
raising the taxes on tobacco in the budget. As members know, to 
tobacco farmers in the community surrounding my area, the size of 
tax on tobacco is important, although not on the sales. It does not 
have a big influence in the production, but in giving them a good 
feeling and understanding of how the system works.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> It is my duty to interrupt 
proceedings now to put the question now before the House.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.

motion will please say yea.

<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> All those opposed will 
please say nay.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Nay.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> In my opinion the yeas 
have it.

	<I>And more than five members having risen:</I>

	<I>Before the taking of the vote:</I>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> The member for Joliette 
on a point of order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Laurin:</B> Mr. Speaker, as the bells started sounding, the 
official opposition asked that the vote on Motion No. 92 be 
deferred, and the Chair did not recognize our request at that point.
<P>
	I would submit, with all due respect, to your attention, Standing 
Order 73(1)(<I>d</I>), which provides in French:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-after not more than 180 minutes of debate, the Speaker shall interrupt the debate 
and the question shall be put and decided without further debate.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In our opinion, putting the question does not mean we cannot 
defer the vote. Standing Order 45(5)(<I>a</I>)(ii) provides:
<P>
(ii) During the sounding of the bells, either the Chief Government Whip or the 
Chief Opposition Whip may ask the Speaker to defer the division.
<P>
	This is what we did. Nothing in this Standing Order either 
indicates that we cannot ask to have the vote deferred to another 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9541"> 9541 </A></B>
<P>
time. The French text is clear, and I  would ask you to recognize the 
request of the official opposition, please.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise on the same point of order. It appears the whip of the Official 
Opposition is correct in his summary.
<P>
	I bring to the attention of the Chair that there are other times, for 
example in Private Members' Business, where a set amount of time 
is allocated for debate, at which time the question is put and is 
often deferred. I think in this case the whip of the Official 
Opposition is correct.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont-Dundas, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would submit respectfully that the standing orders are quite clear:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>After not more than 180 minutes of debate the Speaker shall interrupt the debate 
and the question shall be put and decided without further debate.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1345)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In fact, debate was concluded after 180 minutes, the vote was 
scheduled, the division bells were rung for 15 minutes ago. We are 
now ready to vote.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
refer to the Chair's ruling earlier this morning on 73(1) where it 
was pointed out by the government whip that there was no 
restriction in Standing Order 73(1) and therefore it applies to bills 
that had a ways and means motion preceding it because there was 
nothing in 73(1) that contained that restriction.
<P>
	I draw your attention to Standing Order 45, content contains no 
restriction. Therefore I humbly suggest you see that his point of 
order is in order.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> I thank members of both 
sides of this House for their arguments on this point. I have looked 
at Standing Order 76, cited by the hon. member for Joliette, and 
considered the wording. Furthermore, I looked at the wording of 
Standing Order 45 to make a comparison, and I do not believe the
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is provided in Standing Order 45(3) that:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>When, under the provisions of any Standing Order or other Order of the House, 
the Speaker has interrupted any proceeding for the purpose of putting forthwith the 
question on any business then before the House, the bells to call in the Members shall 
be sounded for not more than fifteen minutes.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I interrupted the proceedings at the conclusion of 180 minutes.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
-in order to put the question immediately on a matter under 
discussion in the House, the division bells must have rung for 
fifteen minutes at most.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Having done so, I refer the hon. member for Joliette and the 
Reform Party whip to Standing Order 45(5)(a)(i):
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Except as provided in sections (3) and (6) of this Standing Order-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In other words, where section (3) applies there is no right to 
defer under Standing Order 45(5). Standing Order 45(5) applies to 
30 minute bells, not 15 minute bells. On any 15 minute bell the 
only hope for deferral lies under Standing Order 45(7).
<P>
	I urge hon. members to have regard to that fact. I did not permit 
the deferral of the division because I believed it was out of order 
and I so ruled.
<P>
	We will now proceed with the question.

	<B>Mr. Bernie Collins (Souris-Moose Mountain, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, 1996 marked the third consecutive outstanding year for 
the Saskatchewan potash industry, the largest producer and 
exporter of potash in the world.
<P>
	The industry's solid performance in 1996 was the result of strong 
sales to the United States, Brazil, western Europe and Indonesia. 
These sales, combined with strong potash prices, sustained gross 
revenue to the Saskatchewan industry at the second highest level on 
record.
<P>
	Most important, this success translates into high quality, well 
paying jobs. The potash industry employs 3,000 people in 
Saskatchewan and has an annual capital spending of $60 million.
<P>
	In order to build on this success and to spur growth in the mining 
industry as a whole, I call on all members to support the natural 
resources minister in her efforts to remove regulatory constraints 
within federal jurisdiction which hinder mining investment in 
Canada.

to acknowledge in this House the courage and determination of the 
four miners from Asbestos who ran in the Paris marathon last 
weekend.
<P>
	In so doing, although they were ignored by the French press, 
they wanted to create awareness about how safe asbestos really is

more effective dispute resolution mechanism''. There was even 
talk about abrogating the agreement if satisfactory changes could 
not be negotiated.
<P>

suppose we can add it to the heap of other Liberal broken promises 
like dumping the GST, getting to the bottom of the Somalia affair 
and eliminating interprovincial trade barriers.

	Any justification for such actions based on the claim that such

false. Canadian crews do this kind of work all the time and they do 
it well. They could have done the work recently performed in 
Winnipeg and in Bala, Ontario. There was no emergency and no

do.

<P>
	We were faced with a similar problem just a few months ago 
in the House. A resolution to amend the Constitution as it applies 
to Newfoundland and Labrador and their education system was 
introduced, and everything turned out fine.
<P>
	I am very confident that things will go just as well when we 
receive the resolution from the Government of Quebec, but we 
must wait for people to express their views before we can proceed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Leader of the Opposition, BQ): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister knows very well that Mr. Mulcair 
introduced a resolution that received the unanimous approval of all 
members of the National Assembly. He also knows that the 
Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs said yesterday that the will 
of the National Assembly was not enough.
<P>
	Just today, the Prime Minister was speaking about hypothetical 
opposition from church representatives, when the bishops have 
never, throughout this longstanding debate in Quebec, opposed the 
introduction of linguistic school boards.
<P>
	Why refer to hypothetical opposition from church 
representatives when, in the case of Newfoundland, in fact, we 
know that church representatives were opposed, and the Prime 
Minister agreed to the request from the Newfoundland legislature, 
even though church representatives were opposed, but the elected 
representatives of the people of Newfoundland wanted to go 
ahead?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as the minister responsible said, a broad consensus is 
required. I am very happy to see that a consensus seems to be 
taking definite shape in the National Assembly. But I also know 
that people may wish to make representations to us, as they did in 
the case of Newfoundland. We listened to them, and then took 
action.
<P>
	This is how the democratic system works. A resolution must be 
passed here, in the House of Commons, and in the Senate. It took 
several months before Newfoundland's problem was sorted out, 
because of holdups that occurred in fact in the other Chamber. In 
any case, we shall see. We shall have to wait to see the resolution. 
And if it is unanimous, so much the better.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I ask the Prime Minister if, given the resolution passed 
unanimously by all members of the National Assembly, he will 
agree to move quickly. The official opposition in this House will 
give him its full support. Will he agree, on behalf of his party, to 
ask the Liberal and Conservative senators to do likewise, so that 
this amendment may be passed before the upcoming election?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we will receive the resolution, we will examine it  as 
required, and we will introduce it in the House of Commons. At 
that time, we will ask members to proceed as quickly as possible.
<P>
	Sometimes, people object to unanimous situations in the House, 
and the Standing Orders of the House must be observed. As for the 
Senate, we shall see. First of all, the House of Commons must vote 
on it. When we have seen the resolution and it has been approved 
by cabinet, we will then introduce it in the House as soon as 
possible.

until then it is not possible to say whether or not the other objective 
can be met.

question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	In acting as they are with the linguistic school board situation, 
the Prime Minister and the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
are demonstrating exactly why all of the governments of Quebec, 
whether sovereignist or federalist, have denounced or rejected the 
Canadian Constitution which was imposed on Quebec 15 years 
ago.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister admit that he is once again making use 
of the 1982 Constitution to intervene directly in a matter which 
falls under the jurisdiction of the National Assembly, in order to 
dictate to Quebecers how they are to handle their own affairs?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there is but one Constitution in Canada and we respect it. 
There is an obligation for the House of Commons to receive 
resolutions from a provincial government, to study them and to 
vote on them.
<P>
	As I have just said, it is all the better if there is a broad consensus 
in Quebec and a unanimous vote in the Quebec National Assembly. 
That will, I hope, facilitate the debate here. Everyone's point of 
view must be heard, however, for this is a democracy.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, how 
can the Prime Minister deny the consensus expressed by the 
National Assembly's unanimous draft resolution, when he himself 
patriated the Constitution in 1982, against the virtually unanimous 
will of the National Assembly? Does he think a consensus in 
Quebec means the exact opposite of what the National Assembly 
wants?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is obviously the calling of the hon. members of the 
opposition, who are getting the feeling this is where they always 
will be, to do nothing but try to stir up controversy.
<P>
	At the present time there is a debate going on in the Quebec 
National Assembly. The MNAs concerned are holding discussions, 
trying to reach compromises, and will be holding a vote, and there 
is no controversy. Only one party, whose objective is to block 
rather than to accomplish, is trying a blocking operation. We are

discussed the policies of the government, worked very hard and 
brought forward legislation which added to the criminal law 
powers for the police to search and to take bodily substances after 
they get a warrant to test for DNA substances.
<P>
	That legislation was put into effect in July 1995. The 
investigation was concluded. A sample was taken. Charges were 
laid and that case is now before the courts.
<P>
	That is the way the government responds to the needs of victims.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
was referring to criminals getting appeals left, right and centre, 
while victims wait time and time and time again for them.
<P>
	Yesterday I indicated that Darren Ursel tortured and violated a 
young woman for an hour and a half. She was lucky to escape with 
her life. The judge said this sex offender was tender at times and 
somewhat sorry for  what he did, so he gave Ursel a two-year 
conditional sentence with no time in prison.
<P>
<B>(1425 )</B>
<P>
	Yesterday I asked the justice minister the following question but 
he evaded the issue. Again I will ask it so that all Canadians can 
listen carefully to the answer.
<P>
	Does the justice minister think there is any time in Canada where 
a woman can be violated and degraded like this and the criminal 
not receive time in prison?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, all of us believe that anyone who 
commits a serious violent crime should be imprisoned as a penalty 
for that kind of crime.
<P>
	The case to which the hon. member refers is before the appeal 
court and he knows that. Let the courts deal with that decision.
<P>
	Last Monday, because of our concern about the way courts are 
interpreting some of the provisions of the bill, we asked the House 
to agree to amendments to the conditional sentence provision in 
Bill C-41. The hon. member and his party agreed, and those 
amendments will be adopted and enacted by this Parliament.
<P>
	I said in answer to the hon. member's questions earlier this 
week, and I will say it again today, the government has acted to 
make significant improvements in the criminal law for the interests 
of victims. My hon. friend knows that. The legislation speaks for 
itself. We have acted.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
justice minister is talking about an appeal of a sentence resulting 
from a law that he legislated. Conditional sentencing should not 
have occurred in the first place.
<P>
	Yesterday I was ashamed of the justice minister and the Liberal 
government. The justice minister would not accept responsibility 
for implementing laws that make the lives of victims worse.
<P>
	I talked to this lady yesterday and she told me she was most 
discouraged by his comments. She felt the justice minister had no 
concern at all for her well-being.
<P>
	How is it the Liberal government suggests it has concern for 
women in Canada and then legislates conditional sentences that 
allow women to be raped and degraded, with no prison time for the 
rapist?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I say the government has acted. I 
do not ask the hon. member or the House simply to take my word 
for it. Why do we not ask someone who knows about being a victim 
and about what rights victims need?
<P>
	In answer to the hon. member's question, let me read from a 
letter I received today:

	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday the Minister of Justice rejected out of hand the 
text of a bill drafted by the Government of Quebec that would 
outlaw biker gangs.
<P>
	However, the very same day, two Hell's Angels were released 
because of lack of evidence, a murder was committed in 
Donnacona, there was an attempted murder in Thetford Mines, a 
Molotov cocktail exploded in Quebec City, and sticks of dynamite 
were found in a garbage can in Longueuil. This is all connected 
with the biker gang war in Quebec. Otherwise, it was just an 
average, care-free day for the federal Minister of Justice.
<P>
<B>(1430)</B>
<P>
	By using the Charter as an excuse for his lack of political will, is 
the minister not broadening the scope of the charter so that it 
protects biker gangs like the Rock Machine and the Hell's Angels 
more than it does law-abiding citizens?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would ask the hon. member to 
wait until next week when I intend to announce concrete, specific 
and practical measures to deal with a situation we find not only in 
Quebec but wherever such gangs and individuals are involved in 
organized crime.
<P>
	It is true that Monday night I received a proposal drafted by Mr. 
Bégin, the attorney general for Quebec. I examined the proposal, 
and my officials are now  preparing our replies. Personally, I was a 
little surprised and disappointed because, according to Mr. Bégin's 
proposal, membership alone in an organization would constitute a 
crime. I think this is against the Quebec and Canadian charters.
<P>
	It is possible to find acceptable, permanent and effective ways to 
deal with this. I am now preparing proposals for next week.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I suggest that instead of acting like an armchair 
quarterback and waiting for a bill to appear out of thin air, 
preferably drafted by divine inspiration, the minister take a look at 
documents produced by the RCMP and Criminal Intelligence 
Service Canada, which state that, and I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Hell's Angels and the Rock Machine have a vast arsenal of weapons and 
munitions and are determined to go to the very limit. At stake in this war is control of 
the drug trade in the Montreal area and elsewhere in the province.</BLOCKQUOTE>
These are federal documents.
<P>
	Considering what he said yesterday about Quebec's bill, would 
the minister agree that his rather innocent interpretation of the 
Canadian Charter of Rights is undermining his own efforts to find 
effective ways to deal with the bikers' war?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I fully share the hon. member's 
concern. We disagree on how we should proceed to meet these 
challenges.
<P>
	Both I personally and the Government of Canada prefer to use 
constitutional and valid measures. We believe it is possible to meet 
these challenges with constitutional measures.
<P>
	Mr. Bégin, the Quebec minister, suggested another, 
unconstitutional approach. I would prefer to have laws with staying 
power, not laws that would be challenged in the courts in the 
months to come. So next week I intend to table proposals that are 
valid, constitutional and effective as well.

	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the justice 
minister's Bill C-41 is allowing rapists and violent offenders to 
walk free. I am sure Mrs. de Villiers will not support that. I am sure 
she is opposed to that.
<P>
	Rather than seeing rapists and violent offenders walk free, why 
will the justice minister not bring in an amendment that would 
restrict conditional sentencing to non-violent offenders?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as the hon. member knows, the 
provision in Bill C-41 to which he  refers requires the court to 
assess the safety of the community before determining that a 
conditional sentence is appropriate. One would have thought it was 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9550"> 9550 </A></B>
<P>
clear that someone who had committed a serious violent crime 
would not be granted a conditional sentence.
<P>
	The cases in some of the appellate courts of the provinces have 
been unclear. It is for that reason that I proposed-and the hon. 
member was good enough to agree-that there ought to be an 
amendment to Bill C-41 to make clear that the courts must have 
regard to the traditional principles of sentencing, including 
deterrence, denunciation and protection of society when deciding 
on whether a conditional sentence should be given.
<P>
	The case to which the hon. member refers, which is so 
shamelessly exploited by the hon. member for-
<P>
<B>(1435 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Bullshit.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Of course I do not always hear everything that is 
said in the House. I can understand sometimes if we have outbursts, 
but I would like the hon. member for Fraser Valley West to simply 
withdraw the word so that we can get on with question period.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, that was a very 
serious accusation he made but I withdraw my comment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
conditions of the amendment to which the justice minister refers 
will not stop courts from allowing rapists and violent offenders to 
walk free. It will not do that.
<P>
	Inasmuch as the justice minister's answer indicates very clearly 
that he has no intention of limiting conditional sentencing to 
non-violent offenders, what does he have to say to the victims of 
violent crime, in particular women who have been assaulted and 
raped by men who are now walking free because of his bill and 
because of his refusal to restrict that law to non-violent offences?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the fact is that the case is before the 
British Columbia Court of Appeal. The argument before that 
appeal court is that such sentences should never be given in such 
cases. If the appeal court should see fit to make such a disposition 
of course it will be binding on lower courts.
<P>
	The reality is that my friend speaks of victims. All week long the 
Reform Party has made much of the plight of victims. As I have 
already said this afternoon there is in Canada a no more credible, 
hardworking organization in favour of victims and their rights than 
CAVEAT. There are few more respected outspoken spokespersons 
for victims than Priscilla de Villiers.
<P>
	As I have read to the House today, Priscilla de Villiers on behalf 
of CAVEAT has said that the government listens, has made 
meaningful change and has acted to change the law to make the 
plight of victims better. That is the record of the government.

	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, federal legislation on financial institutions prevents 
insurance companies with provincial charters from acquiring part 
of the activities of a federally chartered insurance company.
<P>
	It denies Quebec companies the opportunity to buy blocks of 
insurance from a competitor withdrawing from the market. The 
discrimination in the legislation goes so far as to permit a French, 
American, Brazilian or other company to do what a Quebec 
company cannot do in its own country.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Finance. Will he agree before 
this House to correct this discrimination against Quebec companies 
immediately? He can do it right now in the course of the present 
review of the legislation on financial institutions?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, as 
the hon. member is aware, Bill C-82 is very important to the 
insurance industry. It contains many provisions on a variety of 
broad issues.
<P>
	I am sure the hon. member will agree with me that any change to 
an industry like the insurance industry must be made with care. 
Third, the change proposed by the member was not a priority for 
the insurance industry.
<P>
	That having been said, my officials are already considering and 
analyzing a possibility. I myself am very open to looking at it and 
giving it full attention.
<P>
<B>(1440)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, when the minister says it was not a priority for the 
industry, I would remind him that a white paper was tabled last year 
that was almost unanimously approved by the industry in Canada, 
that contained support for this sort of change by the Canadian Life 
and Health Insurance Association Inc., the Canadian Bankers 
Association, the Insurance Bureau of Canada, Canada Trust, and so 
on.
<P>
	As we are always ready to co-operate in the interest of our fellow 
citizens, contrary to what the Prime Minister said a few minutes 
ago, we offer him our services to correct the unjustified 
discrimination against Quebec's provincially chartered insurance 
companies before the next election is called.

I have just indicated, I am very open to considering a change. My 
officials are already looking into it, and I am prepared to meet the

have been listening carefully to the questions that have been put to 
the justice minister over the last few days and to his responses, and 
I cannot believe what I am hearing.
<P>
	Judge Harry Boyle had evidence that Darren Ursel confined a 
young woman, stripped her, raped her, sodomized her with a 
racquet handle for an hour and a half until she escaped in terror. 
The judge found this man guilty but said he was somewhat 
remorseful, had been tender at times with his victim and then let 
him walk free.
<P>
	Rather than hiding behind a courtesy letter of thanks from 
CAVEAT, a letter this group probably bitterly regrets sending him 
now, what does the Minister of Justice have to say to this young 
woman and her family about why nothing happened to her 
tormentor?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as I have already said, that case is 
before the Court of Appeal of British Columbia and I am not going 
to comment on it. It is for the court of appeal to deal with the case 
and the issues it presents.
<P>
	I also caution the hon. member about taking some facts from a 
case and not all the facts in presenting the issue to the House or 
publicly.
<P>
	Finally, in relation to conditional sentencing, I and the 
government believe that anyone who commits serious violent 
crime should be imprisoned. I also believe that the amendment we 
made in common on Monday, to make clear that in the case of 
conditional sentences the courts must look at the factors, including 
societal protection, denunciation and deterrence, will improve the 
provisions and give the courts clear direction on the intention of 
Parliament.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do 
not think the facts are in any doubt. A woman was stripped, 
violated and brutalized. She is a  single mother. Now the justice 
minister brought in a hurried amendment which says that judges 
should consider the needs of society for protection before letting 
criminals walk free. Now he is saying he has done a great thing and 
this is really going to protect women.
<P>
	Is it not amazing that laws have to be passed to tell judges that it 
is their job to think about our safety?
<P>
	Why does this justice minister not pass one of his laws and tell 
judges that raping women in this country deserves time in prison?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Criminal Code contains over 
800 sections. It is made very clear in the Criminal Code that the 
penalty for serious violent crime is imprisonment. The penalty for 
sexual assault is already crystal clear in the Criminal Code.
<P>
	The case to which the hon. member refers is being argued in the 
Court of Appeal of British Columbia. It is not to be decided here in 
the House; it is to be decided in the courts.
<P>
	The principles of sentencing are already set out in the Criminal 
Code of Canada. They are there to be interpreted and applied by the 
courts. That is the way the system of justice works in this country 
and this government has taken steps to ensure that system is all the 
stronger.

<P>
	On March 25, the minister announced that financial support of 
$185 million would be provided to the Pearson airport authority, 
supposedly for necessary projects relating to safety and to the 
environment at the Toronto facility. However, when we take a look 
at the breakdown of the amount paid by the federal government, we 
note that $145 million, or 80 per cent of the total, will in fact be 
used to build a new runway.
<P>
	Will the Minister of Transport admit that this gift of $185 
million is compensation paid to the Toronto airport authority to 
allow it to buy terminal 3 at a high price and thus save face for the 
Liberal government, which is being sued to the tune of $662 
million by Pearson Development Corporation?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, let me again explain to the hon. member and the House 
that the $185 million he talked about was for three projects. The 
rental deferral was conditional on  three things, to complete the 
runway, to build two fire halls on the Pearson airport area, and to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9552"> 9552 </A></B>
<P>
put in a new de-icing facility which was a $40 million item. This 
was the agreement made.
<P>
	It follows adjustments to the rental formulas of Vancouver, 
Calgary and Edmonton. It was in line with the general switch from 
the local airport authority approach of the previous government to 
the Canadian airport authority approach of this government. 
Subsequently there has been a sale of T-3, the terminal at Pearson. 
As I said yesterday, the chairman of the board of the local airport 
authority has made it perfectly clear that it was his decision to buy 
that facility and clearly in that case the price was determined by the 
willing buyer and the willing seller.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Mercier (Blainville-Deux-Montagnes, BQ):</B> Mr.

to the $50 million to 75 $million that the federal is about to give to 
promoters to compensate them for the privatization of terminals 1 
and 2, we arrive at a total of some $250 million, which taxpayers in 
Quebec and Canada will have to pay for Pearson airport as a result 
decisions made by this government?

believe the first day I became Minister of Transport that I think it is 
always better to have lawsuits settled out of court, and this has been 
the government's position. From time to time there have been 
discussions and that is well known to everyone. If in the future

	Child abduction is on the rise. All too often, children are 
abducted by a parent who illegally takes them out of the country. 
That is what happened to Suzie Robitaille's five children, who were 
abducted by her former husband two years ago and are still in

children back; one of them is very sick.

met with Mrs. Robitaille, and my office is in contact with her on a

<P>

would no longer be entitled to the benefit, she was also asked to pay 
back $7,000 in alleged overpayments.
<P>
	My question to the minister is this: Could the minister state in 
this House that he will be pressing his colleague at National 
Revenue to maintain Mrs. Robitaille's entitlement to this tax 
benefit for the sake of her children and as a means of keeping in 
touch with them?

	I would like to assure the hon. member that while the children 
are still in Egypt, members of the embassy there are in regular 
contact with the children to ensure their protection and to ensure 
that as much as possible under Egyptian law their rights are being 
protected.

	We will take all measures possible to aid Mrs. Robitaille in this 
very serious matter.

	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Minister of Labour is quoted in the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> today as 
follows: ``If I fire or suspend Mr. Weatherill without having good 
cause, Mr. Weatherill can turn around and sue the government''.
<P>
	The minister therefore expects to keep Mr. Weatherill in his 
position until the fall, and the chairman of the Canada Labour 
Relations Board has violated every principle of his office by wining 
and dining executives of CN and CP while adjudicating a case for 
the railroads and he has violated the fundamental rules that apply to 
his tribunal.

	The first day we learned of his expenses we asked the auditor 
general to investigate. Today privy council officials have asked the 
commissioner of ethics to investigate Mr. Weatherill's alleged bias. 
As soon as we have all the facts we will act.

	He is now sending a clear signal to people who violate the ethics 
of their office, who have abused the principles of expenditures of 
their office, that it is perfectly okay to sit where they are. He has 
not even suspended him without pay until this investigation is 
complete. This type of ethics from this government we have heard 
time and time again.

on the payroll when if it were in the private sector he would be 
before the courts today?

repeat, I cannot act until I have all the facts.

	If the member was very concerned, on March 11, a month ago, 
instead of filibustering, and the Reform Party moved a motion to

	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (Parliamentary Secretary to </B><B>Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I welcome the chance to launch this 
debate and to encourage all hon. members to support the motion to 
refer Bill C-93 to committee before second reading.
<P>
	This legislation will implement a wide range of measures 
proposed in February's 1997 budget. Some of these measures are 
technical, but other proposals relating to support for children, to 
small businesses' ability to create new jobs and to Canada's ability 
to innovate and respond to Canadian needs and social interests, 
fully deserve the speediest possible consideration.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We are not talking here about partisan politics, but about 
national interests and progress. This is why I think this bill should 
be referred to a committee at the earliest opportunity, so that the 
House can, as quickly as possible, implement the constructive 
measures put forward in the budget.
<P>
	I do not believe it is necessary today to discuss at length the 
measures proposed in the 1997 budget, let alone the important 
achievements that it reflects. In the last two months, I have 
mentioned on numerous occasions our government's achievements 
and objectives.
<P>
	However, I would like once again to stress a vital issue. The 
1997 budget is not just a means to put our fiscal house in order, it 
also a means to promote new investments that are essential for job 
creation, both in the short term and in the long term.
<P>
	It includes measures designed to alleviate the terrible burden of 
poverty on the most vulnerable among us, namely our children. 
These measures reflect a philosophy which had guided our 
government in each of its four budgets.
<P>
	Fiscal recovery is not an end in itself. Rather, it is an essential 
tool that allows a government to fulfil an ongoing responsibility, 
which is to build a stronger society, a society that can maintain and 
enhance the well-being of its citizens.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This takes me directly to the legislation involved in this motion. 
We all live in a world where scientific knowledge and industrial 
innovation and the products of research become the driving engines 
for national growth and economic opportunity. Our long term 
future as an advanced industrial nation, able to compete abroad and 
create jobs at home, will depend on our success in this area. That is 
why C-93 will establish the Canada foundation for innovation. It 
will provide financial support for modernizing research facilities 
and equipment at Canadian post-secondary education institutions 
and research hospitals in the areas of science, engineering, health 
and environment.
<P>
	Through an up front investment by the federal government of 
$800 million, the foundation will be able to provide about $180 
million annually for research infrastructure over five years.
<P>
	However, this investment will go further through partnerships 
with public research institutions, the business community, the 
voluntary sector, individuals and, we hope, provinces. The 
foundation has a potential to trigger about $2 billion for research 
infrastructure across Canada.
<P>
	I do not believe that any hon. member has substantive doubts 
about this initiative. As the <I>Globe and Mail</I> stated in an editorial 
just days ago: ``The Canadian Foundation for Innovation shows the 
hallmarks of a forward looking and responsive policy''.
<P>
	Therefore, it will be to the credit of us all if we move promptly to 
get the foundation off the drawing boards and into reality so that it 
can begin its task of enhancing Canada's research facilities.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In the 1997 budget, we did not just propose ways to promote 
long term growth and improve job opportunities. Our government 
knows very well that for too many Canadians the prospect of better 
jobs in the future is not enough. What they want, and what they 
need, is jobs right now.
<P>
	Here again, Bill C-93 proposes concrete measures. Last 
November, our government announced the program to hire new 
workers, the creation of which was confirmed in the 1997 budget.
<P>
<B>(1510)</B>
<P>
	This program provides for reduced EI premiums for small 
businesses that create jobs this year and in 1998.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Under this bill eligible firms, those with less than $60,000 in EI 
premiums in 1996, will pay virtually no employer premiums for 
new employees hired this year. They will benefit from a 25 per cent 
reduction in premiums for new employees in the year to come. This  
action will help some 900,000 eligible small businesses make the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9556"> 9556 </A></B>
<P>
transition to the new EI system and provide a bottom line incentive 
for them to create jobs.
<P>
	An economic analysis suggests that this new hires program, as it 
is called, combined with the general 1997 EI premium rate 
reductions, could generate as many as 20,000 new jobs. Again, 
there is clearly firm and fair reason to implement this proposal as 
speedily as possible. The price of unnecessary delay is one that 
Canadians should not accept.
<P>
	I have focused on measures in Bill C-93 that deal with creating 
opportunities for meaningful work, a foundation for individual 
well-being. But the ultimate foundation for nations and for 
individuals lies in the conditions of childhood. For too many 
Canadian children whose families lack the means that so many of 
us take for granted, that foundation is at risk. That is why the 
federal, provincial and territorial governments have been 
examining ways to improve assistance to children in low income 
families.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In the 1997 budget, we propose a national child benefit system 
under which the federal government would introduce an improved 
Canadian child tax benefit. For their part, the provinces and 
territories could reassign part of their resources to improve the 
services and benefits available to low income families.
<P>
	The 1997 budget proposes a two stage improvement in the 
present $5.1 million Canadian child tax benefit so as to create a 
new child tax benefit of $6 billion by July 1998.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Bill C-93 represents a key component of this program. It will 
mean that effective this July the working income supplement will 
be enriched by $195 million, which is $70 million more than was 
proposed last year. Benefits will be provided for each child instead 
of per family. The maximum working income supplement will be 
increased from $500 per family to $605 for the first child, $405 for 
the second and $330 for each subsequent child. The benefits will be 
phased in on family earned income over $3,750 and will be reduced 
as family income exceeds $20,920.
<P>
	The second step will occur in July 1998 when the working 
income supplement will be combined with an enriched child tax 
benefit to form the Canada child tax benefit. The maximum benefit 
for low income families will be $1,625 to one child families, 
$3,050 to two child families, increasing by $1,425 for each 
additional child.
<P>
	Overall more than 1.4 million Canadian families with2.5 million children will see an increase in federal child benefits by 
July 1998. Again I find it hard to believe that any hon. member will 
have substantive objections to such  an initiative. Let us make sure 
it is passed as quickly as possible.
<P>
	I have highlighted the elements of this legislation that combine 
wide reaching effects and the need for timely action. Bill C-93 also 
includes a range of other measures and each has constituencies or 
stakeholders who would also argue in favour of timely action. Let 
me summarize these very quickly.
<P>
	At the request of the Cowichan Tribes of Indians and the 
Westbank First Nation the legislation includes provisions to enable 
them to impose sales taxes on tobacco products. This initiative will 
enable these First Nations to achieve a greater degree of 
self-reliance and self-government. It will also provide a tangible 
example of the government's commitment to reaching practical 
taxation agreements with First Nations that indicate an interest in 
exercising taxation powers. I should add that the costs of this 
initiative are minimal, probably less than $200,000 a year in 
foregone revenue.
<P>
	There is another part of this legislation that also deals with 
tobacco. Bill C-93 proposes amendments that implement changes 
announced last November and December. These changes include 
an increased excise tax rate for tobacco products, an extension of 
the surtax on tobacco manufacturers, changes to the excise tax on 
exported tobacco products and reductions in amounts of tobacco 
products that may be brought into Canada on a duty and tax free 
basis.
<P>
<B>(1515)</B>
<P>
	I realize the tax increases involved are more modest than some 
might favour, but we believe disciplined, gradual increases 
undertaken in conjunction with the provinces is the most 
appropriate method of restoring tobacco tax rates while minimizing 
the risk of renewed contraband activity.
<P>
	Bill C-93 would also implement the government's proposal to 
rebate excise tax paid on aviation fuel, a measure available to 
airlines that is conditional on the companies involved giving up the 
right to use some accumulated tax losses.
<P>
	Also the legislation proposes a further fuel related measure. 
Currently the Excise Tax Act does not stipulate the method used to 
measure the volume of fuel for the purpose of accounting for excise 
tax. The legislation will clear that up.
<P>
	Finally, Bill C-93 will formalize the procedures for the 
government's participation in bridge loans, those co-ordinated by 
the BIS or Bank for International Settlements to countries 
receiving assistance from the IMF and the World Bank.
<P>
	Let me emphasize that the amendment will in no way alter the 
efforts made to ensure that such loans are quickly repaid from the 
IMF or World Bank through its disbursements to the borrowing 
country.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9557"> 9557 </A></B>
<P>
	The time for this debate is short and I had to cover considerable 
ground in just a few moments. I have explained the reason for 
moving quickly to implement these important changes. I feel the 
summary indicates that the House should proceed immediately 
with-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am sorry but the parliamentary 
secretary's time has expired.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, BQ): 
</B>Mr. Speaker, I will pick it up from there. The main thing the last 
budget tells us is that the deficit has been reduced, and the 
government is to be congratulated for that. But it is overdoing it a 
bit for the government to claim that it has reduced the deficit by 
cleaning up public finances. We know very well that the 
government has not attained its objective, in terms of cutting its 
expenditures.
<P>
	In fact, where it has indeed reduced the deficit by reducing 
certain expenditures is in two very specific areas. First of all, by 
cutting $4.5 billion, or $4,500 million, in transfer payments to the 
provinces, which will affect health, education and welfare in 
particular, or in other words areas which affect the most 
disadvantaged members of society. So, it took $4.5 billion from 
transfer payments to the provinces. Yet we remember the Prime 
Minister's commitments. We have them here in English. He stated 
this before the 1993 election, and I am quoting the Prime Minister 
here:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``What we said in our platform is we don't intend to reduce the 
transfer payments. What I said in the program, and I intend to keep 
my word, is we don't intend to cut further''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	A few months later, in April 1994, the Minister of Finance set 
the record straight after the election, and I quote him, again in 
English:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``The next federal budget will include massive cuts in aid to the 
provinces for such things as health, welfare and education'', 
according to the Toronto <I>Star</I> in April 1994.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	So we can see that election promises are not worth much. They 
promised to make no cuts to the provinces, yet half of the deficit 
they are now claiming to have reduced comes from a $4.5 billion 
cut in transfer payments to the provinces.
<P>
	Then, as well, $5 billion or $5,000 million, were taken from the 
unemployment insurance fund. Not the employment insurance 
fund, for there is no such thing as employment insurance, it is 
unemployment insurance. They laid their hands on $5 billion 
belonging strictly to  the workers of this country. The government 
did a kind of collective garnishment of wages, and decided to 
reduce its deficit with that money.
<P>
	So then, the Canadian government's deficit was not cut by a 
massive reduction in state spending, but by massive cuts in transfer 
payments to the provinces which in turn, be it Ontario, BC or 
Quebec, have been forced to make dramatic cuts to hospital 
services and health care. As my colleague from the Reform Party 
was saying this morning, this government is the one government in 
the history of Canada that has closed the greatest number of 
hospitals in the least amount of time, because all hospital closures 
are the direct result of the cuts to transfer payments to provinces 
made in the last budget.
<P>
	I believe that some here do not understand how finances work.
<P>
<B>(1520)</B>
<P>
	An in-house report of the Department of Human Resources 
Development has revealed that today, 55 per cent of the 
unemployed no longer receive unemployment insurance benefits. 
Fifty-five per cent of the people who deserve to get these benefits 
no longer do, compared with 33 per cent when the Liberals came to 
power. I know some people will say we are making this up, but this 
is from a press release of the Canadian Labour Congress, dated 
January 23, 1997.
<P>
	The CLC estimates that by the end of 1997-in other words, 
right after the election-when we will be able to see the impact of 
the Liberal reform, the proportion of unemployed who are not 
eligible for unemployment insurance benefits will easily exceed60 per cent, in other words, 60 per cent of those who expect to get 
unemployment insurance at the end of 1997, when all other 
measures have been put in place, will realize after the election that 
there is no unemployment insurance for them.
<P>
	The Minister of Human Resources Development is nevertheless 
trying to sell this reform by claiming that 500,000 more 
people-they will say just about anything-will be covered by the 
employment insurance plan. At least, that is what he says. Now, 
about employment insurance. What the minister means is that 
500,000 more people will pay unemployment insurance premiums.
<P>
	However, an in-house study by the Department of Human 
Resources Development was published in 1996, and my colleague 
can check this, on employment insurance and the impact of reform. 
This comes straight from the minister. What the minister means 
and what this study claims is that more than 75 per cent of the new 
people who are supposedly covered-the 500,000 people referred 
to by the minister-will have their premiums refunded at the end of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9558"> 9558 </A></B>
<P>
the year because they did not earn more than $2,000; they will 
probably never get unemployment insurance.
<P>
	Always according to the same study, only 18,000 more people in 
Quebec will be eligible for benefits, while at the same time, 31,000 
current beneficiaries will be completely excluded from the plan as 
a result of the Liberal reform. This still according to the same 
information provided by the department.
<P>
	Unfortunately, that is not the end of it. All persons who earn 
more than $2,000 annually but do not work the minimum number 
of hours required to qualify, which varies between 420 and 910 
hours, will pay premiums which will not be refunded because they 
earned more than $2,000 during the year, and meanwhile they are 
not eligible for unemployment insurance if they lose their job.
<P>
	This is easy to understand. There are people, for instance in 
universities, who teach about two or three hours per week. 
However, they are relatively well paid on an hourly basis because it 
is felt that they have a lot of course preparation to do. By the end of 
the year, they have earned more than $2,000, they have paid 
unemployment insurance premiums but did not work the total 
number of hours required, so they are not eligible for 
unemployment insurance. There are thousands of people in this 
position.
<P>
	With the massive cuts in transfers to the provinces and the 
wholesale garnishment of wages, so to speak, to benefit the 
unemployment insurance fund, the government has deliberately 
created a network of poverty in this country. We have 500,000 
more children living in poverty. Not three, four or one but 500,000 
more than there were three and a half years ago. This government 
even has the nerve to tell us it has done a good job. I think the 
public will be in a position to judge in the next election.
<P>
	I have a short quote taken from page 19 of the red book, before it 
disappears and they do everything they can to make it sink into 
oblivion, because they did not keep any of the major commitments 
they made in the book. So here is the quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A number of government programs and tax expenditures-some of which have 
been identified by the auditor general-are inefficient, poorly managed or driven for 
purely political reasons. We will clean up.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1525)</B>
<P>
	That is what it says on page 19 of the red book. What does 
cleaning up mean? There were the family trusts, which transferred 
$2 billion to the United States without paying a cent in taxes. They 
are most likely talking about the $400 million or $500 million in 
unpaid taxes. All that went on behind the scenes. There was no 
paper trail. The so-called ministers knew nothing, nobody wanted 
to investigate, the knuckles of the auditor general were rapped. He 
said, and I quote: ``We fear that Revenue  Canada, in making these 
decisions, has harmed the tax base by giving up its right to collect 
these amounts''.
<P>
	I remind you, Mr. Speaker, that $500 million, and I will close on 
this as I see my time is up, is what the Minister of Finance, his 
voice quavering, is trying to tell us he is going to give over five or 
six years to the poor children of Canada, who number 500,000 
more than they did three and a half years ago.
<P>
	All this time, however, the minister raises not a pinkie to stop 
someone who probably contributes to Liberal party coffers from 
leaving Canada with $500 million in unpaid taxes, which the 
children will have to pay some day. I am acutely chagrined by the 
fact that the minister continues to try to tell us that they reduced the 
deficit through proper management and improvement of public 
finances, because it is simply not true.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we are now 
moving along with the budget bills, and this one is Bill C-93. Since 
I did not quite finish the comments I wanted to make on Bill C-92 I 
will continue along, finish my earlier speech and touch on a few 
things I feel are important for the Canadian public to know about 
the fourth budget of the Liberal government.
<P>
	The government spent $1.3 billion in the budget on 
infrastructure type programs. We all know the last infrastructure 
program created about 10,000 permanent jobs with a $6 billion 
expenditure. By that criteria this $1.3 billion will create about 
1,300 permanent jobs.
<P>
	Had the federal and provincial governments agreed to cut taxes 
by $6 billion, they probably could have created 162,000 jobs by the 
year 2000. Over the next couple of years it is obvious that spending 
cuts and balanced budgets would mean a lot more to job creation 
than infrastructure programs.
<P>
	As I said earlier, infrastructure money is a battle of budgets: the 
federal budget, provincial budget and municipal budget. There is 
only one taxpayer that feeds that three levels of government. If we 
take from one and give to the other and play games at this level, the 
taxpayer will still have to pay more taxes at one level or the other. 
It is just a fight about who will look better.
<P>
	If the budget is so good, why do Canadians not feel better? Why 
are they not jumping up and praising the government? 
Unemployment is still at the same level with 1.4 million to 1.5 
million unemployed. Bankruptcies are up. People get a raise and 
end up paying more in taxes. Why would they not get to keep more 
money?
<P>
	No less an expert than the deputy minister, Mr. David Dodge, 
agrees with me on the following point. It is called the bracket 
creep. The finance minister will not acknowledge this point.
<P>
	Mr. Dodge once wrote in <I>The Canadian Tax Journal</I>, Volume 22:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9559"> 9559 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>There are two fundamental sources of higher taxes as a consequence of inflation. 
Bracket creep and the erosion of the value of unindexed amounts in the system such as 
the basic personal credit and married credits. It is essential that the adjustment process 
offset both of these.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Apparently his political bosses do not agree.
<P>
	People get a raise in pay that puts them in a higher tax bracket, 
but because the personal exemption stays at the 1993 level they are 
paying higher taxes than they were before. That is bracket creep. 
Another thing that is wrong with the budget is that it has not kept 
up with inflation or bracket creep. It has also entrenched the GST 
forever.
<P>
<B>(1530)</B>
<P>
	It is another example of why people are losing respect for 
politicians. In opposition as we are now and in government as the 
Liberals are now platforms are presented stating what will be done. 
The Liberals did in their red book. We did it in our fresh start 
platform. Everyone is beginning to do it. Are we not morally and 
ethically bound to deliver on the promises we made?
<P>
	Why is it that we can promise one thing when on this side of the 
House and do the exact opposite when elected? Why is it that they 
can promise to renegotiate a treaty and they do not? They should be 
held accountable for promising to get rid of the GST and then not 
doing it. I guess the people will have a chance either in June or in 
the fall to hold the government accountable.
<P>
	The Liberals were elected by going door to door saying they 
would get rid of the GST, especially in Toronto. They went door to 
door saying: ``Over my dead body will we get a third runway at this 
airport''. This was the same type of thing the justice minister and 
the environment minister said. Now they have changed their minds. 
I read where the Minister of the Environment said that they have 
found ways to reduce noise and to reduce the pollution. She 
concludes that she was not very smart then but is smarter now and 
the third runway is needed in Toronto.
<P>
	I hope the Canadian public holds politicians accountable. They 
should be elected to deliver the promises they make. If I believe in 
something on this side of the House, I should implement that zero 
in three program on the other side. I should make those cuts that I 
promised. I should lower government spending. I should be held 
accountable if I do not. I should not flip flop. Canadians for too 
many years are letting politicians get away with it. It is time it 
stopped. This might be a good election in which to do that.
<P>
	Every one of the key cabinet ministers, the finance minister, the 
current minister of defence and even the minister of national 
revenue and the Prime Minister, has said various comments to the 
effect that they have to get rid of the GST. The finance minister has 
said that if the GST is harmonized with a provincial sales tax it is  
entrenched forever. Those were his words. That is what he has done 
with the budget.
<P>
	Shame on him. Shame on him for flip flopping. Shame on him 
for being a political opportunist and just trying to raise money in 
any way, shape or form he can. Shame on him for trying to impose 
this horrible HST on the Canadian public. It is poor politics and 
poor business. That prepayment to the provinces is costing 
taxpayers a ton of tax dollars.
<P>
	What would the Reform Party do? If we were ever elected to 
form the government we would make government smaller. We 
would not expand to 301 members like the government is doing. 
We would reduce it. We would have lower taxes thereby creating 
more and better jobs. We would take 1.2 million of low income 
people off the payrolls because we would increase personal 
exemptions, give immediate tax relief to everybody at the low end 
of the scale who is paying income tax. That is a good way to help 
people to get more money in their pockets to pay for their daily 
expenses. We have an overall comprehensive plan to stop 
overspending, to attack the national debt and to overhaul 
government with jobs as the bottom line.
<P>
	We believe that lower taxes is the key to prosperity. We believe 
that smaller government is the key to prosperity. The only way we 
can get there is by making government smaller and getting it off 
our back and out of our pocket.
<P>
	The government believes it has now turned the corner on the 
deficit. It believes it now has the opportunity to spend money. It 
will not face and address the big problem. It brags in its budget 
about the fact that it has lowered the deficit by $23 billion, $42 
billion to $19 billion. Tax revenues are up by $30 billion. It says 
that is just growth in the economy. None of it is due to the 35 tax 
increases in terms of tinkering in exemptions and deductions, et 
cetera. Let us accept those numbers because they are accurate. That 
is a $55 billion improvement in the source and application of funds.
<P>
	What does the budget not dwell on? At the same time the 
government has lowered the deficit and increased tax revenues, 
what has it not talked about? What does the government not tell the 
Canadian public that the Reform Party will tell them at every town 
hall meeting and in front of every Liberal? The Liberals have added 
$111 billion to the national debt. That takes us over $600 billion.
<P>
<B>(1535)</B>
<P>
	Who wants to come back here as a member of Parliament three, 
four or five years from now when the debt is over $700 billion or 
$750 billion? The separatists who want to break away will have a 
$200 billion, $300 billion or $400 billion debt. Who will pay the 
interest? How will we sustain the interest payment?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9560"> 9560 </A></B>
<P>
	There is only so much that can be cut. There is room to cut 
another $10 billion or $12 billion over the next couple of years, 
but after that there will be nothing left to cut. We need about $94 
billion to $95 billion to run the country, along with all the 
exemptions and deductions that currently exist in the tax system. 
How are we to service the debt on $700 billion? I want the brains 
on the other side to figure that out.
<P>
	They will raise taxes. That is what the Liberal government will 
do in the next mandate. It will promise to lower taxes. I have 
already read some speeches made by the finance minister. What 
will his choice be when the debt hits $700 billion? We are talking 
about increased taxes. They have no other choice because they will 
not be able to cut any more.
<P>
	Your programs will be threatened. The only way you will sustain 
them is by increased taxes.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I ask the hon. member to put his remarks 
through the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, I apologize. I will do that. What bothers 
me is that the finance minister and the government have missed the 
problem. They are doing a half job. They could do a good job if 
they addressed the debt.
<P>
	We have to get to a balanced budget. There is no commitment to 
do so. We have to create a surplus so we can service the debt and 
start repaying the debt in terms of a mortgage over 30 or 40 years. 
We need a long term plan. We do not have to pay it off all at once 
but we have to stop adding to it. Even if we add $9 billion to it, that 
is not breaking the back of the deficit. That is not solving the 
problem. We are still adding to the problem.
<P>
	If people on diets who are overweight keep eating, they add to 
the problem. Even if they cut back on what they are eating but are 
still eating more calories than they burn off, even if it is less than it 
was the week before, they will still gain weight. They are adding to 
the problem. They are getting fatter.
<P>
	The debt is getting bigger. The government is adding to the 
problem. It is not solving the problem. That scares me. Every 
Canadian should be afraid.
<P>
	In the next election Canadians should be looking at which party 
is offering sound fiscal management. Which one is saying it will 
make government smaller, lower the overhead, offer tax relief, and 
put more money in the pockets of Canadians so that they will have 
more money to spend? It would mean less for government but it 
could get on with servicing the debt with a surplus. Those are the 
kinds of people to vote for, the ones who will stick to what they say 
they will do.
<P>
	The Reform Party as a third party had the opportunity to keep 
only one promise. It walked away from the fat cat MP pension plan, 
which members opposite did not walk away from. Some 51 
Reformers opted out of the  pension plan. They will never qualify 
for a pension plan here. The finance minister and the Prime 
Minister made sure of that. Reformers did it gladly, to set an 
example.
<P>
	I hope Canadians will remember that. Leadership starts at the 
top. This is the first group of politicians that ever put their money 
where the mouth is. They want to do what is right for Canada. It 
shows they are sincere. It shows where their hearts are. It shows 
where their pocketbooks are. They care about Canadians. They 
want to make the country better for Canadians. They do not want to 
throw out money on flags and TV programs and be loved by 
everybody. They are prepared to pay the price, sacrifice and do 
what is right for Canadians.
<P>
	The finance minister made an $800 million commitment to the 
Canada Foundation for Innovation, which was very worth while. I 
believe it is a good program. Over the next five years it will provide 
many dividends for Canada and for Canadians. The finance 
minister chose to charge off the $800 million to last year's budget.
<P>
	I accuse the finance minister of going against generally accepted 
accounting principles. It is a bad precedent. Cabinet ministers 
should be paying attention. The issue is not whether he is doing a 
good job. The issue is whether they are allowing a precedent to be 
set by a finance minister who might not be here the next time 
around. Another finance minister could abuse that power, based on 
precedent, and we could be in real trouble.
<P>
	The Liberals should pay attention. They are the government. 
They have the responsibility-

<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The member's time has expired.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it gives me 
great pleasure to enter the debate on the budget implementation 
legislation.
<P>
	I cannot help but respond to some of the comments made by my 
colleague from Calgary Centre. Members talk about originality. I 
went door to door in the last federal election. We had a phrase in 
my organization that we took some time to study as people do when 
they enter into a campaign. Our phraseology was a fresh start. We 
had that on our brochures. We promoted it because it was very 
much a fresh start for Canada and for the people Durham.
<P>
	Canada had its fresh start back in 1993. It always gives me great 
delight when I hear the Reform Party saying me too another four 
years later. That tells us a lot about its policies. Basically it is mired 
in the past.
<P>
	It has taken us a long time to get to where we are today in our 
fiscal responsibilities. Past governments of all political stripes for a 
variety of reasons created deficits and debts which we have had the 
responsibility in this administration to deal with. I say 
responsibility because we have not shirked our responsibilities. 
Looking back 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9561"> 9561 </A></B>
<P>
to when I first wanted to enter this place, it was basically to 
improve the finances of the country.
<P>
	I am proud to be part of a government that took that commitment 
seriously, that started off with a $45 billion a year deficit and 
dropped it to $35 billion. In the last budget it is down to $17 billion. 
We can see that we are going in the right direction.
<P>
	The hon. member talks about a long term plan. Presumably he 
means that somehow we are going to make it go away tomorrow. 
We are not. We have a long term plan. The long term plan is toward 
fiscal responsibility, getting the deficit and debt down.
<P>
	The hon. member wanted to intervene about taxation. Reformers 
talk about the lower income groups they will drop off the tax roll. 
There may well be some merit in that but that kind of policy creates 
a tax wall. It creates a wall so that people cannot get away from the 
lower income. They are lower income people and as soon as they 
jump over the wall they are hit with 20, 30 or 40 per cent taxes. 
That is the kind of regime the Reform Party would have us enter 
into.
<P>
	They spend very little time talking about the other side of the 
issue. They want to give their buddies and friends, the rich of the 
country, a reduction in taxes. Who picks up the bill for that? It is 
the middle income earners, the people in my riding, people with 
$50,000 or $60,000 worth of income. They are the ones who will 
pick up the bill for the so-called Reform agenda.
<P>
	I agree with another aspect the member mentioned. I do not want 
to dwell a long time on Reformers. On the infrastructure spending 
program they went on and on about comparing infrastructure 
dollars to jobs created. Nowhere did we ever say that the prime 
motivation of the infrastructure spending program was to create 
long term jobs. We always said it created short term jobs. It gave 
people hope.
<P>
	It gave people hope. I remember back in 1993 when people had 
no hope at all. Once that infrastructure spending program came into 
play, people saw things were happening. More important, the 
infrastructure spending is not directly impacting jobs per se. It is 
creating the infrastructure or the environment where governments 
and small business people can create wealth. They have better 
roads and better sewer systems. They can create business 
opportunities.
<P>
	The Reform Party seems to have entirely missed this point. It is 
mired in the past. It keeps studying history.
<P>
	One thing my colleague said, to lead me into the main part of my 
dissertation, was that Canadians for some reason do not feel good. 
They feel a queasy uncertainty. It is that uncertainty with which the 
budget deals. What is that uncertainty and what drives it?
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	Basically, what drives it is that we live today in a period of 
change that is no different from the industrial revolution. Things 
are changing because the country is moving to a different type of 
economy. The Reform Party does not seem to understand what that 
change is all about and how it impacts people.
<P>
	The people are concerned about jobs. Clearly, if someone is 
unemployed they are concerned about jobs. However, the people 
who are concerned about jobs today are the people who have them. 
People are worried that they are going to lose them for some very 
specific reasons. They see how technology has impacted their lives 
and it gives them fear and concern. I would like to discuss that 
concern relative to this budget and relative to my riding. In some 
ways, it is a microcosm of what the problem is.
<P>
	In Durham, we have General Motors. The General Motors plants 
are in the riding south of mine, in Oshawa, but a lot of the workers 
live in my riding. More important, the person who started General 
Motors in our area, Sam McLaughlin, had a carriage factory. That 
is part of my riding.
<P>
	In those days, Sam McLaughlin was building carriages so that 
horses could trot people around for their transportation. When 
General Motors came to Canada, it needed a framework to develop 
an automobile industry. That is very important. Most of the growth 
in this economy has been in the automotive sector. Basically an 
engine was put on a carriage that horses would pull. Think of that. 
We are talking about the 1800s. Think of what that meant to the 
people who lived there at that time.
<P>
	They were people who were working on carriages for horses or 
people who raised horses. It must have been very disconcerting to 
them to see suddenly these cars going around and their business 
and agriculture threatened. They must have worried at night about 
whether they were going to maintain some kind of livelihood with 
this new engine of change that was enveloping them in Durham.
<P>
	What happened, of course, is that this new engine created new 
change. It created the need for gasoline. It created the need for 
better roads. We were talking about infrastructure only a few 
minutes ago. It created the need for those kinds of infrastructures. 
It created the need for auto mechanics.
<P>
	Generally speaking, most people will agree that if they actually 
study the people who got new employment from using a car, in fact, 
they got better jobs. They got higher paying jobs than they would 
have had if they were in the agricultural sector.
<P>
	That is change that is really upon us. A lot of people have 
uncertainty. They feel uncertainty about that change. The opposi-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9562"> 9562 </A></B>
<P>
tion parties, whether Reform or  Conservative, breed on this 
uncertainty. They try to say it is the government's fault that we are 
living in a period of change. Nothing could be further from the 
truth. What people need is the courage and conviction to go 
forward into the 21st century.
<P>
	When I look at Durham today, in some ways we are very much 
married to that industrial economy. I have some interesting 
statistics here. The industrial economy allowed for a relatively 
modest degree of human capital to resolve into a fairly good return 
on people's labour. People talk about the new society which is upon 
us as the new knowledge based society, which requires 
considerably more human capital to get that higher return.
<P>
	In Durham, this is something I have been very concerned about. 
Of course, Durham, General Motors and the automotive sector are 
very close together. It has created a problem for us to break out of 
that and to start realizing the potential benefits that science and 
technology can deliver. What do I mean by that? It can mean 
prosperity in the lives of people for better jobs, better lives, better 
health care, et cetera.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	Over 25,000 people in my riding of Durham have post-secondary 
education. The education of over 18,000 of those people is science 
related. Durham has a population of approximately 250,000 
people. That is not a lot when that aspect is considered. Another 
aspect to be considered is why people are not educating themselves 
in the area of science and technology.
<P>
	Of the 18,000 people who have those degrees, only 8,000 have 
jobs in the field of science. In reality, there is a deficit in Durham of 
over 10,000 people who cannot work in Durham because no jobs 
are available in their field. They have to go away. A lot of our youth 
also go away to be educated.
<P>
	The government's program, the Canada Foundation for 
Innovation, is just one way to equalize that and for our educational 
institutions to utilize the $850 million. We talk about the 
importance of frugality in spending, but we have found a way to 
spend money in these very important-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am sorry. The hon. member's time has 
expired.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to participate in this debate on Bill C-93, an act to 
implement certain provisions of the budget tabled in Parliament on 
February 18, 1997.
<P>
	I would like to focus on a new measure introduced in this budget 
and dealing with the establishment of the Canada Foundation for 
Innovation.
<P>
	First of all, I would like to read-and this will come as a surprise 
to you-a number of rather eloquent  statements, which I would go 
as far as to describe as most honourable, made by some of our 
colleagues opposite. The first one states, and I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We are working to ensure that Canada and Canadians are winners in this new 
global economy, an economy which above all focuses on knowledge and our 
knowledge capacity. That means helping our universities modernize and enhance 
their science capacity. It means helping our teaching hospitals improve their research 
capacity. It means increasing our investments in new technologies, research and 
development.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This is what the Prime Minister said on February 13. Three days 
later, the Minister of Finance announced in his budget speech the 
establishment of the Canada Foundation for Innovation. This is the 
explanation he gave for it at the time, and I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We must broaden our notion of infrastructure. We must take it beyond its 
traditional meaning to include the components of future economic success, 
post-secondary education, knowledge, innovation. These are the building blocks of 
the new wealth of nations. It is in this infrastructure as well that government must 
invest, for if we fail to do so we will fail the country of tomorrow. We will short 
change the next generation.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He went on to say:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Research facilities provide the tools needed to develop leading edge skills, skills 
that our students have to acquire if they want to succeed and we want to remain 
competitive in a world growing more competitive by the day.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He stated further: ``The fact is that much of our current research 
infrastructure is literally unable to handle the kind of pressures 
required to keep Canada in the front ranks of the new economy. 
Innovation does not just happen. It requires investment''.
<P>
	And he concluded with these words: ``The Canada Foundation 
for Innovation is about looking forward. It is about our children. It 
is about education. In short, it is about investing in the future 
growth of our economy, making a down payment today for a much 
greater reward tomorrow''.
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	I was listening to all this and I was just stunned to see this new 
awareness, on the part of the Liberal government, of the 
importance of research and development. For close to a year, we 
had been condemning the cuts to the research program on nuclear 
fusion in Canada, which were to put an end to the tokamak project 
in Varennes. We condemned these cuts for a year, and now we are 
told that the future of Canada, the future of the Canadian economy, 
is based on research in the advanced technology sector.
<P>
	However, to justify its decision to cut its modest contribution of 
$7.2 million to the tokamak project in Varennes, the government 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9563"> 9563 </A></B>
<P>
was saying that it had set other priorities. Its top priority was the 
research, development, marketing and sale of CANDU reactors.
<P>
	As you know, the traditional process of nuclear fission is a 
dangerous, highly polluting and ultimately obsolete technique, 
while nuclear fusion is a promising, clean and safe method of 
producing energy in high volumes. Of course, we are told that 
nuclear fusion will not yield results for another 20 to 50 years, at 
least. Granted, but if we give up now, we will never benefit from 
that technique, at least not in Canada.
<P>
	The tokamak project in Varennes, in which the federal 
government invested a modest $7.2 million, is currently the most 
important research and development project on energy in Quebec. 
It is particularly insulting and unacceptable to see that the federal 
government wants to withdraw its annual $7.2 million subsidy, 
considering that Quebec receives barely 17 per cent of federal 
investment in research and development.
<P>
	Regardless of the process, research on nuclear fusion allows us 
to develop new skills and technologies that will be of use in much 
more that just the nuclear fusion industry. Indeed, the research 
program on nuclear fusion generates economic spinoffs amounting 
to millions of dollars, mainly for the Montérégie.
<P>
	This decision by the federal government is all the more 
astonishing given that the European Union is now investing 
US$550 million annually on nuclear fusion, and it plans on 
increasing its budgets by 10 to 25 per cent over the next five years; 
not a cut, but a 10 to 25 per cent increase on the base figure of 
US$550 million.
<P>
	For its part, Japan is investing US$600 million annually in 
nuclear fusion research. The United States has levelled off its 
investment in nuclear fusion research at close to $225 million 
annually and, over the last five years, South Korea, the People's 
Republic of China and India have also become involved in nuclear 
fusion research.
<P>
	Can it be that the federal government is completely cut off from 
the reality of today's technology? Is it completely unaware of what 
the future holds with respect to energy production? It seems so. The 
decision is all the more incomprehensible because the modest $7.2 
million invested by the federal government in nuclear fusion 
research means that Canada is investing only 1 per cent of the 
amounts spent in this sector internationally.
<P>
	But by investing a mere 1 per cent of the amounts spent 
internationally on nuclear fusion research, Canada receives all the 
technological spinoffs from this research. If we now decide to cut 
our nuclear fusion funding or research program, Canada will have 
missed the boat when this form of energy starts to be used. It is 
important that we continue our investments in nuclear fusion 
research.
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	It must also be understood that if the federal government 
withdraws its modest contribution of C$7.2 million, it will be the 
only G7 country no longer investing a cent in nuclear fusion 
research.
<P>
	In closing, I would like to put this announcement of $800 million 
for a Canada Foundation for Innovation in perspective. First of all, 
it must be understood that the government is initially investing 
only $180 million. The $800 million is in the long term, and we 
shall see how much it actually invests in the end. But what has to be 
understood is that it is essentially making this investment with the 
money it cut in transfers to the provinces.
<P>
	The 1996 budget forecast that provincial transfer payments 
would be $20.6 billion. In actual fact, when we look at this year's 
budget, we see that this amount has dropped to $19.8 billion, or 
$800 million less, exactly the amount announced for the Canada 
Foundation for Innovation.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, you are indicating that my time is up. I shall now 
conclude by saying that Quebecers will not be taken in by the tricks 
and duplicity of this government. We will find a way to make this 
clear in a few weeks.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Steckle (Huron-Bruce, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
very pleased to take part in the debate this afternoon on Bill C-93, a 
measure regarding the government's fourth budget and one which 
acknowledges the three main goals of our agenda since it was 
elected: job creation, economic growth and deficit reduction.
<P>
	First, I would like to take the opportunity to commend the 
Minister of Finance for soliciting and considering the views that 
were expressed by many Canadians during the process leading up 
to the budget. I believe the budget addresses positively the issues 
that were brought forward by the people of Canada. The budget 
also proves that the government is keeping its promise to put 
Canada's fiscal house in order. The government has remained 
committed to reducing the deficit.
<P>
	In 1993-94 the deficit had risen to $42 billion, approximately6 per cent of GDP. The 1996-97 deficit is the lowest in 15 years at 
under $19 billion. Canada has every reason to be proud of its fiscal 
recovery. Other countries in the G7 are reportedly impressed by our 
fiscal turnaround and if the projections for the future are correct, by 
1998-99 Canada will have the lowest deficit in the G7 with a record 
low of $9 billion. That projected record low will also end the need 
for Canada to borrow money from outside of the country.
<P>
	The government has met its deficit targets in the past and I 
firmly believe that the projected targets for the future will also be 
met.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9564"> 9564 </A></B>
<P>
	Since the government took office in 1993 more than 700,000 
jobs have been created. In the last four months alone 85,000 
Canadians found employment, the vast majority of them in full 
time jobs.
<P>
	The government is also working hard to create the opportunities 
that are so desperately required to keep improving the fiscal health 
of Canada and to restore confidence. The announcements that I am 
particularly pleased about are those measures introduced to assist 
small and medium sized businesses. The survival of many small 
communities across Canada rely on the building, strengthening and 
continued success of small and medium sized business.
<P>
	My riding of Huron-Bruce is a rural riding. The people of 
Huron-Bruce depend on small business for employment. Without 
the existence of small business in ridings like mine, people would 
not be able to put food on their tables or clothes on the backs of 
their children. Unemployment has a direct effect on the local 
economy. Without businesses and employment stimulation in small 
communities, small communities may cease to exist.
<P>
	The 1997 budget announced very encouraging provisions to 
provide Canadians with job opportunities. Improving employment 
prospects is a team effort between different levels of government 
and the private sector. For example, the new hires program is an 
initiative to encourage small businesses to create jobs by offering 
employment insurance premium relief to 900,000 eligible 
businesses that hire new workers.
<P>
	Another measure to assist small businesses is the step to reduce 
the paperwork burden of payroll taxes which the government 
imposes by allowing businesses with less than $1,000 monthly 
payroll deductions to file on a quarterly basis. One model 
partnership is the Canada infrastructure works program. An 
additional $425 million in federal support for infrastructure will 
have many positive influences on communities. Not only does the 
investment in the Canada infrastructure works program produce 
short term and long term jobs, but by upgrading local infrastructure 
it allows communities to stay competitive and viable in attracting 
business and commerce.
<P>
<B>(1605 )</B>
<P>
	Technology is the way of the future. It is a science that changes 
rapidly from day to day. The technology partnerships Canada 
investment fund provides up to $250 million annually to work with 
businesses and to keep the development, marketing and production 
of new technology in Canada.
<P>
	The industrial research assistance program offers financial 
support and/or technical advice to numerous Canadian companies 
to assist them in taking full advantage of the latest technology to 
increase their competitiveness internationally, while at the same 
time creating jobs locally.
<P>
	On a more personal, riding related level, I am very happy to see 
that the government continues to recognize and acknowledge the 
important role that rural Canada plays in our society. Nearly 
one-quarter of all Canadians live in the rural sector. I feel that the 
rural development measures outlined in the budget reflect the 
changing needs of rural Canadians.
<P>
	The Farm Credit Corporation is an invaluable financial 
instrument for rural Canada. This budget provides an additional 
$50 million in capital to the Farm Credit Corporation to expand its 
ability to support growth and diversification.
<P>
	The budget also introduces the community access program for 
rural Canada. It is important that the people of rural Canada 
experience the same technological opportunities that urban Canada 
does. The world wide web is an amazing communication and 
information instrument which links people together around the 
world. This budget provides an extra $30 million over three years 
to connect 5,000 small communities, with populations between 400 
and 50,000, to the information highway via Internet sites. Young 
and old alike will greatly benefit from this access.
<P>
	The challenges that face our youth are clear. Last spring the 
government created a youth task force to solicit and consider the 
concerns of young people. Knowledge and training are key factors 
behind employment. However, rising tuition costs are making it 
difficult for students and parents to afford post-secondary 
education. The budget responds to struggling students and families 
by doubling the already established education credit.
<P>
	The budget also provides assistance to students who have had to 
borrow money from the government. The government realizes that 
it is difficult to find employment on graduation. Due to the 
hardships that many graduates are facing, students will be allowed 
to defer their loan payments for up to 30 months during the period 
between post-secondary graduation and employment.
<P>
	Also, for high school students seeking employment in order to 
save for post-secondary education, the budget has consolidated $2 
billion in a new youth employment strategy for work experience 
and employment related programs and services for youth.
<P>
	As well, the existing youth internship and summer student 
employment programs will enable 140,000 more young Canadians 
to gain the experience they require in order to enter the workplace.
<P>
	Child poverty has been an ongoing concern across the nation. 
Many families live at a low income level and are often unable to 
provide their children with basic necessities, such as food and 
clothing. If children do not receive the start they need at a young 
age, how can we possibly expect them to become healthy, educated 
and  productive adults, the same adults that will run the country in 
the future?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9565"> 9565 </A></B>
<P>
	The 1997 responds to the hungry cries of low income families by 
introducing a new cross Canada child benefit system. The measures 
introduced in this budget complement the child support reform 
announced in the 1996 budget. The government announced that 
federal spending on children will increase from $5.1 million to $6 
million. The new Canada child tax benefit will go to all eligible 
families, those who are employed and those who require social 
assistance.
<P>
	The changes that the government is imposing will also initiate 
the process of dismantling the welfare trap, a trap that so many 
have fallen into.
<P>
	Canada will certainly be better off if the government can help to 
prevent and reduce the overwhelming numbers of children living in 
poverty.
<P>
	Our national health care system is one of our proudest 
achievements. It is a system that many other countries envy. 
However, it has been under much duress and scrutiny. Last year the 
budget introduced the Canada health and social transfer, a measure 
that provided the provinces with predictable and assured funding. 
To demonstrate the federal government's commitment to the health 
system, a cash floor of $11 billion in cash transfers has been 
guaranteed over the next five years and then will grow accordingly 
to ensure that funding will not be jeopardized.
<P>
	The National Forum on Health which was originally established 
by the Prime Minister to allow Canadians to express their visions 
of a more effective and efficient health care future recently brought 
forward its recommendations. The forum concluded that the health 
care system is fundamentally sound and adequately funded. 
However, it did note that its usefulness in various areas could be 
improved.
<P>
	In response to the forum and its findings, the 1997 budget 
allocates an additional $300 million over the next three years for 
health initiatives. To break down the moneys that have been 
rationed, $50 million will go toward the creation of a new Canada 
health information system to provide Canadians with the best 
medical information and the latest developments regarding 
medical treatments; $150 million has also been specified for a 
health transition fund to assist the provinces to launch pilot projects 
to investigate new and better approaches to health care. These 
funds will be awarded to the provinces and territories on an equal 
per capita basis, with expenditure discussions to take place among 
Canada's ministers of health.
<P>
<B>(1610 )</B>
<P>
	There are already two active programs to help prevent health 
problems from developing: the community action program for 
children and the Canada prenatal nutrition program. The 
community action program for children  provides services to 
address the developmental needs of young children who are at risk.
<P>
	The Canada prenatal nutrition program addresses the problem of 
low birth weight babies among high risk groups such as pregnant
<P>
adolescents and women who have used alcohol and drugs. This 
budget increases the funding to these existing programs by $100 
million over the next three years.
<P>
	Canadians with disabilities face many obstacles in everyday life. 
Last year the budget doubled the assistance provided to persons 
with disabilities to a tax credit for those who provide in-home care 
for family members.
<P>
	The 1996 budget promised to review measures and opportunities 
for people with disabilities. In response to that promise, the task 
force on disabilities was created and chaired by the member for 
Fredericton-York-Sunbury. It is the government's desire to 
create a better society for all Canadians.
<P>
	Not only is the list of expenses eligible for the medical expense 
tax credit been broadened, but a new opportunities fund has been 
set up to help a significant number of Canadians with disabilities to 
help prepare, find or keep either part time or full time jobs. Every 
Canadian has the right to contribute to the economy.
<P>
	The opportunities fund will help to integrate disabled Canadians 
into the economic life of their community as well as increase their 
independence.
<P>
	In closing, may I say that in a country as vast and diverse as ours, 
it is a privilege to be able to be part of the team that outlines 
priorities and goals and achieves them. We have made some 
significant changes. I am confident that by maintaining our 
practice we will continue to face and meet the challenges that lie 
ahead of us.
<P>
	It is with these sentiments that I fully intend to vote in favour of 
Bill C-93, an act to implement certain provisions of the 1997 
budget.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak to the budget 
implementation bill.
<P>
	We had a very clear picture this past week-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Pardon me, but I believe, since we are 
taking turns, that it is now the turn of the Reform Party.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Our member 
would like to speak.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a real pleasure to try and speak to this bill. I am 
completely confused.
<P>
	It is really quite incredible to sit here and listen to this debate 
today on Bill C-93. It strikes me as more than a  little odd that in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9566"> 9566 </A></B>
<P>
just about the last two and a half hours we have managed to move 
ahead about a year and a half. About two and a half hours ago we 
were debating Bill C-92 which dealt with implementing certain 
aspects of the 1996 budget. Here we are now moving at the speed of 
light and dealing with Bill C-93 and the implementation of certain 
facets of the 1997 budget. We are moving ahead very quickly.
<P>
	In replying to this legislation, I noticed that once again the 
Liberal government is doing exactly the same thing that it has 
become renowned for doing over the past three and a half years. It 
is using every procedural tactic possible to stifle debate in the 
House of Commons, particularly today. Rather than face the public 
honestly and try to shut down debate as it normally does with time 
allocation, it has opted to use another procedure and shuffle these 
two bills off to committee, regardless of the fact that the principle 
of these bills has already been decided. I listened to a couple of 
Liberal members make their presentations. The hon. member for 
Durham said something to the effect that it has taken us a long time 
to get to where we are today.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Three years.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Exactly. That is what 
I was going to say. It is not such a long time to a lot of Canadians. 
Canadians can remember back to balanced budgets. Canadians can 
remember back to a time when, even though wages were 
substantially lower, they had a lot more of their income at their 
disposal at the end of the day.
<P>
	The hon. member for Durham went on to say that he came here 
to improve the financial situation. He spoke in glowing terms of 
how he was so proud of the Liberal record over the past 3.5 years. 
The budget we are talking about in Bill C-93 is the fourth budget 
since the Liberals came to power following the 1993 election. He 
spoke as though he was quite proud.
<P>
	I wonder if Canadians watching the debate today are equally 
proud of another $111 billion worth of debt. The Liberals do not 
talk about that. They do not talk about the fact that interest on the 
debt is by far the single largest expenditure for the federal 
government and for taxpayers.
<P>
	When we talk about the federal government it is important to 
understand there is only one taxpayer in the country. One person is 
paying the bill. Some seem to operate under an illusion in this 
place. They are insulated. They think the government is providing 
these services and programs. They turn to government to look for 
direction and for hope for the future when in reality it is the people 
of the country who are providing all this for themselves. 
Sometimes the old parties seem to forget this fundamental fact.
<P>
	The Liberal member for Huron-Bruce talked about two of the 
goals the Liberals had when they were elected in 1993. It was job 
growth and controlling the deficit. Once again the hon. member, as 
did his previous colleagues, spoke in glowing terms of how far we 
have come.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Schmidt:</B> With 1.5 million unemployed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Exactly. Why are 1.5 
million people still unemployed if the Liberals have done such a 
great job of jobs, jobs, jobs? That was one of their big promises.
<P>
	Let us look at their two big promises in the 1993 election. One 
was jobs, jobs, jobs. We have 1.5 million people unemployed or 
two million to three million unemployed people with the ones out 
there who have given up looking for work. They have simply given 
up and are no longer even included in the unemployment statistics. 
There is no hope left in them to be out there seeking a job. Why are 
they so proud of that?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Schmidt:</B> Are they proud of their tax increases too?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> That is right. They 
talk about the fact that there have been no tax increases. When they 
were on this side of the House they very clearly understood there 
were two ways to increase taxation. There is the honest way, where 
they increase the tax rate and take the heat from it publicly. Or, 
there is the sneaky way where they do it by plugging some 
so-called tax loopholes and with excise taxes and other such taxes. 
That is the way the government has opted to go.
<P>
	I do not believe for a minute Canadian people will to be fooled 
by this, not for a minute. It is them at the end of the day, the end of 
the week and the end of the month who have less and less money to 
spend on essentials: food, homes, gasoline for their vehicle to get 
to and from work, and raising their children.
<P>
	We must look at the real facts if we are to discuss the 1997 
budget and the deficit. Both Liberal members across the way 
revealed quite correctly that the deficit had come down from $42 
billion when they came to power in 1993 to somewhere in the 
neighbourhood of $19 billion today.
<P>
<B>(1620 )</B>
<P>
	They look at that and say: ``What a wonderful achievement. We 
are on the road to victory''. Let us look at how that was 
accomplished. It was accomplished by $24 billion in increased tax 
revenue achieved in a number of ways. I spoke two hours ago to the 
1996 budget and referred to the fact that a substantial amount of the 
increase was because of something called bracket creep.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> The finance minister?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9567"> 9567 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> No, not the finance 
minister. There is a system of bracket creep. When the Liberals 
got into government they refused to index to the inflation rate, 
even though they complained about it when they were in 
opposition and the Tories were doing this type of thing. It is a 
sneaky way to increase tax revenue. They complained about it very 
volubly when they were on this side. When they got over to the 
other side they recognized it was a way in which to continue to 
gather in more and more tax dollars from Canadians, $24 billion 
more annually than when they took office. They have cut $7 
billion from the Canada health and social transfer.
<P>
	In Bill C-93 they are talking about the Canadian Foundation for 
Innovation, an $800 million program over five years. They talk 
about it as though it will be the answer. They hold it up as the be all 
and end all. The fact of the matter is that hospitals have closed and 
highly trained and skilled doctors have moved to other countries 
because there are not the opportunities here there should be, due to 
their cuts.
<P>
	They have cut $7 billion on one side but on the other side they 
will initiate a few small new programs. I suspect they will be 
highly bureaucratic programs. The Liberals are talking about a 
board of 15 new patronage appointments that will necessary to 
operate the organization. That is typical of the government. That 
too highlights the problems and the differences.
<P>
	As Canadians head toward the next election the choice will to be 
increasingly clear. They can choose big government, big spending, 
big taxes, big bureaucracy, more and more government intrusion 
into their everyday lives, or they can choose smaller government, 
balanced budgets and lower spending and tax cuts. That will be 
their choices. It will be made very clear as we go into the next 
election.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> My apologies. Now it is really the turn of 
the hon. member for Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am very pleased to finally be able to speak to the bill on 
budget implementation.
<P>
	In this bill we find more of the smoke and mirrors the 
government has been using on the whole issue of fighting the 
deficit. For a long time now, the federal government has been 
claiming that it has been fighting the deficit effectively. Yet it must 
be seen-and this is something the people of my riding have 
understood, and are telling me-that the federal government has 
fought the deficit in the following way: it let the surplus in the 
employment insurance fund build up, deciding to take out $2 
billion in the next five years and reinject only $800 million. This 
means a deficit of $1.2 billion at a time when we need  all the 
incentives we can get to create employment. There is no 
adjustment included in the present bill.
<P>
	What is more, transfer payments are being cut. Today, all of the 
provinces, Quebec, Ontario, the others, are faced with problems 
that require them to make major cuts in health and education. This 
is always the result of actions by the federal government.
<P>
	This past week we learned that the federal government has not 
cleaned up its own act. Since 1994, the objective had been to 
reduce expenditures in the order of 19 per cent. Today we see that 
the reduction has been about 9 per cent. So there is another 10 per 
cent that has not been saved.
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
	We are talking about $8 billion worth of expenditures. If this 
amount had actually been saved, the government could have taken 
the pressure off the employment insurance fund and arranged for 
more money to be invested in business. When we talk about the 
transition job creation fund, about money from the employment 
insurance fund that is invested in projects, it could put a lot more 
into those projects than is now the case. The current problem stems 
from the government's decision to use the employment insurance 
surplus to pay off the deficit.
<P>
	So the government aimed at the wrong target. It decided to fight 
the deficit. That is fine, but meanwhile, it could have taken more 
decisive steps in this year's budget to ensure that employment is 
again a priority, but there is no indication of this, and certainly not 
among Reform Party members who are being most unruly today.
<P>
	So the priority that should have been set on employment is 
missing from this budget. People were waiting for some kind of 
action, for instance if we consider the government's procurement 
policies, this morning the government released the report of the 
parliamentary committee on government operations. After three 
and a half years in power, not one year but three and a half, we can 
say that this government is not effective, lacks openness in its 
procurement policies and does not use those policies to assist 
regional development across Canada.
<P>
	I think that is inconceivable. The report as such is interesting, 
although it should have been tabled three years ago. The 
government should have taken steps two and a half years ago. This 
year, the budget should have contained measures to change the 
government's procurement policies, so that the negative impact of 
employment insurance reform on eastern Quebec and the 
maritimes could be compensated by meaningful expenditures, 
including government procurement, something that is sadly 
lacking.
<P>
	There is no significant action on research and development. How 
will regional economies that need to diversify be able to meet the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9568"> 9568 </A></B>
<P>
challenges of the 21st  century? They must be given a chance to 
transform their economy, to include research and development in 
the agri-food sector, for instance. There is room in secondary and 
tertiary processing for developing products that will be successful 
on foreign markets, which means they would not be stuck with 
primary processing where there are far fewer jobs today than was 
the case 20 years ago.
<P>
	In agriculture, the future is in processing. We must keep 
producing primary products, but we must ensure that they are 
subsequently processed in this country so we can sell them in that 
form on American and European markets and throughout the 
world.
<P>
	So, there is nothing dynamic in the present budget or in the 
practical applications.
<P>
	The member for Matapédia-Matane pointed out to me that the 
approach to the forestry industry could have been very different so 
as to permit an improvement.
<P>
	In connection with the new policy on U.S.-Canada relations, 
quotas were imposed on lumber exports. There is however a major 
new market to be developed and that is for wood which has been 
processed and which is not subject to quotas. If the processing 
industry is developed, it would mean increased exports to the 
United States, which are not limited by quotas. This paves the way 
for initiative, for original ideas. It provides a breath of fresh air to 
those who have come up with ideas in our regions to develop 
processing companies and development incentives. This will surely 
be one of the issues in the upcoming federal election, with people 
wanting to know what each party has to offer.
<P>
	There was none of the originality we might have expected. Here 
in Parliament, the official opposition is often the source of 
originality, as we have seen in documents such as those tabled on 
tax reform and the RRSP employment proposal, which could have 
been included in the budget. But there is nothing like this.
<P>
	The budget implementation policies are rather like the budget. 
We could describe the budget as neutral, rather lazy, failing to aim 
at the real target, unemployment. It should help us attain our 
objectives by creating jobs and breathing new life into our regional 
economies.
<P>
<B>(1630)</B>
<P>
	In the last part of this presentation, I would like to talk more 
specifically about a different problem, that of American pensions. 
Yesterday, the minister made an interesting announcement. It was 
the result of the efforts of members of pretty well every party, I 
think. In particular, I would mention those of the member for 
Bellechasse, with whom I set up a non-partisan committee to 
propose solutions to the minister, of the member for Windsor-St. 
Clair and of the Solicitor General, whose efforts I am aware of.
<P>
	Once the new agreement between Canada and the United States 
is ratified, the situation will finally be  corrected. In the meantime, 
however, one thing has not been corrected and could be in 
legislation to implement the budget, such as this. The federal 
government could have made an advance available to people who 
were penalized by the Americans' deduction of 25 per cent income 
tax from all American pensions. It often amounts to $1,000, $1,500 
or $2,000, but it is money that enables people to buy food and pay 
the rent.
<P>
	If the agreement is not ratified until January 1998, low-income 
people will have lived two full years with 25 per cent less than what 
they should have received. I think the government should go the 
extra step and provide advances so that people on limited incomes 
have at least 50 or 60 per cent of the money they should normally 
have. It could have done so through a bill like this one. Perhaps it is 
not too late. Perhaps the government could bring in an amendment 
to this effect, so as to put a lid on the inequity created by the change 
made to the tax treaty.
<P>
	Once the U.S. Senate has ratified the agreement and the 
Canadian government has done so in keeping with the 
announcement made yesterday, the problem will be resolved, but in 
the meantime, there are people on very low incomes who will be 
forced to cut back on necessities for two years or two and half 
years, after which time they will receive a cheque covering the past 
two years. Why does the federal government not show some 
consideration and quickly give these people an advance?
<P>
	These days, people are paying for mistakes made by 
governments when it should be the other way around. I would 
therefore ask the government to do that and to be more effective 
than it has been in reducing the deficit, to show more foresight than 
it has in curbing unemployment and, as far as American pensions 
are concerned, to show some consideration and take action to settle 
the problem once and for all.
<P>
	In closing, it seems to me that the federal government still has a 
long way to go in terms of addressing the unemployment problem. 
The active measures one would have expected are nowhere to be 
seen, and that is probably the issue on which this government will 
be judged most harshly by the people in the next federal election.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise for a short while to address some of the issues. 
Earlier this day the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Finance laid out some of the principal provisions of Bill C-93.
<P>
	He referred to the issues of science research and development, in 
particular the Canada Foundation for Innovation. He outlined a 
program where the government would put as much as $800 million 
over a five-year period into this important sector. The investment 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9569"> 9569 </A></B>
<P>
followed a pattern the government has used  in other programs 
where partnerships can be developed. It is expected-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Has he already spoken?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Szabo:</B> The member is wondering whether I have spoken. 
That was on Bill C-92. I know they enjoyed that one. The member 
was wondering whether I had anything else to say on RRSPs and 
was after some tax planning tips.
<P>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
	With regard to the elimination of the seven-year limit on the 
carry forward of unused RRSPs, the member knows that young 
people who are cash poor in the early years will be able to 
contribute. The statistics show that contributors to RRSPs make the 
majority of their contributions after age 45. Certainly that 
opportunity is an important aspect which I left out in my speech on 
Bill C-92.
<P>
	As the member knows, neither one of us care for Garth Turner's 
rationalizations of why would should buy RRSPs from him.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keyes:</B> No, no.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Szabo:</B> I hear the member. If he had heard the speech he 
would well know the reason he is pushing RRSPs is to earn 
enormous commissions without providing his clients the kind of 
information they really need to know. It is not only how to get 
money into an RRSP. It is how to tax plan to get it out at the lowest 
effective tax cost to the taxpayer and to the family. That is an 
important issue.
<P>
	The rat fink phone line to turn in taxpayers is quite a draconian 
and extreme measure.
<P>
	Bill C-93 is related to some extent to Bill C-92. It deals 
ostensibly with the provisions of the budget of February 18. The 
parliamentary secretary raised some extremely important issues 
with regard to EI and the relief to be given to businesses with 
premiums of less than $60,000. There was to be a grace period for 
EI premiums for new employees, an important aspect with regard 
to the overall strategy of the government in promoting economic 
growth and jobs for Canadians. The subsequent reduction of EI 
premiums for businesses is estimated to create an additional 20,000 
jobs.
<P>
	These kinds of elements in the budget brought down by the hon. 
Minister of Finance continue to show the commitment of the 
government to the growth of jobs for Canadians. As he has said and 
as the Prime Minister said on many occasions, as long as there is 
one Canadian out there who wants to work and who has not had an 
opportunity for a job they will continue to look for opportunities to 
promote an environment which will provide those essential jobs.
<P>
	I cannot help but comment on the plight of young people. They 
are in a situation where they are competing for their first jobs with 
people who have already been in  the labour force for many years 
because of the number of jobs that were lost, particularly the entry 
level jobs. It is an extremely serious situation for young people 
because it is not their fault. They have the education to a great 
extent and are looking for a chance.
<P>
	In terms of its work with the provinces, internship and 
apprenticeship programs and other partnerships will tend to create 
the foundation that is essential to providing important jobs.
<P>
	I have a message for young people, particularly those in high 
school. I have done a little of research since becoming a member of 
Parliament. I have spoken to the Peel Board of Education about the 
percentage of dropouts in high school. I was astounded to find out 
there were no hard and fast statistics because of re-entry into high 
school by people who formerly dropped out.
<P>
	There are some rationalizations that somehow someone who has 
dropped out and comes back in and completes high school is just as 
successful as those who start and complete their high school 
education.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	We can imagine the condition of young people's lives vis-à-vis 
their families when they have taken the decision to drop out before 
finishing high school. I imagine the parents feel sadness that their 
children did not have the motivation, support or whatever it was at 
a time when they really needed it and when it was so important for 
them to continue school.
<P>
	People who have not finished high school have a tremendous 
problem finding that entry level position. We cannot expect small 
businesses that are struggling to compete to hire high school 
dropouts. Those jobs are gone in the new high tech global 
economy. Canada's role is to provide knowledge based jobs. Our 
young people have to understand that for them to earn a spot in the 
labour force it is essential that they as a minimum complete their 
high school education.
<P>
	As an aside I pass on to young people that if there is anything 
they could possibly do, they must continue their education through 
high school. Hopefully they will find the motivation and a linkage 
to a community college or some other opportunity to develop their 
skills and talents. Every Canadian has something to contribute to a 
knowledge based economy if they would only invest a little of their 
time in its development.
<P>
	In this last portion I would simply like to make a couple of 
comments about the child tax benefit. Members will know that 
some years ago there was an item called family allowance. Family 
allowance was a universal benefit given to all Canadians regardless 
of income. That changed over time. We now have a child tax 
benefit. It is effectively income tested. It provides assistance 
effectively to those with children who are in need.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9570"> 9570 </A></B>
<P>
	The budget provides for an enrichment of the child tax benefit. 
As the parliamentary secretary laid out, the benefit for a couple 
with one child would be $1,625; for two children, $3,050; and for 
every additional child over two, $1,425.
<P>
	The House has talked about an issue called a caregiver tax credit. 
It is a concept where we are looking for opportunities to provide 
financial or tax assistance to families who choose to provide care in 
the home not only to preschool children but also the chronically ill, 
the aged or the disabled.
<P>
	The enrichment of the child tax benefit goes a long way to 
improving the support we have given to families with children. I 
continue to advocate on behalf of my constituents that the finance 
minister and all colleagues of the House look for ways to continue 
to enrich the support we should be giving to families who need 
help.
<P>
	We will have an opportunity to talk about this issue much more. I 
simply wanted to reiterate the importance of the enrichment of the 
child tax benefit to assist families. I appreciate the opportunity to 
have participated in the debate on Bill C-93 and urge all members 
to support it.

<BLOCKQUOTE>``(<I>a</I>.1) transfer all or any portion of its policies to, or cause itself to be reinsured, on

transact the classes of insurance to be so transferred or reinsured.''</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to address this important 
measure, Bill C-82, at report stage. The official opposition is 
basically proposing three amendments to the legislation before us 
today.
<P>
	The first amendment concerns clause 42, in which the federal 
government seeks to regulate financial services. We propose that 
the government take into account the fact that financial services 
come under the exclusive jurisdiction of the provinces. This is the 
purpose of our first amendment.
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	The second amendment also relates to the federal government's 
intention to take action regarding tied selling and consumer 
protection. Again, in our second amendment, which deals with 
clause 55, we suggest to the federal government that, when 
provincial legislation applies to consumer protection, tied selling 
or other issues, such legislation should be complied with by 
financial institutions.
<P>
	Our third amendment, which we feel is the most important one 
for Quebec and all Canadian provinces, concern clause 226. Clause 
226 provides that it is not possible for a provincially chartered 
insurance company to purchase any portion of insurance policies or 
transactions from insurance companies operating under a federal 
charter.
<P>
	For example, a Quebec insurance company such as l'Entraide, 
which is mentioned in today's edition of the daily <I>Le Soleil</I>, cannot, 
under federal legislation on financial institutions, make such 
purchases, since it has a provincial charter, and it cannot purchase a 
federally chartered company. By contrast, a federally chartered 
company can purchase any portion of insurance policies or 
transactions from another company that also operates under a 
federal charter.
<P>
	There is no longer any justification for this barrier in the context 
of a free competitive market. This situation is unfair to Quebec 
insurance companies for two main reasons.
<P>
	First of all, they cannot freely enter into transactions with 
another insurance company that is federally regulated, even to 
purchase a block of policies that are all held by Quebec policy 
holders. No one has control over his own affairs under this bill.
<P>
	Second, it is contrary to the spirit of NAFTA and of any 
agreement concerning international trade, as well as financial 
services. Treatment under this bill and under section 226 that is still 
in force today is more favourable to foreign insurance companies, 
which are, for the most part, federally chartered, than to 
provincially chartered Quebec and Canadian insurance companies. 
A French federally chartered insurance company, for example, 
could buy a block of insurance policies from a Canadian federally 
chartered company that decided to go out of business.
<P>
	It would be the same for an insurance company from Brazil or 
the United States-name any country in the world-that was, and 
usually is, federally chartered. It could buy a block of insurance 
policies from a federally chartered insurance company operating in 
Quebec that decided to wind up its operations. A provincially 
chartered Quebec company cannot do the same, and this is 
completely unacceptable.
<P>
	The federal government is using consumer protection as an 
excuse not to eliminate this discrimination. Why  would consumers 
be better protected in a situation that allowed federally chartered 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9572"> 9572 </A></B>
<P>
insurance companies to buy insurance policies from another 
federally chartered company, but consumer protection is no longer 
an issue when a provincial company decides to buy this same block 
of insurance policies?
<P>
	We are not in a developing country when it comes to financial 
institutions or the insurance sector. We have institutions in place, in 
Quebec and elsewhere, and the Inspector General of Financial 
Institutions is responsible for the security and proper operation of 
financial markets.
<P>
	There is also CompCorp-the Canadian Life and Health 
Insurance Compensation Corporation. This corporation requires a 
high degree of solvency of all insurance companies, whether under 
provincial or federal charter. They must be solvent and their 
solvency is verified annually. The corporation also requires these 
companies to keep reserves in the event of compensation, and is 
also responsible for the final payment of compensation if a 
company has the misfortune to go bankrupt.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	Consumers have ample protection, whether we are talking about 
transactions involving an insurance company under a provincial or 
a federal charter. So the argument that the consumer must be 
protected does not hold water, especially since we have a situation 
that is discriminatory. As I said earlier, a Quebec company has 
fewer rights than a foreign company with respect to acquiring a 
block of insurance policies in order to expand and be able to deal 
with globalization and fierce competition in the insurance sector.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance today, in response to one of my 
questions, was quite forthcoming when he said he would like to 
meet the official opposition critic and people from the industry, 
including representatives of the Entraide insurance company, to 
discuss ways to amend the legislation.
<P>
	I commend the minister on his open minded approach, but I 
would appreciate it even more if he would accept the amendment 
we are proposing, which consists in allowing insurance companies 
under a provincial charter to acquire blocks of insurance policies or 
to acquire, in part or in whole, the business of an insurance 
company active in Quebec under a federal charter.
<P>
	In fact we discussed all this with the Quebec Minister of Finance 
who is willing to make certain concessions so that the federal 
government could move on this amendment from the Bloc 
Quebecois. Mr. Landry, the Quebec Finance Minister, said that the 
Quebec legislation on trust companies and credit unions is in some 
ways discriminatory, but it is the reverse of the kind of 
discrimination we mentioned today, in other words, companies 
with a provincial charter may only acquire  part of the business of 
other provincially regulated companies but not of a company 
operating under a federal charter. The Quebec Finance Minister is 
prepared to go part of the way toward amending the Quebec 
legislation, if the Minister of Finance accepts the amendment 
proposed by the Bloc Quebecois that would allow this type of 
transaction.
<P>
	I think this is an interesting proposal, and I also think that this 
government, and especially the Minister of Finance, who call 
themselves apostles of free trade, should realize that on the eve of 
the 21st century, this kind of discrimination makes no sense at all, 
especially when we consider what we are losing as a result.
<P>
	There are at least two provincially regulated insurance 
companies in Quebec which would be forced at this time to expand, 
to rationalize, to become more efficient, because of this type of 
discrimination in the Financial Institutions Act, and the challenges 
of globalization and rationalization that have been in place for the 
past ten years.
<P>
	It is perhaps time for the other side to make a move and we are 
offering our full co-operation to the Minister of Finance so that we 
may get Bill C-82 through rapidly, if he will accept the 
amendments we are proposing to him, in particular the one 
allowing provincially regulated insurance companies to rationalize 
and have transactions with federally regulated companies.
<P>
	It would be only logical to do so, and in my opinion the matter of 
consumer protection has been resolved. The consumer is protected 
by recognized institutions which are, let us keep in mind, within an 
area of jurisdiction that is exclusive to the provinces. All that is left 
to do is for the other side of this House to show some good will. 
Next week the Minister of Finance can, when the bill is passed on 
second reading, acknowledge the value of our arguments and claim 
to be a true defender of the economic interests of Quebec.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak to this first 
group of motions which have been moved by the official 
opposition. I would like to speak to each of them in order.
<P>
	Motion No. 1 deals with financial planning and the suggestion 
that the act be amended to provide that where there is any 
provincial regulation on the provision of financial planning 
services, that provincial regulations shall override the Bank Act.
<P>
<B>(1700 )</B>
<P>
	I want to clarify first of all that the amendment is proposed in 
respect of section 410(3) which deals only with the right to make 
regulations in respect of new in house services, for instance 
provision of information processing services and specialized 
financing services.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9573"> 9573 </A></B>
<P>
	The right to make regulations about the provision of financial 
planning services by banks was introduced in the 1992 Bank Act 
and is not being changed by Bill C-82. That being said, I think 
what underlies this motion is the suggestion that the federal 
government, federal regulators in the Bank Act, have no place 
whatsoever in the area of financial planning and regulations with 
respect to financial planning.
<P>
	It would simply be untenable if the Bank Act and other financial 
institutions legislation which regulate financially chartered 
institutions were not to be able to control the scope of powers of 
those institutions. It is simply unacceptable to carve out certain 
powers and say you cannot deal with those powers with respect to a 
federal institution. Clearly concomitant with the right to regulate 
certain institutions is to regulate the scope of the powers of those 
institutions.
<P>
	With respect to the second motion with respect to privacy and 
the proposal from the official opposition that where there is any 
provincial regulation on privacy it shall override the Bank Act, I 
also understand that but I think consumers understand that they are 
better off that this area of privacy and consumer protection is a 
matter of shared jurisdiction between the provinces and the federal 
government when it comes to financial institutions and consumers 
are the better for it.
<P>
	The last motion that was just brought forward by the official 
opposition deals with the transfer of blocks of business between 
insurance companies. The proposal has been made that the act be 
amended to permit the Minister of Finance to allow transfers of 
blocks of insurance business from federally regulated companies to 
provincially regulated companies.
<P>
	Again, I understand the motivation for the recommendation of 
this change. Indeed it is something that officials are looking at. 
Today in question period one of the hon. members from the official 
opposition asked the Minister of Finance if he could proceed and 
make this change at this time. The Minister of Finance indicated he 
was open to considering such a change but that officials still had 
work to do.
<P>
	We have several concerns before we would agree to such a 
change. Among them is the protection of policy holders and the 
safety, soundness and prudence of the regulatory system. It is a 
complex matter. Under current law transfers of blocks of insurance 
policies that are purchased by one company from another are not 
permitted when one of those companies, the seller, the vendor, is a 
federally regulated company and the purchaser, for instance, is a 
provincially regulated company. The reason for that relates, as I 
said, to the protection of customers and solvency of federally 
regulated companies. It is essential in a transfer situation that the 
same supervisor continue monitoring not only the transferring 
company but the acquiring company.
<P>
	If financial difficulties were to arise the superintendent would 
have the information to take effective action by ordering both
<P>
companies to take appropriate measures. This may not be able to be 
done if the acquiring company is not under the supervision of the 
superintendent.
<P>
	I want to focus on some of the problems. That is not to say they 
are insurmountable. Indeed, as I said a moment ago, federal 
officials are looking at this suggestion and shortly, if the questions 
that we have about safety, soundness and consumer protection can 
be addressed, I could foresee a change along these lines being 
made, but we are not there yet.
<P>
	I just want to end by saying that Bill C-82, the financial services 
legislation, contains many important changes for the financial 
services sector and in particular the insurance sector. We have been 
responsive to many of the proposals that were brought to this 
government before the preparation of the white paper and the 
consultations that took place after the white paper before the 
finance committee reflected, and these responses are reflected in 
this bill.
<P>
<B>(1705 )</B>
<P>
	To be fair, this request for the federal Minister of Finance to 
grant the discretion to allow these transfers between federally 
regulated and provincially regulated companies was not something 
that was brought forward by the industry during these consultations 
as a priority for the changes it wanted to see in this round. It has 
been brought to our attention at the 11th hour by certain insurers in 
the industry and it is a valid suggestion that we should look at, but 
we must take the time to look at it so we can assure ourselves that 
prudence and consumer protection are addressed. We are going to 
do that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Schmidt:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a question of clarification. I

<BLOCKQUOTE>Motion No. 2</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-82 be amended by deleting Clause 45.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Motion No. 4</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-82, in Clause 55, be amended by deleting lines 19 to 42 on page 31 
and lines 1 to 10 on page 32.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Motion No. 6</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-82, in Clause 412, be amended by replacing lines 18 to 22 on page 
254 with the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``Governor in Council.''</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I wish to speak to these amendments and 
to refer briefly to the hon. parliamentary secretary with regard to 
Bill C-82 covering a number of financial institutions. I think that is 
correct, a number of the wishes were put into place, a marked 
improvement forward.
<P>
	However, the sections I am referring to, essentially clause 45, 
part of clause 55 and the subsequent amendment to clause 412, are 
there for a very specific reason which has to do with tied selling. 
Tied selling means to sell one product on the condition that another 
product be purchased. In other words, in the case of getting a 
mortgage from an institution you would get that mortgage only on 
the condition that you also brought your RRSPs or other kinds of 
things to that institution, which could be a bank, credit union, trust 
company or whatever the case.
<P>
	The difficulty is that the individual once having made 
application for loan and wanting that loan has no choice. That is 
where the issue lies and this is where we want to come to grips with 
this matter.
<P>
	I draw this to the attention of the House. The government has 
indicated that it would pass this legislation at this time but that it 
would not proclaim these two sections of the act until September 
1998. That proposes a very interesting dilemma. If the issue is that 
this should be done now, then why would one delay this thing? The 
rationale given was that it has to be given to the finance committee 
so it can study in depth the implications of tied selling in the world 
of financial business.
<P>
	All the rest of this was done in consultation with industry and 
was subjected to an in depth study. Now apparently this issue 
requires further study but in the meantime the government will 
pass legislation to permit institutions to do it. There seems to be a 
certain lack of logic in this procedure.
<P>
	I am so concerned about this issue because it is not in the 
interests of the consumer. There are people who would argue this is 
of particular interest to certain vested interests in the financial 
sector.
<P>
<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
	I submit that the interest is the consumer and the protection of 
the consumer. I draw to members' attention the comments that 
were made by the director of government relations of the Insurance 
Bureau of Canada when he appeared before the committee: ``If 
there is an area where the committee may choose to make Bill C-82 
an even better piece of legislation, it is with respect to the tied 
selling provisions proposed under section 459.1 of the Bank Act. 
Our view is that subsections (2) and (3) have been worded too 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9575"> 9575 </A></B>
<P>
broadly and may permit the  bundling of certain bank products and 
other financial services in a way that may not be beneficial to 
consumers''.
<P>
	That is the crux of the issue. It is not only our view but it is the 
view of the Insurance Bureau of Canada and the member 
companies. It is also the view of the Insurance Brokers Association 
of Canada, which has written a similar letter on this issue.
<P>
	The matter goes even further when we get into the statement: 
``The finance committee is also expected to assess ways to make a 
distinction between cross-selling and practices anti-competitive or 
coercive ones. The distinction between what is and what is not 
acceptable could be, we are told, reflected in future regulations. If 
our understanding is correct, it implies that the proposed 
interpretive amendments to section 459.1(2) and (3) of the Bank 
Act may be deleted or modified to reflect the finance committee's 
findings and recommendations''.
<P>
	What are the implications of tied selling that make me concerned 
and that show why these provisions are not in the interests of the 
consumer? Probably the primary issue here is the matter of forcing 
consolidation of financial assets into a single institution.
<P>
	Why is this significant? In this case we are dealing only with 
banks. It should apply to other institutions as well but the act refers 
here only to banks. They could precipitate a change in loan status, 
credit lines and so on based on the customer information available 
to them from information that may be existent in a subsidiary.
<P>
	We were told before the committee by the Canadian Bankers' 
Association that the bank would never use information from its 
health insurance subsidiary or their life insurance subsidiary to in 
any way influence what would happen in terms of this issue.
<P>
	Let me read the policy statement that exists in one of the 
subsidiaries of one of our six major banks. This is written to clients 
of this subsidiary: ``In respect of the law the officers and 
employees must scrupulously observe in letter and spirit all laws 
governing business and securities activities. Confidentiality of 
client information is a fundamental principle of our firm. No 
employee may release confidential client information unless 
required by law or with the client's consent''.
<P>
	Then there is assurance that the subsidiary is wholly owned 
subsidiary of the bank and the bank guarantees all the liabilities of 
the subsidiary.
<P>
	Now comes the key part, sharing client information. The 
subsidiary: ``May give confidential client information to the bank. 
This type of information includes a client's name, address, phone 
number, income, assets, debts, investment objectives and financial 
plans''.
<P>
	The bank may use this information for the following purposes: to 
sell its services to the client; to survey the relationship between the 
subsidiaries and their clients; to  determine the amount of debt 
outstanding to the subsidiary and to the bank; for any other purpose 
about which the subsidiary will inform the client in writing. That is 
the clincher.
<P>
	What is excluded? Nothing. The bank will not pass this 
information to anyone else. Notice under the heading of consent: 
``By opening an account with this subsidiary, you are consenting to 
the bank's use of the information. If you want to end this consent, 
you must give written notice to the subsidiary, addressed and 
delivered to your subsidiary's branch. Your notice will be in effect 
when you receive a written acknowledgement from that subsidiary. 
The subsidiary may then decide to close your account if you said 
you wanted to withdraw this consent, and give you at least 30 days 
written notice before doing so. They will assume that you have 
received this notice five days after it was mailed''.
<P>
<B>(1715)</B>
<P>
	If that is not a clear indication of how the information in a 
subsidiary may become the information available to another 
subsidiary or the bank, I would like to know what could be clearer 
than that.
<P>
	That is one of the reasons confidentiality of information and 
consolidation of all of one's financial assets under one bank could 
be very serious if one of these businesses or certain parts of the 
enterprises get into difficulty.
<P>
	There is another reason this is not in the best interest of the 
consumer. The point has been made, which is precisely what 
subsection 459.1(2) states, that preferred rates may be given on the 
condition that certain other products and services be purchased 
from a particular person. Preferred rates are given.
<P>
	What does this suggest? It seems to me that we all know about 
lost leaders. It is certainly possible for a financial institution, in this 
instance a bank, to provide the individual a preferred rate, perhaps 
even a preferred rate in RSP purchases or in terms of negotiating 
securities. Then, once the business is consolidated under one roof, 
it could simply say: ``Guess what? Our costs have gone up and we 
are going to have to increase the price of these services to you''.
<P>
	It is certain price fixing and a certain monopoly position 
vis-à-vis a particular customer that may not be in the interest of the 
consumer.
<P>
	Finally and probably the most significant part is to recognize 
that we in this country need freedom. We need freedom of choice, 
fairness and equality. If the government wants to declare its support 
for consumers in the first instance, to support growth and 
development of small business and to maintain strong, stable and 
viable financial institutions like banks, it will support these 
amendments.
<P>

<HR>
<B><A NAME="9576"> 9576 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member opposite 
for his work on the bill. He has been tireless in his efforts at the 
finance committee. Once again he is trying to bring forward 
amendments in the House which I am sure he thinks will improve 
the bill.
<P>
	We have taken a very long time to look at the needs of the 
financial services sector and to respond. Major amendments were 
introduced in 1992. Up to that time it had been traditional to amend 
the Bank Act and related statutes in the sector every 10 years. 
Because of the nature of the changes introduced in 1992 it was 
decided to review those changes in five years, in 1997.
<P>
	Consultations were conducted. A white paper was issued. 
Discussions were held on the white paper. Hearings were held by 
the finance committee of the House of Commons and by the Senate 
banking committee. The government took time to reflect on the 
consultations and legislation issued. It has been debated in the 
House. It was again debated at committee. We now find ourselves 
at this stage very close to moving forward with what is essentially a 
bill that does some minor tinkering with financial services statutes 
because of the major overhaul that was done. The conclusion the 
government came to was that many of the changes put in place in 
1992 were still being absorbed by the sector. It would be unfair to 
Canadians and unfair to the sector to once again make major 
changes. The bill before us today deals with a host of issues 
responsive to needs to make the sector more efficient, more 
accountable and more responsive to the concerns consumers have 
addressed.
<P>
<B>(1720)</B>
<P>
	I digress for a moment to say the government announced the 
creation of a task force on financial services to look ahead to the 
21st century and to ask some fundamental questions about the 
shape of the sector for the next century. How will it continue to 
serve the interests of Canadians while continuing to grow and 
prosper? How will it help enhance the opportunities for jobs and 
growth? What powers are required? What realities will the industry 
face?
<P>
	We cannot sit back and simply say what we have will always be 
good enough. The world changes whether we like it or not. 
Competitive factors are there whether we like it or not. Our 
financial services sector, a major engine of employment and 
investment, requires that the government take the time-and 
through the task force it is doing so-to ensure the sector is poised 
to deal with the challenges of the next century.
<P>
	The sector is often maligned in the House because it is 
misunderstood. That is not to say there is not fair criticism. There 
certainly is. We heard a great deal of it in the committee, which was 
quite legitimate, as is true of any business sector. It is a major 
employer, particularly the banks, of millions and millions of 
Canadians through  their RRSPs and their company pensions. 
Sometimes we forget that.
<P>
	Motions Nos. 2, 4 and 6 in the second group relate to the issue of 
tied selling. We heard much about tied selling before the finance 
committee during the consultation stage when we were considering 
the white paper. Allegations have been made that certain financial 
institutions engage in tied selling and that the legislative provisions 
which currently exist in the financial services laws are insufficient 
to deal with the problem.
<P>
	The committee and the government concluded that as yet there is 
insufficient evidence of the existence of tied selling as it has been 
described to us by certain parties. Therefore the government took a 
decision recently to invite the finance committee of the House of 
Commons to engage in a detailed study of tied selling in the 
financial services sector. That study will take place over the next 
year. In the interim while the study is going on, the government has 
indicated that it expects each participant or each industry group in 
the financial services sector to develop internal guidelines to deal 
with tied selling practices in this area. The government certainly 
hopes that a self-regulatory regime will develop in that sector. We 
certainly want to give it time to happen.
<P>
<B>(1725)</B>
<P>
	The hon. member opposite, knowing the party he represents, 
does not want government to rush in to regulate and not necessarily 
help the situation. We are giving the industry time because the 
industry has said: ``We can address the problem. Let us address it''. 
We are saying: ``We will stand back and let you do that''. We will 
also look at the whole area through the good work of the finance 
committee in the year ahead.
<P>
	To facilitate that we have proposed that a new tied selling 
provision, which had been proposed in the legislation originally 
tabled before the House, be suspended and not be proclaimed in 
force until a certain date in the future.
<P>
	In the interim the existing tied selling provision, whether 
adequate or inadequate, will remain in place so that we are not left 
with no provision whatsoever in the Bank Act dealing with tied 
selling.
<P>
	The government looks forward to hearing from the finance 
committee of the House of Commons with respect to its 
recommendations about the tied selling provision, what should be 
reflected in regulations under that provision, what activity should 
be described as acceptable and what activity should be prohibited.
<P>
	We are mindful of the experience of our neighbours to the south 
in the United States where there are extensive provisions dealing 
with tied selling and carve outs of acceptable activity. We do not 
want to inadvertently take away from consumers the opportunity to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9577"> 9577 </A></B>
<P>
benefit from  relationships that can happen in the market by just an 
outright prohibition at this point.
<P>
	While we appreciate the member's interest in the area, his 
concern for consumers and for the efficient functioning of the 
sector, we think we have the best situation of all. We have proposed 
the new tied selling provision and suspended it. It will be 
proclaimed in force. The government at that point will have the 
benefit of seeing how the self-regulatory regime works and the 
benefit of extensive study of the subject of tied selling throughout 
the financial services sector by the finance committee. I am sure 
the hon. member opposite will co-operate in the work of the 
finance committee.
<P>
	On behalf of the government I urge hon. members, as I did with 
respect to the first group, to reject these motions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
vehemently disagree with the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Finance.
<P>
	In his speech he indicated that the bill on financial institutions 
had been debated and was pretty close to moving forward. Those 
words mean they are not sure what they should be doing on tied 
selling. That is the clause members of the Reform Party are most 
concerned about. It is the clause that is potentially extremely 
dangerous for consumers if the bill is allowed to go through 
without clear definition and for competitors in the financial world.
<P>
	The bill affects the four pillars of the financial industry: trust 
companies, insurance companies, investment dealers and the 
banks. By far the most powerful institution of those four are the 
banks.
<P>
	The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance should 
know it is the job of government to protect those who cannot 
protect themselves, to protect against monopolies and to protect 
against unfair intrusion into competitive areas where single 
suppliers of a service are not held at a disadvantage.
<P>
	I submit that clause 45 deletes the current section in the act that 
prevents tied selling. Subsection 459.1(1) reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A bank shall not impose undue pressure on, or coerce, a person to obtain a 
product or service from a particular person, including the bank and any of its 
affiliates, as a condition for obtaining a loan from the bank.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That makes sense. I agree with that. It is the clause that basically 
says that no tied selling, no coercion and no undue pressure on the 
consumer. It protects other institutions that offer insurance and 
investments and the bank does not have the advantage.
<P>
	Then it goes to clauses 2 and 3 which my colleague from the 
Okanagan wants deleted. I support that amendment. Section 
459.1(2) confuses things more. It reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>For greater certainty, a bank may offer to make a loan to a person on more 
favourable terms or conditions than the bank would otherwise offer to a borrower, 
where the more favourable terms and conditions are offered on the condition that the 
person obtain another product or service from any particular person.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	If that does not give the banks unfair advantage, these people do 
not know what they are talking about. The bill is advocating 
volume discount. I have five products. You are coming to me for a 
mortgage. I approve your mortgage, but I say: ``Listen, I can give 
you a better rate on the mortgage if you buy an RRSP. I will give 
you an even better rate if you buy insurance on your house''. Those 
are three products. But wait a second. A trust company cannot 
provide all of those products. Insurance companies cannot provide 
all of those services. Investment dealers cannot provide mortgages. 
That is unfair.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, you are giving me a sign, but I believe the 
agreement made by the House leaders was that we would be given 
two ten-minute speeches on this today and that would be it. That is 
what the parliamentary secretary to the House leader told us. I 
believe that the Bloc agreed to that, as did the Reform Party. I 
thought I had five more minutes.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> The Speaker is bound by 
the House order that was adopted earlier this day, which provides 
that at the end of Government Orders, which is at 5.30 p.m., as the 
hon. member knows, all questions are deemed to be put and a 
recorded division deemed to be requested and deferred until 
Tuesday, April 15 at 12.30 p.m.
<P>
	If there is any other arrangement, I am unaware of it. If there is 
consent, the hon. member may continue for another five minutes. 
Otherwise, I believe the time has expired and it is my duty to 
interrupt the proceedings in accordance with the order adopted 
earlier this day.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, I was present when the negotiations 
were going on. If there is some confusion, then of course you will 
proceed to Private Members' Business, but I would like to make it 
clear and put it on the record that I still have five minutes 
remaining when this debate resumes.
<P>
	I know that the parliamentary secretary to the House leader is 
busy with other matters, but I wish he was here to clarify the 
situation because I do insist, because that was the deal, that I be 
allowed to finish this point. That is one of the things which is 
wrong with sending this stupid bill off to committee after only 
three hours of debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Campbell:</B> Mr. Speaker, in the absence of the parliamentary 
secretary to the government House leader, I was present in the 
House and I believe you may have been in the chair, Mr. Speaker, 
when the motion was discussed. If you refer to the text of the 
motion, it is clear in its terms.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9578"> 9578 </A></B>
<P>
	I think you have proceeded quite properly and that at 5.30 p.m. 
today all questions are deemed deferred until Tuesday and all 
stages of the bill which is before us, Bill C-82, will be dealt with 
at that time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not disagree with what the 
parliamentary secretary to the finance minister said. I just want to 
have it on the record and make it clear that when we continue 
government orders I will have the floor to finish my speech.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> The difficulty the hon. 
member has is that when the matter comes up again it is for a vote. 
There is no continuation of the debate except at third reading stage.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kilger:</B> Mr. Speaker, certainly everything that was 
mentioned by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Finance is correct. I fully support his view on the matter.
<P>
	However, I was also involved in the negotiations with the other 
parties and, given the co-operation of all the parties and the fact 
that the matter will be coming to a vote on Tuesday without any 
further debate, as you stated, in a spirit of co-operation I think we 
should give the member for Calgary Centre another five minutes in 
order that he may conclude his remarks. Then, of course, the vote 
will be deferred until Tuesday at 12.30 p.m.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> The House has heard the 
suggestion of the chief government whip. Is it agreed that we 
extend for five minutes at this time?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank government 
members for giving me the opportunity to finish my remarks.
<P>
	I would caution those members of the Standing Committee on 
Finance who will be considering this bill, especially with respect to 
the issue of tied selling.
<P>
	For greater certainty, we have to ensure that there is a level 
playing field for financial institutions. We have to be concerned 
that investment dealers, trust companies and insurance companies 
do not have the same rights to provide all of the services which 
banks do.
<P>
	For instance, all those money machines out there are only banks, 
Mr. Speaker. You have to have a bank account in order to use them. 
These other institutions do not have that right. If a clause is put in 
which says that the more services that one uses with the bank the 
better deal one can get on one's rate for borrowing the money, that 
is giving an unfair advantage to the banks. To me that is very clear. 
It is unfair to the other institutions.
<P>
	For the individual consumer in that particular case it might be 
fair. As my colleague from the Okanagan pointed out, there are two 
schools of thought concerning what happens when one bank or one 
institution ends up getting all the business and knows everything 
about that  person. Either that is good or that is bad. If it wants to 
pull the plug it can pull the plug.
<P>
	Clause 3 states that for greater certainty a bank or one of its 
affiliates may offer a product or service to a person on more 
favourable terms or conditions than the bank or affiliate would 
otherwise offer where the more favourable terms and conditions 
are offered on the condition that the person obtain a loan from the 
bank.
<P>
	I am confused or call me stupid, but one clause says we get rid of 
tied selling, then it is replace with this type of tied selling. That 
allows tied selling. That is not cross selling. The banks can offer 
more services, thereby if they are allowed to give discounts they 
can give greater discounts than the other institutions. Therefore, it 
becomes tied selling and people will end up dealing more with the 
banks and it is a loss of revenue or business for the other 
institutions.
<P>
	Cross selling is fine. I have applied for a business loan, they have 
approved it and then they ask me questions like ``Jim, do you need 
a mortgage? Do you need something else?''. When I tell them no, 
they say ``Okay. If you did you know we could look at it 
favourably''. That is suggestive selling. Or I just bought a house 
and they ask if I would like to get insurance on that house. Then I 
ask what is the rate. At least I get my mortgage and I am approved. 
It has nothing to do with my mortgage being conditional upon me 
also getting insurance. If they just suggest it, that is okay.
<P>
	We do not know what goes on behind closed doors, but we did 
have witnesses come before the committee and say that this kind of 
thing is done by certain bank managers who are more aggressive 
than other bank managers. The law may say one thing but the 
application of the law by individuals in the workplace might allow 
them to do another thing. If they do another thing, then we end up 
with coercive tied selling and that concerns me.
<P>
	I do not want to be a part of a 35th Parliament that passes 
something like this without proper debate, proper discussion, lots 
of witnesses in the committee so that we know exactly whether we 
are talking about cross selling or tied selling.
<P>
	Maybe somebody should put forward an amendment that would 
allow insurance companies, trust companies, investment dealers 
that want to merge to go into the banking business as well. In that 
way they can compete with the banks and we will not have these 
kinds of debates. Then whatever the bank offers as a volume 
discount for having more and more services, these other companies 
would also be in a position to do the same thing.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I want to thank you for your patience in listening to 
the different points of order. I want to thank the chief government 
whip for conceding the extra five minutes and the Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Minister  of Finance for also agreeing to allow me 
<P>

<B><A NAME="9579"> 9579 </A></B>

these few more minutes so that I can get the points across that I 
wanted to make. I thank everybody in the House.

who, on this side, he had those discussions with since I was not a

something of which I was not a part. Could he explain that?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Wappel:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
question. I had my discussions with the critic for justice for the

	<B>Mr. Jim Karygiannis (Scarborough-Agincourt, Lib.)</B> moved 
that Bill C-324, an act to amend the Income Tax Act (entertainment 
expenses), be read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.
<P>
	In light of the great co-operation that has been evident in the 
House this afternoon I am sorry to rise now just before my hon. 
colleague is about to speak, but I must rise on a point of order with 
respect to private member's bill C-324.
<P>
	I must sadly say, and I would ask you, Mr. Speaker, to rule on 
this, that the bill is not in order on the grounds that the intent of Bill 
C-324 is to increase taxes and would therefore require the tabling 
of a ways and means motion.
<P>
	I remind my hon. colleagues that such legislation requires the 
tabling of a ways and means motion which  can only be tabled by a 
minister of the government. On these grounds, I would ask,Mr. Speaker, that you rule this bill out of order. I would like to add 
that I am sorry to have to rise and do this but as a matter of the 
order of the House I felt it essential to do so lest we have a 
breakdown in the way in which those sorts of bills are brought 
forward.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I would ask you to take a position on that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, once again 
I find myself disagreeing with the parliamentary secretary on this 
issue. He well knows that we have a committee that reviews private 
members' bills. It is the job of that committee to determine whether 
or not private members' bills should go forward.
<P>
<B>(1745)</B>
<P>
	The scrutiny and review of the principles and objectives of that 
bill, whether or not they conflict with government policy, whether 
or not they should be allowed to proceed, is determined in that 
committee. Members well know that.
<P>
	This bill is at second reading. It was presented to the House. The 
government House leader had ample time and opportunity to ask 
the member to withdraw. This gentleman has worked hard to put 
forward some ideas in his suggestion. Whether we agree with it or 
not is another issue.
<P>
	This gentleman is a member of Parliament. He has followed the 
proper course and if you rule in favour of the point of order of the 
parliamentary secretary to the finance minister, you will be 
stepping on the toes of another hon. colleague.
<P>
	We should just proceed with this debate as planned and let this 
thing play itself out. The proper procedures have been followed.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I think this bill deserves our consideration, especially 
since it is not votable. In addition, the bill not being votable, the 
point made by the parliamentary secretary is irrelevant, as it will 
have no funding implications. This is simply an opportunity for this 
House to look into the matter and the desirability of taking action in 
that area.
<P>
	Not being votable, this bill will have no economic impact, but it 
will have an impact nonetheless because of the relevancy of the 
idea put forward by the hon. member.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Campbell:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a couple of points. It was 
evident in the hesitation in my earlier remarks that I am troubled to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9581"> 9581 </A></B>
<P>
be rising to object to this bill's being receivable and debatable here 
because of the hard work  of my hon. colleague which many of us 
do in trying to get private members' bills before this House.
<P>
	I do not want to interfere with that process. However, it is always 
up to you to decide whether something is in order that we are 
debating in this House.
<P>
	Notwithstanding the procedure that has been followed, it is clear 
that the sorts of bills that call for this kind of action by the 
government must be preceded by a ways and means motion which 
can be tabled only by a minister of the government.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, should you rule in favour of proceeding with this 
debate, we will proceed and debate this motion. I want to make it 
clear and have it on the record that the bill, in the government's 
view, is not properly receivable by this House because of the nature 
of the bill. I am sorry that is the outcome.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Karygiannis (Scarborough-Agincourt, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise on the same point of order. With regard to the point 
raised by my hon. colleague, I would like to make a few points 
clear.
<P>
	This bill was properly researched and drafted by the private 
members' business office which, I assure members of the House, is 
highly professional in its organization with many years of 
experience in these matters. It saw no problem with regard to the 
exclusive prerogative of the crown to levy taxes and believes this 
bill to be in order.
<P>
	Erskine May's twenty-first edition, pages 727 and 728, shows 
examples of matters that require a ways and means resolution to be 
initiated by a minister of the crown. The examples listed include, 
under taxation, new taxation, continuation of an expiring tax, 
reimposition of a repeal tax, increase in the rate of the existing tax, 
and extinction of an instance of tax.
<P>
	This bill does not change or repeal the rate of taxation or offend 
any of the criteria which fall under the purview of the government. 
It merely eliminates a deduction which will cause persons and 
business affected by this bill to pay this rate of taxes, as do other 
Canadians.
<P>
	I therefore ask you, Mr. Speaker, to rule against this point of 
order and let the debate proceed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, to satisfy the parliamentary secretary to 
the finance minister, as the member from the Bloc Quebecois 
pointed out, this is a non-votable motion. There will be no ways 
and means required to do anything because the House does not 
have to vote on this.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> The chair has heard the 
arguments put forward by all hon. members on this issue. I want to 
stress that in my view the parliamentary secretary is absolutely 
correct to raise the issue at this stage. It may seem late to hon. 
members, but bills are introduced and read for the first time 
without being reviewed by other hon. members. They sit on the  
Order Paper until they win a draw and are put on the order of 
precedence. It seems to me entirely appropriate that the issue be 
raised at this stage.
<P>
<B>(1750)</B>
<P>
	It could have been raised earlier I suspect as a point of order at 
any other time but it has been raised now and it clearly impacts on 
whether the bill is votable.
<P>
	I must say that I have grave doubts as to whether this bill is in 
order. I refer to page 821 of Erskine May's twentieth edition:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Matters which are covered by the term `charges upon the people' may be briefly 
summarized as-(2) the repeal or reduction of existing alleviations of taxation such 
as exemptions or drawbacks-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It is clearly stated that where there are such changes it would 
appear that ways and means proceedings are necessary and the full 
scope, that is a resolution, would have to be introduced first, 
followed by the bill.
<P>
	In view of the fact that the House is ready to proceed with the 
debate today and in light of the fact that members are prepared to 
debate the subject today, and in view of the comments that have 
been made concerning the possibility of such a debate, as your 
Speaker I will take the matter under advisement and give a formal 
ruling on the point of order at another time.
<P>
	We can proceed with debate today. I have indicated the way the 
Chair is leaning in light of the arguments advanced. If that is 
satisfactory we will now proceed with debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Campbell:</B> Mr. Speaker, thank you for resolving it in that 
fashion. I want to indicate to my hon. colleague we will proceed as 
a result of what you said but I want to be assured that did not stand 
as any precedent whatsoever.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> As I indicated to the 
parliamentary secretary, I will come back to the House with a 
formal ruling at a later time, possibly next week.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Karygiannis (Scarborough-Agincourt, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is with great pleasure to rise today to speak on my 
private member's Bill C-324, an act to amend the Income Tax Act. 
Bill C-324 provides for the elimination of entertainment expenses 
as a deduction under section 67.1 of the Income Tax Act.
<P>
	I received a number of calls and correspondence from lobby 
groups and business associations under the mistaken belief that 
meal deductions would be affected by this amendment. I would like 
to make it clear from the outset that this amendment would not 
affect business meal deductions.
<P>
	What this amendment would do, however, is bring a certain 
amount of fairness into the tax system for both small businesses 
and individuals. I would like to commend the government which in 
the 1994 budget  reduced the deduction from 80 per cent to 50 per 
cent. At that time there was much concern expressed by the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9582"> 9582 </A></B>
<P>
business community that this would have a detrimental effect, but 
this was proven not to be the case.
<P>
	I believe that elimination of the entertainment deduction would 
in the short term cause a small amount of disruption but in the long 
term have no negative effect on businesses and a positive effect on 
the revenues of the government and create a more equal playing 
field for all those who pay taxes
<P>
	If we look at sport stadiums in any major Canadian city the 
majority of the best seats and practically all the box seats are held 
by corporate entities. They do so with the help of 50 per cent 
deduction on their income tax, while at the same time the average 
Canadian sits in a cheaper seat up in the bleachers and pays full 
price. The same holds true for attending the theatre, opera or the 
events where the business community gets to deduct half the cost 
while the average Canadian pays full price. This situation gives rise 
to the circumstance that most sport stadiums count on the very 
expensive box seats to provide necessary revenue to pay the 
exorbitant salaries of sports figures who are indirectly being 
supplemented by the Canadian taxpayer.
<P>
	Although no figures are available there is much anecdotal 
evidence to suggest that many of these corporate seats and boxes 
are used by employees and their friends and families rather than to 
further business contacts, as was the original intent of the 
deduction. In my opinion this change would result in significant 
savings to the people of Canada with relatively no impact on small 
businesses and only a small period of adjustment for large 
businesses.
<P>
<B>(1755)</B>
<P>
	While this bill has not been deemed a votable item, I believe that 
it is of some importance and when the opportunity arises I shall 
resubmit it.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak today on this private member's bill. 
The procedural debate we had earlier is but an indication of the 
Liberal government's unwillingness to reform the tax system. 
Beyond the principles raised, it is obvious that, these past three 
years, the Government of Canada has sought to avoid at all costs 
changing the tax system to any great extent.
<P>
	While the Minister of Finance received with great interest the 
papers on corporate and personal tax reform prepared by the Bloc 
Quebecois, the government did not act on either. On every issue, be 
it family trusts, the GST or tax havens, the Bloc played its role as a 
watchdog, defending the interests of the taxpayers, but the 
government failed to show the leadership one would have expected 
from a government looking to change things  and make tax policies 
more effective, with respect to employment development in 
particular.
<P>
	According to the Bloc's analysis of corporate taxation, the 
federal government could recover something like $3 billion a year 
by revising or eliminating some outdated, ineffective or unfair tax 
expenditures. The expenses specifically targeted by the hon. 
member in his bill deserve consideration. It would be appropriate 
to take an in-depth look at these expenses to see if, given the effort 
asked from everyone to help improve public finances, we can still 
afford to allow entertainment expenses as a tax deductible item. We 
must also look at who benefits from such deductions.
<P>
	The same questions could be asked about the fact that lobbyists 
are allowed some tax deductions for their lobbying activities. It is 
rather strange that a group, whose mission is to try to influence 
parliamentarians so as to favour the interests of those it represents, 
can enjoy a tax benefit that does not exist for ordinary citizens. 
This is rather peculiar and a review of this whole issue seems in 
order.
<P>
	So, whether we are talking about corporate or individual 
taxation, the federal government did not do its homework, as 
evidenced by the fact that a Liberal member feels compelled to 
table a private member's bill to deal with a very specific issue, 
namely the tax deduction allowed for entertainment expenses.
<P>
	There is also a significant shortfall when it comes to personal 
taxation, because a lack of initiative or imagination on the part of 
the federal government keeps it from bringing about the tax reform 
that is so necessary. Here again, some $2.5 billion could be 
recovered, while about $4 billion could be reallocated annually, if 
the government reviewed or abolished some obsolete or inefficient 
expenses. Such a reform would also improve fairness within the 
federal tax system.
<P>
	Therefore, the Bloc Quebecois fully supports this bill. Why 
should the Income Tax Act allow a company to reduce its tax 
liability by several thousand dollars simply because it happens to 
have, for example, a private box in a sports centre? This is 
something our society must no longer tolerate, in view of the 
hardships experienced by the poor. A government that imposes an 
employment insurance reform which has the effect of diminishing 
benefits provided by the program while increasing the surplus 
cannot maintain measures that favour those who have money, as 
well as measures that do not necessarily yield the anticipated 
economic benefits.
<P>
	So yes, the hon. member is right to call for abolition of this type 
of deduction; yes, it would be right also to demand that the 
government carry out far more extensive taxation reform, that it 
take into consideration the points submitted by the Bloc Quebecois 
in two major documents on personal and corporate tax reform, 
from which a number of elements ought to have been adopted by 
the minister.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9583"> 9583 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1800)</B>
<P>
	The fact that they were not is perhaps related to the fact that the 
minister has created a taxation review committee, a technical 
committee made up of experts, most of whom come from 
communities already taking advantage of the systems and 
conditions in place. Given such a context, it is understandable that 
the government is trying to avoid having a bill like this go any 
further.
<P>
	I congratulate the hon. member, for at least this provides the 
opportunity to bring the debate out in the open on the eve of a 
federal election. I think that it will enable the voters to ask some 
questions of the various parties, such as: ``What do you intend to do 
about these tax deductions? Does the Liberal Party of Canada feel 
these types of deductions ought to continue? What about the 
Reform Party, the Bloc Quebecois?''
<P>
	In our case, the answer is obvious. Where the entertainment 
deduction is concerned, we feel this ought to no longer be allowed, 
especially for corporations, who use this in the end as a corporate 
perk, while at the same time often calling for the government to 
interfere as little as possible. You cannot have it both ways. There 
must be the greatest equity possible. I feel that the bill has the best 
of intentions in this area; it will not have any financial impact 
because it cannot be voted on, but it will have some impact on the 
political debates.
<P>
	I hope that the people of Quebec and the people of Canada will 
take advantage of the next election to ensure that the next 
government, the next Parliament, all of the representatives who are 
here, will focus particular attention on this issue.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois will certainly be there to remind the 
government that action is necessary. There is also a connection 
with political party financing. When a political party like the Bloc 
Quebecois is 100 per cent financed by individuals, and companies, 
organizations of any kind or labour unions cannot invest directly in 
a party, then it is only indebted to the electorate.
<P>
	When a political party receives substantial contributions from 
banks, large corporations, even unions or other organizations, then 
its hands are tied when it wants to introduce tax reforms that only 
benefit the individual, and not people who were able to make 
sizable contributions to the party's coffers.
<P>
	In concluding, I may say we applaud the principle behind the bill 
and the fact that the hon. member has asked the government to do 
what it failed to do for three years in terms of tax reform. We hope 
that the hon. member's initiative will be reflected as soon as 
possible in concrete government actions.
<P>
	It appears that this sort of decision and action will not be taken 
until after the next election, but at least we hope that the Liberals 
will make specific commitments and that, if they are returned to 
power, they will keep their commitments and we will have a tax 
reform that  eliminates all unfair deductions such as those for 
entertainment, although there may be some in other sectors too. 
The impact of each of these measures on job creation has to be 
assessed, and this will have to be a major criterion for tax reform, 
so the people of Quebec and Canada can trust the tax system and 
see clearly the advantages and disadvantages of each measure, and 
the new tax system will have to be fair.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am going 
to argue against this non-votable bill. Based on words and the 
ideology of the Bloc Quebecois member and the Liberal member 
who moved the motion, they are out to lunch when it comes to 
corporations. Do they not realize that corporations pay taxes and 
lots of taxes?
<P>
	They talk about how this being a tax deductible item and the 
corporation getting it at half price while the person who takes his 
lunch to work has to pay full price. The corporation or business has 
generated the revenue to have the right to buy season tickets, to 
have the right to spend $50,000 for a box.
<P>
	Why do the government and the current income tax system allow 
these businesses to write that off against their incomes? It is for a 
very good reason.
<P>
<B>(1805 )</B>
<P>
	They are sizeable corporations. They are movers in the business 
world. They are growing and expanding and they wish to 
communicate their message. The best way to get the attention of 
others who might possibly buy their product is to mix and mingle 
with them at times when they are not busy producing their product, 
from the hours of 8.00 until 12.00 and the hours of 1.00 until 5.00. 
The noon hour and evenings become prime time for people to 
spread their message.
<P>
	Having a box at a hockey game can be a legitimate deduction 
because of expectation of profit. Companies in Canada cannot 
afford to buy a box if they are broke. Companies in Canada cannot 
afford to spend that money unless they are generating the money 
against which they can deduct the cost of the box from income.
<P>
	Even at 50 per cent it is a good compromise. At 50 per cent the 
company has to think about how it is spending its money, whether 
it is justified and whether it will get a return through this contact 
and through this sales pitch.
<P>
	It is a good compromise. It reduces the abuse. It legitimizes the 
expense. When it was 100 per cent I agree there was a lot of abuse. 
The 80 and 20 was not enough to ensure that companies thought 
twice about it. The 50:50 rule should not require a motion like this. 
It makes a mockery out of people going into business.
<P>
	Profit leads to more tax revenue for the government than it loses 
through the tax deduction. That is another point. If the company 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9584"> 9584 </A></B>
<P>
has a box which leads to more business, for example a high tech 
corporation with a box  at the Corel Centre, the company makes 
more money. The bottom line increases. The tax revenue increases. 
I bet it is more than the 50 per cent deduction on the $50,000 box. 
What they are arguing against is less revenue for government, if it 
is taken away.
<P>
	It would not apply to food. That is good. I was pleased the 
member made that clarification.
<P>
	I do not understand how everybody seems to think we have to 
tax, tax, tax the rich and the corporations. We have to make sure 
that they pay their fair share. There is no question. People with 
lower incomes should pay less taxes than people with higher 
incomes. The simplified tax system I recommended would be 
progressive. It would have the same level of generous personal 
deduction. Everybody would pay the same rate with none of the tax 
exemptions. They would be eliminated. People would pay the 
single rate and maybe a dual rate on incomes up to a certain level 
and then a higher rate on incomes above $30,000, say 17 per cent 
and then 25 per cent.
<P>
	The point is that what sets a country apart from less fortunate 
and less expanding countries is how it handles its tax regime. Is it a 
punitive tax regime or is it an inducement tax regime? Do people 
get to keep more of their money when they make more money?
<P>
	Our system is getting pretty iffy. We seem to punish incentive 
and successful people by taxing them more and more. The levels 
are higher than they should be. We are at the maximum in terms of 
taxes. The finance minister knows that. That is why he has not 
raised personal tax rates in the four years he has been here. He has 
been very smart not to do that. Had he done that, the Liberals would 
be a lot lower in the polls than they are right now.
<P>
	With respect to corporations, the tax regime is important because 
we are now in a global economy. If the separatists want to have 
their own country, they had better learn quickly that if they punish 
their corporations by taxing the heck out of them, there will not be 
very many jobs. Who creates the jobs? It is the corporations. Do 
corporations really pay taxes? No, they do not.
<P>
	We could say that the banks contribute $8 billion in taxes. We 
could look at any financial statement of a public company to see 
how much it paid in taxes. Do they really pay those dollars in 
taxes? No. It is the consumer who pays the taxes. The tax cost is 
built into the corporation every year. It is built into a price increase 
to protect the bottom line. It is the people who pay. It is the 
consumers who pay the taxes.
<P>
<B>(1810)</B>
<P>
	The whole argument that we should tax corporations more is 
bogus. On the surface we must have a tax regime for corporations. I 
am not one who says corporations should not pay tax. That is what 
some people say. They think costs would be lower and product 
costs would be lower and they would pass it along to consumers. 
No, I  do not think so. I do not agree with that. They should pay 
some tax.
<P>
	It is important to have the right incentives in place, a tax regime 
that is properly thought out. If there is expectation of profit it is a 
legitimate expense. If corporations are investing in hardware or 
investing in people, how do they get their message out there? They 
advertise. They advertise in a lot of ways. It is not just a media buy 
in the electronic media or the print media. Word of mouth 
sometimes is the best form of advertising.
<P>
	If I just started a brand new restaurant, one of the better ways for 
me to increase clientele and sales so I can hire more people and end 
up paying more taxes is to start bringing people there. That is a 
legitimate deduction if I bring people there to introduce them to my 
product, my place of business, and show them what we have.
<P>
	Both the Bloc member and the Liberal member who have just 
spoken do not understand the corporate environment. They do not 
understand what corporations really do. They do not understand 
how much of a contribution corporations make.
<P>
	It is government's role to create the right incentive and the right 
environment for the private sector to create jobs. We are slowly 
getting the Liberals to accept that. They are talking the talk now. 
Maybe they will start walking the walk.
<P>
	A bill like this one is draconian. It is dinosauric. It is from the 
past. We must create incentives for businesses to stay in Canada. 
We must give businesses the legitimate opportunity to deduct their 
expenses. Those expenses that are clearly and legitimately intended 
to increase their profitability should be deductible.
<P>
	The 50 per cent rule legitimizes, reduces abuse and allows 
corporations to have the respect they have when they spend this 
kind of money. If these corporations did not spend this kind of 
money, does the member know how many rinks there would be in 
the country? Does the member know how many sporting venues or 
other venues would exist if there was not an inducement for 
companies to spend these moneys? There would be a lot less. How 
many jobs would be lost? I do not think the whole psychology has 
been thought out by the two members. They see high profits.
<P>
	I would rather go after Bombardier. Lending money to 
Bombardier as the government has done is shameful. It is a 
profitable company with a profit of $400 million last year. Over the 
last 10 or 12 years it has received over $1 billion. We do not know 
when it will be paid back or how much will be paid pay back. How 
much of the $400 million is the government getting back. We do 
not know those things.
<P>

<P>

<P>
	Those are the ways in which I would increase revenues. That 
is how I would go after corporations. I would not subsidize 
businesses to that extent. If they cannot survive on their own they 
should go broke.
<P>
	If Bombardier with its huge profit this year wants to buy a box at 
the Molson stadium, it should be allowed to deduct that against its 
income because it generated that $400 million. A company does 
not generate $400 million profit unless it hires a lot of people and 
has a lot of clients. It is a worldwide company. It needs to show the 
kind of operation it has. The member should rethink his position on 
going after corporations and not allowing deductions of this nature.
<P>
	While I have the floor is it proper for me to move third reading?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> I should caution the hon. 
member that if he seeks consent the Chair might be disposed to 
make a ruling on the procedural regularity of the bill. I am not sure, 
in light of the discussion we had earlier, the member would want to 
do that.
<P>
<B>(1815 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was only afraid that the hon. 
member for Calgary Centre wanted yet another five minutes. The 
spirit of co-operation only goes so far.
<P>
	I would like to comment on Bill C-324, which we have been 
debating for the last few moments. It concerns the income tax 
system and specifically taxes on corporations.
<P>
	I understand the intent of the bill is that certain company 
expenses on entertainment should not be deductible. In addition to 
the procedural irregularity of the receipt of the bill before the 
House which you, Mr. Speaker, have taken under advisement and 
on which I am not commenting further, there is a different problem.
<P>
	I note, with all respect to my colleague the hon. member for 
Scarborough-Agincourt, the bill suffers from a drafting error, 
which I am sure was not the intent of the member. The bill would 
raise the current deduction for business entertainment expenses 
which is subject to several limits under the current Income Tax Act 
to 100 per cent of eligible expenses on entertainment.
<P>
	I know that the intent of the bill and the tenor of his comments 
are quite different. The question before us is, to what degree should 
entertainment expenses be deductible in the computation of income 
for businesses.
<P>
	As indicated earlier, the current deduction for business 
entertainment expenses is limited in several ways. First, businesses 
are not allowed to deduct certain types of business expenses. 
Specifically, expenses paid for the use of a yacht, camp, lodge or 
golf course facility are not deductible unless the taxpayer made or 
incurred the  outlay or expense in the ordinary course of his 
business from providing the property for hire or reward.
<P>
	Second, the Income Tax Act requires that any business or 
entertainment expense must be reasonable in the circumstances and 
incurred for the purpose of earning income from a business or 
property.
<P>
	Third, since 1994, qualifying business meals and entertainment 
expenses have been deductible at a rate of 50 per cent. Prior to 
1994, 80 per cent of qualifying meals and entertainment expenses 
were deductible.
<P>
	The current income tax rules are based on the presumption that 
business meals and entertainment expenses contain a portion which 
is incurred to earn income and, therefore, would normally be 
regarded as legitimate business expense. They also contain an 
element of personal consumption which should not be deductible. 
However, it would be very difficult to identify the precise 
proportion of business meals and entertainment expenses which 
represent the business component.
<P>
	For this reason, the Income Tax Act permits businesses to deduct 
50 per cent of eligible expenses on business meals and 
entertainment expenses in the calculation of taxable income.
<P>
	I should also note that Canada's treatment of business meals and 
entertainment expenses is in line with the level of tax deductions in 
all provinces, including Quebec. I was startled to hear the hon. 
member say that he thought it should be changed. I wonder if he 
has told his provincial friends in Quebec City that. The federal 
deduction level currently is in accord with the level in all provinces 
and in the United States.
<P>
	In conclusion, I would first say that the government cannot 
support Bill C-324. Indeed, I doubt that the hon. member for 
Scarborough-Agincourt would support it because of the drafting 
error which, in effect, causes the opposite result from that which he 
has asserted he intended.
<P>
	However, even if the bill was redrafted in a way which would 
carry out its stated intent, I would recommend to the House on 
behalf of the government that it not be approved because it does not 
recognize that a portion of these expenses do have a legitimate 
business person. The complete denial of these expenses would not 
constitute an improvement in the system we now have.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> There being no further 
members rising for debate and the motion not being designated as 
votable item, the time provided for the consideration of Private 
Members' Business has now expired and the order is dropped from 
the Order Paper.
<P>
	Is it agreed that we call it 6.30 p.m.?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 is 
deemed to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CORCAN">CORCAN</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, a laundry in 
the city of Granby, in my riding, recently bid on a contract to 
service the Granby and Brome-Missisquoi-Perkins hospitals. 
Buanderie Shefford has been providing laundry services to these 
two hospitals for eight years now.
<P>
<B>(1820)</B>
<P>
	On December 19, 1996, Buanderie Shefford received a call for 
tenders. After the Granby company posted a $200,000 bond, it 
realized, when the tenders were opened, that it was the lowest of 
the four bidders.
<P>
	Strangely enough, the Corporation d'achat régionale de biens et 
services de la Montérégie decided to issue another call for tenders 
without giving any explanation whatsoever. This time, my 
constituent came out second, behind the Centre correctionnel de 
Laval, CORCAN, which, strangely enough, had not submitted a bid 
the first time around but did this time, knowing in advance what the 
prices of its competitors would be.
<P>
	The private company, Buanderie Shefford, might lose a contract 
to a company funded in large part by taxpayers.
<P>
	One has to wonder whether CORCAN includes all of its costs in 
the bids it summits and respects the same ground rules as its private 
sector competitors.
<P>
	This is obviously a blatant example of unfair competition on the 
part of the federal administration, taking major contracts away 
from companies which are at least as competitive as Corrections 
Canada.
<P>
	CORCAN employs, on a regular basis, some 1,800 offenders 
whom alone, I might add, cost Canadian taxpayers close to $90 
million a year. The tax burden should not be made heavier, it is bad 
enough as it is. The result would be a further 15 workers out of a 
job. This is a fact, and it is unacceptable.
<P>
	Fifteen jobs are in jeopardy, 15 families may have to suffer the 
disastrous consequences of unemployment. While the Liberals 
promised jobs, jobs, jobs, just the opposite is happening in this 
case.
<P>
	I sent letters to the solicitor general on two occasions. I have 
questioned him in this House and, on March 21, he told me he 
would be most pleased to look into the matter and to report to me as 
promptly as possible. Here we are three weeks later and nothing 
has been resolved in this matter. Time is of the essence. Will the 
minister take action to redress this injustice?
<P>
	Our local entrepreneurs have a right to operate in a free market 
setting where the rules of the game are not altered by the 
interference of government agencies whose financial resources are 
totally unconnected to their economic performance.
<P>
	The government must act responsibly and act as quickly as 
possible to resolve this unfair situation. The government has one 
responsibility: it must withdraw its bid. That is the only 
conceivable solution.
<P>
	Otherwise, law abiding citizens whose taxes pay for correctional 
facilities will end up losing their jobs. That is unacceptable. It 
makes no sense.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernard Patry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
is my pleasure to provide an answer to a question raised in the 
House by the hon. member for Shefford, on March 21.
<P>
	At the time, the hon. member expressed concern about the bid 
submitted by CORCAN, following a call for tenders by the 
Corporation d'achat régionale de biens et services de la 
Montérégie. He felt that CORCAN was an example of unfair 
competition on the part of the federal administration.
<P>
	I want to explain that CORCAN is a special operating agency 
under Correctional Service Canada, which is accountable to 
Parliament, through the Department of the Solicitor General. The 
purpose of CORCAN is to promote rehabilitation of inmates into 
Canadian society by providing them with job and training 
opportunities during their stay in federal penitentiaries and for 
brief periods once they are released.
<P>
	There are always around 1,900 federal inmates working for 
CORCAN. These working inmates get job-related training and 
experience. According to a 1994 study, former inmates who had 
worked for CORCAN were much less likely to be sent back to a 
federal penitentiary. Since these individuals do not reoffend as 
much, programs like CORCAN improve public safety.
<P>
	CORCAN has five areas of activity: manufacture, agro-business, 
construction, services and textile. Its 32 workplaces are distributed 
among the 58 federal correctional facilities. CORCAN sells its 
products to federal, provincial and municipal governments and to 
institutions such as hospitals, schools, universities and charitable 
organizations.
<P>
	As a special operating agency, CORCAN receives no 
appropriations but must borrow the money it needs to operate 
through a revolving fund. This money must be paid back with 
interest. CORCAN's operating costs must be recorded in its 
financial
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="9587"> 9587 </A></B>
<P>
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
practices.
<P>
	CORCAN is always trying to minimize the adverse effects of its 
activities on the private sector. An independent review of 
CORCAN's operations demonstrates that it holds-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> I am sorry to interrupt the 
member but his time has expired.
<P>
	The motion to adjourn the House is deemed to have been 
adopted.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Accordingly, the House stands adjourned until tomorrow at10 a.m. pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 6.25 p.m.)
