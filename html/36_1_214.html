</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK3">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK4"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (for the Minister of Canadian Heritage, 
Lib.)</B> moved that Bill C-64, an act to establish an 
indemnification program for travelling exhibitions, be read the 
second time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK5"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mauril Bélanger (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, at first glimpse Bill 
C-64 looks like a relatively small technical piece of legislation 
of apparent interest only to people who work in Canada's museums. 
However this legislation has tremendous potential.  It has the 
potential to affect the heart, soul and mind of every Canadian 
now and in years to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this legislation in place every Canadian will be that much 
closer to seeing and experiencing many of the world's treasures 
that are all too often inaccessible except to a fortunate few. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has museums, art galleries, libraries and archival 
depositories that are renowned throughout the world.  They house 
treasures that belong to all the people of Canada.  Many of us, 
if not most of us, have never had an opportunity to admire them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For someone living in Red Deer, in Moose Jaw, Trois-Rivières, 
Corner Brook or such small places as Howe, Saskatchewan, which I 
have had the opportunity to visit, Mattawa, where I was born, or 
Saint-Eleutère-Pohénégamook in the lower St. Lawrence region of 
Quebec, it is not always possible to get to Vancouver, Ottawa, 
Montreal, Quebec City or Fredericton to see exhibitions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The entire world is full of wonderful things which Canada's 
children and youth will probably never get to see, for most 
people cannot afford to visit Rome, Paris, Beijing or 
Johannesburg. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But what if these treasures came to Canadians, instead of 
Canadians having to travel to see them? 
What if the world's greatest works could be brought here to 
Canada, and if Canada's art works could be seen by people the 
world over? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Far more Canadians would then have an opportunity to learn more 
about their history, their heritage, their identity, and the 
world's masterpieces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is precisely the essence of Bill C-64: to give Canadians the 
chance to know Canada, to open up the world to Canadians, to 
open up Canada to the rest of the world. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill deals with a major roadblock in putting exhibitions on 
the road.  One solution is to get rid of the high cost of 
insurance.  That is what the bill will allow us to do, to greatly 
lower the cost of insurance by covering loss or damages to an 
exhibition through an indemnification program: no money up front, 
only after the fact, only if needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourteen industrialized countries including the United States, 
Great Britain, Australia and France have have had their own 
government sponsored indemnity programs for years.  Do they work? 
They more than work.  In 23 years of operation the United States 
indemnity program has received only two claims at a cost of just 
more than $100,000 U.S. out of a total annual indemnification 
value of $3 billion.  It is a similar story for the other 13 
countries with similar programs.  The precedent has been set. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Risk for Canada would be minimized by stringent eligibility 
criteria in a number of areas, including plans for security, 
environmental control and artefact handling. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having a sliding scale will do away with requests for relatively 
minor indemnification. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1010"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT1"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also means that insurance companies will not be excluded, 
because they will continue to supply insurance policies. 
Exhibitions valued at less than $500,000 would not be eligible 
for this program, and the maximum indemnification per exhibition 
would be $450 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The risk to government could be further reduced by setting a 
maximum of $1.5 billion for all exhibitions indemnified during a 
fiscal year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this bill, we want first and foremost to circulate Canadian 
heritage and to put it within the reach of all Canadians.  We 
also want it accessible to visiting tourists. 
We want to make the wonders of the world more and more 
accessible to the people of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must not ignore the economic impact of visitors to a 
province, a region or a city anywhere in the country.  The 
Barnes exhibition at the Art Gallery of Ontario alone generated 
$38 million in consumer spending, much of which comes from the 
some 65,000 foreign visitors to Canada.  The same phenomenon 
occurs pretty well across the board in other cities in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last summer, I had the honour of visiting the Rodin exhibit in 
Quebec City.  The exhibition was thronged and beautiful.  The 
same phenomenon is happening with the Monet exhibit in Montreal, 
which I have also had the opportunity of seeing, and it occurs 
in the rest of the country as well. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consider also last fall's Renoir exhibition at the National 
Gallery in my own backyard:  $6 million in restaurant sales, a 
quarter of a million room nights in Canadian hotels and motels, 
80,000 more people visiting Parliament Hill, and $25 million 
spent by visitors from abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Exhibitions are about culture.  They are also about jobs, 
manufacturing, consumption of goods and services, and tax 
revenues for all levels and orders of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am honoured to have the National Gallery in the riding of 
Ottawa—Vanier that I represent.  I know families from St. 
John's, Victoria, Whitehorse or Val d'Or cannot take a walk or a 
mere drive to the National Gallery as can my constituents and 
those in the national capital region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the wonders of that gallery, the Group of Seven 
paintings, the Emily Carr paintings, the modern sculptures and 
the antique artefacts, to travel to all Canadians.  The bill is 
one big step in making that happen.  As a proud Canadian, as all 
of us here, I think that is fantastic. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If our museums, art galleries, archives and libraries are to 
compete with institutions in other countries in order to borrow 
the world's most prestigious collections, we must pass this 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we want a greater share of tourist revenues, we must pass 
this bill. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we want our kids to see more Canadian art firsthand, we need 
this legislation.  If we want our kids exposed to the greatest 
works of art in the history of humanity, we need this 
legislation.  A vote for this bill is a vote for the achievement 
of Canadians and for our national identity.  It is a vote for 
opening up the world to our children.  It is a vote for culture 
and the power it brings to the human mind, the human soul and the 
human heart. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am delighted from preliminary conversations with 
representatives of the opposition parties that there seems to be 
a substantial amount of support for the legislation.  I encourage 
speedy passage at second reading so that the committee can be 
tasked with dealing with the bill and report as early as 
possible. 
<P><A NAME="LINK6"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin—Swan River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am very pleased to rise to speak to Bill C-64 this morning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party, the official opposition, certainly supports 
Bill C-64, the Canada Travelling Exhibitions Indemnification Act. 
The bill would in effect make the Government of Canada the 
underwriters for travelling international exhibitions under the 
auspices of public institutions up to a maximum of $450 million 
per show and up to an aggregate of $1.5 billion for any given 
year. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1015"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT3"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT3"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1015

<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I begin to tell the House why we support Bill C-64, I 
want to say that this is another good example of Reform's support 
for legislation put forth by the government.  It makes sense and 
it will ultimately provide better service to all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our record shows that almost half of the time we do support 
legislation from the government side.  We support legislation 
when it is well thought out, when the people have been consulted 
and when we know the impact that it will have on the country. 
This side of the House would support more legislation if the 
government would be more transparent and take its time when it is 
putting together its legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now tell the House why the official opposition believes 
Bill C-64 should be supported.  By serving as underwriter to the 
public travelling exhibitions, the government potentially saves 
taxpayers the cost of paying a premium for private showings.  For 
example, insurance on a recent travelling exhibition valued at 
$1.5 billion carries a premium of $1 million.  Under the current 
circumstance, how can anyone afford to pay those types of 
premiums?  Without this legislation, the premium is certainly a 
barrier to museums and other organizations that would like to 
bring in international and national exhibits and have them 
circulated throughout the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As long as standards of security, care and transportation are 
maintained at a high level, it seems unlikely that a potential 
liability would turn into an actual liability.  Under a federal 
United States identification program, with a ceiling of $5 
billion, in the last 25 years of operation only two claims were 
filed totalling $100,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the opportunity to meet with the Canadian Museum 
Association this past year to discuss Bill C-64 in-depth.  This 
indemnification program was requested by the museums and by the 
Canadian Museum Association.  They want the bill amended so that 
the maximum aggregate liability of $1.5 billion in any fiscal 
year be changed to $1.5 billion at any time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, section 53 and 54 of the Constitution Act, 1867 require 
that supply be specifically proposed by the crown and 
specifically authorized by the House of Commons.  From a 
constitutional point of view, $1.5 billion at any time is 
disallowed.  There is provision in the subclause for the amount 
to be raised or lowered by an appropriation act for a given year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no minimum exhibition value set for participation in 
the indemnification program by the governor in council, but the 
governor in council is authorized to make regulations for setting 
a minimum.  The government intends to set the minimum at $500,000 
in order to maintain standards sufficiently high that losses are 
highly unlikely.  This is a good approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been mentioned by the parliamentary secretary that there 
will certainly be a spillover of economic impact from major 
exhibitions.  This could run into the tens of millions of dollars 
and would have a huge impact on local governments, provincial 
governments, local chambers and local small business because it 
would generate economic activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People from many miles away will literally flock to these 
exhibits. This will give the people of this country an 
opportunity to see world-class exhibits which would otherwise not 
occur.  From that point of view, there are a lot of pluses with 
Bill C-64.  This program will keep costs low.  Decisions as to 
what kind of exhibitions will travel would be left up to the 
museums. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party supports the freedom of Canadian culture in 
communities to grow and develop without needless protection and 
government regulation, encouraging a cultural free market which 
offers choice while lowering costs to consumers as services are 
provided by those sectors which are able to do so most cost 
effectively.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The indemnification in Bill C-64 is the kind of program that 
all governments can do with little cost to the taxpaying public. 
It brings sufficient economic as well as cultural benefits to the 
citizens of the country.  Therefore, the official opposition 
supports the bill and also supports all stage consideration by 
the House on Bill C-64.

<P><A NAME="LINK7"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to address Bill C-64, an act to establish an 
indemnification program for travelling exhibitions, at second 
reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill seeks to establish a program of indemnification for 
international exhibitions, and for domestic exhibitions that are 
shown in at least two provinces. It will empower the Government 
of Canada to assume the financial risk, and provide 
compensation, for damage to or loss of an item that is part of 
the exhibition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The program's main feature is that it will allow museums to save 
several hundreds of thousands of dollars in insurance, which is 
a very significant amount of savings for the arts world, as the 
hon. member pointed out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me say from the outset that the Bloc Quebecois supports the 
principle of the bill. Indeed, we fully agree with the idea of 
helping museums by assuming a financial burden, which they 
certainly could do without. However, we would like to see some 
amendments to the bill. I will elaborate on these in the second 
part of my speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, let us take a look at how this legislation came to be. 
The facts to which I am referring are taken from a report 
prepared in February 1997 for the Canadian Museums Association. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada once had an indemnification program for exhibitions. 
That program was established in 1985, but abolished in 1995, as 
part of the program review. During its 11 years of existence, 
the program was used to insure 157 travelling exhibitions 
sponsored by 50 museums, for an estimated total value of 
$6 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The program had been set up to help museums deal with the huge 
increase in the value of works of art and, consequently, in 
insurance costs, which had become prohibitive. Today, these 
costs have not diminished, far from it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the international level, various studies, some dating back to 
1974, concluded that the establishment of government sponsored 
indemnification programs was more effective than commercial 
insurance for travelling exhibitions. 
Not only is this method more economical, because breakage is 
very limited, but it also has the advantage of eliminating the 
problems associated with legal interpretations of the policies 
and legislation of various countries, which is reassuring to art 
lenders. During the 1980s, studies done in Canada reached the 
same conclusions.  It so happened that in 1981 the Art Gallery 
of Ontario was to host a Van Gogh exhibition.  Shortly before 
the opening, one of Van Gogh's paintings was auctioned off for a 
very large amount.  As a result the owners of the items on loan 
demanded that coverage be increased accordingly.  The insurance 
premium went up so much that the federal government had to step 
in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The following year, in 1982, during the annual federal-provincial 
meeting of ministers of culture, a resolution was passed to set 
up a task force to examine the details of an indemnification 
program for exhibitions, in consultation with representatives of 
federal and provincial museums.  This task force pointed out the 
savings that such a program would produce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, according to the task force's figures, claims for 
breakage during travelling exhibitions from 1972 to 1982, a ten 
year period, were slightly higher than $300,000, half of which 
represented a single claim.  The task force therefore 
recommended an indemnification program for exhibitions worth 
over $5 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In June 1985, the federal government announced the introduction 
of an insurance program for travelling exhibitions so that 
Canadians would have access to exhibitions that would otherwise 
cost too much, and so that Canada could host major exhibitions.

</I></B></P><P align=left>During its lifetime, the indemnification program cost the 
federal government and the museums $6.6 million, and insured 157 
exhibits by 50 museums, for a total coverage of $6 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Claims made over the 10 years of the program's existence 
totalled $550,000, which I would point out is far below the 
claims average for the Canadian insurance industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995, 15 countries were offering support to museums in one 
form or another, in order to insure travelling exhibits. 
The program implemented in the United States allowed eligible 
museums and galleries to save some $90 million U.S. in insurance 
premiums between 1975 and 1977.  Over that same period, claims 
totalled only $104,700 U.S.  This shows how low the costs of 
such a program are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In introducing this bill today, the federal government is merely 
catching up with other countries in the world that already have 
similar museum support programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that we have examined the background to this bill, I would 
like to set out the points which are, in my humble opinion, the 
most problematical.  In fact, what I am doing is passing on to 
the House comments that are supported by the people who work in 
museums. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the Bloc Quebecois supports the principle of the bill, 
we would like to see certain essential changes made to it. 
First of all, the definition of travelling exhibit ought to be 
amended to include those not presented in at least two Canadian 
provinces; second, the annual eligible limit needs to be raised 
substantially; third, the two subjective criteria for 
eligibility of travelling exhibits, namely educational and 
professional quality of the exhibition, and significance and 
relevance of the theme and content to Canadians, ought to be 
changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the requirement to show the exhibition in at least two 
provinces is found in clause 2, which sets two conditions for an 
exhibition to be considered a travelling exhibition, namely that 
the total fair market value of the objects in the exhibition 
that are borrowed from outside Canada exceed the total fair 
market value of those borrowed from inside Canada, or that the 
exhibition be shown in at least two provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem with the second condition is that international 
exhibitions are rarely shown in more than one province. In fact, 
they rarely shown on more than one continent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, a more modest exhibition may be of interest to a province, 
but not to the other regions of the country. The Bloc Quebecois 
feels that the residents of one province are taxpayers just like 
the residents of two different provinces, and must be entitled 
to the same services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This provision will also have a greater impact in Quebec, where 
exhibitions are often shown in French only and can therefore not 
be presented in English speaking provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for our second point, which is to raise the annual maximum 
liability, we are not the only ones to raise this issue. Indeed, 
all the museum officials to whom we talked unanimously condemned 
the indemnification program's annual maximum liability, since 
that maximum can be reached with three major exhibitions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This ceiling is all the more unacceptable because experience has 
shown that claims by museums are below the insurance industry's 
average, and that an authorized maximum is set for each eligible 
exhibition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, this measure coupled with clause 5(a), which limits 
accessibility to the program to exhibitions valued at $500,000, 
will restrict the bill's application to big exhibitions and the 
major facilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Need we remind you that the major exhibitions—Picasso, Renoir, 
Daumier and Van Gogh—at the National Gallery of Canada alone 
represent a total value of several billion dollars. 
Consequently, the Bloc Quebecois would like the Minister of 
Finance to raise the annual ceiling for eligibility to the 
indemnification program considerably. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would remind the hon. members that clause 3 of the bill 
provides that the government's liability cannot exceed $450 
million per exhibition and $1.5 billion annually for all 
exhibitions.

<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, clause 5 permits the governor in council to make 
regulations for the purpose of, first, limiting the minimum 
value of eligible exhibitions and, second, establishing the 
criteria for the conclusion of indemnification agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been told that the minimum value of eligible exhibitions 
would be $500,000.  This minimum is way too high for small 
travelling exhibitions.  The Société des musées du Québec, for 
example, is asking for a limit of $200,000.  The Bloc Quebecois 
supports its recommendation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the criteria to be considered in the conclusion of 
indemnification agreements provided in the bill include, in 
subparagraphs 5(<I>b</I>)(ii) and 5(<I>b</I>)(iii), and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(ii) the educational and professional quality of the exhibition, 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(iii) the significance and relevance to Canadians of the 
exhibition's theme and contents, 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc wants these overly subjective criteria deleted.  Why 
does the government want the privilege of deciding on the 
educational quality of exhibitions and their significance for 
Canadians?  Does it hope to use travelling exhibitions for 
propaganda purposes?  I put the question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, the Bloc Quebecois is not alone in its 
reservations.  They are shared by the president of the Société 
des musées du Québec, Hélène Pagé.  She made her views known at 
the hearing held at the head office of Radio-Canada in Montreal 
on February 25 by the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should begin by pointing out that the Société des musées du 
Québec is made up of 250 museums in Quebec, which, according to 
a recent survey, were visited by some 14.8 million people in 
1997-98. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So as to clearly convey Ms. Pagé's thoughts to members of the 
House, I will read what she said: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—we have seen the draft bill and it is quite worrisome because 
there does not seem to be an understanding of what a travelling 
exhibit is. There are two conditions. The travelling exhibit 
must contain more foreign objects than Canadian objects, whereas 
we know that an exhibit that comes from abroad does not include 
any Canadian objects, or else it must travel in two provinces. 
The great international exhibits are presented once on the 
European continent, once in the United State and in one Canadian 
province. They don't go to two provinces. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>She states further: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Secondly, the regulations are worrisome because here again, it 
is somewhat coloured by politics. A regulation will decree what 
makes an exhibit have educational value and interest for 
Canadians. 
I don't understand that this can be done by regulation. There is 
no trust in the museum professionals. Who will decree that this 
exhibit interests Canadians or not; that the Monet exhibit in 
Montreal is not really interesting for Canadians? There is truly 
a problem there, and a connotation of political intervention in 
a bill for which we had high hopes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing is worrisome. We have learned that it would only 
apply to exhibits of a value of $5,000 and up. Only the large 
national museums are able to present that kind of exhibit. The 
others only present that kind of exhibit on an exceptional 
basis. If a small museum in Newfoundland or Quebec presented an 
exhibit worth between $90,000 and $200,000 and an unfortunate 
fire occurred, it would be a total catastrophe. The museum would 
not be compensated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, this is a bill that will be useful to the big museums 
but not the small ones. Right now, throughout the country, the 
smaller museums are experiencing a great deal of difficulty. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was a long quote, but an interesting one.  As members can 
see, there are very clear concerns among museum directors about 
this bill, and the government needs to be attuned to them.  The 
professionals working in this field, those who are knowledgeable 
about it, need to be trusted.  If competent people like Mrs. 
Pagé voice reservations, the government needs to heed them, and 
to make the changes they are asking for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be a great disappointment if we were to feel obliged to 
oppose this bill on next reading just because the government's 
intent was to make political hay from an indemnification 
program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been clearly demonstrated that this program was a highly 
economical one with great advantages for the museums.

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why should the program not be expanded to include more museum 
exhibitions, since this is easily done?  I would remind this 
House that every possible precaution is taken by museums.  Every 
possible effort is made to protect exhibits and to ensure that 
they are not damaged. Hence there are virtually no losses and 
very few accidents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the federal government has a duty to demonstrate 
its confidence in the museum community, by amending the bill as 
requested, solely in order to include as many exhibitions as 
possible.  I trust that the government will be responsive to the 
real needs of the museum community.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CANADA TRAVELLING EXHIBITIONS INDEMNIFICATION ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK11">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-64, an 
act to establish an indemnification program for travelling 
exhibitions, be read the second time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK12"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
NDP is pleased to speak in support of Bill C-64, an act to 
provide for the indemnification of travelling exhibits. It is 
easy to see what the motivation was for the introduction of this 
bill given the research we have been doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently for museums to field travelling exhibitions they have 
to undertake commercial insurance offset by help from the federal 
government for a total of $6 million per year. In order for 
Canadian museums to tour shows we are paying up to $6 million a 
year to commercial insurance in the event that they may suffer 
damage or loss to some of the artefacts or exhibits, whereas the 
empirical evidence shows it can be far more cheaply undertaken by 
a socialized system.  If the government undertakes the risk and 
the liability, it will cost far less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the United States the American government undertakes the risk 
for $3 billion worth of artefacts touring the U.S. In 23 years of 
operation there have only been two claims amounting to payouts of 
less than $100,000. The American model underwrites a far greater 
amount of value in artefacts and the empirical evidence has been 
that only two claims were made for less than $100,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are spending $6 million a year to the commercial insurance 
industry.  It is only common sense that this is one of those good 
examples of where government can do it better.  Rather than have 
this insurance product contracted out, if we keep that work in 
house, we all reap the savings and the museums can feel more 
comfortable in taking their exhibits on the road. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of us undervalue the role Canadian museums play and the 
level of interest in the community for Canadian museums and the 
good work they do.  According to our research there are over 
24,100 employees of Canadian museums, a figure that may surprise 
many members here.  There are also 55,000 volunteers which 
indicates to me huge interest and support in the community for 
the work they do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An even more telling figure of the value of our Canadian museums 
and why we should support them with this bill is that 54.9 
million people visited museums last year.  In a country of 30 
million people that means almost every Canadian went twice to a 
museum, or some people went an awful lot. That is all the more 
reason to share the wonderful products, the message, culture and 
heritage Canadian museums hold with more Canadians by taking 
their shows on the road. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Museums have not been so inclined to get involved with 
travelling exhibitions, whether of their own artefacts or of 
touring international shows, because of the terrible risk they 
face in terms of loss of artefacts.  They are dealing with 
priceless products, absolutely world class items in many cases. 
There is no possibility of ever replacing them accurately.  As a 
result the commercial insurance industry has no choice but to put 
a very high value on those products.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was involved recently with a travelling show at the Museum of 
Man and Nature in Manitoba.  I was very pleased to take part in 
it.  I raise this only as an example of the value of taking shows 
out of the museum and into the communities so more people can see 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Museums can actually play a role, and always have, in shaping 
social policy through education.  This one example was the very 
pressing and timely issue of child labour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Museum of Man and Nature to its credit put together an 
exhibit of photographs by David Parker called “Stolen Dreams”. 
It dealt with this man who travelled all throughout the world and 
found examples of child labour. It did not stop there.  The 
museum put together a multimedia interactive exhibit.  There 
would be a photograph of a child working in a brickyard in India 
and a lever next to it.  Some kid looking at the picture could 
push on that lever and actually feel how heavy it is to carry a 
load of bricks for 12 hours a day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This exhibit will be taken beyond Manitoba.  I know it is going 
to Vancouver and all around the country. CIDA has helped to put 
this show on the road.  By travelling, this show will expose and 
sensitize far more kids than could possibly have been exposed to 
this very real and pressing international issue. It is very 
important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I raise that as one example of the importance of museums 
ignoring their physical barriers, the walls of their own 
buildings.  Rather than trying to take Mohamed to the mountain, 
the mountain will be taken to Mohamed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It makes sense to do this internally.  We can look at socialized 
auto insurance.  No one who has ever lived in a province that is 
lucky enough to have government run auto insurance would ever 
argue that we should go back to the commercial carriers because 
we were simply paying too much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada was paying too much to insure these 
artefacts.  Now we know.  All we have to do is look to our 
neighbours to the south.  We did not have to spend $6 million a 
year to underwrite some of these touring exhibits. It is $100,000 
a year in the United States to insure $3 billion worth of 
products.  We are talking about a maximum value of $450 million 
per exhibit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one thing I would criticize about Bill C-64.  I would 
hope people would review it when it gets into further debate. 
Exhibitions under Bill C-64 must have a value in excess of 
$500,000 to qualify for the program. I am a little suspect of 
that.  I wish that could be altered because in the example I 
gave, whether it qualified or not, we would have been dealing 
with photographs and with relatively inexpensive materials.  The 
artefacts were not as important as the interactive value.  Really 
$500,000 would preclude a lot of valuable exhibits from being 
underwritten and taken on the road. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that the figure could be brought down to something more 
realistic.  I am not sure why there has to be a minimum dollar 
value unless there is a breaking point where it simply is not 
worth the paperwork.  If the exhibit was only worth $500, there 
may be more than $500 worth of administration to register the 
articles and so on.  A realistic figure would be $100,000. If the 
exhibit has a net value of $100,000, it should qualify under this 
otherwise very worthy program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Museums need a break.  The Government of Canada should not be 
paying more than it needs to but neither should the museums. 
Look at what they have been facing in recent years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been a huge escalation in the number of museums and 
related institutions in the country.  In 1972 the Canadian 
Museums Association listed 838 museums, galleries and 
institutions.  As of 1999 there were 2,271 listings in the 
directory.  It has expanded 200-fold.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Going back to 1990-91 the total museum funding was $210 million, 
give or take.  It went to a high and spiked at almost $220 
million in 1995.  In the year 1999-2000 it will go down to $193 
million.  They have actually seen quite a cutback in their 
overall budget funding in a period of time where the number of 
institutions was escalating.  I would assume the burden then 
falls to more volunteers, more community input or other levels of 
government funding museums.  Many of them are still operating in 
a very healthy fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The museum in Dawson City where I used to live had quite an 
impact on the community.  It helped to shape and save the whole 
community.  When I moved to Dawson City it was a ramshackle town 
of falling down buildings.  Nobody cared a hoot if Dawson City 
washed away into the Klondike River because it was an old ghost 
town with a couple of leftovers still hanging around from an old 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1970 or so Parks Canada had the common sense, prior to all 
this stuff slipping away, to try to hang on to some of the 
artefacts that were disappearing like crazy.  The museum got 
going and started to give value to these products which otherwise 
had no value; they were junk.  Tourists could pick up an artefact 
and take it home, resulting in the history of the place 
disappearing.  It was truly the people with the foresight to 
start the museum who saved the town by giving value to articles 
which otherwise had no value. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dawson Creek has now been rebuilt.  It is a tourist destination, 
a mecca.  The real catalyst was the people, including the Parks 
Canada people to their credit, who had the foresight to start to 
catalogue and chronicle the wonderful rich history of Dawson 
Creed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-64 recognizes the value of Canadian museums and the way 
Canadians feel about their museums.  It does not go as far as 
talking about restoration or overall museum funding—that is not 
the nature of the bill—but it does help and speaks to the value 
that Canadians give to their museums.  Our caucus is proud to 
support Bill C-64. 
<P><A NAME="LINK13"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to rise before the House to debate Bill C-64 at second reading, 
the Canada Travelling Exhibitions Indemnification Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ever since the Liberal government discontinued its cost sharing 
insurance arrangements with our Canadian museums, curators across 
the country have been struggling with the high cost of insurance 
premiums on travelling exhibitions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Depending on the quality of the exhibition in question, 
insurance premiums can cost thousands of dollars.  These high 
costs are a serious deterrent to our museums which are striving 
to provide Canadians with the broadest possible collections of 
art and artefacts.  Without these exhibits Canadians throughout 
the country will be losing out on a very important aspect of our 
cultural heritage. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the main shortcomings of our education system is that it 
does not make full use of our museums as a teaching tool for our 
children. Reading history or art books cannot replace the 
immediate joy that comes from being in direct contact with 
objects or works of art from the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is especially important for young Canadians to be able to see 
what life was like for those who worked hard to build this great 
country of ours so we can reap the benefits today. 
Children must understand what life was like before this era of 
high technology to better understand the supreme efforts 
everyone  must make to be successful in this complex world in 
which we live. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is indemnification for travelling exhibitions?  In essence 
it means that the Canadian government will assume financial risk 
for damages to contents contained within travelling exhibitions. 
This means that the government will pay for loss or damage to 
objects in these exhibitions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only will this indemnification program relieve some of the 
financial burden that is affecting most of Canada's museums.  It 
will also help them negotiate the loan of other prestigious 
foreign exhibitions. 
Having Canada's financial resources to back up foreign 
exhibitions should make it a lot easier to access some of the 
major cultural exhibits from other nations.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned previously, the federal government withdrew its 
support for cost sharing of insurance in 1995.  In the 10 years 
prior to 1995 the federal government invested approximately $6 
million in premiums for commercial insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By creating a government sponsored indemnification program 
Canada will join 14 other industrialized countries that presently 
offer such a program to their respective museums.  Countries like 
the U.S., Great Britain, New Zealand, Australia and France have 
recognized the advantages that such a program has for the 
enhancement of one of their major cultural industries.  The 
eligibility requirements to receive the indemnification program 
will be determined by the value of the individual exhibitions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At present the bill requires that the total value of objects 
must exceed $500,000 to qualify for coverage.  I am concerned 
that by establishing a benchmark of $500,000 for qualification, 
many of the smaller museums in the country will not be able to 
access this funding and will miss out on the intended benefits of 
the program.  I would suggest that we revisit this figure to see 
if we could not arrive at a more reasonable figure that will 
benefit both our small and large museums alike. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The total coverage allotted within the bill would be limited to 
$450 million for exhibitions.  Perhaps this figure could also be 
re-examined when the bill comes before committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For years our Canadian museum representatives have been lobbying 
government to implement an effective government based 
indemnification program.  During meetings in Ottawa of the 
Canadian heritage committee we have had the occasion to meet with 
a number of very distinguished individuals from across the 
country representing our museums, libraries and public archives. 
It was during these hearings that I heard firsthand of the 
significance that such an indemnification program would have on 
our museums.  Subsequently this message was repeated on many 
other occasions as our committee crossed the country to meet 
directly with interested groups and organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. François Lachapelle, directeur general corporation du Musée 
régional de Rimouski, was the first to focus my attention on 
this issue as he discussed possible government initiatives that 
would be very beneficial for our museums.  Allow me to quote Mr. 
Lachapelle: 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>You will understand that moving a national treasure from one 
province to another or to another country is going to be 
extremely costly in terms of insurance because of its great 
value or of the high risk involved in transportation, etc. 
Therefore, the premiums charged by insurance companies will be 
extremely high. That is why this program is very important so 
exhibitions can travel outside Canada. 
</UL>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This sentiment was further supported by Ms. Candace Stevenson, 
executive director of Nova Scotia Museum.  She represents the 25 
provincial museums in my home province.  Ms. Stevenson believes 
this indemnification program will be a tremendous boost for many 
of our institutions, although it is questionable whether any of 
Nova Scotia's museums will actually be able to benefit from it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not take away from the benefits the program, however, 
will have on Canadian museums in general. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the government seems to be responding to the concerns 
expressed by our museums, let us not forget that it is the 
government itself that put Canadian museums in a critical 
situation by making significant cuts to their budgets over the 
last few years. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1972 the initial budget for museum assistance programs 
hovered around $8 million per year.  By the early 1990s their 
budget was increased to a maximum of $15 million despite a 
Canadian Museum Association recommendation for a budget of $25 
million per year.  Last year the Liberal government reduced this 
amount to a paltry $6.5 million, leaving the museum industry 
reeling to try to find alternative financial resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Canadian Heritage has since announced subsequent 
increases to the MAP of $2 million and $1 million respectively, 
putting the 1999 budget at $9.4 million.  This amount does not 
come close to responding to the grave concerns expressed by our 
museum representatives.

invest enormous resources in maintaining their buildings 
themselves, which are often historical landmarks.

the Prime Minister said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This celebration is very much what Canada is all about.  As 
Canadians, many of us today take it for granted that this country 
values equality and fairness.  The experience shows us that was 
not always the case. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed the history of the Sikh community in Canada left a scar 
in our nation's past when the Sikhs on the <I>Komagata Maru</I> 
were refused entry and sent back to India.  Canada has now buried 
the lingering memories of the <I>Komagata Maru</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last Monday's occasion reminds us that out of a people's 
struggle emerges the strength of a nation's citizenship.  We can 
all be proud that Canada is a nation of people who have brought 
to this land diversity, values and honour.

Dental Health Month. 
They all have a common purpose:  to reinforce the elements of 
prevention, from brushing and flossing, to visiting the dentist 
for regular checkups and eating a healthy diet.  Dentistry's 
commitment to prevention is to be commended.  It is a commitment 
that is celebrated during Dental Health Month, but practised all

yesterday the Quebec Minister of Justice, Linda Goupil, spoke 
out against the punitive character of the federal Young 
Offenders Act, because it threatens the preventive approach 
developed by Quebec and because the Quebec model, with its focus 
on rehabilitation, might be forced unwillingly into becoming as 
repressive as the prevailing legislation in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since there is a consensus within Quebec that young offenders 
need help rather than punishment, does the government intend to

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jacques Saada (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General

the same statement I made in committee.  The situation in Quebec 
with respect to young offenders and the province's 
accomplishments in preventing youth crime are totally 
remarkable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That said, the bill before us at this time contains all the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker,

</UL>
<P><A NAME="LINK179"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):</B> 
(a)  The structure of the environmental framework for cleanup: 
The framework for the cleanup will be in accordance with 
the agreement between Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated and Her 
Majesty in the right of Canada as represented by the Minister of National 
Defence for the cleanup and restoration of Distant Early Warning 
sites within the Nunavut settlement area.  This agreement was 
signed in Cambridge Bay on September 1, 1998 and details the 
environmental provisions to carry out the cleanup. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b)  The accumulated and estimated cost of cleanup:  The 
estimated cost for the sites in Nunavut is $200 million, a figure 
established in May 1997 which takes into account escalation 
according to the economic model established by the Department of 
National Defence, DND.  The accumulated cost is $14.2 million, 
actual expenditures April 1, 1996 when the first site cleanup was 
started until September 30, 1998.  The latter expenditures 
include project overhead and administration.  They also include 
project management costs that are not part of the contract values 
listed at (e).  For example, some of the major costs included in 
the accumulated cost total, and not in the contract values, are 
the scientific delineation of contaminated soil, engineering 
survey of upcoming sites and project administration costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(c)  The source of environmental contaminants which have 
contributed to any environmental degradation:  Scientific studies 
carried out between 1989 and 1994 showed that the environmental 
contaminants at the sites are the result of waste disposal 
practices that followed the standards of the day.  PCBs and 
inorganic elements such as copper, lead and zinc, are the 
contaminants of primary concern in soils and surface waters. 
Copper, zinc and cadmium are found in sewage outfalls and 
landfills.  Lead is found in petroleum and oil spills.  Although 
PCBs are detectable in virtually every sample collected in the 
vicinity of the sites, they are present at elevated 
concentrations primarily in outfalls and to a lesser degree in 
landfills and stained areas near pallet lines, storage areas, and 
site buildings.  Leachate waters and soils near the base of some 
landfills contain detectable concentrations of contaminants, 
indicating drainage from a more concentrated source within the 
landfill.  The remaining contamination is restricted to isolated 
spills within the area of station operations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(d)  The health hazards caused by the environmental 
contamination:  The cleanup strategy places special emphasis on 
preventing the movement of chemical contaminants from sources at 
the DEW Line sites into other parts of the Arctic ecosystem. 
There are no immediate health risks.  The cleanup is designed to 
prevent migration of contaminants into the arctic food chain and 
is therefore more stringent than normal protocols in the south. 
The work will prevent any potential chronic or long term impact 
on human health and the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(e)  The list of companies which have received federal 
government contracts for cleanup, and for what amounts:  Cape 
Hooper, FOX-4, was awarded to Qikiqtaaluk Corporation of Iqaluit 
and the value of the contract is $6.8 million.  In 1998 the 
cleanup of Cambridge Bay, CAM-M, was awarded to Kitikmeot 
Corporation of Cambridge Bay and the value of the contract is 
$7.3 million.  The contract value of $6.8 million for cleanup of 
Cape Hooper, FOX-4, has been spent.  The contract for cleanup of 
Cambridge Bay, CAM-M, was awarded in late summer of 1998 and 
only several months of a projected two year cleanup have been 
completed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(f)  The structure of the process used to award contracts:  The 
contracts awarded in Nunavut were negotiated with regional 
aboriginal development corporations.  This was done to build 
confidence in the cleanup standard and to develop the expertise 
of local business so it can compete for future DEW Line cleanup 
contracts.  This practice is in accordance with the spirit and 
letter of the Nunavut land claims agreement.  Future contracts 
will be conducted in a competitive manner if industry shows 
sufficient interest in the process by which this is carried out. 
Should industry not be interested, contracts will be negotiated 
with the designated Inuvialuit-Inuit firm in such a way as to 
arrive at a price satisfactory to all concerned parties.  The 
department will strive for openness, fairness and best value in 
contracting in a matter consistent with the land claim agreements 
and negotiated co-operation agreements with the aboriginal 
development corporations.

cost for the sites in the Inuvialuit settlement region is $73.4 
million, a figure established in May 1997 which takes into 
account escalation according to the economic model established by 
the Department of National Defence, DND. The accumulated cost is 
$24.3 million, actual expenditures April 1, 1996 when the 
first site cleanup was started until September 30, 1998. The 
latter expenditures include project overhead and administration. 
They also include project management costs that are not part of 
the contract values listed at (e). For example, some of the major 
costs included in the accumulated cost total, and not in the 
contract values, are the scientific delineation of contaminated 
soil, engineering survey of upcoming sites and project 
adminstration costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(c) The source of environmental contaminants which have 
contributed to any environmental degradation: Scientific studies 
between 1989 and 1994 showed that the environmental contaminants 
at the sites were the result of waste disposal practices that 
followed the standards of the day. PCBs and inorganic elements 
such as copper, lead and zinc, are the contaminants of primary 
concern in soils and surface waters. Copper, cadmium and zinc 
have been generally confined to sewage outfalls and landfills. 
Lead has been found in petroleum, oil, and lubricant spills. PCB, 
although detectable in virtually every sample collected in the 
vicinity of the sites, are present at elevated concentrations 
primarily in outfalls and to a lesser degree in landfills and 
stained areas near pallet lines, storage areas, and site 
buildings. The source is transformer and hydraulic fluids. 
Leachate waters, and soils near the base of some landfills, 
contain detectable concentrations of contaminants, indicating 
drainage from a more concentrated source within the landfills. 
The remaining contamination appears to be restricted to isolated 
spills within the area of station operations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(d) The health hazards caused by the environmental 
contamination: The cleanup strategy places special emphasis on 
preventing the movement of chemical contaminants from sources at 
the DEW Line sites into other parts of the Arctic ecosystem. 
There are no immediate health risks. The cleanup is designed to 
prevent migration of contaminants in to the arctic food chain and 
is therefore more stringent than normal protocols in the south. 
The work will prevent any potential chronic or long-term impact 
on human health and the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(e) The list of companies which have received federal 
governement contracts for cleanup, and for what amounts: 
Tuktoyaktuk, BAR-3, has been cleaned up by Inuvialuit Projects 
Incorporated of Inuvik. The value of the contract is $2.8 
million. Cape Parry, PIN-M, has been cleaned up by Inuvialuit 
Projects Incorporated of Inuvik. The value of the contract is 
$6.2 million. In 1998 the cleanup of Nicholson peninsula, BAR-4, 
was awarded to Inuvialuit Projects Incorporated and the present 
value of the contract is $9.5 million. The contract value of $2.8 
million for cleanup of Tuktoyaktuk, BAR-3, and the contract value 
of $6.2 for Cape Parry, PIN-M, have been spent. The contract 
total of $9.5 million for cleanup of the Nicholson peninsula, 
BAR-4, has not been completely spent as another year of cleanup 
through 1999 remains. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(f) The structure of the process used to award contracts: All of 
the contracts have been publicly tendered through MERX, formerly 
the open bidding system. Economic provisions form part of the 
co-operation agreement for the project and are included as part of 
the contracts. Within the terms of the Inuvialuit final 
agreement and the co-operation agreement for the project the 
department will strive for openness, fairness and best value in 
contracting.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-64, an 
act to establish an indemnification program for travelling 
exhibitions, be read the second time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK185"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, as I was 
saying prior to question period, museums are more than just an 
historical account of a time and place within Canadian history. 
Museums contribute enormously to our local economies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to Mr. Robert Janes, president and chief executive 
officer of Glenbow Museum in Calgary, museums in Canada 
contribute $1 billion annually to the gross domestic product 
which includes 35,000 jobs, directly and indirectly, as well as 
$650 million in labour income.  These figures suggest that this 
particular cultural industry is a very significant contributor to 
Canada's economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada travelling exhibitions indemnification act could be a 
very effective tool in helping Canadian museums bring in more 
attractive exhibitions enticing a greater participation from both 
Canadian and foreign audiences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Already, current statistics indicate over 55 million visitors a 
year enter Canada's approximately 2,000 museums.  This is a very 
impressive number of visitors.  The credit for this success 
belongs to our dedicated museum staff along with the 50,000 
volunteers who devote their time and energy toward helping 
maintain an important element of Canadian history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned previously, the bill responds to a certain need 
within our museum industry.  However, much more needs to be done. 
I am encouraged by this government initiative.  I believe it is a 
step in the right direction.  I therefore support sending the 
bill to committee for further review.

<P><A NAME="LINK188"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC)</B> 
moved: 
<A NAME="LINK189">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the Criminal Code or other 
appropriate federal statutes should be amended in accordance with 
Recommendation 73 of the Province of Nova Scotia's Public Inquiry 
into the Westray disaster, specifically with the goal of ensuring 
that corporate executives and directors are held properly 
accountable for workplace safety. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
Cumberland—Colchester, my neighbouring member of parliament, for 
his seconding of this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion M-455 pertains particularly to one terrible moment in 
time, almost seven years ago in the small community of Plymouth 
in Pictou county, Nova Scotia when a terrible explosion ripped 
through the Westray coal mine. I will reiterate the motion: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the Criminal Code or other 
appropriate federal statutes should be amended in accordance with 
Recommendation 73 of the Province of Nova Scotia's Public Inquiry 
into the Westray disaster, specifically with the goal of ensuring 
that corporate executives and directors are held properly 
accountable for workplace safety. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take a brief moment to thank the draggermen who 
were involved very much in the marvellous and incredible efforts 
that were made to attempt to locate the 26 men who lost their 
lives underground that tragic day on May 9, 1992.  Many of those 
draggermen came from Cape Breton.  Surely Cape Breton is a place 
unlike any other in this country.  It has had more than its share 
of tragedy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The overriding attempt behind this motion would be to remind 
government and in fact all parliamentarians that we in this place 
and in provincial legislatures throughout the country must do 
everything in our power to ensure that there is a safe workplace 
for those who are engaged in labour activity.  I speak not only 
of mines.  I speak of fish plants.  I speak of fishermen, of 
course, fisherpersons on the water.  I speak of any factory and 
any situation where workers might find themselves encountering 
danger. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The method to do this is through enactment of legislation.  As 
we are all aware, that is sometimes a very daunting prospect to 
put somehow into law provisions that will encourage those in the 
industry to abide by these legislative initiatives to ensure 
safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest quite strongly that knowing criminal sanctions or 
other disciplinary acts of retribution exist is the most direct 
way to ensure that those with the implicit responsibility for 
ensuring safety will abide.  This would lead to a higher level of 
accountability among executives, CEOs and management in companies 
that directly benefit from what might be phrased expediency over 
safety in the workplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion is based upon a recommendation, historically for 
reference purposes, that came from the Westray mine public 
inquiry which was conducted by Mr. Justice Peter Richard, a very 
prominent judge in the province of Nova Scotia. It was tabled in 
1997 after a very lengthy public inquiry into the explosion at 
the Westray mine in Plymouth, Nova Scotia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also important to note that for a partial period of time 
simultaneous to this public inquiry, a criminal prosecution was 
proceeding through the courts at various levels and eventually 
went all the way to the Supreme Court of Canada. The prosecutors 
in this case had a very difficult time presenting evidence. There 
was much procedural interference, one might suggest, in terms of 
the presentation of evidence to the courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I knew many of the prosecutors who were involved in that case. 
Peter Rosinski, Herman Felderholf, Andrew MacDonald and others 
worked extremely hard, very diligently to present the evidence on 
behalf of the crown.  Similarly, I acknowledge the work of the 
defence counsel who, in fairness, were presenting evidence to the 
contrary and certainly doing their very best to defend their 
clients, as is their lot.

<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, one might suggest because of the interpretation of the 
Criminal Code provisions, particularly those that refer to 
criminal negligence and manslaughter, these are provisions of the 
code that anyone having practised law will be quick to 
acknowledge are sometimes very blurry in terms of the evidentiary 
proof that is required to obtain a conviction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not at all suggesting the Criminal Code provisions are the 
only provisions that should be examined in the context of 
improving these situations for workers in the workplace. However, 
this is certainly the starting point and one would suggest it is 
in keeping with the recommendations of Mr. Justice Richard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 220 of the Criminal Code refers specifically to criminal 
negligence causing death; similarly section 234 refers to 
manslaughter.  There may be the need as well to introduce 
amendments to these sections that would broaden the scope of 
culpability, or perhaps even go so far as to make specific 
reference to executives, directors, persons in management 
positions, persons who, one could draw the inference, are in a 
position of trust when it comes to the supervision of a 
workplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I brought this motion forward with the hope that the explosion 
at the Westray mine in Plymouth will not be forgotten.  I can 
assure the House and Canadians generally that those in Pictou 
county and in all of Nova Scotia certainly recall with horror 
that period of time in May 1992 when this terrible tragedy 
occurred. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More important I think at this time the recommendations of the 
inquiry themselves should not be forgotten so that this tragedy 
would not have been in vain.  It is in the hope that we in this 
place would learn lessons from what occurred at the Westray mine 
and we might somehow go forward from this point in attempting to 
prevent something like this from ever happening again.  Surely 
when it comes to the criminal law, in fact when it comes to the 
passing of legislation, one of the first and foremost obligations 
that should be in the minds of legislators is that of prevention 
and that of improving the quality of life of those affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The devastation of that Mother's Day nearly seven years ago has 
left a long and painful memory in the hearts and minds of miners 
in the province of Nova Scotia. The explosion at the Westray coal 
mine sent a very chilling message to persons. The message was 
that haste and sometimes political expediency and sometimes the 
pursuit of financial gain can often put persons in danger when it 
comes to this type of enterprise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The death of the 26 coal miners was so foreign and unexpected to 
a peaceful community like Plymouth that from the very second that 
those fathers, brothers and sons were taken away from their 
families, people were left immediately thinking of ways that such 
a tragedy could have been prevented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can only add to that the feelings the recent shooting in 
Colorado conjured up for me and others, the harsh reality of how 
quickly an entire community can be affected in such a way.  I am 
sure the people of Littleton, Colorado are feeling some of the 
same emotions, although on a different level and certainly a 
different level of criminal act. However, I would suggest the 
immediacy and the sudden impact is similar to what was felt in 
the community of Plymouth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It alarms us all to no end that such tragedies can occur and 
that no change results.  The circumstances of the Westray mine 
cannot be forgotten and the lessons learned.  To take it one 
extension further, the efforts made with respect to the tabling 
of the Westray inquiry only to sit idle on a shelf and to not be 
adopted or at least examined further, taken that one step further 
by the Department of Labour, is again an abdication of a 
responsibility that exists within the federal parliament. It is 
painful and I would suggest puzzling to suggest that we will do 
nothing further at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Westray was the only operating underground coal mine in Pictou 
county at the time of the explosion.  Although Pictou county 
itself has a long and rich tradition of coal mining, this Pictou 
coalfield had been mined for nearly 200 years.  The elements of 
the disaster that rest in the nature of coal mining with thick 
and gassy seams is something that Pictonians have become very 
familiar with.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Foord seam itself, which was being mined by the Westray 
corporation or Curragh Inc., has hosted at least eight mines. 
The Allan shaft, the most productive and the one that lay just 
northwest of the Westray workings, finally closed in the 1950s. 
During its 40 year lifetime it experienced no less than eight 
methane explosions which on many occasions it is suggested were 
the result of unsafe working conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a chilling foreshadow that existed in this community. 
One would draw the conclusion that proper research conducted into 
those dangerous conditions might in some way have entered into 
the preventative efforts that should have been made. It is easy 
to look back on it and to perhaps have 20/20 vision in hindsight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I reiterate that the gist of this motion is to not let lie that 
report to gather dust on some shelf somewhere in this precinct 
when we can gain knowledge and insight into what hopefully could 
be prevented in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fundamental and basic responsibilities for the safe 
operation of an underground coal mine and indeed any industrial 
undertaking rests very much with owners and managers.  Westray 
management, starting with the CEO, was required by law and 
certainly by good business practices and good conscience to 
design and operate a mine safely. Westray management after the 
fact certainly came under attack for shirking that 
responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The significance of that failure cannot be overstated or 
mitigated.  Simply because others were also abdicating their 
responsibilities is not an answer. Shared responsibility can be 
said to be implicit in the recommendations that came from Mr. 
Justice Richard's report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As in the criminal context, in the civil context as well we are 
certainly aware that shared responsibility is something that can 
be encompassed by the law.  There was plenty of blame to go 
around in the Westray report.  That statement itself is 
reflective of the findings of Mr. Justice Richard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only in the mining industry but in any business venture, 
corporate executives sometimes seem less interested in the merits 
of workplace safety and simply in the pursuit of profit. This is 
a very dangerous situation that can exist.  We must be mindful of 
this.  This mindset itself is precisely what sets a dangerous 
tone in a workplace where tragedies and the creation of unsafe 
working conditions may exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Business executives and corporate executives should be prepared 
to seek input from front line workers and allow them as employees 
to be part of the management scheme to a degree when it comes to 
safety.  They should be relied upon to lend their knowledge to 
create the maintenance of a safe work environment.  That is 
something that was also acknowledged in the report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not a politically popular thing to say, but there was an 
element of culpability and responsibility on the workers 
themselves.  This has to be taken into the entire context of what 
should occur as far as legislative initiatives to ensure 
accountability and responsibility is held by all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Businesses must also ensure that they have sufficiently trained 
employees in that area.  This is where the top down and bottom up 
approaches must be encompassed in any legislative initiative 
aimed at workplace safety.  I suggest and emphasize that 
particularly when it comes to the operation of a traditionally 
dangerous work environment where equipment, often heavy 
equipment, is being utilized in the operation of that enterprise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Businesses must also ensure that their employees are adequately 
supervised and constantly updated on safe work practices.  Part 
and parcel of that of the companies, the executives and the 
workers, there is also a strong need for bureaucratic 
responsibility and bureaucratic supervision.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mine and labour safety standards were ignored, sadly, in the 
case of Westray, or at least not adhered to to the extent they 
should have been.  Looking at this issue in the larger context 
there must also be attachment of responsibility to government 
officials who are negligent in the performance of their duties 
that result in such horrific outcomes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sadly in the past we have all witnessed poorly trained 
individuals on the job where proper training had perhaps not been 
offered that sometimes resulted in injury or loss of life.  Not 
only is that practice bad for business but it has the 
incalculable human consequence.  It is also unsafe for people on 
the job where they are operating equipment.  They are not only 
endangering themselves but also their fellow workers are at risk 
if the person is not properly trained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the overall context, this goes right to the top and is 
something that management has to be made aware of, constantly 
reminded of.  I look forward to hearing from the minister on this 
point.  There have been efforts made in the past but this is a 
continuing process that will have to be revisited.  We hope it 
can be revisited or that this motion may in some small part help 
in the impetus of looking for ways to legislate safety in the 
workplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is essential that companies take the time to train employees 
so that additional risk is limited for employees and those around 
them.  Management must ensure that the employees have an 
appreciation for any special dangers that may be inherent on a 
job site. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of the Westray coal mine, many tradespersons were 
prone to perform unsafe tasks or take dangerous shortcuts in 
their work, never once being told differently by management of 
the huge potential that did exist in a mine as gassy and as 
potentially explosive as the Foord seam.  In many cases there was 
no question that management may have been aware, or ought to have 
been aware, that safe mining practices were not being performed 
by the workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As stated in Mr. Justice Richard's report, there was a strong 
indication that Westray management was aware that levels of 
methane underground to which the coal miners were exposed were 
very hazardous and potentially explosive. Under section 72 of the 
Coal Mines Regulation Act such conditions mandated the withdrawal 
of workers from affected areas, and that of course is what one 
must presume prevented management from acting quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It stands to reason that when weighing business goals versus 
those of safety, sometimes businesses find themselves on the 
horns of a dilemma.  They have to make production deadlines. 
They have to produce and shutting an operation down obviously has 
huge financial consequences.  That is where the human element and 
the safe discretion must be exercised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we need to remind executives and management and CEOs of this 
through legislation, I say we do it.  It is implicit upon us that 
we act. Far too often businesses, and indeed heads of 
corporations, may be tempted by that financial gain and therefore 
put the safety of workers second.  That type of short term gain 
could be for long term pain as we saw in the case of Westray.  Of 
course I speak of the injury or death that can result.  It is a 
very sad scenario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tough economic times that exist in the country put further 
pressure on workers.  That is why this is so timely.  The 
economic impact of having to shut down a corporation affects 
everyone in the company.  The employees, the management, the 
board of directors, anyone associated with that business is going 
to feel a negative impact if there has to be an operational 
shutdown as a result of a potential breach of safety. But that is 
the cost of doing business and we have to do everything to ensure 
that those safe practices will be followed.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Companies must ensure that to avoid practising hazardous or 
illegal practices these acts cannot be condoned in any capacity. 
In some instances they are acts of omission that can result in 
the greatest harm as opposed to acts of commission. Companies, if 
they have not already done so, should do everything within their 
power to implement safe, ethical work practices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ethics such as this should be studied and followed everywhere in 
places of employment, even in upper management.  If this is not 
the case, action must be taken to demonstrate the importance and 
the seriousness of the issue.  Business executives must promote 
and nurture safe work ethics and have an open and approachable 
attitude toward their employees.  No one ever wants to feel the 
effects we felt in Plymouth with the Westray mine.

Speaker, I would first like to say this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can certainly relate to the victims of Westray. My father and 
my uncle once worked in mines in the United States. Fortunately, 
they were never victims of a tragedy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My father-in-law was a mineworker in Belgium and he survived the 
two worst disasters—explosions—that ever struck Belgian mines. In 
the early fifties, he was decorated by the Belgian government 
for his acts of heroism. He had saved victims of explosion in 
one mine. I am only too aware of what a tragedy this is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion brought forward in the House deals with the safety of 
Canadian workers. Since this government has always been 
concerned with the safety and welfare of workers, I am happy, as 
a government member, to have this opportunity to comment on the 
motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First I want to tell the member who moved the motion that I 
share his concerns about safety in the workplace. The Westray 
tragedy, which the motion refers to, brought back to the 
attention of Canadians the issue of occupational safety. This is 
a very important issue that our government is taking very 
seriously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are very much aware of the high costs of work accidents, in 
terms of human suffering in particular, as well as financial 
hardship, because of the substantial expenses incurred as a 
result of accidents and occupational diseases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every year, many workers die in work related accidents and 
thousands of others suffer from work related injuries and 
sickness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every year, millions of workdays are lost. The human cost is 
extremely high. The cost to the Canadian economy is about $10 
billion a year. The human and economic costs are way too high 
and something must be done soon. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend the member for bringing this issue before the House. 
He has identified an issue that should be of concern to all 
members.  Although I do commend the member for raising his 
concerns with respect to workplace safety, I want to look a 
little more critically at the recommendations for legislative 
change that the motion includes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 455 asks that the House amend appropriate federal 
statutes, including the Criminal Code.  These are far reaching 
recommendations.  I think it is appropriate that we look at them 
more carefully. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, while the Criminal Code is under the jurisdiction 
of the federal government, which can amend it to make sure it 
applies to the responsibility for occupational safety, the 
provinces and territories consider that this type or amendment 
would erode their right to legislate on occupational safety.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know very well that the issue of federal and provincial 
jurisdiction in many other areas of economic and social policy 
is very delicate. We do not want to open up a whole new can of 
worms. I certainly do not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, while the intent of the motion is very laudable, 
the proposed changes could have constitutional implications, 
which, though not intentional, could be very unfortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, the Canada Labour Code already provides for 
occupational safety and imposes fines and sanctions against 
those who are convicted of an offence under the code. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As anyone who follows labour legislation in Canada knows, 
legislation concerning occupational safety and health in the 
federal jurisdiction is consolidated under the Canada Labour 
Code.  The code has jurisdiction over a broad range of industries 
under federal jurisdiction, but only those which operate under 
federal jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are these industries?  Typically these are businesses whose 
operations are interprovincial or international in nature.  Some 
examples that I can cite are railways, highway transport, 
telecommunications, pipelines, shipping, radio and TV 
broadcasting, banks, and other areas which I will not name. In 
addition the occupational safety and health provisions of the 
code cover employees of the federal public service including 
employees of some 40 crown corporations and agencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we debate the motion, it is very important to look at where 
we are starting from with respect to the Canada Labour Code and 
specifically with respect to part II of that code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part II of the Canada Labour Code is the legislation that is 
already in place to govern occupational health and safety in 
federal works, undertakings and businesses.  This legislation is 
intended to prevent accidents and injuries arising out of, linked 
with, or occurring in the course of employment which is subject 
to federal jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation is based on three fundamental rights for all 
workers who come under federal jurisdiction.  These fundamental 
rights are: the right to know about known or foreseeable hazards 
in the workplace; the right to participate in identifying and 
resolving job related safety and health problems; and the right 
to refuse dangerous work if the employee has reasonable cause to 
believe that a situation constitutes a danger to himself, to 
herself or to another employee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This code also includes a set of occupational safety and health 
regulations that prescribe standards and procedures for both 
employers and employees to follow. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If these standards are not met, by virtue of part II of the 
code, senior managers and directors of federally regulated 
companies can be held responsible. If found guilty of a code 
offence, senior managers and directors are liable on summary 
conviction of a maximum fine of up to $100,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the code, an individual found guilty by way of indictment 
is liable to a maximum fine of $1 million and a maximum prison 
term of two years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Next Wednesday, April 28, to mark the National Day of Mourning, 
the Canadian flag will be flown at half mast on Parliament Hill 
in memory of all those who where killed or injured at work.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of this special day is to heighten our awareness of 
our tremendous responsibilities regarding health and security in 
the workplace. Moreover, the North American Occupational Safety 
and Health Week, which will be held in May, will help raise 
awareness of this issue among Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada, partners of the annual awareness campaign include the 
Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety and the 
Canadian Society of Safety Engineering, which co-operate with the 
labour program. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the federal jurisdiction we already have a set of standards 
and sanctions in place which govern workplace safety issues and 
hold corporate officers and directors liable for their actions in 
case of negligence or wrongdoing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it is fair to say we still have a problem in the case 
of all those workers who are outside federal jurisdiction and who 
therefore are not covered by the Canada Labour Code.  It is this 
question we must examine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must also examine the part of the motion which concerns 
recommendation no. 73 that the province of Nova Scotia made 
following the public enquiry.  It requests—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it is a pleasure today to speak to Motion No. 455.  The 
potential exists in terms of corporate responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the most dramatic examples of negligence on the part of 
corporate Canada was the 1992 Westray explosion which killed 26 
miners.  It was a disaster that did not need to happen, but it 
did.  My hon. colleague from the Conservative Party should be 
commended for putting this motion forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 455 deals with some very hard questions. It states 
very clearly that corporate executives cannot hide behind their 
titles when they engage in behaviour that has proven to be 
negligent or harmful to the people working under them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must also ensure that Motion No. 455 is not used as a cudgel 
to slam on the head of the executive world when it is not 
negligent and not responsible.  In other words, we cannot use it 
as an action to make the corporate world responsible for things 
when it is not. 
We want to ensure that individuals, inside and outside corporate 
Canada, are dealt with equally and fairly under the law. 
Executives will not be able to hide behind their job titles in 
the commission of their duties.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also looking at a larger paradigm shift.  We should look 
at the issue of corporate responsibility and the opportunities 
that exist.  Historically, we have not examined the enormous 
opportunities the corporate world has for social good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some companies have done an incredible job, such as Ben & 
Jerry's in the United States.  It is a great giver and has an 
enormous amount of social concern and responsibility.  Through 
its company, it has managed to improve the health and welfare of 
those people who are less privileged than most of us.  There are 
many examples of companies in Canada that have used their powers 
as corporations to help individuals in our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Corporate Canada has two roles:  to make a profit, which is 
extremely important, and to provide jobs and such that makes our 
country run.  Profit is a good thing but a balance has to be 
struck between making a profit and the cost that is sometimes 
incurred by the behaviour of those companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have not looked at the balance between making a profit and 
ensuring that a company is ethical and is not engaging in 
activities which could hurt the collective good and the people. 
We must have a balance between making a profit and the actions of 
the company and the costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Southwest Airlines in the United States is thriving and making a 
huge profit, but it is also very socially responsible.  It treats 
its employees fairly and does an incredible social job within its 
region.  This company has managed to strike the balance between 
profit making and corporate responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather than sacrificing profits, Southwest Airlines is one of 
the healthiest airlines in the United States.  It is healthy 
because it managed to marry corporate responsibility with profit 
and managed to ensure that its employees bought into this 
exciting paradigm shift. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Profit sharing on the part of the employees and the owners is a 
very good thing.  It actually ensures that their employees will 
derive benefits from their actions.  This tends to make employees 
work harder and more effectively, which would benefit the 
company. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This change or paradigm shift in our thinking of corporate 
responsibility does need to be applied just to the private 
sector.  It can be applied to government.  Why not have public 
service employees deriving financial benefits from doing their 
jobs.  If a department was able to meet or cut its budget then a 
percentage of that could be shared by the employees of that 
department.  Right now we do not have that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, when a government department sees it is going to have a 
surplus at the end of the year, it tries to spend the surplus so 
it will not have its budget cut in the next year.  Why not give a 
percentage of that savings to the people who have, through their 
actions of wise spending and through their responsible actions as 
employees, managed to save money for the taxpayer.  The taxpayer 
would still derive the benefit because their money would not have 
been wasted.  The people who made sure that they spent wisely 
would also derive a financial benefit.  It is a win-win 
situation.  It would also ensure that the public sector would be 
working more effectively, which we would all applaud.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of corporate responsibility can also be applied to the 
actions of corporations internationally.  Actions by corporations 
have destroyed environments and decimated social structures 
abroad.  We mentioned the issue of the Sydney tar ponds where 
actions by companies clearly poisoned the surrounding 
environment. We cannot allow this to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 455 brings up a very exciting point about making 
those people who engage in that type of behaviour responsible. 
It also provides a window for the other side of the coin which is 
to use the private sector for the public good. The beauty of 
Motion No. 455 is that it deals with both sides. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The explicit part of Motion No. 455 is a punitive one which must 
be done and should be looked at least.  We believe in studying 
this to ensure that companies cannot compromise the health and 
welfare of their employees and other people. Also there lies an 
opportunity to do public good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some companies that work abroad work in very impoverished lands. 
We must also consider those companies that work in impoverished 
lands or in countries where a despot is abusing the people, such 
as what occurred in Nigeria in the past.  Canadian companies 
working in those areas should have an obligation to invest part 
of their profits into social programs for the people, basic 
programs such as health and education.  Companies must also 
ensure that their employees are paid fairly, not on a Canadian 
wage basis, but in terms of the country in which they are 
operating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a very powerful thing for the surrounding people in that 
country.  Canadian companies working abroad can be used as a 
powerful tool for ensuring social stability and improving the 
social structures within countries which in many cases are some 
of the most impoverished lands in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to wrap up so I will summarize by saying that Motion No. 
455 has some excellent points.  I commend the member from the 
Conservative Party for putting it forward.  We need to study this 
to ensure that those in corporate Canada do not hide behind their 
titles and abuse the people.  The other side is to use this as a 
window for corporate Canada to engage in public good not only 
within our country but also abroad.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I am pleased to take part in the first hour of debate on Motion 
M-455, moved by the hon. member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, 
which reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the Criminal Code or other 
appropriate federal statutes should be amended in accordance 
with Recommendation 73 of the Province of Nova Scotia's Public 
Inquiry into the Westray disaster, specifically with the goal of 
ensuring that corporate executives and directors are held 
properly accountable for workplace safety. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us first look at the facts surrounding the Westray mine 
tragedy and all the proceedings that led to the commission's 
report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On May 9, 1992, an explosion occurred at the Westray mine, 
killing 26 workers. On May 15 of that same year, the Government 
of Nova Scotia appointed Mr. Justice Peter Richard to head a 
commission of inquiry established under the Public Inquiries 
Act. Mr. Justice Richard was also appointed special investigator 
under the Coal Mining Regulation Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The commission had a very broad mandate, so as to shed light on 
the explosion and all the related circumstances. In fact, Nova 
Scotia's premier at the time, Donald Cameron, was very clear 
about that mandate: 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Justice Richard's inquiry will not be limited to the events 
of the early morning of May 9.  Nothing and no person with any 
light to shed on this tragedy will escape the scrutiny of this 
inquiry. 
</UL>
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The commission's work thus began immediately, to prepare for the 
public hearings set to begin on October 19, 1992. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Curragh Resources Inc. and Westray's management challenged the 
validity of the order in council establishing the commission of 
inquiry, and this, as members can imagine, led to numerous legal 
proceedings. 
Because of these delays, the Richard report was tabled only five 
years later, in November 1997.

<A HREF="#LINKT35"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report, entitled “The Westray Story: A Predictable Path to 
Disaster”, contains 74 recommendations. It concluded in general 
that this tragedy could have been avoided if minimal 
occupational safety standards had been met. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, the employers' obligations in terms of occupational 
health and safety fall under provincial jurisdiction. So, before 
determining if the employers were negligent or made a mistake, 
it is important to find out what their obligations are pursuant 
to the relevant legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Nova Scotia, mining is regulated by three pieces of 
legislation, the Mineral Resources Act, the Occupational Health 
and Safety Act and the Coal Mines Regulation Act. Mr. Justice 
Richard reviewed all of these provincial acts and concluded that 
their main purpose was to ensure the safety of the workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, we have seen many examples of occupational safety 
in the workplace taking second place behind the bottom line, 
especially in the mining industry, where the very nature of the 
work involves a lot of risk. So, it is the duty of company 
officers to ensure that the work is done in the safest possible 
conditions. We need only think of the tragedy that occurred in 
the 1980s at the Balmoral gold mine in Abiliti, killing eight 
workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Frédéric Le Play, a 19th century French sociologist, wrote “The 
most important thing that should come out of a mine is the miner 
himself”. Mr. Justice Richard therefore concluded that Nova 
Scotia should revise its legislation on occupational health and 
safety in order to make coal mining safer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our main concern today is recommendation 73 of the report. It is 
addressed to the federal government and deals with Criminal Code 
amendments on the responsibility of directors for safety in the 
workplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The commissioner made this recommendation because of the 
criminal proceedings undertaken while Mr. Justice Richard's 
public inquiry was underway. On April 20, 1993, the RCMP 
announced that charges were being laid against Curragh Resources 
Inc., as well as Gerald Phillips and Roger Parry, two members of 
the mine's management. !gerald sur le net 
They were charged with criminal negligence and homicide under 
sections 220 and 222(5) of the Criminal Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the court found that those charges were too vague for the 
accused to be able to put up an appropriate defence, other 
charges were laid, based on infractions under provincial laws on 
occupational safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why Mr. Justice Richard made recommendation 73. If we 
are to understand clearly the meaning of the motion before the 
House, we should first have a look at recommendation 73 of the 
Westray mine public inquiry: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada, through the Department of Justice, 
should institute a study of the accountability of corporate 
executives and directors for the wrongful or negligent acts of 
the corporation and should introduce in the Parliament of Canada 
such amendments to legislation as are necessary to ensure that 
corporate executives and directors are held properly accountable 
for workplace safety. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current effectiveness of the provisions of the Criminal Code 
dealing with the accountability of corporate executives with 
regard to workplace safety is of concern to us. This is why we 
believe this issue should be looked at from a general 
perspective and not solely within the context of the Westray 
mine. 
In our view, criminal proceedings against Westray mine officers, 
which have proved fruitless so far, were affected by the climate 
created by the public enquiry. Therefore, the study should 
ensure that the provisions of the Criminal Code complement the 
provisions in the various provincial statutes dealing with 
workplace safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support the member's motion. An in-depth and thorough review 
of the issue must take place before any legislative changes are 
introduced. Recommendation 73 clearly proposes that a study take 
place prior to making any such changes. We believe, and I hope 
my colleague who is sponsoring this motion will agree with me, 
it would be more appropriate for the Standing Committee on 
Justice and Human Rights to undertake this study.

the following: “, following a study by the Standing Committee on

</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our opinion this amendment clarifies the motion and is in 
keeping with recommendation 73.  With this amendment, the 
Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights would be charged 
with carrying out the study referred to in recommendation 73 by 
the commission of inquiry. We could then have clear reason to 
amend the Criminal Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> In my opinion the amendment 
is in order.

<P><A NAME="LINK201"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney—Victoria, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
it is a pleasure to rise today to address the motion of my 
colleague from Nova Scotia, the member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough.  It is also my pleasure to 
indicate that he will have, as he knows, my support on the 
motion.  He will have the support of our party as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His motion calls for the government to act upon recommendation 
No. 73 of the public inquiry of the province of Nova Scotia into 
the Westray disaster and to amend the Criminal Code accordingly. 
It mirrors very much a bill that was introduced by the leader of 
our party in relation to the Westray disaster in January 1999. 
Our bill details the specific changes to the Criminal Code 
required to address the concerns of corporate liability and 
workplace safety as indicated in the Westray report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I began by saying the hon. member knows he will have my support. 
I come from the same province.  I come from a coal mining 
community.  I remember well the Westray disaster because that day 
I was not in Nova Scotia.  My wife and I had taken some time and 
were outside the province.  When we called home and spoke to the 
caregiver who was looking after our children we did not talk 
about the weather.  We did not talk a whole lot.  The first thing 
we were apprised of was the situation in Westray. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is perhaps difficult for those who do not live in mining 
communities to understand the impact of that news. Coming from 
Cape Breton we knew that it would be our friends and colleagues 
who would volunteer to go into those mines to find the bodies of 
the 26 coal miners who were killed, and they did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those who live in communities where there are coal mines, 
for those who live in industrial communities, it is difficult to 
describe how ingrained and how we know that disaster lurks around 
the corner.  When a whistle blows, when there is the sound of an 
explosion from the blast furnace, when we look at the changing 
colour of the sky and the fishermen are out on the water, we know 
that there will be disaster. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We live with that reality every day.  The miners in Stellarton 
live with that.  The miners in Sydney mines and New Waterford 
live with that and the fishermen live with that.  It colours the 
way we react. 
There is some romance around that but it leads to certain harsh 
realities.  It leads to some good realities.  It leads to the way 
we share things.  It leads to a sense of community.  It leads to 
a sense of humour that is mirrored in the works of our poets and 
artists and in the songs of our musicians.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We live with the frustrating knowledge that corporations which 
exploit workers in areas of high unemployment in dangerous 
settings literally get away with murder.  It is that reality 
which the motion and the New Democratic Party's bill seek to 
address. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say this having listened to the speaker on the government 
side.  I will not dwell on it, but one of the real concerns we 
have as the government dismantles the Cape Breton Development 
Corporation is that it will move to a private mine without a 
union under provincial jurisdiction, without the protections we 
now have, which were the very circumstances that led to the 
disaster at Westray.  I urge the government to bear that in mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are ways to prevent this.  One way is to accept the motion 
and the New Democratic Party's bill.  I will read from the 
wording of Justice Richard in the Westray report: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The <I>Westray Story</I> is a complex mosaic of actions, 
omissions, mistakes, incompetence, apathy, cynicism, stupidity, 
neglect—Viewed in context, these seemingly isolated incidents 
constitute a mindset or operating philosophy that appears to 
favour expediency over intelligent planning and that trivializes 
safety concerns.  Indeed, management at Westray displayed a 
certain disdain for safety and appeared to regard safety 
conscious workers as the wimps in the organization.  To its 
discredit, the management at Westray, through either incompetence 
or ignorance, lost sight of the basic tenet of coal mining that 
safe mining is good business. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tale that unfolds in the Westray report is a story of 
incompetence, of mismanagement, of bureaucratic bungling, of 
deceit, of ruthlessness, of cover-up, of apathy, of expediency 
and of cynical indifference.  It is a tragic story with the 
inevitable moments of pathos and heroism.  The Westray story 
concerns an event that in all good common sense ought not to have 
occurred.  It did occur and that is our unfortunate legacy.  It 
is in fact our unfortunate tragedy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are ways to stop this.  There are ways to stop criminal 
murder by corporations of their workers.  That is what our bill 
will seek to address and that is what the motion seeks to 
address.  There are ways it can be done by amending the Criminal 
Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that report Justice Richard pointed out those ways.  He 
suggested that there be a new criminal offence that would impose 
criminal liability on directors or others responsible for failing 
to ensure their corporation maintains an appropriate standard of 
occupational health and safety in the workplace, a criminal 
offence of corporate killing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Justice Richard said “in the context of Westray these deserve 
consideration”.  They deserve more than consideration; they 
demand action.  Recommendation No. 73 states that the Government 
of Canada through the Department of Justice should institute a 
study of the accountability of corporate executives and directors 
for the wrongful or negligent acts of corporations and should 
introduce in the Parliament of Canada such amendments to 
legislation as are necessary to ensure that corporate executives 
and directors are held accountable for workplace study. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only disagreement I have with this is the call for more 
study.  We do not need more study.  We need legislation.  That is 
why we intend to introduce a bill complementing the motion of my 
colleague from Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough which will amend 
the Criminal Code to make this law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not the first time it has been raised.  I quote from the 
Law Reform Commission of Canada back in 1976 which stated: 
“While the goals of many of our corporations, profit and growth, 
spur important advances in the technologies of production and—” 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I am afraid that the 
time provided for the consideration of Private Members' Business 
has now expired and the order is dropped to the bottom of the 
order of precedence on the order paper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member will have about three minutes left the next time 
this is brought back to the House. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It being 1.15 p.m., the House stands adjourned until Monday next 
at 11 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(The House adjourned at 1.15 p.m.)
