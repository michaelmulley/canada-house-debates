</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke—Lakeshore, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the Christmas season is a time of joy and happiness for 
many Canadian children, yet for one unknown young child this will 
not be the case.  Last Tuesday the people of Etobicoke—Lakeshore 
were shocked to learn that the body of an unidentified child was 
found dismembered in Colonel Samuel Smith Park, a local park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The death of this child is an example of the kind of violence 
that, when perpetrated, affects us all.  Our communities will not 
be whole or functional until we can identify this child and find 
the perpetrators.  The lives of our children are too precious not 
to warrant our protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we mourn the tragic death of this child let us take the time 
to reflect and take action on the things that threaten children's 
lives.  We must work to ensure that children are safe in 
Etobicoke—Lakeshore and in all communities across our great 
country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta—South Richmond, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, Santa Claus announced today that he will be moving his 
entire Canadian operation to the South Pole early next year.  The 
reason?  The excessively high taxes imposed by this Liberal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An obviously distraught Claus told a packed news conference that 
all aspects of his operation are overtaxed and that he is simply 
not prepared to pay any more. “It is becoming increasingly 
impossible to get the elves to work overtime”, said Claus. 
“Liberal payroll taxes rip their paycheques in half”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“The excessive burden of provincial taxes, federal excise taxes 
and the GST are driving the price of reindeer fuel out of 
sight”, said R. N. Reindeer, chief of Claus' transportation 
division.  “Our accountants say the best way to escape the 
Liberals' juggernaut is to move to the South Pole and to operate 
Santa's sleigh under a Liberian flag of convenience”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“Our agenda has always been a children's agenda”, said a 
tearful Mrs. Claus.  “Once Liberal taxes have shut us down, who 
are the kids going to write to at Christmastime, Revenue 
Canada?”

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jacques Saada (Brossard—La Prairie, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have some good news, very good news, for the Gaspé region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On December 13, the Minister of National Revenue and Secretary 
of State responsible for the Economic Development Agency of 
Canada for the Regions of Quebec announced that the Conseil de 
développement économique de Murdochville will be receiving a 
contribution of $377,000 for four prefeasibility studies aimed 
at determining the most promising areas for investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is one of a series of measures undertaken by the Government 
of Canada in the past 24 months within the region.  Some $28 
million have been injected into programs specifically designed 
for the Gaspé—Îles-de-la-Madeleine region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should point out as well that an envelope of $20 million is 
still available for productive projects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is just one more fine example of the Government of Canada's 
concrete support to the process of restructuring the economy of 
the Gaspé—Îles-de-la-Madeleine region.

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The constant decrease in youth crime and the positive results 
achieved by the provinces that implement all the components of 
the Young Offenders Act should convince Canadians, provided they 
are adequately informed, that the implementation of Bill C-3 
would be a costly and useless measure.

continue to turn a deaf ear to the message sent by those who 
have been defending Quebec's expertise for decades.

this unjustified panic among the Liberals, who would rather 
upstage the Reformers when it comes to juvenile crime.

justice system, when it should be doing everything it can to 
support that system.

adversarial approach.  The federal government appointed the board 
of the authority and I ask that the government ensure that the 
authority acts in the best interests of the port, our community 
and our region.  The federal government has a duty to take a 
leadership role in this matter and ensure that the long term 
interests of the port of Halifax are upheld.

to facilitate renewed negotiations in an atmosphere of mutual 
co-operation, not conflict.  The people of the Halifax region

merry Christmas too, but there is a merry Christmas going on with 
René Fugère right now.  He is probably finishing up his Christmas

</I></B></P><P align=left>He can afford to send a nice one because of the $11,500 payback 
he got from arranging $100,000 in federal grants to, you guessed 
it, Mr. Speaker, the Grand-Mère inn through the Prime Minister's 
Office.  That is pretty good return on your money; it is better 
than most mutual funds.

<P><A NAME="LINK35"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development,

First, it occurred in an area of high unemployment.  The project 
was recommended and supported by all local partners: the 
provincial government, the local caisse populaire, la Fédération 
des travailleurs du Québec solidarity fund, the group forces of 
private sector investment and the Banque de développement du 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All these partners supported the investment of money which did

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B> Thanks anyway, 
Mr. Speaker, but when it comes to being a Liberal person in

</I></B></P><P align=left>Fugère's rewards are not just limited to that $11,500.  He is 
the same fellow who is being investigated by the RCMP right now 
for breaking the Lobbyist Registration Act.  The Prime Minister 
knows it.  Why would that be?  It would be for his efforts on 
behalf of three other companies in the Prime Minister's riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see a little pattern.  The Prime Minister keeps Fugère on his

$100,000 cheque from the federal government.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister does not understand the difference between 
1982 and the present situation. He can no longer count on a

any more than he can count on Quebec's support, because two-thirds 
of the members from Quebec in this House are opposed to 
his bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
since we are speaking of clarity, I could perhaps read the

not want the decision to be ambiguous, and the purpose of the 
ruling is to ensure that the decision is truly based on an 
accurate understanding of the situation—that the process takes 
place very clearly and transparently, that the undertakings are 
clear, and that naturally the question is clear as well”.

what people are reading about health care in today's newspapers: 
crowded emergency rooms, stretcher-bound waits for beds and 
ambulances roaming city streets searching for hospitals to take 
their patients.  That is the rule not the exception in Canadian 
health care these days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the federal Minister of Health accept his share of 
responsibility for the harm done to health care or is he just 
going to continue to blame the provinces? 
<P><A NAME="LINK55"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am working very hard with those provinces.  I am working with 
every minister of health in the country to find solutions for the 
long term, to address the very issues that the member mentioned 
in her question, to deal with the crowded emergency rooms, the 
waiting lists and the shortages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As recently as last September, all the ministers of health 
agreed on priorities that we are working toward together to get 
that job done.  It includes increased money from the federal 
government, money that we substantially increased last February 
in the budget.  We will continue in that vein. 
<P><A NAME="LINK56"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is 
great rhetoric from the health minister, but he knows perfectly 
well that for every dollar cut this government will return 50 
cents, if that, and home care has been completely forgotten. 
What that means is that hospitals are backed right up to the 
emergency rooms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A Toronto emergency room nurse put it bluntly, “Christmas is 
going to be a disaster for people needing health care”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the minister content to preside over more hallway medicine or

<P><A NAME="LINK57"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
we are delivering.  As we speak, governments are working together 
to map out home care for the future and make it part of medicare 
in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tomorrow I am meeting with the minister of health from Manitoba 
to discuss that very project.  Last week, all the deputy 
ministers of health in the country met to discuss that very 
project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The leader of the New Democratic Party should learn what is 
going on in the country in relation to health care.  There are

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the drug approval regulatory process is in total 
disarray.  On one side of the issue, we have a minister who, on 
his own signature, can override the best scientific analysis his 
department can provide to approve a drug knowing full well he 
always has to err on the side of caution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other side of the issue, we have cancer fighting drugs, 
life saving drugs that have been bogged down in the regulatory 
process going on two years.  Some of these drugs were approved 
two years ago in other jurisdictions and in other countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the minister continue to operate under this conflicting 
set of guidelines within his own department? 
<P><A NAME="LINK60"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the Conservative Party cannot have it both ways: on the one hand, 
criticizing Health Canada because drug approvals take too long, 
and on the other, criticizing Health Canada because we innovate 
to get drug approvals through more quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can tell the hon. member that the bottom line for us is public 
safety and getting drugs to the patient as quickly as we can, 
consistent with public safety. 
<P><A NAME="LINK61"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, what we are looking for is leadership on the issue.  I 
have mentioned the need to be compassionate in that process, but 
we are looking at 40 countries in the world where this particular 
drug, Rituxan, that I am mentioning by name, has been approved. 
We are bogged down in a regulatory process that is denying 
patients that drug. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are looking for international leadership to allow us to 
exchange information with other jurisdictions.  Does the minister 
have a plan to share international information to avoid the cost 
of duplication in bringing these drugs to market? 
<P><A NAME="LINK62"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Yes, Mr. 
Speaker, and we are working with other governments for that 
purpose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me tell the hon. member that we will approve these new 
pharmaceutical products as quickly as we can in keeping with the 
criteria of safety and efficacy.  We will do that in every case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In relation to the very drug that the member mentioned, he knows 
that we are working on that now.  We are doing everything we can 
to bring that to market as soon as possible, consistent with 
public safety.

Canadians who have access to high priced lawyers and accountants 
are able to exceed the 20% foreign property limit in their RRSPs

request, a company I have never heard of called Canada Steamship 
Lines has 40% of its assets currently invested in foreign 
companies through their $300 million pension fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the Prime Minister explain why some people are able to 
circumvent these foreign ownership rules while the rest of the

<P><A NAME="LINK65"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International

House know that the 20% foreign property limit is something that 
has been under review.  We were looking forward to receiving the 
reports from the various committees and have received them. We 
have also received some other reports.  The whole issue of the 
foreign limit is a matter which is under review by the government 
at this time. 
<P><A NAME="LINK66"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
think the minister misunderstood because some companies, like the 
company called Canada Steamship Lines, already has 40% of its 
pension fund invested in foreign properties.  This is a two tier 
pension system.  While those with means can invest where they 
want to, the rest of us have to abide by that 20% rule. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is this not just another Liberal example of “do as I say and 
not as I do?”

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International

understand that there are certain ways that cloned funds and 
derivatives have been used in various ways.  This is a reality of

</I></B></P><P align=left>According to a statement made by the member for

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the

is obviously because the clarity of the majority must be 
assessed, and for that it is necessary to know the circumstances

threshold either, any more than there is such a threshold in 
Quebec's Loi des consultations populaires.

in his AIDA confessional the agriculture minister said that it 
was costly, complicated and cumbersome.  He also said that he had 
taken a tough approach to ensure that all 1998 AIDA cheques would 
be delivered before Christmas.  With nine shopping days left, 
information from his own department proves that there is more 
than $1 billion in the system and tens of thousands of farm 
families desperate to receive a portion of this money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the minister's plan <I>B</I> to ensure the money will be

<P><A NAME="LINK101"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food,

announced by the government a year ago was for over two years.  A 
portion of that money was allocated and it was assumed it would 
be sent out to the farmers after their applications were reviewed 
as a result of their 1998 business. By far of the majority, there 
will be very few of those.  When the information is all in from 
the producers, there will be very few applications that trigger a 
payment as a result of 1998 that will not be in the hands of the 
producers.

$600 million for the 1998 farm business year, the remainder for

my question is for the Minister of Transport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the access to information program, we received a letter 
written by the minister to the Halifax International Airport 
Authority dated July 22, 1998.  It outlined the terms of the 
agreement to take over the airport.  One of the sentences the 
minister used in his own letter is: “This offer confirms 
Transport Canada's intent to assume liabilities for the current 
pyritic slate mitigation program”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a very clear commitment by the minister.  It is very 
simple.  The department has now reneged on that commitment. Will 
the minister please confirm to us he will instruct his department 
to honour the commitment and assume the responsibility for 
existing pollution at Halifax airport? 
<P><A NAME="LINK106"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, as the hon. member knows, since that letter was 
written, there has been an agreement concluded with the Halifax 
International Airport Authority and it was to its satisfaction. 
If there is some problem with that agreement, then obviously I 
will look into it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK107"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B>  Mr.

letter, a signed agreement, signed by the director of airports 
divestiture that says: “Transport Canada agrees to continue to 
be responsible for pyritic slate runoff existing prior to 
transfer date”. It is very clear and very simple. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely if the Government of Canada signs an agreement and a 
person signs an agreement with the government, the government 
should honour that commitment. Will the minister instruct his 
department to honour the commitment? 
<P><A NAME="LINK108"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, this government honours all of its commitments. In

the hon. member has outlined.

enforcement has the ability to seize cash, goods and property of 
smuggling rings.  Yet immigration authorities are not awarded the 
same power.  Proceeds of crime are there for smuggling drugs but 
not for people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My bill, which would amend section 462 of the criminal code, 
would allow immigration to seize the profits of people smugglers. 
With any underworld activity it is difficult to catch the 
kingpins of smuggling operations.  However it is essential that 
we allow the greatest amount of resources available in order to 
begin decreasing the financial incentives for such activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore I encourage all parliamentarians in the House to 
examine my bill.  It is time we put an end to the large 
inconsistencies within the Canadian criminal code and go after 
proceeds of crime for all crimes.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
move: 
<A NAME="LINK209">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the first report of the Standing Committee on Finance, 
which was presented on Friday, December 10, 1999, be concurred 
in. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have moved that the report of the Standing Committee on 
Finance be concurred in for the following fundamental reasons. 
We travelled across Canada and heard from many witnesses 
regarding the use of the surpluses—which do not belong to the 
minister but to all taxpayers—in the coming years.  We in the 
Bloc Quebecois feel that a number of important consensuses have 
been completely ignored. 
I would like to discuss it here and I would like the report to 
be adopted after this speech. 
Let us take, for example, the social transfers. The whole issue 
of social transfers was debated in the finance committee and was 
raised by some of the witnesses.  This question was fully 
discussed, as the Minister of Finance slashed social transfers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee report does not even mention the possibility of 
employment insurance reform, even though it now covers only 42% 
of the unemployed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have also turned a blind eye to the recommendations made by 
my colleague from Québec on the fight against poverty in Canada. 
As for the issue of taxes, this major issue was minimized, yet 
the Minister of Finance has surpluses coming out of his ears. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to touch upon these issues in the next few minutes 
if I may. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as social transfers are concerned, since 1994 there has 
been a drop in federal transfers to the provinces for funding of 
social assistance, post-secondary education and health to the 
tune of $22 billion, $6 billion for Quebec alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report by the Liberal majority in the finance committee 
ignores these cuts and their devastating effects on the poverty 
level in Canada and the situation in the health system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to point out in passing that since 1994 
Quebec has absorbed 37% of all cuts to Canadian social transfer 
funds for post-secondary education, health and income security 
while accounting for only 24% of the population of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has had disastrous results for Quebec.  It has had harmful 
effects on Quebec public finances as well.  There is a parallel 
to be drawn.

<A HREF="#LINKT24"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>By slashing social transfers to the provinces, the Minister of 
Finance has hurt Quebec. A few years back, the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs made a number of statements to the 
effect that it was necessary to hurt Quebec economically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That brings me back to the bill recently introduced by the same 
minister. This is a bill against Quebec and against Quebecers. 
It is a case of one Quebecer going after Quebecers. This 
Quebecer can now act in collusion with the Minister of Finance, 
another Liberal member from Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We now have a very unusual alliance that really hurts the 
province of Quebec, an alliance between the Minister of Finance, 
who fiddles with the figures, and the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, who fiddles with democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These two devious individuals can now rely on 24 other Liberal 
members from Quebec, 24 docile Liberal members who are ready to 
crawl on their knees in front of English Canada in order to hurt 
Quebec. It is a sad thing because throughout history there 
have always been individuals who agreed to fight against their 
own people, to do the dirty work for their leaders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are 26 such individuals in front of the House, 26 Liberal 
members from Quebec who have agreed to spit on Quebec and to 
deny Quebecers the freedom to decide their own future. They 
typify docility at its worst, kow-towing to their masters and 
conquerors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a good thing we can count on the 45 members of the Bloc 
Quebecois. It is a good thing that we can count on these members 
to unconditionally defend Quebec, its national assembly and the 
freedom of its people and that we are not in the same situation 
as in 1982 when we had 74 Liberal members from Quebec in this 
House who supported the unilateral patriation of the 
constitution initiated by Mr. Trudeau. They ignored the national 
assembly's near unanimity against the unilateral patriation of 
the Constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We, in the Bloc Quebecois, will stand up to fight on behalf of 
Quebecers for their right to freedom, to freedom of choice, and 
their right to democracy, a healthy democracy the government is 
trying to tarnish in this House with the complicity of 26 
Liberal members from Quebec who are willing to help the English 
Canadian majority do its dirty work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report of the Standing Committee on Finance's Liberal 
majority is also weak in that it makes no reference to 
employment insurance, as I said in my introduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People came to tell us that EI eligibility requirements have 
become so restrictive that it is virtually impossible for 58% of 
unemployed workers, who pay premiums when they are not 
unemployed, to receive EI benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people also came to tell us that as unemployed workers 
they were considered as abusers and cheaters and that they were 
harassed day after day and treated as if they were criminals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government has become the government of chronic and 
institutionalized impossibility. 
Again, I want to make a parallel with the bill introduced by the 
Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs to establish a framework 
for the Quebec democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the bill provides that following a referendum in 
Quebec the House of Commons, which is made up of a majority of 
representatives from English Canada, will determine whether 
there is a clear majority of Quebecers who support secession. To 
that end, the House of Commons will take into account the “size 
of the majority”. Will there ever be a majority large enough to 
be acceptable to this government? No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs even repeated today 
that, whether the question is clear or not, the federal 
government will not allow Canada to be broken up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the point of tabling a bill requiring clarity when the 
government will not recognize the result of a Quebec referendum, 
even if the result is clear? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also refers to the percentage of voters who will have 
voted and to any other matters considered to be relevant. This 
provision really opens the door to a very broad interpretation 
which will ultimately make it impossible to recognize the result 
of a Quebec referendum.

<A HREF="#LINKT25"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also provides that the views of the political parties 
and the Senate be taken into account. Can you believe it? 
Senators would be consulted to give their opinion on a 
democratic process when they are not even elected? This bill is 
truly Kafkaesque and the end result is that it will be 
impossible for the House of Commons to recognize the referendum 
result. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It provides that the House of Commons will take into account any 
other relevant views on the majority. Are they going to ask 
Howard Galganov, Keith Anderson, Guy Bertrand and, while they 
are at it, Youppi, for their opinion on such an important issue, 
an issue that has to do with the free and democratic choice of 
Quebecers to create an independent country? This makes no sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It bears a strange resemblance to the way the EI system has been 
run for two years.  What we heard in the Standing Committee on 
Finance was that the government disqualified most people who 
normally should have received benefits.  The government is going 
after unemployed workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here again the situation is similar.  First, the government goes 
after unemployed workers and then it goes after all voters in 
Quebec.  Their right to choose is being taken away.  The 
exercise of democracy in Quebec's referendums is being devalued. 
Quebecers are being treated like children, as are unemployed 
workers when they are monitored day after day and identified, 
almost as though they were setting out to cheat the system.  It 
is becoming ridiculous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another similarity between what witnesses had to say 
about the EI system and the Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs' bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People told the committee that they were viewed by the system 
and by those enforcing it across Canada, based on decisions made 
here in the House, as cheaters.  This is another big similarity 
with the bill introduced by the Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs, the member for Saint-Laurent—Cartierville. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal members accuse unemployed workers of defrauding the 
system and now, with the bill introduced by the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, they are assuming and insinuating—and 
this is serious; members should listen carefully to what I am 
about to say—that all Quebecers are doing the same thing with 
democracy.  Government members are insinuating that Quebecers 
are not playing by the democratic rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> That is terrible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> They are considered minors, immature children 
who need adult guides such as the federal Liberals and the 
federalists in general, children who need guardians and those 
supreme possessors of the truth, which the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, the Prime Minister and the 
federalists in general are, to help them make a free choice 
within a democratic system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, the federalists in this House have turned into the 
neo-colonialists of Canada.  They have become the leaders of what 
is becoming more and more like a banana republic, who are all 
excited at the prospect of crushing those whom they still 
consider the “white niggers of America”, to borrow the 
expression of Pierre Vallières. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a bit of news for them.  The Quebec people are too proud 
to stand for such treatment. 
The Quebec people are too proud to allow themselves to be 
crushed. 
They will stand up against this with the help of the Bloc 
Quebecois here in this Chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to be certain that my message is properly understood I 
will quote, if I may, two excerpts in English from statements 
made by René Lévesque in May 1980 after the Quebec referendum 
and by Robert Bourassa after the failure of the Meech Lake 
agreement. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regardless of the result... it is now undisputed and 
indisputable that Quebec constitutes a distinct national community 
able to choose its constitutional status for itself, without 
outside interference.  This right to control their own national 
destiny is the most fundamental right the people of Quebec 
possess. 
</UL>
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the end of the quote from Mr. Lévesque's statement of 
June 11, 1980, after the first Quebec referendum. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1610"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT26"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>After that came the failure of the Meech Lake agreement, in 
which considered Quebec as something very minor, a distinct 
society, but rejected totally by Canada.  Not only was there the 
death kiss of Clyde Wells and the actions of the present Prime 
Minister, but Canada too rejected this minimal agreement.  In 
economics we say “minimum minimorum”, and there is nothing 
smaller than that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is what Mr. Bourassa had to say after the failure of Meech. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“English Canada must clearly understand that no matter what 
anyone says or does, Quebec is and always will be a distinct 
society that is free and able to control its own destiny and its 
own development”. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the words of Mr. Bourassa.  In other words, Quebec 
alone will decide its future and neither the people across the 
way nor the English Canadians are going to come and tell us how 
to vote in the next referendum on sovereignty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Prime Minister is faulted for this, he who has been 
involved in dirty dealings with Quebec since the beginning of 
his political career, that little guy from Shawinagan, the 
member for Saint-Maurice, he always comes back with the same 
quote, which we have heard a good 40 times in the 6 years we 
have been dealing with him: only the weak resort to insults. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with him on that, and I would point out that if that is 
so then he must be very weak indeed. 
Do you know why? On five significant occasions during 
his political career, this man insulted millions of Quebecers. 
He insulted them all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, in 1980 Quebecers were told that to say no to the 
referendum on sovereignty was to say yes to renewed federalism. 
We found out later on what it really meant. It was a pack of 
lies. This man was involved in this first fight against Quebec's 
legitimate aspirations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then in 1981 there was the night of the long knives. Taking 
advantage of the absence of Quebecers, especially Mr. Lévesque, 
the current Prime Minister plotted against Quebec in the 
kitchens of the Château Laurier Hotel together with 
representatives of other provinces—it has been called the night 
of the long knives—to isolate Quebec, to hurt it again. Already 
they were talking about unilaterally patriating the 
constitution. This was the second insult to Quebecers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third insult came in 1982 when the Canadian constitution was 
indeed patriated in spite of the nearly unanimous opposition of 
the national assembly. This was yet another insult to Quebecers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1990 there was the failure of Meech Lake. The other day I 
heard the Prime Minister say “I was not there”. Negotiations 
were going on and this charming gentleman was standing in the 
corridor talking on his cellphone to Sharon Carstairs, the then 
leader of the opposition in the Manitoba legislature, who was 
fighting tooth and nail against the Meech Lake accord. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few weeks after the failure of Meech Lake, he embraced Clyde 
Wells. I do not know if he embraced him for reasons other than 
his fierce opposition to the Meech Lake accord and his crusade 
against Quebecers. If so, he should tell us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997, during the referendum on sovereignty, he organized an 
extraordinary love-in saying once again “Quebecers, you will be 
recognized if you vote no to sovereignty”. What happened since 
1997? They still spit on Quebec and people across the way still 
work against Quebec. The same man is once again insulting 
millions of Quebecers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, in December 1999, this month, the little guy from 
Shawinigan found the worst insult possible by putting seven 
million Quebecers under some form of custody, under mandatory 
supervision, as if they were cheaters, dishonest people whose 
enlightened choice of sovereignty was a crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How weak must the Prime Minister be to resort to such measures. 
As the old saying goes: insults are the weak man's weapons. 
Since the beginning of his political career he has constantly 
insulted millions of Quebecers.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Considering this bill in light of the way  parliament 
and the governor in council operate and thinking of the 
influence enjoyed by the Prime Minister's Office and the Prime 
Minister himself, we have to ask ourselves if this man is a 
megalomaniac. Is it possible for such a man, under our current 
political system, to have exceptional power and a veto on the 
future of Quebecers, on the future of a whole nation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the Prime Minister's office that decides. 
This means that under this process, under this bill that sets so 
many strict criteria for recognizing the result of a referendum 
or the clarity of a question, it is the Prime Minister, the 
little guy from Shawinigan, who will decide the future of seven 
million Quebecers. This cannot be. I cannot believe that we have 
reached that point in Canada, that we have practically become a 
banana republic, that the destiny of a whole people will be 
determined by one person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again we have news for the Prime Minister. He may think 
and do what he wants but he will never prevent Quebecers from 
controlling their destiny, from choosing in a free and 
democratic way. There is nothing more democratic than the 
election and referendum process in Quebec. These people will not 
decide for Quebecers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are rather interesting things, particularly in 
international law. Among others, there is the 1975 Helsinki 
charter signed by former Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau. 
What does that charter say? It says that participating states, 
those that signed the charter, including Canada: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—respect the equal rights of peoples and their right to 
self-determination, acting at all times in conformity with the 
purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations. 
</UL></UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>By virtue of the principle of equal rights and self-determination 
of peoples, all peoples always have the right, in full freedom, 
to determine, when and as they wish, their internal and external 
political status, without external interference, and to pursue 
as they wish their political, economic, social and cultural 
development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The participating States reaffirm the universal significance of 
respect for and effective exercise of equal rights and 
self-determination of peoples for the development of friendly 
relations among themselves as among all States; they also recall 
the importance of the elimination— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada signed that agreement and we are lucky enough to have not 
only that charter but a whole series of international laws that 
make it easier for people to achieve sovereignty. In Quebec, we 
are also lucky to have 44 Bloc Quebecois members who, contrary 
to the 74 federal Liberal members elected in 1982, will stand up 
and fight against a government that has the audacity to deprive 
Quebec of its freedom and to restrict its democratic spirit.

future of an independent Quebec.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the hon. member for 
Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot for his speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs talks about clarity. 
Is he not in fact imposing his vision of clarity, imposing his 
question, and above all blocking Quebec's horizon in such a way 
that we will have no other choice but to decide between the 
status quo and a totally indefensible option, when it comes 
right down to it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Has he not decided in the end to put aside what all Quebecers 
want, an option allowing them to become sovereign and to have a 
modern relationship on this planet for tomorrow, an appropriate 
relationship allowing Quebecers to make all the decisions 
concerning themselves, to have their voice heard in  the 
community of nations and to have a correct relationship with 
Canada, instead of the nasty climate the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs obstinately persists in creating with 
his current attitude? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> Mr. Speaker, my colleague has been very 
eloquent and has put the finger on the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, yesterday the cat was let out of the bag. When the 
Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs said that, whether the 
question is clear or not, he does not want Quebecers to decide 
democratically on sovereignty, what is the point of introducing 
a bill? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not the question and its outcome that bother the 
government, and particularly the little member for 
Saint-Laurent—Cartierville, the Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs. What bothers him is the content. What bothers him is 
the possibility that Quebec might become a sovereign country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Besides, that man has changed his mind. 
Here is what the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs had to 
say in 1994.  He said that the 1995 referendum was sufficiently 
clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Still in 1994, he added “Ottawa's insistence on using the term 
separation in the question has no basis in law”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third thing he said, again in 1994, was “Ultimately, 
the terms sovereignty, independence, separation and secession 
are synonymous”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today he tells us “We will consider the clarity of the 
question, the terms used, so that they are the real terms, 
secession, the breakup of Canada”.  If these are not 
scare tactics, I do not know what is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be frank. This is what is going on on the other side of 
the House, as we have seen and as Quebecers will see as we bring 
all this out.  Let them admit that they have just sold out 
Quebec, that they are going to prevent it from using a 
democratic process to attain its independence. Let them admit 
it.  That is the real purpose of this bill.  This is the 
beginning of the pre-referendum campaign and the scare-mongering. 
They are telling Quebecers that they will not have the backing 
of the law if they answer this question.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is even sadder, and we saw this recently, is that during 
the 30-day period after they have forced the question out of the 
national assembly, they will debate the clarity of the question 
when Quebec is already fully launched into a referendum 
campaign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, it is sad.  We will be right in the middle of a democratic 
process and these people will be imposing a process on us that 
smacks of apartheid. 
<P><A NAME="LINK212"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
take advantage of the rationality of our colleague, the member 
for Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot.  I believe this bill was not introduced 
for very noble reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know his opinion on the following.  Is it 
possible that this bill was introduced for purely political 
reasons? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister reads the opinion polls. He has seen the 
outcome of provincial elections in the Atlantic region: three 
Tory governments out of four.  He sees the polls in Ontario. He 
sees the relatively good showing of his long time enemy, Mr. 
Clark, who is certainly doing better in the polls than one year 
ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would my colleague agree with my analysis, which, albeit 
superficial, is logical? That strategy reminds me of the 
declaration the Prime Minister made two weeks before the 1997 
election, when he talked about 50% plus one. I say this for the 
benefit of my Bloc Quebecois colleagues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, at the time we lost several ridings to the Bloc 
in Quebec.  I suspect the Prime Minister is now using exactly 
the same election-minded strategy and is thinking “I need at 
least 40 Bloc members in Quebec and 60 Reform members in western 
Canada so that we can squeeze through with 38 or 40% of the 
vote”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a feeling this bill was introduced for very practical 
reasons and not for reasons relating to the referendum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> My dear colleague from Chicoutimi is right. 
Moreover, this has always been a basic fact about the career of 
the Prime Minister of Canada.  When the government starts to 
drop in the polls, the best way to raise its popularity 
quotient, in Canada in particular, is to dump on Quebec 
and Quebecers.  Heaping scorn on Quebecers is the right 
approach. The more a Liberal member dumps on Quebecers the 
higher the Liberals go in the polls. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with my colleague.  Probably he too looks at the polls 
relating to the Bloc Quebecois members and the rise in 
popularity of his leader, which has gone up constantly for the 
past year and a half. This I think is what motivates him to get 
tough with Quebec and to continue the dirty tricks he has always 
been up to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have referred to the patriation of the constitution.  He was 
there. 
The Prime Minister, that little little guy from Shawinagan, was 
there.  He is the one who cooked up that procedure one night at 
the Chateau Laurier, a concerted effort by the federal 
government and nine Canadian provinces to crush Quebec, to 
marginalize it, to strong-arm it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was also, along with Mr. Trudeau, behind the unilateral 
patriation of the constitution in 1982, despite the near 
unanimity of the national assembly against it.  Then there was 
Meech, as I have said before. Though he says “I wasn't even 
there for Meech”, that is not true.  We were here.  We walked 
around. We saw the Prime Minister in a corridor with his cellphone, 
and Sharon Carstairs, one of his buddies, was there 
working against the accord. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How about Clyde Wells, the embrace—and I am not familiar with the 
habits of the Prime Minister—but yes I agree with the hon. 
member.  This was electioneering.  Dumping on the Quebec to 
score better in the Canada-wide polls. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am sorry to interrupt the hon. member but 
the time for questions and comments is up. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  In the interests of the short time we have left before 
Christmas and the fact that a number of petitions have been given 
to us for presentation to the House, I wonder if we could get 
through the usual Routine Proceedings.  I suggest that we present 
petitions at this point. 
It is my understanding that if we could get the unanimous consent 
of the House, we could present some petitions.  My hon. colleague 
from Calgary Centre has a number of petitions to present and so 
do I.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in a way, I thank the hon. member for 
Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot for launching this very important debate on 
the direction we want to give to the year 2000 budget. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would not necessarily agree with the points he made in his 
opening comments and there was some digression later in terms of 
the clarity bill.  But on the question of transfers, Canadians 
are clear that Quebec gets its share of the federal transfers, in 
fact more than 50% of the equalization payments.  That is what 
this House is about.  That is what this debate is all about. That 
is how democracy works. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my privilege and pleasure to lead off today's debate, a 
debate addressing what will likely be one of the most important 
budgets in modern Canadian history. This happy chore has been 
given to me by the finance minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister is in Berlin chairing the inaugural meeting 
of the G-20, a body dedicated to strengthening and stabilizing 
the world's financial architecture.  The minister has asked me to 
express his thanks and appreciation to the hon. members of the 
finance committee for their committed efforts in what was truly a 
national odyssey to hear the views of Canadians and for the 
quality of that work in synthesizing and reporting those views. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today's debate is another important stage in the process of 
prebudget consultation introduced by this government.  It is a 
process that many today take for granted.  Let us remember what a 
dramatic change it represents compared to earlier decades when 
budgets seemed to be prepared in not so splendid isolation from 
the public and the emphasis seemed to be on backroom bartering 
rather than on public discussion and debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many members of the House have had prebudget consultations and 
town hall meetings in their ridings across Canada.  I hosted a 
prebudget consultation in my riding of Etobicoke North on October 
21.  A large number of my constituents came forward to present 
their views on this very important budget.  They told me that 
they wanted a balanced approach.  That was the opinion of the 
constituents in my riding and I look forward to the debate on the 
budget 2000 by members in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To help set the stage for this debate, I remind all hon. members 
of some of the important elements of our current economic and 
fiscal performance.  It is these elements that set the context in 
terms of opportunities and also real limits for the 2000 budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the minister reported to the committee in his fall economic 
and fiscal update last month, our national economy is strong with 
one of the best growth rates among the G-7 major industrialized 
nations and a number one record for creating jobs. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These results are due in great part to the fact that we were 
able to put our federal fiscal house in order. The time when we 
ended up with a deficit and an increase in our public debt year 
after year is over. For two years in a row now, we have had a 
surplus, something we had not seen since 1951-1952, almost 50 
years. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is committed to maintaining this record of fiscal 
responsibility as the unyielding foundation for all policy 
initiatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Looking ahead based on the average of forecasts by a group of 
Canada's leading private sector economists, this record of annual 
fiscal surpluses should grow from $5.5 billion in 2000-01 to $23 
billion in 2004-05.  This is a well deserved dividend that 
Canadians have earned through their support of the tough fiscal 
choices we had to make in bringing Canada's books back into 
balance. Of course those are impressive numbers but we must never 
let them tempt us into losing sight of the need for continued 
financial probity and prudence.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the minister said to our committee, we live in a volatile 
global economy.  Offshore events can buffet us overnight, sharply 
reducing future revenues from today's planning basis.  That is 
why the government is sticking with the advice of the leading 
economists we consulted with and using real caution in our 
planning projections.  This includes deducting our yearly $3 
billion contingency reserve and a significant prudence factor 
before we arrived at those surplus estimates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the update does offer a five year forecast for discussion 
and planning purposes, we should and we will continue to take 
budget decisions only within a rolling two year time horizon. 
This is something I hope hon. members will address in the debate 
to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was through near term and real term targets that we made a 
reality of deficit elimination.  That is how we can ensure that 
the government does not commit long term financial resources 
today for tax cuts for important national investments, popular as 
these may be, at the risk of a return to punishing deficits in 
years to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson:</B>  Never again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen:</B>  Never again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, I am sure most hon. members will agree that 
there are actions that must be taken, investments that should be 
made to strengthen our economy and provide Canadians with the 
prospect of better incomes, a higher quality of life and 
increased security and opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee's report highlights some excellent suggestions, 
but let me note that two of the commitments that this government 
has already acted upon, debt relief and tax relief, are a 
critical part of a context for the upcoming budget and for 
today's debate.  First, we will continue to reduce the debt load 
on the economy and its taxpayers.  Second, we will continue to 
reduce taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a fact that we have already made some headway on our 
national debt. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last two years, with the debt decreasing by some 
$6.4 billion, we were able to save more than $300 million in 
interest every year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And there is more good news. We have actually paid down debt 
previously borrowed in financial markets by almost $16.4 
billion. These achievements in combination with sustained 
economic growth also contributed to the reduction of the debt to 
GDP ratio. This ratio assesses our debt according to the size of 
our economy. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995-96 that ratio peaked at 71.2%.  In other words, our debt 
was equal to nearly three-quarters of our entire yearly economic 
output.  For 1998-99 that ratio was down to 64.4%.  This marks 
the third consecutive annual decline in the debt to GDP ratio. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the way, there is another important comparison that should be 
highlighted.  If one uses comparable accounting standards, our 
federal fiscal turnaround, combined with the positive fiscal 
performance of most Canadian provinces, means that on a total 
government basis Canada has achieved the largest improvement in 
its fiscal balance of all the G-7 nations since 1992. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me emphasize to all hon. members and all Canadians that such 
fiscal improvements are not abstract accounting achievements. 
Combined with our commitment to low inflation, they have 
contributed directly to keeping interest rates down.  Gone are 
the days when Canadian rates were axiomatically higher than U.S. 
rates.  In fact our rates are generally equal to, if not lower 
than, American rates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But Canada's financial challenges are not over.  We have to stay 
on track and that includes getting our debt burden down further. 
Five years ago 36 cents out of each federal revenue dollar went 
to pay interest on the debt. 
However because of our financial progress the portion of each 
revenue dollar eaten up by interest charges is down to 27 cents. 
That is progress, but it is still too high.

<A HREF="#LINKT32"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is money that could otherwise be used to cut taxes, or for 
health care, or for investing in knowledge and innovation.  For 
this reason we are continuing with our debt repayment plan. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will continue to include every year in the budget a $3 
billion contingency reserve. This will ensure that the 
government will be in a position to fulfil its obligations 
toward Canadians without ending with a deficit because of some 
unforeseen economic hardship. If the contingency reserve is not 
needed it will be applied to the debt. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Paying down absolute debt is only part of our strategy.  We will 
continue to make important investments in strengthening our 
economy, such as boosting our national research capability and 
boosting knowledge, skills and training.  The dynamic at work 
here is clear and concrete.  The combination of a shrinking debt 
and a growing economy work together to make the burden of debt 
fall faster.  Just like a family with a mortgage, the more one 
earns and the more one pays down, the lighter the load. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is this consistent strategy of falling debt and a growing 
economy that will help Canada and Canadians build a foundation 
for success in the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This takes me to the second firm commitment I want to highlight. 
That is continued tax reduction.  With the end of the era of 
deficits and growing debt, our government has moved to cut taxes 
for all Canadians.  Quite simply, people have the right to expect 
that each year we will bring down taxes.  It is not a matter of 
debate.  Tax reduction is essential to secure strong and 
sustained economic growth. We may debate the means and the pace, 
but from the point of view of our government, reducing taxes is 
not a debatable item. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is more, we have taken some actions already.  The actions 
taken in the 1998 and 1999 federal budgets have removed 600,000 
low income Canadians from the federal tax rolls.  The combined 
actions taken in the last three budgets mean that the personal 
income tax relief for Canadians will total $7.5 billion in 
1999-2000.  That is about 10% of all personal income taxes.  For 
families with children, total personal income tax relief provided 
in the last three budgets represents an average of 16% reduction 
in their tax burden.  That is families with children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are going to do much more.  This process continued the day of 
the minister's update presentation itself when we announced that 
for the sixth year in a row, employment insurance premiums will 
be reduced from $2.55 to $2.40 for each $100 of insurable 
earnings starting this January 1. This means that employees and 
employers will save a further $1.2 billion next year, bringing 
total savings, compared to the rate that prevailed in 1994, to 
$5.2 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Looking beyond that, as the Speech from the Throne and the fall 
update both emphasized, in the 2000 budget we will spell out a 
multi-year plan to cut taxes further and we will explain how we 
intend to carry it out.  This plan will be based on a number of 
key principles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our approach must be fair which means starting with those who 
need it most: middle and low income earners, especially families 
with children.  We will focus initially on personal income taxes, 
since that is where we are most out of line. We will also have to 
ensure that Canada has an internationally competitive business 
tax system.  Finally, we will not finance tax relief with 
borrowed money because that just means an inevitable return to 
higher taxes in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Suggestions on how best to implement further tax reduction and 
by how much are important elements of the finance committee's 
report.

criticisms that each and every hon. member can add in the House 
today.  I encourage my hon. colleagues from all parties to 
provide their own positive, concrete suggestions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope my few remarks have put some of these issues in some 
context, but I am sure we will not agree on everything that 
should go into the year 2000 budget.  However, it is a process 
that is respected and it is very worthwhile having the debate in 
the House of Commons because budget 2000 will likely set the tone 
and thrust for Canada's continuing growth and security in the new 
millennium.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It is my duty, pursuant to Standing Order 
38, to inform the House that the questions to be raised tonight 
at the time of adjournment are as follows: the hon. member for 
Lethbridge, Trade; the hon. member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, CSIS; the hon. member for 
Okanagan—Coquihalla, National Defence. 
<P><A NAME="LINK214"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened carefully to the member's speech 
and I am a little surprised that the Liberals do not realize 
that ultimately there are two priorities when it comes to the 
budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, they must put some money back into the transfer payments 
to the provinces to help them deal with their responsibilities 
in the areas of education, health and social assistance. A 
survey showed that 54% of Quebecers think this is the top 
priority. The second choice got 17% or 18%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should this not be the first thing to consider when deciding how 
to reinvest the federal government's surpluses? Another measure 
urgently required is to really make the employment insurance 
system an income supplement so as to put a stop to the 
impoverishment being inflicted by the federal government on all 
regions with seasonal industries, particularly in Quebec. That 
would ensure that the income of someone who is employed 20, 22 
or 23 weeks per year is not less than it was in 1994 before the 
Liberals came to power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should those two measures not be taken expeditiously by the 
federal government to try and correct the impoverishment the 
Liberals have brought about through their budget measures and 
decisions thereby strangling the provinces and the unemployed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his 
question but I believe that that cuts in transfers are things 
of the past because the minimum amount of the CHST has now been 
increased to $12.5 billion, which means $1.8 billion more for 
Quebec over five years. Moreover, $11.5 billion have already 
been put into the CHST. This means $2.7 billion more for Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on and on. Equalization gives Quebec $2.8 billion 
more over five years, and Quebec now receives about half of the 
money available in the equalization fund, or about $4.5 billion 
per year. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In last year's budget, the government injected $11.5 billion 
into the CHST for health care and Quebec was a recipient of that. 
Whether the CHST should be augmented further is a very debatable 
point, which is the purpose of this discussion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the question around employment insurance, 
Canadians understand and appreciate that the government had to 
take some very decisive action on this.  Would everybody in the 
House agree that every measure we took was perfect?  Would 
everyone in the House agree that perhaps there are some 
adjustments that need to be made?  Perhaps. 
That is why we are having this debate.  However, to say that we 
should fundamentally go back and re-open EI as it once was, I do 
not think Canadians would support that.

increase in child poverty over the last 10 years?  There will be 
1.5 million Canadian kids going to bed hungry tonight as we 
speak.  We have seen thousands of protesters on the Hill with 
respect to the homeless.  Thirty-six per cent of the people who 
are unemployed in the country do not qualify for unemployment. We 
have students carrying high debt loads by trying to access higher 
education.  We have people on stretchers in emergency rooms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can he explain to me how this is happening in such a prosperous 
country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member forgets that 
during the term of this government unemployment has declined.  It 
is a generational switch.  We are down to 6.9% and we will take 
it down further. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member opposite talks about child poverty.  The latest data 
shows that the incidence of children living in low income 
families declined from 21.1% in 1996 to 19.8% in 1997.  Is that 
good enough?  Probably not.  As a result, 100,000 fewer children 
are living in families with low incomes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, a real problem remains and there is room for action. 
This government has acted on this with the child benefit program, 
with a huge commitment of approximately $7 billion annually once 
it is fully in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the member talks about this doom and gloom scenario, we 
should recognize the huge progress that we have made and the 
progress we will make in the future.  With a growing and strong 
economy, we will be able to devote more resources to the issues 
that the member is referring to.  If we had not taken the 
measures that were needed to bring the deficit under control, we 
would not be having this debate today.  We would still be 
reducing the deficit.  We have achieved that and we now have to 
have a good debate on what to do with the surpluses.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean Dubé (Madawaska—Restigouche, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I listened carefully to the answer by the hon. member.  If I 
clearly understood his response to the question from the 
opposition, the government is not ready to look at employment 
insurance and the effect that employment insurance has had on 
many Canadians in Canada.  Am I clear on that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the member also comment on whether the government would be 
in the position it is today if it was not for free trade, which 
has brought export up from $80 billion to $280 billion?  As well, 
would the government be in this position if it was not for the 
GST, which this government said it would scrap in the last 
election?  This year the GST brought $24 billion into the federal 
coffers.  Does the member think that the government would be in 
that position today if it was not for these measures which were 
brought in by the Conservative government? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen:</B>  Mr. Speaker, if the member checks the 
blues he will learn that what I actually said about EI was that 
no one on the government side or any member in the House would 
say that everything is perfect with EI. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also said that a very strong point would have to be made to 
cause the government to go back to the days before we reinvented 
EI.  To say that there are not some areas that perhaps need some 
fine tuning is one thing, but I do not think we really want to go 
back to the days when we had a situation where EI was causing 
some fiscal pressures and problems for the government and for all 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I acknowledge that with the international liberalization of 
trade, Canada as a major exporting nation has benefited from 
that.  That is very much part of the economic success that we are 
now experiencing.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will highlight some measures that this government can take 
some credit for, such as low interest rates, which is often 
forgotten in the debate.  Because of the low interest rates 
today, the average family with a $100,000 mortgage save something 
like $3,000 a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Business investment has much improved with low interest rates. I 
know this from my days in the private sector where decisions were 
being made to invest in the United States because of the cost of 
capital differential.  That has now been removed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, the monetary policy of the Bank of Canada has created a 
situation where inflation is being moderated.  That has also 
contributed to the economic success of Canada and has created a 
situation in the country where Canadians are feeling more 
confident today than they have ever been and certainly more 
confident than they were in the days of the Tory regime.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is a pleasure to rise and speak on what has become, with very 
short notice, the prebudget debate this afternoon.  Having said 
that, I am pleased to stand and represent not only my 
constituents but also my party on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first concern I have with the majority report that really 
reflects the position of the government members on the finance 
committee is that I feel that some of the recommendations in it 
are completely insincere.  I want to expand on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first point is that there were headlines after this report 
was leaked.  Sadly, it was leaked, as it always is, and as we 
have seen with so many different committees over the last few 
years.  The headlines indicated that the majority report was 
calling for about $46 billion in tax relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Representing a party that has long called for major tax relief 
in the country, I certainly do not object to the majority report 
of the finance committee calling for big tax relief.  We favour 
that completely.  We believe that one of the greatest errors the 
government has ever made was to continue to raise taxes.  It has 
hurt Canadian taxpayers tremendously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we doubt the sincerity of that recommendation.  The 
reason we doubt the sincerity of the recommendation is that a few 
paragraphs into the report we see the government claim that it 
wants to continue to adhere to the 50:50 promise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For people who do not know what the 50:50 promise is, let me 
explain.  In the 1997 election, the government made a promise 
that surpluses that ran up over the next several years would be 
divided; about 50% to new program spending and the remaining 50% 
to a combination of tax relief and debt reduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government laid out the numbers in the fiscal and economic 
update in November when the finance minister told Canadians that 
the total surplus, best case scenario, would be $95 billion, and 
that the amount we could count on to use for things like spending 
and tax relief would be $67 billion.  In that situation, it means 
that the finance committee report was calling to spend $46 
billion of that on tax relief, leaving very little for its huge 
commitment to spending increases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is obviously a bold attempt by the government members to 
have their cake and eat it too.  They want to be the champions of 
tax relief saying “Oh, we believe in tax relief, but on the 
other hand, we believe in raising spending dramatically.  We want 
to see 50% of the surplus devoted to new spending”.  They also 
care very much about the debt.  They want to see debt repayment 
become a huge priority as well.  They cannot have all of these 
things at the same time, but that is exactly what this report 
attempts to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So we very much doubt the sincerity of government members when 
they claim that this is what they want to do.  These two things 
are simply incompatible.  They contradict one another.  We think 
it reflects very poorly on the whole report.  We think it 
undermines the credibility of the whole report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Starting from that very flawed approach, we think that the 
report, while having some merit in some areas, is also found 
lacking in many others, but the most glaring area is really the 
one I just mentioned.

<A HREF="#LINKT36"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to expand on that for a moment.  This is a pattern that 
we see coming forward from the Liberal government.  On one hand 
it promises that it wants to have tax relief.  It promises that 
will come at some point in the future, but its rhetoric and its 
record show something completely different. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we heard the fiscal and economic update from the finance 
minister at the beginning of November he talked ad nauseam about 
why we need to have lower taxes in Canada today.  However we find 
out through the government's actions that it is raising taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The best example is the millennium tax hike which will occur 
just two short weeks from today on January 1.  Canadians will 
wake up from the big millennium party with a big tax headache 
because on January 1 in the new millennium, the year 2000, they 
will see all kinds of tax increases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me recount some of them for the House.  We will see Canada 
pension plan taxes go up as part of the largest tax increase in 
Canadian history.  It is a double burden for the self-employed 
because they have to pay both halves of that huge 73% hike in 
Canada pension plan taxes.  The government is saying that taxes 
are going down and that it wants taxes to go down, but at every 
opportunity it raises taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second example is how it is increasing personal income 
taxes.  The government never misses an opportunity to say that it 
would never raise the tax rate.  The government is being 
completely honest when it says that, but it is being somewhat 
deceptive when it alludes to only the tax rate because the 
overall tax burden will go up because of bracket creep. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ever since 1986 when we deindexed the tax system in Canada under 
the previous Conservative government we have seen taxes increased 
automatically for hundreds of thousands of Canadians every year, 
without having a vote in this place to decide whether or not we 
should have an increase in taxes.  It is an automatic tax 
increase.  The government benefits from that because it brings in 
about $1 billion a year in new revenue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to touch for a moment on the rhetoric of the government 
when it comes to how concerned it is about people on the low end 
of the income scale.  Interestingly enough, people on the 
government side have made a career of telling the public how much 
they care about people who are struggling to get by, the people 
who have fallen through the cracks.  Yet those people who have 
fallen through the cracks, the people on the low end of the 
income scale, are hurt more than anybody else in the tax system 
because of bracket creep. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to note that every year 85,000 new taxpayers 
join the tax rolls because of bracket creep.  They do not have 
any more purchasing power.  They do not necessarily get a raise 
but they are dragged on to the tax rolls for the first time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is that?  It is because with every passing year not only are 
the tax brackets not indexed but also because the exemptions are 
not indexed.  People end up losing the value of the exemptions 
which become less and less with every passing year due to 
inflation, due to the increase in the cost of living.  These 
people are dragged unwillingly and unwittingly on to the tax 
rolls and start to pay taxes for the first time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Liberals have been in power for the last six years they 
have increased revenue from people on the low end of the income 
scale, and indeed from all Canadians, by billions and billions 
and billions of dollars.  This is a big tax increase that the 
Liberal government has pushed through and presides over.  We 
never discuss it and never have a vote on it in the House of 
Commons, but nevertheless Canadians are much the poorer for it. 
That is one way in which the government continues to raise taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On January 1 there will be another tax increase.  This is 
another way that the government raises more revenue and people 
are less better off, without having a vote in the House of 
Commons.

<A HREF="#LINKT37"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give one more example, for instance, the small business 
exemption.  Small businesses in Canada have an exemption of 
$200,000 below which they pay one rate of tax and above which 
they pay another rate of tax.  That will also be eroded by 
inflation this year, so small businesses will see their taxes 
rise again through the big hike in Canada pension plan taxes and 
through the erosion of the exemption for small business.  That is 
another way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other examples which I could go into.  My point is 
simply that the government on one hand says it is concerned about 
taxes and it is cutting taxes, but at every opportunity it raises 
taxes.  That is what we will see on January 1.  Its say one thing 
but does something completely different whenever it has a chance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does this hurt Canadian families, Canadian entrepreneurs and 
Canadian investors?  There are different ways in which it has 
hurt them.  The best way to bring that home, as we have tried to 
do over the last several weeks, is to recount the stories of many 
Canadians who sent us their paystubs to illustrate to the finance 
minister and to the government in the clearest possible way what 
happens to people's incomes when taxes are as high as they are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me remind members of an issue I brought to the floor of the 
House a few weeks ago.  I had a teacher from my riding send her 
paystub which showed that she had received a $1,000 raise, but by 
the time the taxman got done with it, $81 of the $83 a month 
raise was gobbled up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know it sounds incredible, Mr. Speaker, and you look 
incredulous, but I can tell you we saw the paystub.  We shared it 
with the media.  We had Annalora Horch, the teacher from Medicine 
Hat, go to the bookkeeper of the school board and ask what was 
happening.  The bookkeeper said that it simply reflected the tax 
tables for Alberta issued by Revenue Canada as of July 1, 1999. 
They were following exactly what the government told them they 
had to do.  The result is that a $1,000 raise becomes a $24 
raise, thanks to the tax increases of the government.  We think 
that is terrible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Edmonton North raised the issue of Doreen, a 
worker from Winnipeg.  Doreen sent us her paystub, her statutory 
holiday paystub.  She had received statutory holiday pay of $53, 
which is a small amount, but she was really concerned that $30 or 
60% of that $53 went to pay taxes.  I think that is ridiculous. I 
remember at the time the finance minister sort of mocked this. It 
is a small amount of money, I will agree, but every dollar is 
precious to people who are hard pressed and paying the highest 
taxes they have ever paid in Canadian history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is ridiculous that on the one hand we have the government 
saying it wants to reduce taxes but on the other hand we see 
taxes mounting ever upward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to raise the instance of Andy.  Andy is a mechanic in my 
riding.  He works at Evergreen Implements in Brooks.  He works in 
the town where I live.  He has been a mechanic there for 27 
years.  He sent us his Christmas bonus paystub which showed that 
out of his bonus the finance minister got 42%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Andy, Doreen and Annalora are the ones who are putting in the 
extra hours.  They are the ones who are working their hearts and 
guts out for their families.  They take all the risks.  They do 
all the work, but who gets half the bonus?  Who gets half the 
statutory holiday pay?  Who gets half the Christmas pay?  It is 
the finance minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that is not the biggest destroyer of incentive I have ever 
seen, I do not know what is.  It is ridiculous that to burden our 
people the way they are in Canada.  They should be rewarded for 
hard work, productivity and entrepreneurship but sadly they are 
punished. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must remember that taxing something effectively means that we 
get less of it.  A tax is a price.  When a tax is placed on 
something we get less of it.  The higher jobs are taxed, the 
fewer jobs we get.  We see that with every passing year as Canada 
pension plan taxes go up, or when employment insurance premiums 
do not go down nearly as much as they should. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1710"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT38"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the House that the government is still raiding or 
confiscating $7 billion a year of employer and employee premiums 
that do not go to pay more benefits and therefore should come 
back to employers and employees in the form of lower premiums. 
The government continues to raid that and as a result we see the 
taxes on jobs being far too high. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we have high income taxes we have a high price placed on 
productivity and work.  There is no incentive to work overtime 
any more.  We wonder why we languish when it comes to 
productivity.  The reason is that we pay a very high penalty when 
we work hard in Canada today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about entrepreneurship?  There are myriad ways that the 
government punishes entrepreneurs.  I have recounted some but I 
will go into that in a bit more detail.  Before 1971 in Canada we 
did not have a tax on capital gains.  Since that time we have an 
extraordinarily high tax on capital gains.  The result is that we 
put a high price, a penalty really, on the great crime of 
investing in our economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing that has distinguished Canadians over the years is 
that people have been risk takers.  We have been individualists 
to some degree.  That may shock some people in the Chamber, but 
we have been rugged individualists.  We have said that we wanted 
to create businesses, to start something that we could run 
ourselves and be our own bosses.  As a result of the high capital 
capital gains taxes in Canada today, it is very difficult to 
accumulate capital to the point where we can start a business. 
The result is that many people leave the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The best example is what is going on right now in the high tech 
industry where we see all kinds of people who are trying to start 
businesses moving to the United States and other countries around 
the world.  That is shameful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only is it a shame to lose these people because of the 
economic impact, but we see families splitting up, families 
leaving the great country of Canada to go elsewhere.  That is 
disgraceful.  It is very disappointing to see the government be 
so sanguine about it, especially the Prime Minister who says “If 
you don't like our high taxes then just go to the United 
States”.  I think that is ridiculous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see it in other ways, even in consumption.  The more 
consumption is taxed, the less consumption we have.  That is 
rather obvious.  For retailers in Canada that is a serious issue. 
Not long ago I spoke to Peter Woolford, head of the Retail 
Council of Canada.  Mr. Woolford pointed out in testimony to a 
Reform Party committee that the domestic economy in Canada had 
never really recovered from the recession of the early 1990s. One 
reason for that is the high taxes on consumption.  We see this at 
the provincial level and at the federal level.  Part of the 
reason is that people have less disposable income and therefore 
cannot purchase in the first place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whenever we have these taxes we have what economists call a tax 
wedge, a difference between what consumers are willing to pay and 
what the seller is willing to sell for.  The tax often serves as 
the wedge so no deal is struck between the two.  The result is 
that a sale is not made.  We need to make sales.  We need to keep 
the economy moving for the economy to grow, to create wealth, 
prosperity, jobs, opportunity and hope, something for which 
Canada was known during the first 100 years of its existence but 
too often is no longer known for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are all prices that are placed on very productive 
behaviour.  Now we in Canada bear the fruit of that in the form 
of a brain drain and an unemployment rate that is still far too 
high.  The unemployment rate is about 60% higher than it is in 
the United States.  It is certainly 60% higher or perhaps higher 
in relation to the historical level of employment in Canada. That 
is a huge concern.  Government members take some comfort in an 
unemployment rate of about 7%, but to the unemployed it is not 
very much fun at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other ways in which the government punishes people 
through the tax system.  In 1995 when the finance minister 
undertook a number of changes he asked that Revenue Canada hire a 
whole bunch of new auditors. 
The impact has been terrifying for people who are in the sad 
position of having these people visit their businesses. 
Let me cite an example. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1715"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One accountant in my hometown, Hugh Bevan, writes to me often 
about something that is so bizarre, but it makes sense because it 
is about government.  If a farmer or a rancher buys a half-tonne 
truck or a three-quarter tonne truck with an extended cab, a log 
has to be kept indicating everywhere the truck travels.  The 
reason is because somebody might be in the back of the truck who 
is not actually travelling on official business.  This results in 
farmers and ranchers being forced to keep a log.  With all of 
these compliance costs, people try to cheat the system and get 
around these things in various and sundry ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not productive.  Instead of trying to wring every cent 
out of Canadians' pockets, when will the government make a solid 
commitment to cutting taxes, not some airy-fairy commitment that 
is contradicted in the document itself, such as we see in this 
finance committee report? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want lower taxes.  Fairness and justice demands it. 
It is time the government quit talking about lowering taxes and 
started doing it instead of giving us tax increases like we will 
see on January 1. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us end this Liberal rhetoric.  We want to see lower taxes in 
Canada starting today.  Therefore, I would move that the motion be 
amended by deleting all the words after “That” and substituting 
the following therefor:  “the first report of the Standing 
Committee on Finance, presented on Friday, December 10, 1999, be 
now concurred in, but that it be recommitted to the Standing 
Committee on Finance with instruction that they amend the same, 
so as to recommend that the government re-index the income tax 
system to inflation by immediately eliminating bracket creep”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The Chair had grave reservations when 
the hon. member read his motion.  He left out a word that I see 
is in the printed version, and that is that the report be “not” 
now concurred in.  The member said “concurred in”.  Had that 
been his motion, it would have been out of order.  But I see 
“not” in the printed version and I assume that he adopts 
that as what he intended to read. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a 
point of order.  I feel certain that the member's heart was 
telling him that he wanted to concur in this report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  We are not going to get into that

</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of tax relief, I draw to the attention of the House 
that the minority report tabled by the Reform Party states: 
“Outside of partnership and ideological differences, the need 
for tax relief and tax reform is very real.  The official 
opposition has called for major tax relief.  We will outline the 
size of our proposed tax relief in our January report”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I draw to the attention of the House the tax package that the 
House of Commons committee tabled.  It is very important to 
understand its major components.  I cite the fact that the 
finance committee would like the government to adopt the 
following plan over the next five years.  First, to increase the 
basic and spousal amounts by 15%, which would mean that the basic 
personal amounts for individuals would rise to $8,200.  This 
measure would take 500,000 Canadians off the tax rolls.  It would 
lower the number of people on welfare and increase attachment to 
the workforce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, we want to reduce the middle tax rate by three 
percentage points to 23%.  This is in large part because 
hard-working, middle class Canadians worked so hard to defeat the 
deficit and give the Canadian government a surplus that they need 
to be rewarded.

signalling me to stop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want the hon. member for Medicine Hat to tell Canadians 
whether the figure in the Reform package will be over the $46 
billion in tax cuts announced by the finance committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my friend's 
comments.  We think the finance committee report is a modest 
start toward tax relief.  My friend does not have to convince me 
of the need for tax relief.  Reformers have championed the idea 
for many years.  We have been standing alone for tax relief for 
several years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend does not have to convince us, but he certainly has to 
convince his friends in the Liberal Party that they need to get 
onboard and advocate tax relief.  If he did that, they would not 
retain that commitment to the 50:50 spending promise, which can 
only mean billions upon billions of dollars in new spending, 
which is completely at odds with what he himself advocates in the 
form of tax relief.

contributed to the systematic impoverishment of the people who

insurance program and the cuts in the transfer payments?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for his 
question.  The Liberal government has contributed to the 
impoverishment of Canadians, but by a different means than my 
friend suggests.  High taxes have caused many people to be in a 
situation where they cannot hire the number of people they would 
like to hire and therefore people without skills, traditionally 
people who are at the bottom of the socioeconomic scale, cannot 
benefit.

</I></B></P><P align=left>If he had more time for his speech he would have taken very 
great care to point out the examples of the provinces of Ontario 
and Alberta, which recognize the stimulation to the economy that 
tax relief brings, which has resulted in booming economies in 
both of those provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could my colleague enlighten particularly the Liberals, who 
obviously do not understand the real economic benefits of 
reducing taxes? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate that very 
thoughtful question from my friend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has happened in Alberta and Ontario since those governments 
have taken charge is that we have seen a reduction in taxes, a 
reduction in debt and ultimately a huge increase in the number of 
people working in those provinces.  What that has meant, under 
the governments of Mike Harris and Ralph Klein, is that hundreds 
of thousands of people are being brought into the workforce, some 
of them for the first time.  They are given skills, experience, 
contacts and ultimately a wage.  As a result of all those people 
working more money pours into the coffers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has happened as a result of that?  More money is going into 
health care in both Alberta and Ontario than has ever gone into 
health care in those provinces, thanks to the provincial 
governments.  On the other hand, we have the Liberal federal 
government, the supposed defender of medicare, cutting the life 
out of medicare, cutting ultimately $21 billion out of medicare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can thank Mike Harris and Ralph Klein for helping health care 
recover at the provincial level.  Thank goodness for them, voices 
of sanity in this country.

comparing us to the United States.

this money?  Would he cut jobs?

country in the world, but no thanks to this Liberal government 
which transferred a $42 billion deficit on to the backs of 
taxpayers.  That is irresponsible.  That is not leadership; that 
is cowardice.  We see it from this government every day. 
Canadians, frankly, are sick of it.  They will not take it much 
longer.  That is why the government is on its way out.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have the honour to rise today to 
present and debate Motion No. 222 on seasonal workers and the 
employment insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should take 
immediate action to restore Employment Insurance benefits to 
seasonal workers. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debate on this votable motion is an opportunity for my 
colleagues and myself to thoroughly look into the issue of 
seasonal work and try to find short, medium and long term 
solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I introduced this motion in order to demystify seasonal work. 
People who work in seasonal industries are often called seasonal 
workers. We often forget that they are not seasonal workers; 
their jobs are seasonal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main reason I wanted to introduce this motion is the recent 
changes to the employment insurance plan. Through this debate, I 
want to highlight the negative impact of these changes on the 
lives of people who work in seasonal industries and of their 
families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to highlight the important contribution of these workers 
to our country and our economy. But most of all, I want to 
engage my colleagues in an exchange in order to develop 
solutions that will certainly include a proposal to reform the 
employment insurance, but also proposals to diversify our 
country's seasonal economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, it must be mentioned that seasonal work is very important 
for the Canadian economy. It accounts for one million direct jobs 
and contributes to the creation of thousands of others. A number 
of industries are seasonal by nature. A case in point are the 
industries which are weather-dependent such as fishing, logging, 
agriculture, mining, construction and tourism. There are other 
industries such as the automotive industry, education, and 
cultural industries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seasonal industries are an important variable in Canada's 
balance of payments. Net exportations of agricultural products, 
seafood, energy and mainly wood products are the main elements in 
Canada's balance of trade.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tourism industry is the 12th largest economic sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995, shipments by the construction industry were estimated 
at $22.8 billion. That year, the building materials industry 
accounted for about 6% of the gross domestic product from 
manufacturing and it provided direct jobs to nearly 150,000 
people across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1996, the forestry sector contributed $20 billion to the 
Canadian economy. Activities in this sector accounted for 2.9% 
of the GDP. In 1997, national forestry exports were estimated at 
$38.9 billion. 
Moreover, in 1997, the forestry sector provided 365,000 direct 
jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the commercial fishery on the Atlantic and Pacific 
coasts, it was valued at $1.6 billion in 1997. Fisherman from the 
Atlantic provinces are responsible for 74% of that amount. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Looking at these statistics, it is obvious that seasonal 
industries are important to our economy throughout the country. 
All these sectors make an important contribution not only to our 
economy but also to our quality of life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part time university professors contribute to the education of 
our young people but their work often depends on university 
semesters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who does not appreciate a nice lobster, especially here in 
Ottawa? We often tend to forget that before reaching our plate 
lobster had to be harvested by a fisherman and packed by a 
plant worker to be shipped to Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tourism is another example. A canoe rental business can hardly 
find clients in the middle of winter when rivers are frozen. 
Therefore, it provides work to its employees only 10 or 12 weeks 
out of the year, during the summer months. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seasonal jobs are dispersed throughout Canadian industries. 
Their contribution to the Canadian economy goes far beyond the 
activity that is confined directly to the seasonal jobs 
themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the forestry sector for example, the harvesting of trees 
leads to primary sector activity in sawmills, pulp and paper, and 
plywood and panel board plants.  Secondary manufacturing includes 
planing mills, engineered wood products, manufacturing of paper 
or cardboard products, wood re-manufacturing, prefab homes and 
wood doors and windows. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seasonal activity in forestry generates year round activity in 
many more sectors. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995, a working committee was set up to examine the issue of 
seasonal work and employment insurance. Its report contains 
findings that in my opinion are still valid today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, it draws attention to the fact that what is seasonal is 
not the workers but the jobs. Second, the committee found that 
the contribution of seasonal labour to the Canadian economy was 
largely ignored. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, it noted that a negative attitude toward seasonal 
workers was emerging and that these workers were considered 
responsible for the temporary nature of their jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, it warned the Liberal government of the day that any 
change to employment insurance would disproportionately affect 
seasonal workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government had in its possession a document that said what 
exactly the impact would be on seasonal workers but it chose to 
go ahead anyway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the situation today? The eligibility criteria are too 
high and prevent many seasonal workers from receiving employment 
insurance benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the government decided to punish workers who 
frequently claim employment insurance by making them subject to 
the intensity rule. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee was right to say that the government had a 
negative attitude toward seasonal workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of attacking seasonal workers, the employment insurance 
reform should have taken into account their particular 
conditions and created a system reflecting the reality of the 
labour market.

<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seasonal work is a subject of special concern because those 
engaged in seasonal work have fewer alternatives than other 
workers and are therefore more dependent on EI.  They cannot fish 
when the bait is frozen or cut trees in the spring thaw when 
roads turn to mud.  Very often, workers in seasonal industries 
live in remote areas of the country where the only work is 
seasonal and things freeze up in the winter. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The working group has also predicted that the EI reform would 
have a negative impact on women. In many cases, women who work 
in fish plants are unable to meet the number of hours of work 
requirement to qualify for EI. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the EI reform, the number of hours required to qualify has 
doubled in certain areas. Besides, the 910 hours required from 
newcomers on the labour market or from workers who have been 
away from the labour market for a time result in the exclusion 
of many women and young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This 910 hour requirement penalizes women who have decided to 
stay home to raise their children during their formative years. 
When they go back to work and the seasonal work ends, they do 
not have any income because they cannot meet that 910 hour 
requirement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did the government choose to make those changes if it knew 
what the impact on women would be? Perhaps because it wanted to 
use the surplus accumulated in the EI fund thanks to all those 
restrictions to reduce the deficit and the debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last few weeks, we have talked about the rise in the 
number of children living in poverty. It is not hard to realize 
that the EI cuts have deprived mothers and fathers of benefits, 
and that their families suffer because of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since many poor families are headed by single mothers, the fact 
that women do not qualify for EI has contributed directly to the 
increase in child poverty.  The saddest thing of all is that 
this negative impact was very likely intentional 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The EI reform has had a negative impact on seasonal workers. 
This impact was predicted and can be observed today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time to admit that errors were made.  It is time to make 
changes so that seasonal workers can again qualify for EI 
premiums. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the government must not stop there.  I am often accused of 
suggesting EI as the solution to all problems.  That it not 
true.  Really. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What must be remembered is that the EI program is there to help 
workers who have, through no fault of their own, lost their job. 
It is a temporary measure to help during the transitional 
period, but this government is forgetting that this temporary 
measure is necessary for both workers and for the economy.  When 
workers are denied EI premiums, small and medium size businesses 
suffer too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even the Liberals agreed with us.  In 1993, when the Prime 
Minister was the leader of the opposition, he said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>By reducing benefits and further penalizing those who leave 
their jobs voluntarily, the government shows very little concern 
for the victims of the economic crisis. Instead of getting to 
the heart of the problem, it goes after the unemployed. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened to our Prime Minister?  Perhaps the same thing 
that happened to the red book, the GST and all the rest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister went on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These measures will have a disturbing impact. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it not ironic that when he came to power our Prime Minister 
did exactly what he spoke out against?  He went after unemployed 
workers and the result was very disturbing.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister was not the only one to oppose relentlessly 
the proposed changes to employment insurance. On July 31, 1989, 
my predecessor, Doug Young, said that the taxpayers of New 
Brunswick should vigorously oppose these changes, which would 
have serious consequences on the region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am prepared to give credit to the Liberals. They understood 
the situation before taking office in 1993. They knew that 
employment insurance was an important program that was part and 
parcel of the social fabric of our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I even believe that they know now that they are wrong. 
But the employment insurance fund is accumulating a surplus of 
$7 billion every year and they do not want to give up what this 
surplus brings them. As I said before and continue to say, 
workers are the victims in this case and this is unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. colleagues opposite sometimes point out to me that 
workers are abusing the employment insurance program. But the 
workers are not the ones dependent on the employment insurance 
system, the Minister of Finance is. He cannot do without it and 
he relies on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But to talk about employment insurance is not good enough. The 
problem with seasonal industries is that we do not think in the 
long term about the diversification of the economies dependent 
on these industries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seasonal work is found mainly in rural areas where natural 
resource development is the main activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not that people do not want to work. It is a 
situation where once their working season comes to an end, be it 
in forestry, the tourist industry, fishing or construction, 
there is no other work to be had. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thus, apart from giving them access to the EI program, we must 
also invest to ensure economic diversification. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Too often these communities harvest the resource. For example, 
in communities like Caraquet, Shippagan, Lamèque, Bouctouche and 
Cap Pelé in New Brunswick, fish is caught and then sent to Japan 
for processing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why not do the processing at home? Why should we not do 
secondary and tertiary processing? Why do we not develop 
aquaculture, which could represent the future of fisheries? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However to develop such industries, we need a long term vision 
that builds on the experience and the know-how of all the 
players, investors, workers, community groups and elected 
officials, whatever their political affiliation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For too long now Atlantic Canada has suffered because of 
decisions based on political motives rather than on the best 
interest of the communities. This has to change. We cannot go on 
like this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals will have to stop giving away money only to their 
friends and start looking at the real economy and the way to 
develop it. What they are doing is the way things were done by 
politicians a century ago. It has to change. 
We have to work together to change things. We cannot go on like 
this. We need a long-term vision on how to develop the economy of 
our country and of our rural areas. As long as we do not do it, 
we will be missing the boat. We will be missing the boat and a 
great opportunity. We have to recognize the difference between 
rural Canada and urban areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to invest in our infrastructures so that our rural 
communities can become as competitive as our urban centres. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, in my province of New-Brunswick, the natural gas pipeline 
runs from Sable Island to the south, but does not go to the 
north. How do you expect northern New-Brunswick to compete with 
the south when the infrastructures serving these two areas are 
not the same? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Besides investing in the infrastructures, we have to invest in 
people. We have to give them some training. Not just any kind of 
training, but training in the industries that are liable to 
develop in their region.

is a privilege to speak following my neighbour from the north of 
my constituency, the member for Acadie—Bathurst, and also my 
good friend from Madawaska—Restigouche in the far north. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recognize the work the hon. member has done with EI.  He has 
travelled the country.  His background has been with the labour 
movement.  When he speaks he is certainly speaking on behalf of 
his constituents and the many people he has worked with in the 
mining sector and other sectors of the labour congress over the 
last number of years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I differ very basically on some of the points the hon. member is 
making.  His tremendous energy should be directed more toward the 
creation of employment, the creation of job opportunities for 
those people who are in need of work.  We heard the speech of the 
hon. member.  I see that you read the report of our Atlantic 
caucus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I ask the hon. member 
to address his comments through the Chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charles Hubbard:</B>  The hon. member read the report of 
our Atlantic caucus.  In fact his speech reflected the need for 
infrastructure, the need for development of industry, the need 
for greater attention to the economy of those areas and, above 
all, the great advent of technology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Great strides have been made in the province of New Brunswick, 
both with the previous two premiers and our new premier who was 
elected last summer.  We hope he will be able to follow in the 
footsteps of the previous two premiers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tonight I want to mention that employment insurance is not 
simply a relationship between the government and the workers of 
the country.  It is a three way relationship. Employers pay into 
the fund 1.4 times the amount put in by employees.  We have to 
ensure that it is a joint fund administered by the government of 
the country.  There has to be a relationship among employers, 
employees and the government.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fund was changed in the early 1990s and again in 1995-96. 
There are certain points we all must be concerned about.  The 
hon. member brought out a good number of those points in terms of 
women, the intensity clause and seasonal workers about which we 
are so much concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tonight we should salute people who work in our seasonal 
industries.  We talk about the people needed in the basic 
resource based industries such as fisheries, agriculture, 
forestry and other sectors.  About 40% of the country's total 
gross domestic product in terms of exports is from basic resource 
based industries.  We have to be sure the seasonal workers who 
participate in those industries are looked after adequately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The intensity clause is one of the most difficult.  Many members 
on this side of the House are concerned with the definite penalty 
against people who participate in seasonal industries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the hon. member indicated, an employee draws from the program 
for 20 weeks.  Each time he draws after that he is penalized by 
1%, going down eventually to 50%, which is a direct attack upon 
people who are mostly involved in seasonal industries.  We too 
are concerned about that penalty or that intensity clause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The employment insurance program has many good parts to it.  For 
example, I mention Nova Scotia which has a very good program for 
people at the lower end of the economic scale.  Families earning 
less than approximately $27,000 a year can receive a family 
supplement which will amount to approximately 80% of their earned 
income.  That is a definite, positive aspect of the changes made 
in 1996. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must also look at some government programs in terms of 
attempting to look at areas in need of more employment.  We think 
of the former transitional jobs fund and, more specifically 
today, the Canada jobs fund.  I see in the House tonight a number 
of members from New Brunswick.  I think all of us from New 
Brunswick benefit from the Canada jobs fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin:</B>  The problem is in my riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charles Hubbard:</B>  Madam Speaker, the hon. member's 
constituency has benefited more from the Canada jobs fund and the 
transitional jobs fund than any constituency in the province of 
New Brunswick.  If he looks at the figures he will find that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin:</B>  That is not right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charles Hubbard:</B>  Madam Speaker, he will have his 
opportunity.  Hopefully he will give me mine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The employment insurance program is under continuous review.  We 
are attempting to look at some of the problems connected with 
people returning to the workforce after a period of being left 
out.  We are looking at the fact that there are certain aspects 
of the program which will be brought to the attention of the 
minister.  With them she would be able to come to the House to 
make changes to better improve the program for all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion of the hon. member certainly needs to be amended 
because we might be led to believe that seasonal workers were 
left out of the program.  Therefore I move the following 
amendment: 
<A NAME="LINK228">&nbsp;</A>

</I></B></P><P align=left>That the motion be amended by deleting all words after 
“immediate action to” and substituting therefor the following, 
“review employment insurance benefits for seasonal workers”.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  The amendment is in 
order.  Debate is on the amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK229"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I appreciate the concerns my NDP colleague has brought to the 
House.  It is truly a very important issue that needs to be 
addressed by the government.  We will go along and take some 
second thought on the amendment. I am not sure that it is an 
adequate response to the problem of the incomes of seasonal 
workers.  I will relate some of the reservations I have about it. 
I acknowledge that it is an important issue and the member is to 
be commended for having raised it in the House this evening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As was already said, it is a given that we have the reality of 
seasonal work in Canada.  Certain businesses and industries in 
Canada have seasonal ups and downs regardless of the business 
cycle which means that fewer workers are needed at predictable 
times of the year.  The result is that workers in those 
industries will apply for benefits at predictable times of the 
year on a repeated basis year after year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seasonal work is a reality in Canada, perhaps more so than in 
other countries because we have so many resource based industries 
compared to other countries around the world.  As has been 
brought to our attention by the two previous speakers, the 
problem we have before us and the reason the motion is here today 
are because of the 1995 act and how it has affected seasonal 
workers.  That is the reason we are debating this motion today. 
Seasonal workers are getting less in the way of benefits as a 
result of those changes to the unemployment insurance program 
introduced by the 1995 Employment Insurance Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government member who spoke prior to me referred to the 
intensity rule which the act introduced.  That rule in its first 
time coming into effect distinguishes between frequent and 
infrequent recipients of benefits under the EI program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Frequent users of EI receive reduced benefits based on their 
previous use of the EI program.  They are reduced by 1% when 20 
weeks of benefits have been collected and may go as low as as 
50%.  They are not wiped out altogether but there is a 
significant 5% reduction depending on the frequency of previous 
claims. The lowest possible rate of 50% is in contrast with the 
standard rate of 55% for regular claimants. That has had an 
effect on real people, on Canadians, those who work in seasonal 
industries in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1998 EI monitoring and assessment report produced by the 
Department of Human Resources Development acknowledges that 
communities with high levels of seasonal employment were more 
likely to have industries that showed declining benefit levels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did the government intend to happen?  What was the motive 
of the government in all of this?  What did it hope to accomplish 
by means of this intensity rule? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would seem that it hoped workers would move out of seasonal 
industries and seek employment in industries where they would be 
able to be employed year round. The reasoning is pretty simple. 
Since seasonal workers would get less in EI benefits, they would 
be in a position where they would seek employment that would not 
be seasonal, that it would have that effect upon them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seasonal workers are not doing anything different despite what 
the government assumed at that point.  Unfortunately it did not 
have that effect on a wide scale.  Most seasonal workers, at 
least during the time of the study that led to the 1998 
monitoring report, said that the intensity rule would not affect 
their work patterns.  That is their plain statement on the 
matter.  When asked about their plans, they said that they had 
few employment opportunities outside of their existing seasonal 
jobs and that they would remain with their existing employment 
and continue to apply for EI despite the intensity rule. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There may be some different ways to deal with this but I do not 
believe we should go the route of what has been proposed today by 
my colleague from the NDP. There are arguments for leaving EI as 
it is if that is the only solution or proposal on the table. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1805"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT50"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT50"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1805

<A HREF="#LINKT49"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, Motion No. 222 would move EI away from pure insurance 
principles which the Reform Party supports for the employment 
insurance program.  EI is supposed to protect workers 
against—and I underline it—the risk of “temporary involuntary 
unemployment”.  The member who introduced this motion mentioned 
that, but I think we need to get the context here and underline 
that it is for those where there is risk and it is temporary and 
involuntary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of seasonal workers we are not talking about risk, 
will I or will I not.  They well know that come that certain time 
of year, they will be laid off.  There is that predictable 
pattern of unemployment.  For this reason EI as an insurance 
program based on insurance principles is really compromised when 
workers come back year after year at the same time of year for 
benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>EI no longer functions as an insurance program, but rather it is 
a wealth distribution program.  That is not to say that wealth 
distribution is not appropriate during a transition phase, but 
that is perhaps another debate for another day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My point here is that the EI program as it was originally 
intended and as I quoted here would not be honouring true 
insurance principles if we used it to address the problem of 
seasonal workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report of the Forget commission on UI stated on page 60: 
“Although it transfers money from the employed to the unemployed 
and to some degree from the rich to the poor, unemployment 
insurance is not a very effective income redistribution 
program”.  There are other ways of doing it if that is our 
intent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, Motion No. 222 would subsidize certain industries but 
not others.  Companies that lay off workers at the same time 
every year have a huge benefit if those workers do not move away 
to find work elsewhere but stay in the area, collect EI and then 
are available to return to work when that work season begins 
again. This in effect means that such companies are being 
subsidized by the EI program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If such companies were forced to pay higher premiums than other 
companies, then things might be fairer. Those companies might 
also be motivated to extend work seasons to avoid those higher 
premiums.  That might be administratively difficult, I 
acknowledge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third is why we should stay as is as opposed to the motion of 
the member, unless there is some other proposal on the table. We 
do have an amendment to which we will have to give some thought 
and consideration. Some seasonal workers have not been as 
affected as regular workers by the 1995 changes.  That needs to 
be brought to our attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Neither of the previous members made note of the fact that some 
seasonal workers have not been as affected as regular workers by 
the 1995 changes.  In fact, the hours based system has actually 
helped some seasonal workers who work longer than the average 
hours per week, which is often the case with seasonal work.  They 
work from sunup until sundown.  They work long hours and they get 
lots of hours in over a short period of time.  They are thus able 
to qualify for benefits in a shorter period of time. On the other 
hand non-seasonal workers who tend to work normal hours were not 
helped by the switch to the hours based system as some seasonal 
workers were. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, I would maintain the status quo or at least the present 
system as opposed to the motion under discussion here, because 
changing the rules for seasonal work might create an incentive 
for people to enter seasonal industries.  We usually hear of the 
person who already has a seasonal job, but what about the person 
looking for a first job or looking to make a job switch?  They 
might be more tempted to try to get a seasonal job than a long 
term employment option if they know that EI will supplement their 
income. Clearly we want some incentive in place that will make a 
person prefer the non-seasonal yearlong job.  We need to have 
that in our EI program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can we affect seasonal patterns?  I think to some extent we can 
over the course of time.  Seasonal patterns themselves have 
changed over time. During the 1970s, seasonality in employment 
declined somewhat, primarily in the primary industries mainly due 
to the decline in the size of the agricultural sector relative to 
the rest of the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seasonal variability in unemployment has declined even more.  In 
1966 the difference between unemployment in the highest and 
lowest months was 46%.  By 1980 the difference had declined to 
less than 26%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We might ask how a government would go about affecting work 
patterns.  One excellent proposal is that of experience rating. 
A fundamental reform which could help us is a proposal by 
Professor Jack Mintz contained in a taxation on business report. 
He talked about experience rating which relates to insurance 
premiums. This is used in the United States in cases where an 
insurance scheme penalizes those companies which lay people off 
more than the industry average.  This is relevant to our 
situation today.

<A HREF="#LINKT50"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a situation where there are many seasonal employees such as 
the forestry industry, a pulp and paper outfit which lays off 
more than the norm in that particular industry would see its 
premiums go up.  This would create a disincentive to lay off 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A couple of years ago I was struck by a situation in a Wal-Mart 
store in Maine.  It hired a number of people before Christmas and 
then laid them off normally, but it hired people to do a variety 
of other things and kept them on in the long term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should pursue these types of possibilities in some of our 
other seasonal industries. It is doable.  We need to use some 
creative minds in terms of our approach so that we go after 
experience rating as a possibility for seasonal workers.

<P><A NAME="LINK230"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, 
BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I want to commend the hon. member for 
Acadie—Bathurst for his motion. I think that the issue of 
seasonal workers is a real concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the third year of the intensity rule which penalizes 
seasonal workers, taking away 1% of their benefits every time 
they receive employment insurance benefits for 20 weeks. This 
means three years during which, in our ridings, the Liberals 
have condoned the unfair treatment of these people, who have 
earned these benefits through their hard work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion, as it stands, is dynamic and interesting. We must 
change the intensity rule, the number of weeks where benefits 
can be paid out, the weekly employment insurance benefits and 
the number of hours to qualify. These four factors deeply 
influence the financial status of our seasonal workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of these requirements, young people and women who could 
have seasonal jobs are leaving some areas because they cannot 
work the 910 hours required to qualify. This is also true for 
our seasonal workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most importantly, the law implies that these people have chosen 
not to work longer. 
That is what is left of the whole debate initiated by the Prime 
Minister when he called unemployed workers beer drinkers. Well, 
we have seen the consequences in the legislation. Today, a 
couple of weeks before Christmas, there are people who are 
wondering if they will have enough money to get through the 
holiday season and to survive until their next job in the 
spring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason is not that there are fewer jobs than before, and the 
Liberals should understand that. Right now, we are in a period 
where the economy is strong but there are seasonal workers who 
have a job only during the summer. Because of  restrictions in 
the EI program, either they qualify or they do not qualify, but 
the bottom line is that their annual income is lower than it was 
before the reform. 
This is totally unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This proposal with regard to seasonal workers did not come only 
from opposition parties. It did not come only from the people we 
talked to on this subject. It was supported by the premiers, 
particularly those affected by the intensity rule that penalizes 
seasonal workers through a reduction of the number of weeks of 
benefits and the weekly amount. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Forestry workers who work hard but cannot work all year long 
find it difficult and unacceptable to see the government treat 
them as if they were lazy, especially when they do not have 
enough money to support their family. 
They then find that they do not have enough dignity to assume 
their responsibilities as  family breadwinners and that is even 
harder on their self-esteem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farm workers live the same situation. In my town of Saint-Denis 
de Kamouraska and in all other villages, some must try to 
qualify, but ultimately they still may not receive enough money 
to support their family. The situation is serious because farms 
are the backbone of rural areas. It will last until that 
infamous rule is abolished. The Government of Canada is saying 
to seasonal workers that they do not deserve the same status as 
other workers. Yet during all the years when the plan was a 
valid one, they were allowed to earn an income. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1815"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT51"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were happy to have those workers being employed, often for 
low wages, so that in the industrial urbanized areas, 
particularly in Ontario, people could earn a good income in the 
processing industries. However, there were no processing 
industries in our own areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime, people end up working in agriculture and 
forestry. There are also those who work in turf pits. I know 
families around Rivière-du-Loup in which the husband works at the 
turf pit and the wife works as a secretary. However, her job is 
also seasonal because the company hires her for only part of the 
year. They have a combined income of about $30,000 a year. 
At the end of the day we end up with the intensity rule, under 
which for every 20 weeks of EI, benefits are cut back from 55% 
of earnings to 54%, then to 53% and so on. This means that over 
three years almost all seasonal workers see their benefit rate 
reduced to 50%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The consequences of that are absolutely absurd. In my area, 
between 1992 and 1998 the federal government invested, from 
year to year approximately $85 million less in the regional 
economy. That means that even if industries are very aggressive 
and manage to get $2 million or $2.5 million out of the Canada 
jobs fund, there is still an $83 million shortfall in the end. 
Those who rely on these industries and are seasonal workers do 
not benefit from that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Faced with this situation, the federal government must respond 
quickly. Action is urgently required. The amendment the Liberal 
majority put forward earlier is not enough, in my opinion. It 
should be much more specific. I recall that at the first 
meeting of the Committee on Human Resources Development, the 
year following the 1997 election, there were members of the NDP, 
the Progressive Conservative Party and the Bloc Quebecois who 
asked that the first issue the committee were to consider be the 
EI reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The observations made today have already been made everywhere in 
our regions. 
The Liberal majority told us “This will not be on the agenda; 
we will not start on this right away.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not like the amendment introduced by the Liberals because 
it could lead to “committee-itis” and we will end up with the 
same song and dance from the department. The minister has been 
telling us for some time now “We are going to review the 
reform. We will assess the new plan after one year and then we 
will act accordingly.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A new minister is appointed and we get the same answer. We are 
now into the third year and soon enough it will be five years. 
Seasonal workers do not eat in the long term, they need to eat 
every day. They need rules providing them with enough money to 
feed their family when they are in between two jobs and retain 
their dignity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what the federal government has failed to understand. 
I believe the amendment on the table is a sign the Liberal 
government has come to the realization that if it goes into an 
election with its employment insurance reform as it is, fewer 
liberal members will be elected in the maritimes and in Quebec, 
particularly in the areas concerned, and possibly in others too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The liberal member said “There are three stakeholders in this: 
the government, the employers and the employees.” But the only 
thing the government has done so far is pocket the employment 
insurance fund surplus and pay down a part of the debt with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, those who contributed, the employers and the employees, 
believe that $6 out of $18 billion going every year to fund 
something else than what it was intended for is highway robbery. 
It is embezzlement. This is what it looks like to them. This is 
what is being put directly on the table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of all these issues, it seems to me that the 
valuable motion introduced by the hon. member should be amended. 
Therefore, I move: 
<A NAME="LINK231">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the following words be added at the end of the motion: 
“and that the Standing Committee on Human Resources Development 
review the situation of these workers at its next sitting”. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am submitting this subamendment to the Chair to ensure that 
action will be taken in the short term. This amendment is 
supported by the hon. member for Portneuf and I hope that it 
will also get the support of the House. It would allow us to go 
beyond idle promises so that after two years all those who 
kept pushing to have this issue looked at by the Standing 
Committee on Human Resources Development would finally get some 
result as early as at the next sitting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the committee decides to sit tomorrow morning or the day 
after, it will not be a problem, we will be there. 
We will ensure that we can work on this issue.

subamendment so that seasonal workers can finally get justice. 
This is also an opportunity for the Liberal government to 
eliminate the terrible burden that it put on workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seasonal workers are not lazy people. They want to work but the 
government has deprived them of the dignity associated with 
working. We must give it back to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Does the hon. member wish to submit a 
subamendment? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, I already did, but I can present it 
again: 
That the following be added at the end of the motion: “and that 
the Standing Committee on Human Resources Development review the 
situation of these workers at its next sitting”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The Chair has some reservations as to 
whether the amendment is in order. We will continue debate while 
the Chair considers the amendment proposed by the hon. member. 
<P><A NAME="LINK232"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour (Beauséjour—Petitcodiac, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
first of all I would like to thank my colleague from 
Acadie—Bathurst for giving us the opportunity today to discuss 
once again the serious problem of seasonal workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My Bloc Quebecois colleague who just spoke closed his speech 
with a reference to dignity.  It is true that our seasonal 
workers have been stripped of their dignity.  That happened some 
years ago already. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It happened the day that the Prime Minister of Canada, that same 
man who came to the riding I represent, then called Beauséjour, 
seeking votes.  When he got back to Ottawa after campaigning in 
our riding, the first thing he told all the Canadians in the 
country is that he had been to New Brunswick where he had seen 
unemployed people bending their elbows in taverns.  He said: 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“In New Brunswick, seasonal workers are in taverns collecting 
EI”. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You can easily imagine what Canadians think of seasonal workers 
now.  These words came from the mouth of the man who went after 
these same people to get voted into this House and to now be the 
Prime Minister. This gives us some idea of what kind of man is 
leading this country today.  The people of New Brunswick could 
readily find a number of terms to describe him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we have our hands full doing away with this perception 
and making Canadians realize that seasonal workers are not lazy 
people. 
If only hon. members could go to these plants, they would see 
that men and women there sometimes put in 100 or so hours a week 
for minimum wage, on their feet from morning to night, sunup to 
sundown, trying to earn a little money to take home.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same thing can be seen in all sectors not just in New 
Brunswick.  It is the same in any area of seasonal employment. 
First of all, it is not the workers who are seasonal, it is the 
work that is, or their communities, with their high unemployment 
levels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of trying to develop our regions, instead of trying to 
create more jobs, this government has taken away the only 
program that helped these people.  The reform was well thought 
out by this Liberal government.  It focussed on one particular 
group, the workers in areas of seasonal employment.  They are 
the ones targeted. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has created a situation that is quite desperate in some 
areas.  We have a discriminatory clause on the intensity rule. 
We have all talked about it but nobody is doing anything about 
it.  I do not see the Liberal government doing anything about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not hear enough about the divisor.  Most of the MPs in the 
House probably do not know what the word means because they have 
never been on EI.  Well some of us have collected EI cheques 
because we have needed to.  The divisor is a serious problem 
because some people receive only $30 week.  Before the last cuts 
to the program, they were receiving maybe $200 or $250 a week. 
This is what the new EI has done to these people.  We have to 
recognize that in order to fix it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How about the pilot project we are under?  Practically the 
whole country is under this project and not under the real act 
because of the small weeks.  We are not talking about that 
either.  That has to be permanently correctly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How about the zones?  We could solve maybe 80% of the problems 
in some areas if we had a minister who would rezone the way it 
should be done.  Let us put the rural communities together and 
the urban communities together.  In Albert county, Petitcodiac 
and Salisbury, we have two national parks in one zone and another 
one in another zone.  One group of workers in these parks can 
qualify with 420 hours while the other group of workers need 669 
hours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about the duration for these two communities.  In 
one community, the workers can receive 26 weeks of EI while in 
the other community the workers receive 15 weeks, but they are 
all in the same riding.  How can this happen?  It happened under 
this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to talk about the duration problem.  We have people 
going with no incomes for up to 12 to 15 weeks.  Can anybody here 
live with no income for 15 weeks?  Why do we think that a person 
who has seasonal job can?  It is unbelievable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about the Canada jobs fund.  The Canada jobs fund 
can be very good if it is used right.  The government likes to 
talk about abuse in the EI system but it forgets to talk about 
its abuse of the fund.  I have to say that I have seen it work 
very well in my riding if it is done right.  All we have to do is 
get the politicians who make it not right out of the picture. 
Let us just do it right.  Let us let the MP recommend the 
project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In one instance I did not recommend a project in my riding 
because I knew there was something wrong with it.  Let us think 
for a minute what happened to it.  Within a year it had folded 
and we lost the money.  I had not recommended that project but 
the minister went over my head and gave funds to that group 
knowing it was not going to work.  There was no plan.  Little 
political favours like that cost a lot money.  Those programs 
will work if we want them to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the last round of cuts, my riding alone has lot $52 
million a year.  New Brunswick has lost over a billion dollars in 
four years.  That is a lot of money.  That will not solve our 
problem.  Our problem is high unemployment.  We have to create 
the jobs. 
We probably will never create enough jobs for everybody to work 
year-round.  We have to recognize that we have seasonal 
industries.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>TRADE 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK235"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, my 
question tonight follows on a question I posed on November 19 of 
this year regarding an agricultural trade issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Protectionism in the international trade of agriculture is on 
the rise.  U.S. border state politicians are increasing their 
rhetoric and are once again starting to rattle their trade 
sabres, threatening the livelihood of Canadian agricultural 
producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most recent example of this protectionism is the 
anti-dumping and countervail petition to the U.S. department of 
commerce by the Montana producers' group, R-CALF.  R-CALF claimed 
that Canadian cattle were government subsidized and were dumped 
on the U.S. market.  Before the United States International Trade 
Commission finally ruled in Canada's favour, Canadian cattlemen 
were forced to pay a 5.63% provisional tariff on their export 
cattle, open their books to a foreign government agency and spend 
millions of dollars in legal fees to defend their industry 
against these groundless claims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian cattlemen are fair traders but are being left exposed 
to the threat of multimillion dollar legal battles because of the 
indifference of the government and its failure to treat 
agricultural trade as a priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has had six years to reduce the bilateral trade 
irritants with our biggest trading partner.  The current 
definition of dumping, which does not consider the cyclical 
nature of the agriculture industry, trapped Canadian cattlemen 
when they were forced to sell their cattle below the price of 
production several years ago.  This poorly worded definition does 
more to hurt Canadian industry than to protect it.  A responsible 
definition should reflect market cycles and take action in cases 
of predatory pricing and selling below home market prices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another aggravation for cattlemen in this case was the failure 
of the agriculture minister to take decisive action to implement 
changes recommended by the Canadian cattle industry, changes that 
would address trade tensions between Canada and the U.S. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Frustrated by the inaction of the federal government in the wake 
of the R-CALF petition, a group of cattlemen in my riding came 
together and formed a producer group called the North West Beef 
Producers.  This group raised over $200,000 to finance meetings 
with U.S. producers to seek a solution to these repeated trade 
disputes.  It requested an expansion of the north west pilot 
project, specifically asking for a national exemption on Blue 
Tongue and recommending a treatment protocol for anaplasmosis, 
allowing year-round entry to Canada of feeder cattle from the 
U.S. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, despite the fact that considerable research has proven 
that lifting the restrictions will not adversely affect the 
health of the Canadian herd, and that these proposals do not 
depend on federal financial assistance for their success, the 
federal minister of agriculture left cattlemen high and dry, 
promising only to further explore the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the U.S. ITC ruled in Canada's favour, this government 
is making a mistake if it thinks that the Americans are willing 
to give up the fight.  The government need only look at the 
$75,000 donation that the Government of South Dakota made to the 
R-CALF campaign to see how seriously the northern tier U.S. 
states view this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How long will the minister of agriculture leave Canadian 
cattlemen exposed to the kind of trade harassment that we have 
seen over the last year before he implements the regulatory 
changes to the north west pilot project requested by industry 
groups and when will the changes to the definition of dumping 
that the industry is asking for be implemented? 
<P><A NAME="LINK236"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Speller (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Trade Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. 
member for bringing this matter forward tonight.  I would 
encourage him to come to the foreign affairs committee, which has 
discussed this issue in the past a number of times.  His 
colleagues on the committee might remind him of the times that we 
discussed this issue at the foreign affairs committee.  It is a 
very important issue for Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his intervention the member raised the anti-dumping 
investigation on live cattle which was recently concluded by the 
United States.  It is important to say that the International 
Trade Commission ruled that Canada's shipments of live cattle are 
not injuring the U.S. industry. 
Therefore, dumping duties will not be assessed.  The Government 
of Canada is very pleased with this decision.

<A HREF="#LINKT55"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an export driven economy, Canada is concerned with the use of 
trade remedies such as anti-dumping by growing numbers of 
countries.  These measures can significantly impair access to 
foreign markets.  In this regard we recognize that there is scope 
for improvement in the rules which allow considerable discretion 
by investigating authorities.  That is why we are seeking 
multilateral negotiations to clarify anti-dumping rules.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>NATIONAL DEFENCE 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK238"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan—Coquihalla, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
at this time of the year it is very important that we take the 
opportunity, when it is given, to express our gratitude to the 
men and women of the Canadian forces who are serving abroad and 
will not be home with their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was in this context that on December 1 I asked the Minister 
of National Defence a question pertaining to the replacement of 
the Canadian forces' Sea King maritime helicopter.  I pointed out 
that the Liberal government's own 1994 defence white paper, which 
is the official government policy, promised that the Sea King 
would be replaced prior to the year 2000.  The Liberal 
government's 1994 white paper states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's maritime forces will be adequately equipped to carry out 
their new array of tasks.  There is an urgent need for robust and 
capable new shipborne helicopters—. Work will, therefore, begin 
immediately to identify options and plans to put into service new 
affordable replacement helicopters by the end of the decade. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is found at page 46 of the defence white paper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Note that the 1994 white paper promised to have new maritime 
helicopters put into service by the end of the decade, not 
tendered as a contract, but—and again I stress—put into 
service.  That means that our maritime helicopter air crews 
should be taking delivery of the last few helicopters during the 
next couple of weeks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, given the late date, the Liberal government has 
broken its promise to Canadians and its commitment to its very 
own defence white paper of 1994. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In November, during a meeting of the standing committee on 
national defence, the Minister of National Defence proclaimed 
that no new maritime helicopter would be in service until the 
year 2005 at the very earliest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of National Defence has broken his own government's 
stated policy.  This broken promise by the Liberal government has 
very serious consequences for the Canadian forces, and in 
particular the personnel.  Continuing to use the Sea Kings has 
reduced the operational capabilities of our forces, and it has 
also placed those air crews at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Sea Kings are now 35 years old, older than most of the 
people serving as crew on those crafts.  The equipment is 
technically out of date and requires over 30 hours of maintenance 
for every one hour of flight.  Often, when needed on missions or 
during military manoeuvres, the Sea Kings are unavailable due to 
technical difficulties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my question on December 1 I said that Canadians continually 
read about how forces operations have been hampered by the 
failures of the Sea Kings.  It took only one day to find an 
example.  On December 2 the news headlines read that a Sea King 
helicopter experienced engine failure and was forced to make an 
emergency landing on the water at Dili Harbour in East Timor. 
This was an operational disaster that put Canadian air service 
personnel at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today the Canadian Press carried a story that the Sea Kings are 
literally disintegrating in the skies, with at least seven 
significant pieces falling off in mid-flight since July.  For 
example, on July 7 a window popped off a cargo door, landing near 
a house in York Harbour, Newfoundland.  Worse still, on October 
12 a bolt popped off a Sea King, forcing an emergency landing at 
Shearwater. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is unacceptable.  The Liberal policy has been broken.  I 
believe that the government has lost its commitment to the 
Canadian forces.  It has lost capability for the forces and, most 
tragically, lost lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the government, where is the replacement for the Sea King 
helicopter?

service, Sea King helicopters have made an outstanding 
contribution in many areas, and more particularly in 
surveillance, and search and rescue operations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have been deployed throughout the world, during the gulf 
war, in Somalia, in Haiti, in the Adriatic Sea for our 
involvement in NATO operations, and also in East Timor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think all Canadians should be proud of what the Sea Kings and 
their crews have accomplished over the years. 
But, as the minister has said, it is time to replace the Sea 
Kings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has confirmed on several occasions in the House 
that, as far as equipment goes, the new maritime helicopter 
project is his first priority. We are working on an acquisition 
strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But this work is taking more time than we had foreseen in the 
white book, because the government wants to make sure we will 
have the equipment that meets our needs best. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government must make sure that the new maritime helicopter 
will met the operational needs of the Canadian forces. For a 
procurement program as important as this one, several 
departments have to be consulted. The government will make an 
announcement when everything is ready. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>]

<P><A NAME="LINK241"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to bring to the attention of the House 
yet again an issue that has been before the Canadian public for 
some time.  I am talking about the failure of the solicitor 
general's department to take control of some of its own internal 
agencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to this issue, the CSIS agent had sensitive 
documents taken from a car while at a hockey game in Toronto.  We 
know that the head of CSIS has commenced an investigation, but 
since that time more security breaches have been exposed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The solicitor general by his acquiescence has been putting in 
question the good name of the CSIS agents and the RCMP.  The 
problem is obvious.  There is no accountability from the top 
officers at CSIS or the solicitor general and those within his 
department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The recent sad chapter involves a CSIS agent at a hockey game 
with top secret documents pertaining to the plan of the country 
with respect to internal security.  The solicitor general should 
have said the puck stops here.  Obviously that has not happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Time and time again we have seen the non-answers, the rhetoric 
and the tired preprogrammed responses of the solicitor general in 
the House.  He states that he takes national security as a 
serious matter, that it is a top priority for the government, and 
that there is a process which has to be followed.  Bunk.  This is 
absolute nonsense.  If this were the case things would change. 
They do not change and that is very obvious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The solicitor general did not inform the head of SIRC, Paule 
Gauthier.  She found out through reading the <I>Globe and Mail</I> 
almost a week after the event occurred.  The solicitor general 
said he was informed of the event by the director, Ward Elcock. 
We know Mr. Elcock does not have a great deal of respect for this 
place or certainly for parliamentarians.  He has no respect for 
SIRC and no respect even for the minister, I would suggest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The director, aided by the minister, has undermined the role of 
SIRC.  It appears at worst that he deliberately covered up the 
theft of the CSIS plan or at best acquiesced and sat on it.  The 
solicitor general seems oblivious to this.  The lights are on but 
there does not appear to be anybody home.  Furthermore, no one 
has held the head of CSIS, Mr. Elcock, accountable.  The CSIS 
board has had vacancies for years.  It was only this summer that 
the inspector general's role was filled, just prior to this 
fiasco being uncovered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The solicitor general said that he did not inform the Prime 
Minister's Office.  Yet the Prime Minister was overseas making 
comments about it and trying to downplay it as a serious incident 
and a serious breach of security.  If the solicitor general did 
not inform the Prime Minister, how was the Prime Minister able to 
make such pointed comments?  Who informed him and what faith 
should we have in a solicitor general who keeps this from the 
Prime Minister? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The solicitor general took great licence with the word 
immediately when the theft had occurred three weeks before and 
had already been reported in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> before it 
was uncovered at all.  Why was SIRC not informed immediately?

<A HREF="#LINKT57"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the solicitor general is covering up for CSIS, this needs to 
be exposed.  Was he trying to hide the embarrassment of the 
incident from the Prime Minister and the Canadian people?  If 
everyone is informed and the process is going to work, everyone 
has to be informed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The solicitor general obviously does not understand his 
departments.  He does not understand the individuals who are 
involved and he cannot continue to pass the buck.  These are very 
serious communication breakdowns.  We already know that the RCMP 
and CSIS are not communicating effectively.  Obviously the 
solicitor general is not prepared to step in and see that his 
departments are co-operating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary will tell us in a few minutes that 
things are fine.  It will be the same broken record response that 
we will hear from the solicitor general.  He will parrot the same 
line, but we know this is a problem in the country right now. The 
solicitor general should have at least asked to call the director 
before him and make him take account for what occurred. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are very worried, as they should be, about national 
security.  The solicitor general and the government, by their 
actions, demonstrate that they do not take these matters 
seriously.  They demonstrate that they have no respect for the 
concerns of parliamentarians and Canadians at large.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jacques Saada (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General

member opposite is accusing me of always giving him the same 
answers. What am I supposed to do if he keeps asking me the same 
questions? Do I have a choice? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be clear. There was a security breach, which I deplore as 
much as my colleague, but he is not the only one who is 
concerned with the safety of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a security breach occurs, and it does happen unfortunately 
because our systems rely on humans who sometimes make mistakes, 
there is a process in place to deal with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague knows full well that this very House established 
two institutions at the same time as the Canadian Security 
Intelligence Service: the Inspector General and the  Security 
Intelligence Review Committee, or SIRC. Both are investigating 
these matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Both institutions are totally independent and have unrestricted 
access to all CSIS documents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These matters to which my colleague referred are being reviewed 
by these two institutions. There was absolutely no obligation on 
the part of the minister to inform SIRC. It is not his duty. 
SIRC is a review committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I somewhat deplore the fact that, as soon as an incident occurs, 
my colleague opposite always has the same reaction: first he
