Mr. Speaker, as the member of Parliament for Prince 
Albert-Churchill River and the chair of the House of Commons 
Standing Committee on Natural Resources, I extend my 
congratulations to the citizens and town council of Creighton, 
Saskatchewan today. They have passed an important resolution 
supporting the Keep Mining in Canada campaign and the industry's 
10-point plan to create a healthy investment climate for mining in 
Canada.
<P>
	Creighton is the 132nd community across Canada to adopt such 
a resolution to demonstrate its support for a continued, thriving 
mining industry in Canada. The health of these 132 local 
economies depends significantly on the health of the mining sector.
<P>
	The 132 resolutions show that these towns care deeply about the 
future of the mining industry and I for one applaud the town of 
Creighton and all Canadians who care about working together to 
ensure a healthy mining sector.

	<B>Mr. Bernard Deshaies (Abitibi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
campaign ``mining, an industry to be supported'' is moving today 
to Ottawa. I would like to salute the presence among us of mining 
industry representatives who have come to see the government in 
action. Or rather, I should say, in inaction.
<P>
	The Liberal government had promised to streamline the 
regulatory maze facing the mining industry. Nothing has been 
done. The Liberals were committed to improving the flow through 
share system, but nothing has been done in that area either.
<P>
	Despite the federal government's inaction, Toronto-based 
Falconbridge recently announced that $500 million would be 
invested in Northern Quebec, which will create hundreds of jobs.
<P>
	The proposed investment shows that the prospect of a Yes vote 
does not scare investors from the rest of Canada. Better yet, it 
demonstrates the potential and vitality of the mining sector in 
Quebec.
<P>
	Just imagine how this sector will grow once Quebec becomes 
sovereign.

	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, this past Monday I was saddened to learn of the death 
of a great Canadian and a constituent of 
Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt.
<P>
	Eric Reilly knew this country well. He was politically wise and 
his efforts are well known in my riding as a Reform pioneer, an 
organizer, a man who introduced scores of new members to the 
Reform Party of Canada. He did this for the love of his country and 
for the future of his children, his grandchildren and their children.
<P>
	Eric was a fourth generation Canadian born in Dauphin, 
Manitoba, 82 years ago. He passed away peacefully on October 16, 
1995. Eric Reilly is survived by his loving wife of over 50 years, 
Nora, four children and eight grandchildren.
<P>
	During the last months of Eric's life he wrote his autobiography 
<I>The Life of Reilly</I>, tracing his early years. But his greatest memories 
were of his family. He wrote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The only thing you have left, regardless of how much money you have 
accumulated, is your family. I will be leaving a fortune.</BLOCKQUOTE>

	Relaying government information to the general public has

between government information services and the public library 
system has been successfully in place for over 100 years. It would 
be most unfortunate if communications between the government 
and the people of Canada should be endangered.
<P>
	With the privatization of CCG, government documents will 
become expensive and difficult to obtain.
<P>
	For the sake of providing information to Canadians, I ask the 
government to consider retaining the publishing function of CCG 
while giving up the responsibility for printing.

	<B>Mr. Stan Dromisky (Thunder Bay-Atikokan, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, today I rise to pay tribute to the Canadian mining industry. 
Canada is the third largest mining nation in the world and the 
world's largest producer of uranium, zinc and potash. Almost 80 
per cent of Canada's mineral production is exported.
<P>
	Mining is the mainstay of employment in over 115 communities 
in Canada. For every 10 jobs created in the mining industry, 8 more 
jobs are indirectly created. For every dollar spent on mining 
research and development, there is a $3 benefit to the Canadian 
economy.
<P>
	Over the past two years the demand for nickel has jumped 20 per 
cent. Fortunately Canadians have the resource, the workforce and 
the expertise to meet this anticipated demand.
<P>
	It is for these reasons that we must work together in a 
co-operative spirit to foster an environment in which the mining 
industry may continue to flourish in this great country of ours.

	<B>Mr. Gurbax Singh Malhi (Bramalea-Gore-Malton, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, Canada is consistently rated as one of the best nations 
in the world in which to live. The United Nations ranked us number 
one twice in the last three years. A recent private sector ranking of 
cities around the world ranked four Canadian cities in the top 
twelve.
<P>
	All around the globe are people who yearn for the rights and 
freedoms, not to mention the peace and personal security, we enjoy 
as Canadians. We are incredibly fortunate to live in a country 
founded on the principles of freedom and democracy.
<P>
	As an immigrant to this great country I find it hard to believe 
anyone, let alone descendants of the first Fathers of Confederation, 
would ever consider leaving it.
<P>
	Quebecers should take a good hard look at the state of other 
countries around the world before they decide to separate from this 
one.

anniversary of ``L'étoile d'or'' seniors' club in Elliott Lake.
<P>

	As always, the members, volunteers and directors did a good job 
of representing the Franco-Ontarians in our region. As always, they 
have shown that the French fact is still very strong throughout 
Northern Ontario because the francophones in our region have 
great love and esteem for the distinctive features and wealth of 
their culture and heritage.
<P>
	There is no need for Quebec to leave Canada in order to preserve 
the French culture. To the contrary, we believe that the French 
culture will have a better chance of surviving in a united Canada, as 
my friends from the ACFO and the seniors' club have

Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Finance contends that all the evils in 
the world will befall a sovereign Quebec and one million jobs will 
be lost.
<P>
	We will recall that the minister himself, along with his present 
government colleagues, opposed the free trade agreement with the 
United States because, as reported in the June 21, 1988 <I>Hansard</I>, it 
would have ``-a negative impact on many industries and 
communities and because it will jeopardize the Canadian economic 
and social structure as well as Canada's political independence''.
<P>
	In fact, as we know, the FTA created thousands of jobs in Canada 
and gave a tremendous boost to our exports.
<P>
	The no side, and the Liberal Party of Canada in particular, have 
always used fear as an argument against progress. On October 30, 
Quebecers will oppose them by saying yes to sovereignty.

	The minister should know how internal probes feel by now. This 
summer he asked his employees to clear him of charges of steering 
lucrative contracts to a campaign contributor who just happened to 
be the golfing buddy of the Prime Minister.
<P>
	The internal whitewash declared the minister clean even though 
a letter from the minister's office blatantly directed a government

<P>
	At a time when funding for Canadian colleges, universities and 
institutes is being reduced through cuts in transfer payments, the 
House is about to pass legislation today that will see Canadian 
taxpayers funding United States universities and colleges.
<P>
	Yes, Canadian taxpayers will be able to support American 
colleges and universities. Bill S-9 will enable Canadians to donate 
funds to any college or university in the United States and then be 
able to deduct these contributions on their tax returns. Canadians 
will now be able to donate money to Harvard, Stanford, UCLA or 
Eastern Arkansas State College and then deduct these contributions 
on their Canadian tax returns.

impressed by an ad placed by the francophone community of 
Alberta in the Wednesday edition of <I>Le Soleil</I> two weeks ago.
<P>
	What it said reflected the concerns of French speaking 
communities across Canada. Canada is recognized around the 
world as a bilingual country where both English and French are 
spoken. The future of the French language in Canada would be 
seriously threatened in a divided country. It is obvious.
<P>
	Francophones were among the founders of cities like Moncton, 
Winnipeg, Regina and Edmonton. The voyageurs who discovered 
new territories and the settlers who farmed this new land are but a 
few examples of this. We must not break the ties between Quebec 
and francophone communities in the other Canadian provinces. 
Together, we are stronger, much stronger.
<P>
	I will conclude by quoting the French Canadian Association of 
Alberta and saying, on behalf of all francophone communities in 
Canada, that the French language has a place in Canada, and so 
does Quebec.

	<B>Mr. Paul DeVillers (Simcoe North, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
according to the Bloc Quebecois, French speaking people outside 
Quebec are all condemned to assimilation unless Quebec separates.
<P>
	That reasoning is all the more insulting because it is unsound. 
Today, there are seven million French speaking people in Canada, 
out of a total population of 27 million, which means about 25 per 
cent of all Canadians. Should the Yes side win, there would be one 
million French speaking people in Canada out of a total population 
of 20 million, or five per cent of Canadians.
<P>
	Separatists are prepared to jeopardize the remarkable progress 
that we have made over the last 30 years to protect and promote 
French in Canada. Separation would result in the worst geopolitical

Daniel Johnson's estimates by ten.

<P>
	Although mining contributes greatly to the economy, the sad fact 
is that today the Canadian mining industry is in serious trouble. 
Domestic mining exploration expenditures for 1992 valued at $385

reach $675 million this year, well below the $800 million level 
generally regarded as the threshold required to maintain reserves.

in an apocalyptic speech to Quebec's industrial commissioners, the 
finance minister predicted one million jobs would be lost the day 
after a win by the Yes side, thus upsetting a number of people in the

<P>
	My question is directed to the Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs. Would such farfetched statements not seriously 
compromise the credibility of the finance minister and are they 
not a definite indication that panic has struck the federal side?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, the finance minister was right. He said there are one 
million jobs in Quebec that are affected by export industries, 
including those that export to the rest of Canada, and that Quebec's 
separation would create considerable problems in this area.
<P>
	What he said was perfectly true and is supported by the statistics. 
It is an indication of the extremely negative economic 
consequences of Quebec's separation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, would the 
Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs not agree that his colleague 
in the Finance Department has gone too far by taking such an 
irresponsible approach, since his responsibility and first duty as 
finance minister is to avoid any statements that might cause a 
negative reaction on the financial markets?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, the finance minister also has a duty to point out what 
would really happen if Quebec separates.
<P>
	In his role as finance minister, he has an obligation to point out 
that separation will not only cost us hundreds of thousands of jobs, 
as the leader of the No committee said, but also that many jobs 
would be affected by changes occurring subsequent to separation, 
and particularly by the fact that, as the finance minister pointed out, 
Quebec would have to renegotiate its entry in NAFTA and the 
successor organization to GATT.
<P>
	These are aspects that will create substantial economic problems 
in Quebec and, once again, the finance minister has a duty to point 
this out to Quebecers.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, does the 
Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs not realize that the finance 
minister's apocalyptic speech, which was actually received with 
some scepticism by industrial development advisers, gets us 
nowhere and is in fact is oddly similar to the speeches they made on 
free trade a few years ago, and which subsequently turned out to be 
all wrong?

<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, the supporters of the Yes  committee, which includes the 
Bloc
<P>
Quebecois, would have Quebecers believe that separation will take 
place without a hitch, without any negative economic 
consequences, without any impact on Quebec's relations with the 
rest of Canada, the United States and Mexico.
<P>
	That is not true, and it is not enough to wave a magic wand and 
say ``Poof! Let the problems vanish!'' for them to vanish.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh!
<P>
	<B>Mr. Massé:</B> The truth is that separation will create tremendous 
problems, it will affect investment in Quebec, jobs and exports. 
Whatever the Bloc and the PQ say, it is important to get the truth 
out and that Quebecers know on October 30 what the real 
consequences will be of separation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs.
<P>
	In an effort to add weight to his apocalyptic speech, the Minister 
of Finance claimed that business in Quebec would no longer be 
able to export to the United States, as if a veritable great wall of 
China was going to be built around Quebec.
<P>
	Will the minister not acknowledge that, the day after a yes vote, 
American and Canadian businesses will not want to lose their 
privileged access to Quebec markets and that this unavoidable 
reality makes the apocalyptic scenario of the Minister of Finance 
completely ridiculous?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is obvious that there is no 
guarantee at all of this in the event a yes vote.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Deputy Prime Minister should know that the Americans will be 
looking for stability in their trading with Canada and Quebec the 
day after a yes vote.
<P>
	Does the minister not agree that nothing will better ensure the 
stability that the United States, and Canada as well, will be looking 
for than Quebec's early entry into NAFTA, as a number of 
American experts have already pointed out.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of

Canada's economic and commercial stability.

Canada had an all time record volume of foreign trade.

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr.

federal financial support of health care is declining in absolute 
terms. Under this government, federal funding has fallen to 22 per 
cent of the overall health care bill, with $7 billion in cuts in health 
care transfers projected.
<P>
	The provinces are wondering, the Canadian people are 
wondering, how the minister expects the provinces to replace the 
health care transfers she is withdrawing. She says they cannot 
charge the patients. She is against facility fees and she does not 
want private capital involved.
<P>
	Is the minister therefore proposing that the provinces impose 
additional health care taxes to replace the federal medicare funding 
she is withdrawing?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
perhaps I can explain to the hon. member what was contained in 
last February's budget. We will have a combined transfer called the 
Canada health and social transfer which, yes, will be cut. It 
includes not only health care, but many other services.
<P>
	Let us look at this in the proper context. For instance, in 
education, social programs and health, expenditures amount to 
about $100 billion in one year. Next year the cut will be in the 
neighbourhood of 3 per cent or slightly less. While it will be a 
challenge to manage this, we do believe that a less than 3 per cent 
cut is manageable.

<B>(1425 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I know when the minister took this job they told her there 
would be no math, but there is.
<P>
	There are only four sources of health care financing: federal 
transfers, patient contributions, private capital and provincial tax 
dollars. The minister is reducing the federal transfers. She is 
against the patient contributions. She is against the private capital. 
Therefore the only other source to replace the federal transfers is 
provincial tax increases.
<P>
	If the minister is against all these things, in reducing the 
transfers will she not admit that she is in effect telling the provinces 
to get the additional revenue through provincial tax increases? Yes 
or no.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
will repeat again what has been stated by all health economists 
across the country: It is not more money that is needed in the 
system; it is a different way of spending.
<P>
	What the hon. member is suggesting is the easy way out: a U.S. 
two-tier style system, one where the rich get the best treatment and 
for the rest of Canadians thank you, it is too bad.
<P>
	We are challenging all Canadians to work together to embrace 
those values which mean that we all get the same kind of access 
based on need. It is first class service that we want for everyone.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Canadian Constitution assigns responsibility for 
health care to the provinces. The federal government only gets 
involved through the exercise of its spending power which is now 
declining. The minister is the first federal Minister of Health to 
preside over annual reductions in federal transfers to the provinces 
for health care which is resulting in closing beds, waiting lines and 
friction with the provinces.
<P>
	Will the minister acknowledge that there are now distinct limits 
to the federal power over health care policy? Will she tell the 
House how those limits will affect her dealings with the provinces 
of Canada?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we continue to transfer considerable dollars to the provinces. As 
long as we transfer dollars to the provinces, we can ask that they 
respect certain principles. We say to them, yes, manage the system. 
We are giving them as much leeway as possible. We are very 
flexible but flexibility does not mean tearing up the Canada Health 
Act.
<P>
	This government stands for something which is valuable and 
which all Canadians stand for. Reform Party members are the only 
ones who believe in tearing up the Canada Health Act.

	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs.
<P>
	After trying in vain for a reimbursement of $127 million for 
fiscal year 1991-92 under the stabilization program, Quebec is 
forced to appeal to the Federal Court in order to win its claim. 
Unperturbed, the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs responded 
cynically and arrogantly that it was perfectly normal for Quebec to 
apply to the courts. Are we to understand that the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs considers it normal for Quebec to have 
to apply to the courts to obtain what Ottawa has owed it for the past 
four years? Is this what they call flexible federalism?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service  Renewal, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, flexible federalism in recent years has worked very well 
through negotiations with the various provinces. Specifically, for 
example, thanks to our action plans with nine provinces in Canada, 
I have signed-and I will leave it to them to guess which province 
has not signed-we have reached 64 agreements with the 
provinces, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15525"> 15525 </A></B>
<P>
including a dozen with Quebec, before the election of the Parti 
Quebecois, but afterwards, zip.
<P>
<B>(1430)</B>
<P>
	So, in terms of negotiations, clearly we resolve most of our 
problems through negotiation. As for this particular problem, Ms. 
Beaudoin has already come and presented her problem. In our 
opinion, there is nothing owing, nothing to pay. The regulations are 
clear: the Province of Quebec, in this case, is not entitled to 
payment, and we have told Quebec that we were prepared to let it 
go to court, that we would provide whatever assistance it needed to 
go to court and that it should get a decision from a court of law. 
This is the normal process.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, does the fact there were a number of agreements before 
the arrival of the Parti Quebecois not mean that the principal 
supporters of a no vote, with Mr. Johnson as a fine representative in 
Quebec, accepted any old thing from the federal government? This 
is why there were agreements. We, however, stand firm-that is the 
difference.
<P>
	How does the minister explain Quebec's receiving only 8 per 
cent to date of the funds from this federal stabilization program, 
when Ontario has received six times as much, that is, 44 per cent?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I should point out that the Province of Quebec has done 
fairly well in dealings with the federal government, because, for 
example, according to the study by George Mathews, one of the Le 
Hir studies, Quebec pays only 21 per cent of federal and other 
taxes, but receives 26 per cent of spending.
<P>
	So, when we look at the whole picture, we see clearly that 
Quebec receives a much larger share for valid reasons. 
Stabilization payments are made when there is a shortfall. The 
shortfall depends on all sorts of things that have to do with 
economic conditions and that are therefore subject to them and not 
to a system of sharing or of percentages between provinces.

	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
health minister is fond of saying health care should not depend on 
the size of one's wallet. What about the  size of the waiting list? For 
a hip replacement in Manitoba it is 61 weeks; 1,200 Ontarians 
waiting for heart bypasses; a 44-day delay in radiation for breast 
cancer treatment, three times longer than the medical college says 
is acceptable. People are dying on these waiting lists.
<P>
	When will the minister even admit there is a serious problem 
with the health care system and that she is causing the violation of 
the principle of accessibility in the Canada Health Act?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
suggest the hon. member deal directly with the provinces when it 
comes to waiting lists. She used two examples in her question, one 
respecting heart bypass surgery.
<P>
	There has been an announcement I believe from Ontario that it 
will be shortening that list. It will be transferring more money into 
that area. Recently there was another announcement in Ontario of a 
new centre for cancer treatment which will shorten the line for 
breast cancer treatment.
<P>
	That is what happens in a system that has everyone in it. Public 
pressure asks governments to transfer funds to where they are most 
needed. We think that is the way it has to be. That is how we have 
been well served in the past and that is how we should continue to 
be served.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, so yes, 
she is admitting accessibility is being violated and that these lines 
are getting shorter because people are going to the States, not 
because the health care system is getting any better.
<P>
	The health minister should open her eyes and take a good look at 
the health care system. If she did she would see these massive 
reductions in hospital closures and Canadians buying American 
waiting list insurance to stay alive. This is ridiculous.
<P>
<B>(1435 )</B>

lists to ensure Canadians are getting the most advanced, the most

answered that question in my previous answer. I remind the hon.

the world because it is first class.
<P>
	The idea that we should move to a U.S. style two-tier system is 
unacceptable to every member of my caucus. All the premiers say 
they support the Canada Health Act. Ministers of health from 
across the provinces support the Canada Health Act. Medical 
associations, nurses associations, hospital associations and the 
people of Canada support the Canada Health Act. The only

that is ready but will not be made public until after the referendum.
<P>
	Are we to understand that the reason for the minister's refusal to 
make his strategy on child care services known before the

national standards on Quebec in an area of provincial jurisdiction?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, once again the hon. member 
for Mercier is in a bit of a time warp in a number of respects. We 
have already indicated to the provinces and to other partners that 
we are prepared to cost share child care. We had a major meeting of 
deputies almost a year ago at which we offered to pay 50 per cent of 
the cost of new spaces.
<P>
	Fortunately a very important initiative was taken up by the First 
Nations people. We are almost ready to conclude an agreement 
with the First Nations Assembly for 6,000 new child care spaces 
sponsored by our First Nations people. We hope to have that 
concluded in a couple of weeks.
<P>
	Because certain provinces are now engaging in restricting child 
care, I simply wrote to the Ontario minister to remind him the 
federal government is willing to be a partner in sharing the cost of 
child care so these spaces do not have to be closed.
<P>
	I hope the hon. member will help carry that message because 
child care is very important to many Canadians.

	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic

are prepared to provide cost sharing over a five-year period and 
that it is the jurisdiction of the provinces to decide how that money 
would be allocated. I  am simply waiting for a response. I am not 
trying to be quick witted but it takes effort when dealing with Bloc 
questions.
<P>
	The provinces make these decisions. I want to ensure we can 
provide, as we do in many other areas, a national response so we 
can share and pool our resources to ensure areas with fewer 
resources are considered. That is why I took some interest today in 
the minister of employment in Quebec when she talked about 
totally fragmenting the national unemployment insurance service 
for Quebecers. It would put at risk thousands upon thousands of 
Quebec workers who would no longer have access to a national

<P>

Quebec has more than 21 per cent of Canada's agri-food industry.
<P>

agri-food industry?

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and

policies that apply to agriculture. In some cases those policies 
provide for grants and contributions, either to producers directly or 
to producer organizations, marketing systems, institutions and so 
forth.
<P>
	Another very valuable form of contribution by the Government 
of Canada comes in the form of our regulatory system that creates 
Canadian supply management, and 45 per cent of Quebec 
agriculture falls within the jurisdiction of the Canadian supply 
management system, which results in billions of dollars worth of

domestic market. As a result the dairy industry in Quebec could be 
placed in very substantial jeopardy.
<P>
	The clearest, best, strongest answer for preserving all these 
benefits for the dairy industry in Quebec and for the dairy industry 
in Canada is a clear and decisive no on October 30.

	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is directed to the Minister of Justice. Last spring, the Bloc 
Quebecois condemned the blatantly unfair treatment of Quebec by 
the Department of Justice when professional and special contracts 
are awarded. In his reply, the minister confirmed our statements, in 
other words, Quebec is losing out on contracts awarded by the 
Department of Justice.
<P>
	Today, could the Minister of Justice explain why Ontario, his 
own province, gets 80 per cent of the total value of his department's 
professional and special contracts, while businesses and 
individuals working under contract in Quebec get only 6 per cent?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, indeed it was last spring the hon. 
member put those questions. It was on that occasion that I provided 
the response and the response remains the same. The Department 
of Justice, like all departments of government, pursues a policy of 
open and competitive bidding for all work awarded by contract.
<P>
	I can tell the hon. member that no matter how the statistics might 
be used for present partisan purposes, the results and the 
advantages of the research and the work done at the Department of 
Justice are shared equally by all Canadians.

<P>
	It was a cold Friday in January 1980 when my wife was

boxes in domes with its infrastructure program. What is the 
government going to do about that? What should my wife tell 
these women who are waiting in line while their lives are being 
threatened?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member's wife was well treated when she became ill, 
thanks to Canada's good medicare system.
<P>
	Yes, there are challenges and they are not always easy to meet. 
However, we do not meet them by ripping up something that is very 
good. They are met by working at protecting the very values which 
have served Canadians so well.
<P>
	It is very important that all Canadians continue to have access to 
the services they need, not just because they can afford to pay extra 
for them, but because they need them. We have to work very 
closely with provincial governments, which we are doing. We are 
going to continue to do that.
<P>
	It is a question of equity and good access, not of having some get 
ahead in the line because they can pay more. That is not what is 
fair. Think of the 38 million Americans who have no insurance at 
all. What kind of lines are they in?

	<B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Minister of Industry.
<P>
	Prescription drugs represent 17 per cent of the total cost of health 
care in the country. These prices have increased 13 per cent each 
year over the past eight years due to Bill C-91, which the Liberals 
opposed in opposition but seem to support in government.
<P>
	The government can save Canadians nearly $1 billion yearly, 
simply by doing one thing: repealing Bill C-91 or, at the very least, 
abolishing the automatic injunction clause of the patented 
medicines regulations.
<P>
	Why will the government not stop the pharmaceutical drug 
manufacturers from ripping off Canadians with usury pricing of 
prescription drugs?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
first let me help the hon. member with some of his statistics 
because I think he would want to get them right.
<P>
	First, 15.1 per cent of national health expenditures in the last 
year for which we have full statistics were for pharmaceuticals. 
Patented drugs only account for 40 per cent of the pharmaceuticals 
purchased in those expenditures. In addition, with respect to 
patented medicines, and this is determined by an independent 
board, the price increase from 1987 to 1994 was 2.1 per cent per 
year.
<P>
	If the hon. member begins to take those statistics into account he 
might phrase his question a little differently. As he knows, and I 
have assured the House several times, we are reviewing Canada's 
drug patent policy. In addition, under Bill C-91 there is a 
parliamentary review process that will be invoked in 1997.

	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I am happy to note that the hon. 
member for Roberval is here while I raise this issue.
<P>
	During question period, my colleague, the hon. member for 
Timiskaming-French River decided to put a question to a 
government minister. He chose to do so in English, which is 
obviously his second language. While he was on his feet, a heckler 
on the other side of the House asked the hon. member: ``Can't you 
speak French?''

<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="AUDITORGENERAL'SREPORT">AUDITOR GENERAL'S REPORT</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise on a point of order concerning the auditor general's report 
tabled on October 5, 1995 and referred to the Standing Committee 
on Public Accounts.
<P>
	I contend that the tabling and referral to the committee of this 
report is out of order because the report in question contravenes the 
Auditor General Act and the conventions and prerogatives of the 
House.
<P>
	I draw attention to section 5 of the Auditor General Act which 
defines the position as the ``auditor of the accounts of Canada'' and 
section 7(2) which sets out the parameters of the auditor general's 
reports. This paragraph empowers the auditor general to report that 
the records of the public accounts were faithfully kept, that 
expenditures have been made only as authorized by Parliament and 
with due regard for efficiency, and that due measures are taken to 
measure the effectiveness of programs.
<P>
	In his latest report the auditor general has clearly overstepped 
the legal and customary boundaries of his duties as a servant of the 
House and in my judgment has interfered with the rights of the 
House by making politically biased statements. Let me illustrate 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15531"> 15531 </A></B>
<P>
this claim  with some direct quotations from the auditor general's 
report in question.
<P>
	In paragraph 9.84 the report states: ``We think that Parliament 
and the public need to focus on debt issues, particularly the amount 
of debt we carry''. The auditor general exists to help Parliament 
hold the government to account and not to hold Parliament to 
account for failing to adopt a particular policy. No company of 
shareholders in the private sector would accept an auditor's report 
that expressed an opinion about how the shareholders conducted 
themselves at meetings, rather than help the shareholders assess the 
management of the company. I contend that neither can we in the 
House.
<P>
	The auditor general further infringes on the rights of the House 
when he writes in paragraph 9.107 concerning the level of public 
debt:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Determining a strategy to achieve that vision is something the government 
and Parliament need to debate and develop a consensus on.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I do not need to remind you, Mr. Speaker, that the House does 
not necessarily exist to create a consensus around a particular 
economic theory. There are different and differing political theories 
and different political stances in the House. Therefore I contend 
that the House exists to hold the government of the day accountable 
in a way that reflects the diversity of political opinion in the 
country and that this is not recognized in the auditor general's 
report.
<P>
	The duty of the auditor general as set out in law is to aid 
Parliament in that task by providing technical information about 
the state of the public accounts to assist members of the House in 
their debates. It is not to preach to Parliament about what the 
conclusion of that debate should be.
<P>
	The same criticism can be applied to paragraph 9.52 of the report 
which states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The reality is that (interest rates) are not lower, and had it been a simple 
matter of making them lower in the 1980s and 1990s as they were in the 
previous 20 years, governments would have undoubtedly done so.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I would happily debate this point with anybody in the House, for 
it is common knowledge that the Bank of Canada under John Crow 
deliberately chose to dramatically increase interest rates in quest of 
a zero inflation rate.
<P>
	My procedural point is that I cannot argue this point with the 
auditor general because this statement comes in the form of an ex 
cathedra pronouncement of an auditor who is presumed to provide 
objective assessments of the public accounts. Yet I can think of no 
principle of accounting that would allow an auditor to offer such a 
tendentious historical verdict on the motives of past governments, 
a verdict which supports a particular political position on what 
caused our fiscal problems and what should be done about them.
<P>
	Because the auditor general like yourself, Mr. Speaker, is a 
servant of Parliament, he should not use the authority of his 
position to advance political arguments as if they were uncontested 
accounting principles. His reports must demonstrate the highest 
degree of political neutrality. He cannot perform the role of auditor 
as set out clearly in the Auditor General Act if he uses his position 
to take sides in debates that properly take place in the House. The 
auditor general has therefore overstepped his legal and customary 
duties in his latest report.
<P>
<B>(1510)</B>
<P>
	I ask you, Mr. Speaker, to consider two measures to defend the 
rights of the House to have access to an objective auditing of the 
public accounts. First, I ask you to rule the tabling of the October 5 
report to be out of order and to have you ask that the auditor general 
submit an amended report that conforms to his duties as set out in 
the Auditor General Act. Second, I ask you to refer the matter of 
the terms of reference for auditor general's reports to the Standing 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I was not given prior notice of this point of order.
<P>
	It strikes me as a rather serious challenge by the hon. member 
that the auditor general should not be independent of government, 
not be independent of the opinions of the House when he studies 
the efficiency of the government and the spending of government. 
Certainly if the auditor general does not have the independence to 
make suggestions on whether or not governments have acted 
prudently, we have stripped him of his power and we have stripped 
him of his reason for being. Therefore I disagree with the hon. 
member. I think his argument is very weak and should not even be 
considered in the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member for Winnipeg Transcona has argued with his usual 
erudition but I submit that even in his wildest dreams he could not 
have imagined that the point he has raised is really a question of 
privilege.
<P>
	I refer Your Honour to-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Blaikie:</B> A point of order, I said.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> A point of order. I thought he said it breached the 
privileges of the House, Mr. Speaker, and that he wanted it ruled 
out of order because it breached the privileges of the House, 
because it interfered with our privilege to manage our financial 
affairs, the financial affairs of the country.
<P>
	I turn to citation 24 of Beauchesne's sixth edition where it states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15532"> 15532 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Parliamentary privilege is the sum of the peculiar rights enjoyed by each House 
collectively as a constituent part of the High Court of Parliament, and by Members 
of each House individually, without which they could not discharge their 
functions.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I submit that in the tabling of this report there has been no 
impedance with members' functions or their ability to discharge 
their functions. We have here a situation where the hon. member 
disagrees with some of the contents of the report. I have no doubt 
the government disagrees with some of the contents of the report as 
well. I suspect if I read it all as thoroughly as the hon. member 
obviously has I would probably disagree with parts of the report.
<P>
	However the place for him to take his complaints is not to the 
House to have the report ruled out of order. The auditor general has 
a right to submit his opinions to the House. He is an officer of the 
House and that is his duty. Surely the hon. member should go to the 
public accounts committee and complain about the report if he 
disagrees with it. Then the public accounts committee would report 
to the House saying it disagrees with the auditor general's report if 
the committee agrees. Surely that is where this complaint ought to 
go.
<P>
	The hon. member has not raised a point of order or a question of 
privilege in my submission. He has raised what I can only suggest 
is a complaint. He disagrees with the report, fine. He should go to 
the committee and express his disagreement. That is what the 
committee is for. That is why it has been referred there.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I think a very important point has been raised 
today. I take under advisement the opinions of the member for 
Kindersley-Lloydminster and the member for Kingston and the 
Islands.
<P>
	I would like to look at this a bit more closely in view of what has 
been said today and I would like to more inform myself of the 
particulars. I will reserve a decision on this point and get back to 
the House when and if it is needed.
<P>
	Is this on the same point of order? I do not want to get into a 
debate going back and forth.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Blaikie:</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all I want to apologize to my 
colleagues for not having given more notice and for that matter any 
notice. I would hope that some of the comments that have been 
made might change when people have an opportunity to think 
about it.
<P>
	The very fact the member gets up and says that I disagree with 
something in the report is the point I am trying to make. The report 
should be of such a factual nature that there is nothing in it to 
disagree with. It should be a report on various facts of a technical 
nature. The fact that I can find something to agree with or 
somebody else can find something to disagree with is the point I 
am trying to make about the report.
<P>
	Nobody elects the auditor general to make these kinds of 
judgments. I think we have a situation here that-
<P>
<B>(1515 )</B>
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I appreciate the member's intervention. I am sure 
he will agree with other members of the House and with me when I 
say that I would like to reserve my decision on this matter. I would 
like to inform myself a little more and get back to the House.
<P>
	I have a point of privilege from the hon. member for 
Madawaska-Victoria. Does this point of privilege arise from the 
question period today?

	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Ringuette-Maltais (Madawaska-Victoria,

comments that were made during today's oral question period.
<P>
	When my colleague from Timiskaming-French River asked his 
question, part of it was in English and part of it in French. As he 
was starting to formulate his question, we heard the Bloc member 
for Roberval's comments. This is a question of privilege, Mr. 
Speaker, and I want to thank you for hearing me out. We heard the 
hon. member for Roberval shout in this House to the hon. member 
for Timiskaming-French River: ``In French, please. In French''.
<P>
	My question of privilege is as follows: Canada has the charter of 
rights and freedoms and the Official Languages Act.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> One moment, please.
<P>
	A point of order was raised today but I ruled that it was not a 
point of order.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I have ruled on that. I was waiting for the hon. member to get to 
the point of privilege. It would seem to me at least at this point that 
we are engaging in debate on a decision I have already taken about 
a point of order.
<P>
	To this point at least I have not heard any argument that would 
deem this to be a point of privilege.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Exchanges take place in the House throughout 
question period, indeed throughout debate.
<P>
	I did not hear the statement that was alleged to have been made. 
Surely we have to be able to tolerate a certain amount of give and 
take in the House. This is the point I would like to impress on the 
House. There are going to be times when words may or may not 
<P>

<B><A NAME="15533"> 15533 </A></B>
<P>
have been used  that hon. members say they heard. In my view this 
is not a point of privilege.
<P>
	Privilege is about what would impede a person from speaking, 
from voting, from coming to the House. It was raised as a point of 
order and I ruled on this as a point of order.

decision, and it is truly for that reason that I will comply. For the

that, plain and simple.

<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> We are entering debate and we do not want to go 
down that road. I have made a ruling. The hon. member wanted

make the one statement which he made. It is on the record and it is 
clear. I ruled on a point of order earlier and, colleagues, I wish you 
would accept that point of order.

	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in my capacity as federal minister 
responsible for co-operatives, I wish to take the opportunity today 
to recognize and salute National Co-Operative Week and 
International Credit Union Day in Canada.
<P>
	Since pioneer times Canadians have found it beneficial to work 
together toward common goals. The co-operative movement 
springs from that community effort and involvement.
<P>
	An important part of our economy, co-ops provide over 133,000 
jobs and represent more than $140 billion in assets. Non-financial 
co-operatives have a volume of business of $20.7 billion. Together, 
caisse populaire and credit unions represent the fifth largest 
financial network in Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This year is important for the international co-operative 
movement, as it marks the 100th anniversary of the International 
Co-operative Alliance. The ICA represents more than 753 million 
members from 90 countries. The conference held in Manchester in 
September was a major event for the international co-operative 
movement. Revised co-operation principles were adopted that will 
propel co-ops into the 21st century. In this respect, I think that it 
would be proper to pay special tribute to Ian MacPherson, from 
British Columbia, who spearheaded the process.
<P>
<B>(1525)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Co-operatives are an effective way of providing a wide range of 
goods and services to their members and to consumers. While 
many co-operatives operate in urban centres, they have been 
especially effective in developing businesses and creating 
employment in rural areas and small communities.
<P>
	Through co-operation, many Canadians have established new 
businesses and expanded into new or unique ventures. For 
example, the Seaway Valley  Farmers Energy Co-operative in 
eastern Ontario will produce ethanol from locally grown grains.
<P>
	Involvement in co-operatives has helped many thousands of 
individuals learn new business and management skills which not 
only help them to manage their co-operatives but also gives them 
the skills to better manage their own enterprises and allows them to 
grow and expand.

<P>
	I want to mention how committed our young people are to the 
co-operative approach. Students have started co-ops in their 
schools to provide services in areas such as savings, housing, 
school supplies and computing science and, in some instances, to 
create summer jobs for themselves.
<P>
[English] 
<P>
	I urge all members, in our deliberations today and on every other 
occasion, to consider the potential of co-operation as a tool to help 
the country to continue to be a nation that is innovative, dynamic 
and proud of its accomplishments.
<P>
	From my home province of Saskatchewan in the west where our 
people demonstrate a high level of participation in co-operative 
organizations to Quebec, which also enjoys a high level of 
co-operative activity, the co-op movement is one very important 
bond of strength and unity.
<P>
	I congratulate the Canadian co-operative movement on its 
achievements and wish it much success in the years to come.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean Landry (Lotbinière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is with 
great respect for all those who have contributed to the development 
of co-operatives that I want to emphasize the importance of 
National Co-Operative Week and of International Credit Union 
Day.
<P>
	The co-op movement reflects the values of mutual help and 
solidarity which are dear to Quebecers and Canadians. In many 
regions, the co-op movement provided the solution to ensure an 
harmonious development geared to the needs of the local 
community. Agricultural co-operatives were among the first to 
support the economic development of our regions. They provided 
an efficient and economical tool to ensure that the required services 
were available for agricultural production. Co-operatives have 
played, and continue to play, an important role in job creation. 
They provide over 133,000 jobs to Canadians and Quebecers.
<P>
	The co-op system has fully shown its usefulness. It is an 
important component of Quebec's economy. Just think of the 
strength of the caisses populaires Desjardins and of the dairy 
co-operatives. The co-op movement is based on a local community 
taking charge; by pooling its  resources and working as a team, it 
can be very successful.
<P>
	This year marks the one hundredth anniversary of the 
International Co-operative Alliance. It is an opportunity to reflect 
on the
<P>
fact that, for decades now, people all over the world have believed 
in the virtues of the co-op movement and have worked hard to 
make these known to others.
<P>
	I congratulate these people, I encourage them to keep up the 
good work, and I wish them the best of success in their future 
endeavours.

Reform colleagues with regard to National Co-Operative Week and 
International Credit Union Day.
<P>
	The co-op movement has a long and proud tradition in my 
province of Saskatchewan. It has played a significant role in the 
development of the province, in our nation and lands beyond our 
borders.
<P>
	I pause to reminisce for a minute. My father was involved in 
some of the early co-operative movements. In fact his membership 
number in the Western Credit and Savings Union in Swift Current, 
Saskatchewan, was 152 which indicates some of the history and 
grassroots nature of the movement.
<P>
<B>(1530 )</B>
<P>
	Like most people in the prairies, and perhaps across Canada, I 
belong to several co-operatives. Interestingly enough, one of the 
first meetings I had as a member of Parliament was with the credit 
union management, members and boards of directors in west 
central Saskatchewan. It was a very profitable meeting, indeed. 
They were concerned about federal issues that are dealt with by the 
Parliament of Canada and they were happy to meet with their MP.
<P>
	The concept is simple and sensible. A group of consumers or 
producers ban together to strengthen their bargaining position in 
the buying and selling of products. When members are buying they 
increase their competitive edge and when they sell they lower their 
marketing costs.
<P>
	Co-ops have had their ups and downs, their triumphs and 
failures, as do most business enterprises, but they have been most 
successful when they have stayed out of the world of politics and 
focused on doing business and doing it well. Co-ops are businesses, 
and their job is to do business effectively for their owners, who are 
the co-op members, ordinary people who buy and sell.
<P>
	Today I extend my best wishes to the co-ops and credit unions of 
Canada and the world. This includes their members, their boards of 
directors, their employees and their millions of customers.
<P>

	<B>Mr. Blaikie:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I seek 
unanimous consent of the House to speak on behalf of the NDP 
on this matter.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Is that agreed?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to join with other colleagues in the House who spoke on 
behalf of their parties in congratulating the credit union movement 
and the co-op movement on the occasion of National Co-Operative 
Week and International Credit Union Day.
<P>
	Needless to say, the New Democratic Party has political roots in 
the co-op movement, of which all members of the House will be 
aware. We are very pleased to be able to join in marking this week 
and this day.
<P>
	It is important at a time when the language of competition is 
prevalent to remind ourselves that there is another way of looking 
at the world. It is a way of looking at the world that is rooted in a 
very Canadian way of doing things in the co-op movement.
<P>
	Co-operation is also a good word. Whatever benefits may come 
from competition, and I would be the first to debate some of them, 
we ought to realize that co-operation is another way of doing things 
and one that has been represented very well in the country over the 
decades by the credit union movement and the co-op movement.
<P>
	I call upon members of the House and the government to protect 
this tradition in everything they do. Various things are under attack 
from various places, whether it is the budget for co-op housing, the 
attack on the wheat board or various other things, all of which 
represent manifestations of this co-operative spirit in our political, 
social and economic history.
<P>
	I am pleased to join with other colleagues on behalf of the NDP 
in marking this occasion. I hope we will keep in mind at all times 
the value of this tradition and the value of advancing it in every 
way we can.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I received a note during question period about a 
point of order to be raised by the hon. member for Elk Island. With 
your permission, I would like to finish the routine business and 
before we get into the orders of the day I will hear the hon. 
member's point of order immediately thereafter.

	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point 
of order to assist in the maintenance of proper decorum in the 
House. I refer to a review on September 18 in which the Acting 
Speaker referring back to a ruling in June said: ``We would hope 
and call upon members of both sides of the House to be mindful of 
the ruling of the Speaker in June regarding exhibits, lapel pins, et 
cetera''.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I draw this to your attention and ask you to remind 
members to refrain from wearing pins today. Perhaps we could all 
agree to do this. The members for Winnipeg South, Kent, Algoma, 
Verchères, St. John's West, and Kingston and the Islands are 
wearing exhibits.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I take the hon. member's advice à coeur. I noticed 
some members today are wearing a flower or a pink pin. I remind 
members members that whatever pins  or parliamentary buttons we 
<P>

<B><A NAME="15538"> 15538 </A></B>
<P>
wear, my general rule is I am guided by the House in virtually 
everything I do.
<P>
	As long as it does not cause a disorder and is in keeping with the 
dignity of the House, I use these as general criteria for what we do. 
I encourage all hon. members to look at what they are wearing in 
the House. For the most part much of it is accepted and we take that 
for granted.
<P>
	I will keep vigilant and I hope all hon. members will keep that in 
mind when in the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I remind 
you the Chair has the right to request that certain pins or items not 
be worn. On the night we voted on MP pensions certain members 
of the Reform Party were asked to remove them.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I thank my hon. colleague for reminding me of 
my decision. I always keep those decisions in mind.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> I want to 
come to Your Honour's assistance in this regard. I think your 
decision in June was quite correct, as I am sure all hon. members 
do.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	Wearing pins and ribbons in the House is a longstanding 
tradition as far as I can understand, certainly since I have been here. 
I do not consider that a long time ago by standards of others. With 
great respect, there is a difference between pins and large buttons 
with highly visible insignia constituting a demonstration.
<P>
	Difficulties occur when members hold up papers, documents or 
things that constitute a demonstration in the House or when they 
wear substantial buttons, placards or other symbols that carry with 
them words or letters transmitted by television as a message.
<P>
	Your Honour's ruling last June indicated that buttons which 
carry a message and were visible to the public were contrary to the 
standards of dress in the House. With great respect, I think Your 
Honour drew a distinction between those items and small buttons 
or pins that members wear not readily visible on television and 
which may convey a message but are very small and discreet.
<P>
	The trick to me in dressing for the Chamber is to dress in a 
decorous way that may involve wearing small pins, possibly 
unusual ties from time time. I consider myself guilty sometimes on 
that score. Those are the things members are allowed to do. As long 
as it is tasteful I submit it is right. I think that was Your Honour's 
intention. I know members opposite, in making their points, are 
really supporting Your Honour's view in that regard.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the intervention by the hon. deputy House leader for the 
government. It seems to me he is really saying buttons are okay but 
if something  embarrasses the government it is okay for the 
Speaker to jump on it with both feet.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I thank all members for supporting my decision 
last June and for their comments which I will forever keep at the 
forefront of my mind when making my decisions.
<P>
	Pursuant to Standing Order 33(2), because of the ministerial 
statement, Government Orders will be extended by 10 minutes.

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CANADA-UNITEDSTATESTAXCONVENTIONACT,1984">CANADA-UNITED STATES TAX CONVENTION ACT, 
1984</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (for the Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec) </B>moved that Bill S-9, an act to amend the 
Canada-United States Tax Convention Act, 1984, be read the third 
time and passed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Walker (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to begin 
the third reading debate on Bill S-9.
<P>
	Hon. members will recall that this legislation ratifies the 
recently signed revised protocol to the Canada-United States Tax 
Convention.
<P>
	Tax conventions are routinely modified, and this is essentially 
routine legislation. It has emerged from committee without 
amendments, and with good reason. By improving the operation of 
the Canadian and U.S. tax systems as they apply in tandem, it will 
result in fairer taxation and a better environment for cross-border 
investment and trade.
<P>
	A number of the amendments provided for in the bill are of a 
technical or procedural nature, an arbitration mechanism, 
improved exchange of tax information, and provisions for 
assistance in collecting the taxes of the other country.
<P>
	But there are also some substantive changes that will benefit 
Canadians and enhance the fairness of the two systems for non 
residents.
<P>
<B>(1555 )</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Let me begin with a provision that has been the subject of some 
misunderstanding, the application of U.S. estate taxes to Canadians 
with property there. Our achievement with respect to estate taxes is 
twofold. First, we are ensuring Canadians with property in the 
United States do not get a harsher deal at the hands of the American 
government than do Americans. Second, we are doing what tax 
conventions are all about, eliminating double taxation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15539"> 15539 </A></B>
<P>
	With respect to the first point it should be borne in mind that 
U.S. estate taxes do not kick in for American citizens until the 
value of their estate exceeds $600,000. Under our law enacted in 
1988 the threshold for Canadians with property in the United 
States is only $60,000. In our opinion that is simply not fair. This 
protocol changes that, ensuring that Canadians are entitled to the 
same treatment as our American neighbours.
<P>
	There is the matter of double taxation. For half a century tax 
treaties have been combating the unfairness and financial 
disincentives of double taxation. Typically each jurisdiction 
provides a credit against its own taxes on revenue from the other 
jurisdiction that has already been taxed in that jurisdiction. The 
complicating factor in this case is that while both Canada and the 
United States impose taxes upon death these taxes take two 
different forms. The U.S. applies an estate tax whereas in Canada 
the levy takes the form of an income tax on any appreciation of a 
deceased's property over his or her lifetime.
<P>
	Bill S-9 simply recognizes the situation and addresses the 
anomaly that would otherwise result. Without the proposed change 
combined Canada and U.S. tax on the estate of a Canadian with 
U.S. property could actually exceed the property value. I do not 
think anyone in the House would deny that would be patently unfair 
to the taxpayers.
<P>
	In other words, any suggestion this provision represents a tax 
break for the wealthy rests on the confusion about tax treaties in 
general and this protocol in particular. Wealthy Canadians will 
continue to pay substantial taxes on property owned at death.
<P>
	Another important change is the reduction or elimination of the 
rate of withholding tax that each country will apply to certain types 
of revenue. The rate on interest payments will be reduced to 10 per 
cent from 15 per cent. The rate on direct dividends will go down to 
5 per cent from 10 per cent and the rate on royalties on computer 
software and on patent and technological information will be 
eliminated entirely.
<P>
	These changes bring the rates under the Canada-U.S. convention 
into line with those provided in the OECD model tax convention 
accepted by most of the OECD's 25 countries. More to the point, 
the reduced rates will facilitate trade and investments between our 
two countries.
<P>
	For example, the elimination of the withholding tax on certain 
types of information technology will make it cheaper for Canadian 
companies to access technology from the United States and easier 
for our high tech firms to sell to the United States.
<P>
	I will mention one further beneficial change provided for in this 
protocol. It concerns the treatment of social security payments such 
as old age security and the  Canada pension plan. Under the 
existing convention these payments are not taxable in the source 
country and only half the benefit it taxable in the other country. 
Once the protocol is ratified, however, benefits paid from one 
country will be taxable exclusively in that country.
<P>
	To sum up, double taxation conventions are a vital part of the 
legal infrastructure underpinning trade and investment 
relationships between modern economies. The protocol the bill will 
ratify will result in fair taxation while enhancing the international 
environment for trade and investment.
<P>
	Once again I remind hon. members the bill came out of 
committee unchanged. I suggest we pass it without further delay.

	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have seen 
that the purpose of Bill S-9 is to ratify a protocol to the 
Canada-United States Tax Convention.
<P>
	This convention regulates most tax provisions, as the hon. 
member explained earlier. This means it regulates most tax 
provisions between Canada and the United States. Canada has 
similar conventions with many other countries throughout the 
world. The purpose of these conventions is primarily to avoid 
double taxation. It would be unfair for a Canadian or a Quebecer 
who works a few months in the United States to be taxed first in the 
United States and again in Canada or Quebec when he files his 
income tax return at the end of the year.
<P>
	So considering the extent of our trade relations and the proximity 
of the United States, the Canada-United States Tax Convention 
should be as harmonized as possible, although it is still detailed and 
very complex.
<P>
	The bill before the House today will make it possible for both 
governments to help each other collect taxes from their taxpayers. 
It is often said that one good deed deserves another. The United 
States will help Canada collect taxes owed by Canadian taxpayers 
abroad and in turn, Canada will help the United States collect taxes 
from Americans when they are on foreign soil.
<P>
	Following the free trade agreement with the United States, both 
countries decided to operate even more closely to simplify fiscal 
exchanges between the two countries. This enhanced co-operation 
and harmonization are all part of the trend towards free trade that is 
now sweeping the international community and is forcing 
governments to become more efficient in the way they tax 
companies and citizens of the two countries that are signatories to 
this convention.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois fully supports the trend towards free trade, 
as we have done since the negotiations began and as Quebec did as 
soon as the issue of international free trade was broached, since the 
Province of Quebec, unlike the federal Liberal government at the 
time, had  come out in favour of free trade. Since we support the 
free exchange of goods in the greatest possible harmony and on the 
most equitable terms for Canadians and Americans, we have not 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15540"> 15540 </A></B>
<P>
changed the position we took at the time and today, we want the 
government to know that we will support this bill.
<P>
	We know that without the firm support of Quebec and all major 
players in the province, the free trade agreement with the United 
States would probably never have materialized.
<P>
	As I said earlier, Jean Chrétien's Liberals and even the Province 
of Ontario were strongly opposed to the agreement. Quebec was 
not only in favour of this agreement between the United States and 
Canada but also supported expanding the agreement to include 
Mexico and still supports this grand design for a free trade zone. 
With President Clinton of the United States, we would like to see 
this free trade zone extend from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego.
<P>
	We could draw a parallel between this situation and the situation 
we see now in the political context involving Canada and Quebec. I 
must say that our support for the bill before the House today is 
entirely consistent with the position we would take on agreements 
with the rest of Canada.
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	Millions of dollars are at stake in Bill S-9. Millions and even 
billions of dollars will be at stake tomorrow morning before a 
partnership between Quebec and Canada.
<P>
	For instance, some businesspeople told me that they could not 
decide on the matter because they needed both supporters and 
opponents of the bill to earn a living.
<P>
	Both before and after October 30, we will need clients from both 
sides in order to ensure a climate of harmony, of beneficial 
exchanges between the two parties. If we have no need for both, as 
we are doing in this bill, why would businesspeople want to stop 
dealing with those clients who voted with the other side after 
October 30?
<P>
	Businesspeople and companies who need both Yes and No 
clients before October 30 will continue to need them after October 
30. That is why we say that they can only hope for a partnership 
between both countries, just as the Bloc Quebecois is now 
supporting the partnership advocated by Bill S-9 to harmonize 
taxes, estate tax rates.
<P>
	Yet, with this bill, if Canada refused to sign a protocol with the 
U.S., it would not claim to be weakened, that this would be an 
obvious way to avoid co-operating with the U.S., or that the U.S. 
would be the only one at a disadvantage. Canada understands that it 
is in both parties' interest.
<P>
	In the same way, when people from the no side tell us that 
tomorrow morning, we will have Canada and a separated Quebec, I 
think that what we have here is a  new definition of separation. 
Where I come from, when a couple separates, it is not just one 
party who is separated; both the woman and the man say they are 
separated.
<P>
	After October 30, once Quebec has proclaimed its sovereignty, 
we will not have a separated Quebec and a complete Canada. We 
will have a separated Quebec and a separated Canada. Both parties 
will likely be weakened in their positions if people in Quebec and 
the rest of Canada refuse to conclude harmonious free trade 
agreements between them so that their economic and trade 
positions would be strengthened by new links. There can be 
accommodations. An economic and trade partnership could 
therefore be arranged not only for taxation but also for 
international trade and the free flow of goods and services in 
general, in the interest of this country's two founding nations.
<P>
	The bill does not specify how many millions and billions of 
dollars are at stake in this protocol. We do not know which 
country-Canada or the U.S.-will benefit the most from this tax 
liberalization protocol. We do not know, and the bill does not say. 
Perhaps the party in power has done studies on this? We simply do 
not know.
<P>
	But we nonetheless agree because this is a principle of justice 
that can only benefit Canadians and Quebecers. It would not be 
normal for a Quebecer working in Florida for three or four months 
a year, for example, to pay more taxes for these three or four 
months than he would pay in Quebec if he had worked only in 
Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	Bill S-9 will ensure that Quebec or Canada, as the case may be, 
will be able to claim from the U.S. the share of withholding tax on 
this person's compensation, under conditions that will be similar or 
identical in both countries. Hence the advisability of supporting 
this agreement.
<P>
	Especially if trade and trade opportunities between two countries 
are involved, considering that $1.3 billion is invested every year in 
manufacturing in Ontario cars, trucks and automotive parts for sale 
in Quebec, it would be sheer folly for the Ontario automotive 
industry to miss out on this market. Is Ontario going to refuse to 
come to an agreement with Quebec, claiming that it can no longer 
sell cars and trucks in Quebec because we have decided to achieve 
autonomy? That would be silly.
<P>
	Also, Alberta sells us oil and natural gas worth more than $850 
million. Would our Albertan suppliers decide overnight to stop 
selling us oil and natural gas worth $850 million because we have 
chosen to make our own decisions from now on?
<P>
	For Bay Street, the heart of Toronto's financial district, Quebec 
represents a $2.8 billion market for financial and insurance 
services. How can one believe that these people would not find it in 
their best interest to maintain harmonious business relations with 
us?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15541"> 15541 </A></B>
<P>
	Integration of businesses in Quebec and Canada as well as the 
need to integrate businesses in Quebec and Canada with American 
businesses make it imperative that we maintain harmonious 
relations among ourselves. In turn, maintaining harmonious 
relations forces us to maintain the existing economic union, but 
under new terms, whereby each partner has a say in problem 
solving.
<P>
	Where the shoe pinches right now is that one country is divided, 
with one partner claiming to have all the answers and be in a better 
position to manage the other one's taxes and imposes its will by 
force of numbers. That is why we were never able to find a 
solution: we realize that we are so terribly different.
<P>
	When I was in college, we had a professor who used to say: ``My 
friends, always remember that, when confronted with a problem, 
unless you hold the solution or are part of the solution, you are part 
of the problem''.
<P>
	That is the kind of situation we are in at present in Canada and 
Quebec. Over the past few decades, we have come to realize that 
we were facing certain problems. We told Canada: ``Here is a 
possible solution: If you agree to a redistribution of powers 
between our two peoples, so as to allow greater fairness, greater 
autonomy and greater respect for our two peoples, we could find a 
solution for this great united Canada''.
<P>
	Unfortunately, Quebec, particularly over the last 30 years, has 
constantly clashed with the federal government and the rest of 
Canada, which want to keep control over the province's tax system, 
over its decisions and, in fact, over any major decision that a nation 
has to make regarding its future.
<P>
	We feel that Canada was more part of the problem than part of 
the solution. This is why we initiated a referendum process, a 
democratic process which will allow Quebecers to freely express 
themselves and tell Canadians: ``Ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow 
morning we wish to offer you a new sharing of responsibilities; we 
wish to offer you a new partnership whereby we will decide 
together, on an equal footing, what should be done to ensure the 
best possible future for us''.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	Let us not forget that soon, when Quebec becomes sovereign, the 
rest of Canada will no longer be in as strong a position, relative to 
other foreign countries. It is wrong and it is misleading to suggest 
that the rest of Canada will still be a strong country, while Quebec 
will have become a weak nation. A Canada without Quebec is a 
weaker Canada and a Quebec without Canada also takes on a 
different dimension. This is why we will have to find a way to pool 
our skills and strengths to maintain as best as we can our trade 
relations with other countries.
<P>
	Should this not happen, Canada will not immediately go 
bankrupt, nor will Quebec: our two new countries will have to face 
international conditions different from  those which currently 
prevail, something which might be harder to do. Clearly, it is easier 
to enter into a partnership to solve issues, rather than try to find 
solutions to the same problems separately. This is obvious. But we 
cannot do it right now. We are told: you are already in a 
partnership, why do you want to leave? This is an illusion. We want 
out because we feel that we are not in a true partnership 
arrangement. We are in a minority position in a country where our 
province accounts for about 25 per cent of the population, and 
where half of the taxes paid by Quebecers are controlled by the 
majority.
<P>
	We want more than that for Quebecers. We mentioned 
commercial reasons regarding free trade agreements. We could 
also provide reasons related to the number of jobs. We are not 
talking about the loss of one million jobs. We are not even talking 
about a loss, because we know that our partners of tomorrow will 
not let 250,000 jobs in Ontario disappear. Indeed, there are 250,000 
jobs in that province that are directly related to goods sold in 
Quebec, particularly in the automotive industry.
<P>
	In western Canada, 75,000 jobs are directly related to trade 
between those provinces and Quebec. We buy 50 per cent of the 
beef produced in the west. Tomorrow, Quebecers will not want to 
stop eating western beef, nor will western producers want to stop 
selling us their beef, because 75,000 jobs are at stake. In Atlantic 
Canada, we are talking about 26,000 jobs. Maritime provinces will 
not risk losing 26,000 jobs by eliminating economic and trade 
activity with Quebec.
<P>
	In Canada, a total of 352,000 jobs depend directly on the trade 
between the rest of Canada and Quebec. I imagine that on October 
31, businessmen will start calling their Premiers and ministers to 
tell them: Gentlemen, let us be serious. Let us get down to 
business. Let us get back to basics and sound business practices. 
Keep protecting our markets and our jobs. Sit down and talk to each 
other and stop being so obsessed with your own policies.
<P>
	I did not make up these examples. They exist today. This is the 
reality of trade, whether we like it or not.
<P>
	The same goes for NAFTA. They want to scare us. They say that 
the next day we could no longer enter into an agreement, be part of 
NAFTA. However, tomorrow morning, for instance, we can enter 
into an agreement with the United States on estate taxes.
<P>
	Americans who own securities or property or factories in Quebec 
or who come and work here a few months every year, tomorrow 
morning, these Americans will want to adopt the same bill, either 
with Quebec or a united Canada. Why is this bill before the House 
today? Because we realize that some Americans are penalized by 
differences in legislation, just as some Canadians and Quebecers 
are penalized by the law as we know it today.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15542"> 15542 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	If Canada is prepared to acknowledge that harmonization of the 
legislation of our two countries is mutually beneficial, why should 
we be more reasonable with the Americans than with a sovereign 
Quebec, if it benefits our citizens? Personally, I think that the day 
after a declaration of sovereignty, the United States and the rest of 
Canada will sit down at the same table and will want to negotiate.
<P>
	Quebec's production figures are four times those of Chile, which 
is expected to be the next country to sign NAFTA. Four times. 
Quebec's trade with the United States is eight times what it is with 
Brazil, Argentina and Chile combined. Canada tells us: ``We are 
willing to let Chile become a member tomorrow morning'', but 
they are not prepared to do the same for Quebec. Yet Quebec has 
eight times the trade exchanges with these three countries 
combined.
<P>
	The American president has already stated, as I have already 
said, that he wanted to create a free trade zone from Alaska to 
Tierra del Fuego, which I imagine includes Quebec. He did not say 
``a free trade zone from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego excluding 
Quebec''. That is not what he said. What he did say is that it is to 
everyone's advantage in this great economic space in which we live 
to liberalize trade. Some governors of northeastern states have 
already announced their firm intention to continue trade relations 
with a sovereign Quebec. Laurent Beaudoin is not the only one who 
has made a statement.
<P>
	The government of Canada strongly supports Chile's 
application, as I have said already, and yet Chile has 148 times less 
trade with English Canada than Quebec has with English Canada. 
This is a key point. Another country like Chile would be accepted 
yet Quebec, with 148 times more trade links than Chile, would be 
rejected. That makes absolutely no sense. Nothing but bogey man 
scare tactics. We will not stand for such a thing.
<P>
	During a trade visit to South America, the Prime Minister of 
Canada made a strong and convincing plea in favour of broadening 
NAFTA to include all of the Americas. There is, however, a lack of 
logic in the no side which they are not prepared to acknowledge. 
Again this week, Mr. Martin has made himself the spokesman for 
the no side with respect to NAFTA. Yesterday in a speech to the 
Association professionnelle en développement économique du 
Québec he raised three key points preventing Quebec from joining 
NAFTA quickly.
<P>
	First, membership in the World Trade Association. With respect 
to this point, I must tell Mr. Martin that he is wrong, although I 
cannot tell whether or not his error is deliberate. I do not believe so, 
I think he might be acting in good faith, but it is obvious that he is 
in error. True, it could take several years for a country to conform 
to the World Trade Organization's rules before being  accepted for 
membership. But he must acknowledge at the same time that 
Quebec already meets all of the World Trade Organization's 
membership requirements. WTO rules contain provisions for 
accelerating the process for countries that are already in 
compliance with the rules.
<P>
	Quebec would certainly have access to this fast track, which 
takes about two to three months. In the past five years, the latest 
countries to declare sovereignty or independence were all 
recognized immediately by the WTO. Perhaps one or two countries 
have still not yet been accepted, because they do not meet the basic 
requirements, because they were not part of a free market economy. 
That is why the delay. However, a sovereign Quebec, which already 
satisfies all the conditions, could join the organization 
quickly-within two or three months, and not two or three years, as 
Mr. Martin suggests. Even the Czechs and the Slovaks have had the 
advantage-
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I would ask the member to use the 
minister's title and not his surname.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Laurin:</B> You are right, Mr. Speaker. I should have said ``the 
Minister of Finance''.
<P>
	Even the Czech and the Slovak republics, which have just 
achieved sovereignty, have had the advantage of this accelerated 
process, the process of joining the World Trade Organization, 
despite the fact that their economies were far less developed that 
Quebec's.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance also contended that Quebec will not be 
able to sign NAFTA before achieving sovereignty, which, 
according to him, would take time. However, Quebec retains its 
legal status, so long as it remains a province of Canada, in my 
opinion and according to all the experts. As a province and so long 
as it has not declared its sovereignty, Quebec remains a party to 
NAFTA.
<P>
	When we come to declare our sovereignty, we will have had time 
to talk with people. We will continue to be a party to NAFTA as a 
Canadian province, and the day after sovereignty, negotiations will 
be complete, and we will become another member of NAFTA, this 
time, not as a province, but as a sovereign country. His reasoning 
falls short here again.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance raised a third point. He ignored an 
aspect of the international reality and existing practice, in stating 
that the American Congress was not keen at the prospect of new 
negotiations. The Americans have never behaved this way, because 
state successions promote the continuity and stability of 
international treaties.
<P>
	If the United States ever did ignore this rule, it would be to 
Canada's full advantage to sign a partnership with Quebec, without 
altering the economic reality of Canada and Quebec, but permitting 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15543"> 15543 </A></B>
<P>
continued membership by  Canada and Quebec in NAFTA, as 
provided in article 22.04 of the treaty.
<P>
	It would be advantageous to both Canada and Quebec, because 
we must not forget that, if the United States wants to renegotiate 
with Quebec, it will surely want to renegotiate with Canada, which 
will have seven million consumers fewer than when it signed the 
treaty.
<P>
	A Canada with seven million fewer inhabitants is not the same 
Canada. It is not the same NAFTA partner. And if Canada wants to 
maintain its economic weight in NAFTA, it should sign a 
partnership agreement with Quebec, because it would be to its 
advantage and to Quebec's to do so.
<P>
	According to another of Mr. Martin's arguments, the United 
States will no longer want to allow new members to have a dispute 
settlement board. This is a half baked argument and should be 
quickly rejected because it is based solely on a letter written by a 
candidate for the Republican Party nomination. Just a letter from a 
candidate making this claim.
<P>
	Furthermore, Mr. Martin has conceded that the negotiations with 
Chile include the dispute settlement board. They are currently 
negotiating, they have recognized the existence, the possibility of 
extending the jurisdiction of a dispute settlement board, yet they 
are telling us that the Americans are no longer interested. How can 
the Americans want this mechanism for Chile but not for Canada? 
They are consistent.
<P>
	This makes it difficult to take seriously the finance minister's 
statement that Quebec will lose a million jobs and endanger 90 per 
cent of its exports. Just imagine. This is no laughing matter.
<P>
<B>(1630)</B>
<P>
	This just goes to show once again that ridicule never killed 
anyone, because the Minister of Finance would have died a long 
time ago. We can see how exaggeration often leads to absurdities.
<P>
	We are proud and happy to participate in Canada's development 
by supporting Bill S-9, because it goes in the direction that we have 
always advocated. We do not want to destroy Canada, we want to 
build a country in Quebec, and we want Canada to remain 
prosperous as well. We want to live in renewed harmony, no longer 
from coast to coast but side by side. And the only way to live side 
by side is to support legislation that will make for more 
harmonious relations between the two countries.
<P>
	Witch hunts must be stopped. They must stop telling Quebecers 
that Quebec is too small, that they cannot administer themselves 
without help, that they will not succeed in their endeavour. Quite 
the contrary.
<P>
	Quebec's history has shown that every time Quebecers have 
really taken their destiny into their own hands, their endeavours 
were successful. They succeeded. And when Quebecers will 
decide, as they will on October 30, to become autonomous and to 
make their own decisions, they will be able to collect their own 
taxes and to sign their own treaties. It will enable them to make 
decisions on their own and to invest in projects that better serve the 
interests of Quebecers the $30 billion in tax money they will no 
longer have to pay the federal government.
<P>
	The Laurent Beaudoins who come and tell us that Quebec would 
be too small to meet the needs of large businesses like their should 
be reminded that countries smaller than Quebec have about 20 and 
sometimes as many as 30 companies that are twice, three times and 
even four times as large as Bombardier. Businesses larger than the 
one run by Mr. Beaudoin manage to prosper in countries like 
Switzerland, Norway and Denmark. The strength and vitality of a 
nation is not dependent on its size, but rather on the resourcefulness 
of its people, their commitment and their self-respect.
<P>
	Naturally, Quebecers will want to invest mainly in research and 
development because this creates jobs. The Chinese have known 
this for a long time. An old Chinese proverb says: ``Instead of 
handing out fish that will feed the hungry only for one day, teach 
them to fish''. Teach people to fish and they will be able to feed 
themselves for the rest of their lives.
<P>
	That is what Canada did with Quebec. Only with respect to 
unemployment insurance were we favoured. Quebecers did get 
more in UI benefits than they paid into the plan. That is the fish we 
were fed. Meanwhile, Ontarians were taught to fish, and teaching 
fishing requires research and development grants, which we did not 
get. And they thought we would go for that.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I recognize the hon. parliamentary secretary to the 
Minister of Industry on a point of order.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a 
point of order.
<P>
	I have been listening patiently to the member for the last 33 
minutes. We are all very sensitive when the separatists speak in the 
House these days. We do not want to upset them in any way, shape 
or form. However, Mr. Speaker, at what point in time do you think 
the member will speak about the bill that is on the floor of the 
House?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am sure that the hon. member will not 
be long in coming to the point of his speech.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Laurin:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thought that what I was saying was 
very relevant to Bill S-9, since it addresses partnership with 
another country, the United States. I was therefore attempting to 
demonstrate that the proposals made concerning other bills before 
the House deal with exactly the same problem. There was a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15544"> 15544 </A></B>
<P>
problem  between the United States and Canada. Tax collection was 
not harmonized, estate taxes were not harmonized.
<P>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
	A way has been found by two sovereign countries to discuss and 
to reach agreement on changing our laws in order to harmonize 
them and ensure that Bill C-9 benefits the citizens of both countries 
equally.
<P>
	What I have attempted to demonstrate to this hon. house, with 
examples, is that this would be equally possible in other areas. I am 
well aware that my colleagues opposite do not like to hear anyone 
telling them that it is possible for the partnership to be a success. 
They cannot be hearing that word much these days. They only wish 
to hear it used in connection with other countries, but when Quebec 
becomes a country they will hear it more often. We think that at 
that point they will be prepared to come to the table.
<P>
	At any rate, whether they like to hear us talk about it or not, this 
is a decision for Quebecers alone. And just as Quebecers, via their 
elected representatives here in the House today, agree to support 
Bill S-9, tomorrow morning Quebecers will also agree to support 
their representatives in the Quebec government and ask them to 
offer a partnership that is respectful of our neighbours in the rest of 
Canada, a partnership that will be advantageous to both parties, a 
partnership that will become the sole solution to our common 
problems.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It is my duty to inform the House that the 
question to be raised tonight at the time of adjournment is as 
follows: the hon. member for Davenport-Climate change.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in two 
years in the House I have never seen a bill that all three parties 
support take so long to get through. Here we are debating the bill 
when all parties agree to it.
<P>
	There are a couple of things I would like to say at third reading 
which I believe are worth clearing up. As everyone in the House 
has been informed, and for those taxpayers who have been 
watching the debate and seeing how a Senate bill gets through the 
House of Commons, there are some items in here that have caused 
some confusion.
<P>
	The NDP member for Kamloops and the Liberal member for 
Gander-Grand Falls have raised some issues on specific items in 
the bill that have now confused the Canadian public. Now we have 
to participate in explaining why we support the bill or why some 
members are against it. There are only one or two people who are 
against it and it seems a shame that we have to talk about it.
<P>
	The bill was done through negotiators on behalf of both 
countries. It was signed on August 31, 1994, so it is already a done 
deal. What we are doing is giving birth to  it, endorsing it or 
whatever through the House of Commons.
<P>
	As the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance 
indicated, it eliminates double taxation, creates a level playing 
field, reduces the withholding taxes on interest and dividends, 
royalties and technologies, et cetera. It keeps up with the global 
need to remain and to become competitive. It is for those sound 
fiscal and economic reasons that the Reform Party supports the bill.
<P>
	The bill has a lot of upside to it and will generate a lot of 
investment opportunities for Canadians in the United States and 
vice versa with the amount of investment Americans make in 
Canada. It is a reciprocity agreement. Whatever we have negotiated 
is a two-way street; what happens in the United States can also 
happen up here. I remind everyone that in a reciprocity agreement 
sometimes we have to give to get and sometimes we get to give. It 
works both ways.
<P>
	I would like to try to clear up some of the confusion on behalf of 
the member for Kamloops. My office received a lot of phone calls 
about the bill based on the tirade over the treatment of universities 
in the United States and Canadians being allowed to make 
charitable donations to American universities. If they send their 
children to those schools, it is an allowable deduction. In typical 
NDP fashion it is a tax for the so-called rich and the rich should not 
be able to do anything except look after those people who the NDP 
deem need to be looked after, rather than having a system that is 
fair for all at both ends of the scale.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	Based on the fact that the member for Kamloops has raised the 
issue and is getting a bit of play out of it in B.C., I would like to 
answer some of the questions people have been calling our offices 
about. I will also address the specifics of the bill. Maybe some of 
the confusion can be cleared up.
<P>
	I must admit I am a bit frustrated personally that we in the House 
of Commons have to enter into a debate over something we were 
not a part of because. It was in the Senate where all the specifics, 
details and all the justifications-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Do you like taking your 
direction from the Senate?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> No, it is just that the details were brought out in the 
Senate. The negotiations were done by representatives of both 
countries. They were not done by senators from both countries, but 
that is where it was approved.
<P>
	My point is that it is frustrating that we now have to dig in and 
get all the details of a done deal. Nevertheless, I will make my best 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15545"> 15545 </A></B>
<P>
stab at it and if there are some areas  where I am a bit off the mark 
hopefully I will not be too far off. I will say so if I am not clear.
<P>
	One question we are getting from B.C. constituents is: Why do 
we favour reductions in the rate of withholding tax on interest and 
dividends? I covered that in my opening remarks. This works both 
ways and will attract investment in Canada as well as investment in 
the United States. It is seen as another step in the reduction of 
barriers as we shift to a global marketplace. All OECD member 
countries, including Canada, the 25 member states have agreed to 
try to get their tax rates in line with one another to facilitate this.
<P>
	It may so happen at this time because of the immediate nature of 
the deal being put into effect that the flow of capital into Canada 
may be reduced. That could be a temporary measure. In the years to 
come we could get it back on bigger and better deals we make with 
the United States.
<P>
	The second question was: How can we endorse a bill that gives 
individuals with children in U.S. schools the ability to write off a 
portion of their expenses? While there are those who argue that we 
should not be subsidizing those who are well enough off to go to 
schools in the U.S., this benefit works both ways. Americans are 
allowed to make donations to Canadian universities as well. It is 
not only the privileged Americans or Canadians who are crossing 
the borders in pursuit of an education.
<P>
	As members know, with legislation like this the good must be 
weighed with the bad. The potential benefits from freer flowing 
commerce between Canada and the U.S. far exceed the potential 
cost of a few individuals who send their children to American 
schools.
<P>
	This is a reciprocity treaty and you win some and you lose some. 
If the principle of encouraging donations both ways was brought up 
in the House today as a separate measure from the principle of 
making a deal with the United States and encouraging a two-way 
deal, I would suggest that the principle of encouraging donations 
both ways would probably be supported in the House by the 
majority of members.
<P>
	The third question which arose thanks to the member for 
Kamloops was: Are American contributions to Canadian charities 
given the same treatment? Yes, this is a treaty that ensures that 
Canadians and Americans are treated the same. It is a reciprocity 
treaty.
<P>
	The fourth question was: What about the estate tax provision? Is 
that not just a tax break for the rich? No, it is not a tax break just for 
the rich. It tries to rectify an inequity in the current system.
<P>
	In Canada we do not have an estate tax. The United States did 
and Americans did not have to pay any estate taxes unless there 
was an amount over $600,000. Canadians had to pay on amounts 
over $60,000. This reintroduces some equity into the system and 
now if a  Canadian with property in the United States died and left 
an estate, it would only be taxed if the value is in excess of 
$600,000. The bill levels the playing field on this issue. It signifies 
the intent of the bill as trying to make sure Canadians are treated 
the same in Canada as they are in the United States.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	If owning property in the United States is only the purview of the 
rich, then so be it. However, I do not believe that everyone who 
owns property in the States all along the eastern seaboard happens 
to be rich. I happen to know the NDP made a lot of mileage on 
taxing the rich until suddenly everybody in Canada realized that 
rich meant anybody making over $40,000 and they were hit as well. 
That took care of the NDP philosophy of taxing the rich, because 
they are not rich.
<P>
	Regarding this attack on the rich by the NDP, even Abraham 
Lincoln addressed that in his day. He said that we cannot make the 
poor wealthy by making the wealthy poor. If we want to protect the 
disadvantaged-we need to protect the disadvantaged-if we care 
about those people who truly need the help then we make our laws 
and our polices and go about doing that. At the same time there are 
people throughout the economic scale who make $50,000 or more 
who also deserve to have any inequities in the system addressed. 
They deserve to be looked after as well.
<P>
	For instance, 62 per cent of those who made up to $25,000 
generated 27 per cent of total income, while their share of the total 
tax paid in 1991 was 11 per cent. My source for this is the 
Department of Finance. There were 19 million tax filers in 1991 
and 13.7 million paid income tax and 5.3 million were not taxable.
<P>
	I want to discuss the breakdown of how much tax was paid by the 
various groups. People who earned $25,000 to $50,000 represented 
28 per cent of the tax filers and their share of both total income and 
total tax was 40 per cent. Ninety per cent of the tax filers in 1991 
made $50,000 or less and they paid 51 per cent of the income taxes 
that year. People in the $50,000 to $100,000 category represented 9 
per cent of the tax filers, with a share of 23 per cent of the income. 
They paid 31 per cent of the total tax. People who made over 
$100,000 were 1 per cent of tax filers, with 10 per cent of income 
and paying 18 per cent of the total tax. This means that 10 per cent 
of the tax filers in 1991 paid a total of 49 per cent of the taxes.
<P>
	I point this out to the member for Kamloops so he can realize 
that the wealthy people in this country, the top 10 per cent, pay 
their darn share of the taxes. They pay darn well, they pay high, and 
they pay a lot, like 49 per cent of the total tax take. This business 
about going after the rich all the time is not going to work and it 
does not hold water with me, because they contribute a lot to the 
economy and keep the economy going. Every now and then 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15546"> 15546 </A></B>
<P>
someone should speak out on their behalf as well.  They are 
suddenly becoming a small and select group as well in this country.
<P>
	This brings me to another issue I would like to talk about from 
this Bill S-9, which is directly related to the concerns of the Liberal 
member for Gander-Grand Falls, who very eloquently raised his 
objections to this bill at the Standing Committee on Finance. As I 
understand, having done a little more homework, this member has 
been watching this issue and this bill for a very long time. I found 
out that when in opposition he basically criticized the Conservative 
government for moving in this direction and moving toward this 
kind of a deal. In fact he questioned the government of the day on 
this quite a bit.
<P>
	The history of Bill S-9 goes back prior to us getting it on our 
desks and saying we should pass the bill. The bill goes back to the 
Mulroney government. The member for Gander-Grand Falls had 
the job and unique duty to critique this item, as he did. Based on 
that and based on being in opposition to it at that time, he feels 
obligated to continue that opposition to it at this time.
<P>
	I bring this point out to show there is at least one Liberal who 
sticks to his Liberal convictions. There is one Liberal who keeps 
his promise. There is one Liberal who does not break the promises 
in the red book.
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> He did not vote against this though.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> I believe when it comes to the vote he will have to be 
very careful how he handles himself. Perhaps he might have a cold 
or something. We certainly would not want the member to be in 
trouble with his party, since that whip is cracking pretty hard over 
there, as evidenced by the last sitting.
<P>
	Some of the issues the member for Gander-Grand Falls pointed 
out are based on his personal crusade against the bill. He has taken 
a lot of effort and looked into it. He does believe that because it 
means less revenue for Canada it is wrong. He does believe it is a 
tax system for the rich. He does point out that the Reform Party and 
the Bloc Quebecois support it, as we do. Yet he never says openly, 
aggressively, that the Liberal government now supports it as well.
<P>
	Perhaps when he has his intervention on the bill, because I am 
sure he wants to speak to it and address it as well, he would maybe 
tell us on this side of the House why it is that when they were in 
opposition and the Prime Minister and his group were over here 
this member was attacking the bill at the time, with their blessing 
obviously, with the finance minister's encouragement, with the 
leader of the party's encouragement. Why when they are on the 
other side of the House all of a sudden did they flip? Do they 
become puppets of the bureaucracy? Do they become puppets of 
the bureaucrats? Do they have to say yes to what those people tell 
them to do? When they were over here they  criticized it. They are 
over there and now they are endorsing it.
<P>
	It now takes one lone voice, one lonely voice in that huge pack of 
177 members over there to remind them that when they were over 
here they were not for this thing, they were not for the bill. They 
did not want to do reciprocity with the States like this. They were 
against stuff like that. They were against NAFTA. They were 
against all these things. Now they are for all this.
<P>
	I do not understand. I do not mean to be taking the member for 
Gander-Grand Falls to task. In a way I am giving him a 
compliment, but in another way-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> You are dangerous. You 
are not fooling anybody.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> I also point out that there are inconsistencies here. I 
will compliment the member for being consistent. However I will 
criticize his party for being inconsistent.
<P>
	The rest of the items on the bill I have covered. We do support it. 
I did have some time to talk about it, and I did feel it was important 
that as the representative for our party on the bill and as a supporter 
of the bill for our party I should set some of the record straight. I 
have to sort of pre-empt the member for Gander-Grand Falls, 
because I am sure he is going to say a few other words.
<P>
	The intent of the bill and what it does accomplish is what the 
future of the country holds. We have to negotiate with other 
countries. We have to be creating a level playing field. We have to 
have taxation levels that are similar. We have to have reciprocity 
agreements that make the deals both ways. As the flow of capital 
and human resources goes back and forth, all around the world, as 
we push buttons on a computer and transfer large sums of money, 
just as an entry item on a ledger sheet, we have to be able to be 
competitive. First and foremost, that is what Bill S-9 does, it keeps 
us competitive. It is only the small minded, the narrow minded 
people in the House who want to protect themselves who would 
argue that this is not a fair and good reciprocity agreement.
<P>
	There is nothing for me to add to this. I know there was a lot of 
confusion. I hope I have cleared up some of that confusion, why 
our party supports it. I hope I have addressed those constituents of 
the member for Kamloops. Also I hope I have put to rest this 
business about picking on the rich all the time, because the rich do 
pay their fair share. I do not believe this is a bill that satisfies the 
rich, because I believe people who make between $50,000 and 
$100,000 and own property down in the States are not really 
wealthy in this day and age, to make $60,000 or $70,000. In that 
case, with $64,000, plus the perks we get, everybody in this place 
would be rich. I would say that a lot of people in the House would 
not say they are rich.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15547"> 15547 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	That is another debate. That is another issue. I bring it up only 
because of the confusion introduced into the bill by the member for 
Kamloops and by the member for Gander-Grand Falls. It is 
worthy of support. The sooner we get it over with, the sooner we 
can get back to real issues and real bills and get on with our 
economic lives.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (St. Paul's, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is an 
unusual day in the House when all parties support a bill. The 
member for Calgary Centre pointed that out at the beginning and 
then spoke for almost 16 minutes even though he felt it was a waste 
of time to talk about the bill, since we all agreed. What is more 
interesting is that he spent most of that time complimenting a 
member for the governing party, the member for Gander-Grand 
Falls. It is indeed an unusual day in the House.
<P>
	I also want to speak to Bill S-9 and some of the concerns raised 
with respect to the bill, an act to amend the Canada-U.S. Tax 
Convention Act.
<P>
	First I want to say to my colleagues that there is nothing sinister 
in the bill and no surprises for those who follow these issues. This 
was pointed out earlier. This matter was the subject of publicity 
earlier. There was a press release in April 1994 that announced that 
the protocol had been signed. A copy of the protocol was available. 
The fact that negotiations were taking place has been known for 
several years. It has certainly been known among people who 
practise taxation law and those who are concerned about cross 
border investment. There are no surprises and nothing particularly 
sinister. The bill follows the OECD model tax convention treaty. 
Provisions of that tax convention model have been followed by as 
many as 25 countries.
<P>
	There has been some suggestion that the bill amounts to a huge 
tax cut for corporations. I want to speak to that misconception. 
What the bill really does is facilitate cross border investment. As 
has been said by others, tax conventions are all about reciprocity. 
What we are gaining through this tax convention and other tax 
conventions is enhanced investment in our country. We have to 
reciprocate for countries that are interested in that kind of 
relationship with us.
<P>
	What we have here in the changes in withholding tax is a great 
incentive for Canadians to invest in the United States and likewise 
for Americans to invest in this country. Certainly at a time when we 
are concerned about jobs and growth, that is a very good outcome 
and a worthwhile goal.
<P>
	There has been talk, again another confusion, about impact on 
the treasury, cost to Canadians. We should also focus on offsetting 
investment in tax revenues that come to Canada from that 
investment. That is what this treaty will accomplish.
<P>
	There has also been comment about estate taxes and some sort of 
opportunity that is being provided to the  rich of this country. What 
is being addressed in the estate tax provisions of the convention is 
the matter of fair treatment. Canadians will be out from under the 
burden of double taxation and unfair treatment that has existed to 
date in the United States for those who have owned property there. 
That will be cleared up.
<P>
	There has also been much discussion about the provisions of the 
convention dealing with the tax treatment of contributions to 
universities outside Canada. Some have been so confused as to 
think that this is something that has appeared in our law and is a 
function of this convention suddenly. It has been a matter of 
legislation in this country since the 1960s and has been in this 
convention since the 1980s. What is the result? Certainly the result 
is that Canadians may make contributions to U.S. universities, but I 
want to come back to the reciprocity issue and make the following 
point.
<P>
	Looking into my own former university, McGill, we discover 
that over the years countless Americans have attended McGill 
University. Approximately 1,000 are there right now if we add full 
time and part time students together.
<P>
<B>(1700 )</B>
<P>
	Here is what is most interesting of all. Let us look at the amount 
of contributions from McGill graduates in the U.S. and Americans 
to McGill University over the last five years. In 1990, $2,452,000. 
In 1991, over $3.7 million. In 1992, almost $2 million. These are 
U.S. figures. In 1993, $3 million Canadian. In 1994, the 
astronomical amount of $7 million Canadian. In 1995 it is 
$3,440,000 to date from American contributors to a great Canadian 
university. Those who question the wisdom of encouraging 
Canadians to make contributions to U.S. schools should ask 
themselves what the impact might be on contributions to Canadian 
schools.
<P>
	I am pleased to support the bill and pleased that it has the support 
of all parties of the House. It is a sensible convention. It is updated 
from time to time, as it has been most recently by these changes. I 
look forward to having it passed by the House.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I would like to add a word on another point. The hon. member 
for Joliette used the debate on Bill S-9 to discuss the effects of 
separation. In response, I would like to say something very clearly.
<P>
	First, if Quebec needs such a convention, it already has one as a 
province of Canada. Second, it seems to me that the hon. member 
does not have a strong grasp of international law, but this is always 
the way with the separatists. When they get up in the morning, they 
say: I want something, therefore I shall have it. But the world does 
not work this way, and he knows it.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15548"> 15548 </A></B>
<P>
	International law is well written and very clear: if Quebec 
separates from Canada, Canada will remain the contracting state, 
not Quebec.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. George S. Baker (Gander-Grand Falls, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in response to the questions raised by the Reform Party 
and by the Bloc yesterday, the accountability of the Government of 
Canada to the people of Canada is made here in the House of 
Commons by the official opposition.
<P>
	There are only two functions which Parliament serves: One is a 
legislative function and the other is an accountability function. The 
actions of the executive of government are held accountable to the 
people through Parliament. If the official opposition party does not 
do its job, then Parliament is not doing its job.
<P>
	We have before us today a bill which came in through the back 
door. It was not the servant's entrance because the back door was 
the Senate. It came in through the Senate, but it involves an 
incredibly large expenditure of money in the final analysis. It is a 
large expenditure not in direct allocation, but in what the auditors 
general call tax expenditures.
<P>
	The bill also includes provisions which Bloc members keep 
repeating as being wonderful. It cuts dividends by 50 per cent to 
American corporations which have subsidiaries in Canada. It cuts 
by one-third the taxation on interest on the money that flows back 
across to the United States. It eliminates every single royalty tax in 
this country which is held by Americans, except for trademarks. 
Trademarks are being bifurcated. It is a very difficult accounting 
procedure, but that is what is happening under the bill. There are 
those three big tax cuts.
<P>
<B>(1705 )</B>
<P>
	I just cannot understand it. I do not believe there is one 
constituent of the official opposition-I keep referring to it as the 
official opposition because it is supposed to be the group that 
controls question period and debate in this Chamber. That is why 
we have a group of MPs like myself and others on the government 
side who are wondering where the accountability and debate is 
here.
<P>
	What I am referring to is this philosophy of the official 
opposition that working Canadians should compensate people who 
have property worth over $600,000 in the United States of 
America. With the passage of the bill, the estate tax in the United 
States only applies to property worth over $600,000.
<P>
	The Bloc is saying it is going to end double taxation. It is 
demanding this on behalf of Quebec. How? It says that the 
Canadian government taxes in a different way. Yes, it does tax 
differently on property over $600,000 because there is no double 
taxation below $600,000. The estate  tax in the United States will 
not kick in until there is property over $600,000 in the United 
States. The Bloc tells us it wants to end double taxation for people 
who pay a tax on things that are valued at over $600,000 in the 
United States of America.
<P>
	The estate tax in the United States of America has been in 
existence since the turn of the century. It was brought in at the same 
time it was brought into Canada when income tax came in. Income 
tax was demanded by the people of western Canada in 1916 when 
they marched with their signs. They demanded that income tax be 
brought in. Their cry was the same cry as that of the people in the 
United States of America when they wanted income tax brought in 
at the turn of the century, about 1897, because they said the rich 
were not paying their fair share of taxes.
<P>
	The governments of the day responded by bringing in taxes on 
wealth of varying amounts. Estate taxes came in. All of a sudden, 
here we are in 1995 and we are going to try to end double taxation 
which has been there since 1904. Worse than that, we are going to 
try to end double taxation for people who have property in the 
United States worth over $600,000. I just do not understand the 
Bloc's position on this as the official opposition in the Canadian 
Parliament because that is where the objection should come from.
<P>
	Let me repeat this again. There is no double taxation after the 
passage of this bill unless one has property of over $600,000 in the 
United States. The double taxation is not really double taxation 
because we do not have an estate tax. Our death tax is on income. 
The estate tax is on property. Everybody in this Chamber knows 
that.
<P>
	In the United States they take the value of one's automobile, 
house and everything else, the paintings on the wall and the dishes, 
the stocks and bonds, everything. In Canada we exempt the primary 
residence and the things one uses. Canada does not tax the car in 
the driveway; we only tax what the estate of the dead person says 
was actually an increase in value of the property that is not exempt. 
It is two completely different things, so how can we have 
reciprocity when we do not have the same thing in effect in both the 
nations?
<P>
<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
	When the bill was introduced into the United States Senate the 
Government of the United States said: ``Each country agrees to 
allow an appropriate credit for the death taxes imposed in the other 
country''. It is convenient for the United States because it takes 
about three years to settle an estate owned by a Canadian in the 
United States. A long time. You normally do not want to pay estate 
taxes in the United States. This will sort of hurry it up, will it not?
<P>
	If we are now going to give a tax credit, where does that tax 
credit come from? It comes from the pockets of working 
Canadians. It comes from the person working on  a construction 
job. It 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15549"> 15549 </A></B>
<P>
comes from the person who works in a store. It comes from the 
person making the beds in the hotels. It comes from every working 
Canadian. Until the official opposition in Parliament understands 
that the government must be held accountable on tax expenditures 
we will never get the finances of this country under control.
<P>
	Apart from that, the other major thing in this bill is that it 
reduces by 50 per cent the taxes paid by American multinationals 
operating in Canada on their profits. Every single member of this 
House knows that we have a special division in Revenue Canada 
called the transfer pricing division. Every member in this Chamber 
knows there are nine or 10 people there and there are another 17 or 
18 in the field looking at all these multinationals. Everyone knows 
that over 70 per cent of them do not pay any tax at all. Transfer 
pricing is the major problem but there are other problems as well.
<P>
	You charge $50 for a clothespin when you pass it from your 
parent company to your subsidiary. The trick is that if you have a 
company working in Canada at rates which are higher than in the 
United States, you want to make sure there is no profit showing on 
the books, so you bring down the profits by transfer pricing.
<P>
	The only place we know they can pay taxes on their profits and 
operations in Canada is at the border. What is the Senate doing in 
this bill? The Senate is reducing that to half. How much money is 
that? Let me quote the chief of corporate and international tax of 
the finance department before the Senate standing committee April 
25, 1995. He was asked the question: Why not reduce it to zero? 
Instead of 10 per cent why not bring it down to zero? His answer is 
on page 19 of the transcript: ``The principal reason is money''. Do 
not forget we are reducing it by half down to five. He said: ``I have 
not looked recently but I believe that our annual withholding tax 
take is approximately $1.5 billion. Currently it would be difficult to 
sustain completely walking away from that''. I repeat, 1.5 billion 
bucks.
<P>
	Do you know, Mr. Speaker, that the agreement we are passing 
here today not only reduces the withholding tax by 50 per cent but 
it also commits us in writing that in three years time we will go 
back to Washington and negotiate it down?
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Baker:</B> Yes, in this agreement, down to zero. That is only 
one of the tax cuts in this agreement.
<P>
	Let me get to the whole purpose. What is behind this? What is 
behind this kind of rush? The <I>International Business and Finance 
Daily</I> is printing news stories. I will read a portion. I can table it for 
hon. members to see. It is marked: ``Washington, September 12, 
1995''.
<P>
<B>(1715)</B>
<P>
	They are interested in getting the bill passed before the end of 
the month. Why? This is why. ``The protocol to the tax treaty 
between the United States and Canada is expected to be ratified by 
the Canadian Parliament before the end of October''. It then goes 
on to talk about the other protocols that were signed and quoted a 
Canadian official: ``We will try as quickly as we can for the second 
reading, and the third reading will take place in the Canadian 
House of Commons''. That is nice to know.
<P>
	He then goes on to say: ``Although the leading party, the Bloc, 
has the power to hold up the vote'', he does not expect that it will. 
Then he goes on to say that one of the key features of the protocol is 
this: ``The proposed treaty will be effective with respect to amounts 
paid or credited on or after the first day of the second month after 
the protocol enters into force''. Just imagine. Let me repeat that: 
``the first day of the second month that the protocol'' is finished in 
this Chamber. This is October.
<P>
	The next sentence is key. ``Companies in the United States are 
looking to apply the rate to their 1995 income tax. However, if the 
third reading vote is delayed in the House of Commons they may 
have to pay the higher rate on dividends''.
<P>
	The largest multinationals in the world will be getting an 
enormous tax decrease. However, if this bill does not pass third 
reading before the end of October, they will not be able to claim 
their reduction of 3 per cent because the protocol lowers the 
existing treaty's 10 per cent tax rate to 7 per cent in 1995, 6 per cent 
in 1996 and 5 per cent in 1997. Does anyone want to save the 
Government of Canada a few hundred million dollars? Pass this 
bill the first week in November.
<P>
	Those are just a few of the reasons why I am opposed to the bill. 
The big one is this. Every single business organization in the 
United States that appeared before the Congress of the United 
States made one point clear. Of the seven treaties that were being 
passed in the U.S. Senate, only the Canadian treaty was truly a 
one-sided affair with the majority of the benefits going to the 
United States.
<P>
	Let me quote from probably the biggest business organization, 
the National Foreign Trade Council, Inc., 1914 representing 500 
U.S. multinationals, Mr. Robert H. Green, vice-president, tax 
policy. ``Turning to the treaties before you''-this is the 
testimony-``the one that clearly is of the greatest interest to the 
largest number of companies in my membership is the U.S.-Canada 
protocol. The investment that flows between the two countries is 
substantial and favours the United States. We have substantially 
more investment there than they do here. The dividend withholding 
rates which are phased into 5 per cent over three years are of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15550"> 15550 </A></B>
<P>
tremendous benefit to the United States because of the  
reduced''-this, that and the other thing. He goes on to say: ``Here 
are all the cuts''.
<P>
	This is from the administration of the United States. Mr. 
Samuels, who appeared before the committee, stated at page 42: 
``If you look at the treaties that are before the committee, with the 
exception of Canada, we think that it is probably about a zero, that 
it is probably a wash as far as benefits are concerned. With respect 
to Canada, when you look at the relative flows, there is a greater 
flow of income into the United States from Canada than there is 
going from the United States to Canada and we will benefit''.
<P>
	Then comes an interesting quote. This is from the assistant 
secretary for tax policy of the United States. He says that in one of 
these cuts it is only a one-way street because according to him and 
the U.S. treasury: ``It will have a lesser effect on U.S. outgoing 
flows of interest to Canada because much of the flow is already 
exempt from U.S. tax under the portfolio interest provisions of the 
code''.
<P>
<B>(1720 )</B>
<P>
	What do we have here? We have an agreement that was 
negotiated in 1988 by the Mulroney administration. The Reform 
Party is absolutely correct. Agreements are signed between 
governments sometimes and they must be honoured. However, that 
is no reason to stand up in this Chamber and support them when 
you are taking money out of the pockets of ordinary Canadians who 
are being laid off by the government. We are cutting back programs 
and here we are giving what is in effect a tax break to the very rich 
in this country.
<P>
	Much more could be said about this agreement. It is very 
complex but it all boils down to three enormous tax cuts. It boils 
down to giving a tax credit to somebody who has property worth 
over $600,000 in the United States. Those poor people, my heart 
goes out to them. If you have property in the United States worth 
more than $600,000 you are subjected to the estate tax. If you are 
under that you are not subjected to it. These political parties in the 
opposition, the Bloc that is supposed to be doing its job, are saying: 
``Atta boy, this is the best thing that ever happened''.
<P>
	We all respect the function of the House of Commons. In order 
for it to function properly that accountability must be there in the 
opposition parties. That is why I take such strong exception to the 
procedure and the content of the legislation.
<P>
	This is the House of Commons. This is the house of commoners. 
That is where that phrase comes from. This is not the house of 
millionaires or the house of multimillionaires. This is the House of 
Commons. In these difficult times we should not be increasing tax 
cuts, tax expenditures for wealthy people and big American 
corporations. If we keep doing this, Canadian corporations will not 
be able to compete. Where is the  cut for the Canadian corporations 
here? Where is it? It is absent.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> It's a reciprocal agreement.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Baker:</B> He says that it is a reciprocal agreement. 
Reciprocal? This is a one-way agreement. Did he not listen to what 
I just read? Does he not know what the estate tax is compared with 
the capital gains in Canada? You cannot have a reciprocal 
agreement if it is not equal on both sides. You can have it, but why 
would you want to do it?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I want to ask the member opposite to expand on one 
aspect that is very important and of which Canadians should be 
much more aware. By and large Canada is a branch plant operation 
of the United States. The vast majority of the industries in Canada 
are branch plant operations of the United States. The real profit is 
derived by American corporations in transfer pricing where the 
American parent charges the American marketing arm a price and 
the Canadian marketing arm a substantially higher price. 
Therefore, there are very few profits relative to the amount of 
business activity generated in Canada, thus very limited corporate 
profit taxes paid in Canada.
<P>
	Given the fact we know this to be the case, why are there just 12 
auditors involved in this, as evidenced by his speaking notes? The 
member opposite thinks we should be doing something. We are 
stuck with this legislation as it is a treaty that we have already 
signed. It is going through. Should we not put more emphasis into 
that part of the audit?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Baker:</B> Mr. Speaker, I was not actually speaking from notes, 
I was speaking from my head on those subjects. Let me tell the hon. 
member this. In the United States of America a term called 
formulary apportionment is used rather than the arm's length 
procedures of transfer pricing.
<P>
<B>(1725 )</B>
<P>
	The present system is this. The Canadian government discovered 
in the auditing branch one case where a company was selling paper 
clips for $200 to a Canadian subsidiary to bring down the Canadian 
subsidiary's profits and then from the Canadian subsidiary was 
buying tires back for 6 cents each that were made in Canada to 
bring down the Canadian profits.
<P>
	The Canadian government looked at that and at all the different 
systems in effect throughout the world. In the United States there is 
a system called formulary apportionment promoted by the state of 
California. Most states in the United States have this. They did it 
with foreign multinationals but they even did it with domestic tax. 
They made a judgment on the portion of the company's operations 
in each state.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15551"> 15551 </A></B>
<P>
	In other words California said, we are going to make a judgment 
here. We are going to decide after looking at the entire 
operations-the company would have to open its books-how 
much the operations are paying in each one of the states. That led 
to double taxation.
<P>
	The international multinational companies will not go to 
California because of that. California had to drop it but it is still a 
principle that is being promoted.
<P>
	We should have more investigators in Canada. The hon. member 
and I agree on that. A lot of money is tied up here. There is $10, 
$20 billion at stake. However, what has been done in Canada, 
which is probably the best system, is sign an agreement.
<P>
	The investigators go after each one of the multinationals and 
sign a pre-agreement, an agreement in advance. It is a secret 
agreement, because one cannot go around telling everybody what 
one's operations are.
<P>
	An agreement is made in advance. That has cut down on a lot of 
the violations in Canada. That is the reason why the office is so 
small. It is a very effective and well run office.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, since the hon. 
member for Gander-Grands Falls has decided to turn himself into 
a member of the opposition, I would be delighted to invite him to 
cross the floor and join us. We have several other causes to defend 
against his party. We would be delighted to welcome you, Sir.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Baker:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be very brief. No thanks.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I understand that the debating skills of the hon. 
member for Gander-Grand Falls are legendary in the House. They 
go back to his days in opposition.
<P>
	We really had not experienced them until the debate on Bill S-9. 
Now we see his passion and his fervour. I wonder if the member 
would assure the House that he will back up this passion and 
fervour with deeds. Does he intend to vote against the government 
and against Bill S-9 when it comes forward for a third reading 
vote?
<P>
	In other words, will he be in the House and will he vote against 
Bill S-9?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Baker:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member puts forward an 
interesting proposition. I think my friend behind me and to my left 
answered quite appropriately one day when he said: ``If you vote 
against the government on a finance bill, it is a vote of no 
confidence in the government''.
<P>
	The assumption is made under our rules, that if one has no 
confidence in the government then that person must have 
confidence in one of the opposition parties.  Unfortunately with the 
positions taken by the opposition parties, I have less confidence in 
them than I have in the present Government of Canada.
<P>
<B>(1730 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I too wish 
to congratulate the hon. member for Gander-Grand Falls on the 
eloquence of his speech. He is truly a fantastic speaker. He is 
interesting and fun to listen to.
<P>
	The hon. member has spoken against the bill presented by his 
party. I congratulate him for that, for coming out and expressing his 
thoughts on the bill even though they are different from what his 
party endorses.
<P>
	Will he be in the House to vote against the bill at third reading? 
Why did the hon. member not vote against the bill at second 
reading? The hon. member was here before the vote and chose not 
to be here during the vote.
<P>
	How can he tolerate being a member of a party which is so 
anti-democratic that it will not let its own members vote the wishes 
of their constituents? The hon. member obviously believes he is 
representing the wishes of his constituents on this issue.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Baker:</B> Mr. Speaker, I respect the hon. member's question. 
It is very interesting.
<P>
	The hon. member will notice that in the last couple of days I 
have had a rather bad back. It is difficult sometimes to stand and to 
be seated. Hopefully my back will improve as the days go on.
<P>
	However, I can tell the hon. member what I intend to do 
tomorrow. The only flight I can get to Newfoundland is early 
tomorrow morning and so I may have to miss the vote.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is the House ready for the question?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Question.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the

	The House resumed from June 20 consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-275, an act respecting the protection and rehabilitation 
of endangered and threatened species, be read the second time and 
referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am happy to speak on Bill C-275.
<P>
	The fundamental goal of any endangered species legislation 
must be to ensure-
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
As a member of the government I should have the privilege of 
speaking first on this motion.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member will appreciate that 
there is no automatic order to the government side's speaking on a 
private member's bill. I understand that a government member 
spoke last and therefore it is now the Reform Party's turn.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I was saying, the fundamental 
goal of any endangered species legislation must be to ensure that 
no further native species go extinct and that already endangered 
species recover to healthy and self-sustaining levels. To do this we 
need to use the most effective, efficient and fair methods possible.
<P>
	The federal government has jurisdiction over the management 
and preservation of wildlife on federal lands. Likewise, the 
provincial governments have jurisdiction over the management and 
preservation on all non-federal lands.
<P>
	I understand that currently only four provinces have endangered 
species legislation: Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec and New 
Brunswick.
<P>
	Farmers and ranchers in Saskatchewan are concerned this type of 
legislation will prevent them from doing what they want with their 
own land. They are afraid governments will annex part of their land 
if an  endangered species makes its habitat on their property. 
Farmers and ranchers are not against the protection of endangered 
species and populations. Farm owners, landowners and land leasers 
are respectful of our duty to protect all species with which we share 
this planet.
<P>
	Any legislation must first consider the rights of the private 
landowner. By considering their rights we will then be able to find 
a co-operative solution to the preservation of endangered species.
<P>
	My constituents who are farmers and ranchers certainly do not 
want to have any legislation thrown at them telling them how they 
ought to regulate their land. They must not be ignored. Farmers and 
ranchers are the closest to the land and are familiar with the 
animals that are endangered species and what needs to be done to 
ensure their survival. It is the duty of responsible government to sit 
down with those most affected by such legislation and find a 
common solution.
<P>
	Recently United States officials under the U.S. Endangered 
Species Act shut down a portion of a west coast logging operation 
in order to save the spotted owl. This was economically disastrous 
for several communities. We are aware of the extreme measures 
taken by the U.S. Not only were they irrational but they do not in 
any way take the private citizen's concerns and rights into account.
<P>
	The U.S. Endangered Species Act compliance process for single 
family residential lots states that only a recent issuance of a 
proclamation by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services has changed 
this regulation. The United States has spent approximately $825 
million and has not recovered one species.
<P>
	Some member from across the floor might say the U.S. measures 
are draconian and that this government would never follow such a 
lead. Let me remind Liberal members that the Minister of the 
Environment is a follower of U.S. practices. The U.S. banned the 
additive MMT in unleaded gasoline and the Minister of the 
Environment followed suit. The U.S. is considering a ban on 
sulphur and so watch for the minister to be trapped and only a step 
behind on this one as well.
<P>
	Bill C-275 is not similar to legislation currently practised in the 
United States. The bill's scope is to protect only species on federal 
lands. Like most legislation that comes from the government side, 
it flirts with that slippery slope concept.
<P>
	We are concerned, as I know landowners in my part of the 
country are, that the Minister of the Environment may be using this 
as a test case to bring forward some severe legislation not balanced 
and not fair to landowners but protecting endangered species, 
which we all share a concern about.
<P>
	Clause 9(1)(a) states in part that the minister ``may make 
regulations forbidding or restricting any use of, access to, activity 
on, or the release of any substance on,  federal lands that are public 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15553"> 15553 </A></B>
<P>
lands''. Clause 9(1)(b) states in part ``federal lands that are private 
lands''.
<P>
	If crown land is leased to a private rancher, which I assume 
occurs in some parts of Canada, does that mean the control of the 
land is under the jurisdiction of the crown or the leasee? When I 
mentioned the slippery slope, this is exactly what I am referring to.
<P>
	Perhaps the sponsor of the bill, the member for Davenport, might 
provide me with further clarification of this section and I would 
appreciate it.
<P>
	Clause 3(2) of the bill states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>For greater certainty, nothing in this act shall be construed so as to abrogate 
or derogate from any existing aboriginal or treaty rights of the aboriginal 
peoples of Canada under section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Endangered species legislation should apply equally to all 
Canadian citizens. There can be only one set of laws applied 
equally to everyone in Canada. If the government is serious about 
the protection of species it cannot predetermine which federal land 
will part of this jurisdiction and which will not; it is either all or 
nothing.
<P>
	Furthermore the Minister of the Environment has stated all 
Canadians share responsibility for ensuring that species are not lost 
to extinction as a result of human activities. I hope the minister 
when drafting her legislation will make certain that all Canadians 
will really mean all Canadians.
<P>
	On August 17, 1995 the Minister of the Environment introduced 
a legislative proposal dealing with endangered species. It was 
called the Canadian Endangered Species Protection Act. Its intent 
was for consultation purposes with a hope that legislation would be 
introduced in the late fall. As of now Canada does not have any 
legislation dealing with endangered species. I was recently told that 
even the minister did not know that such legislation was absent in 
Canada.
<P>
	This causes me and some of my constituents great concern, not 
the minister's lack of knowledge of her own portfolio but rather 
that she will now try to bring in legislation as quickly as possible in 
order to make a mark for herself. A responsible government would 
not do such a thing and therefore I ask the environment minister to 
make sure she not only has the environmental activists on her side 
but the industrial and agricultural communities as well.
<P>
	It is extremely important to find common ground between all 
interested parties. Decisions on endangered species legislation 
should not be made hastily.
<P>
	The Western Stock Growers Association has outlined five goals 
that go a long way in protecting endangered species without 
unnecessary intrusive government legislation. I bring these to the 
attention of the House.
<P>
	First, land goals: they should be to maintain productive capacity 
for producing food and feed through  sustainable development; 
management of habitat for both domestic livestock and wildlife; 
control access to such lands to limit disturbance to all species; 
empower the land holder to make appropriate management 
decisions.
<P>
	Second, people goals: allow local stakeholders a voice in the 
process; maintain the necessities of life and maintain the quality of 
life, particularly life in rural Canada.
<P>
	Third, financial goals: determine all of the direct and indirect 
costs of protection; determine all of the economic impacts and all 
benefits; preparation of a comprehensive budget to show how and 
by whom the action plan will be paid.
<P>
	Fourth, government goals: create a regulatory environment that 
facilitates flexible responses to endangered species management 
and avoids coercion of land holders; provide integration of funding 
of the foregoing processes; facilitate management by land holders.
<P>
	I commend the member for Davenport on his bill. He has been a 
member in the House for some time and has been a champion for 
environmental causes. For this he should be applauded.
<P>
	Should the bill make it to the Standing Committee on the 
Environment and Sustainable Development I hope the member for 
Davenport, the chair of the committee, will seek witnesses from all 
interested parties. I hope he will allow individual ranchers and 
farmers to appear so that the committee will hear from those who 
would be directly affected by his legislation.
<P>
	I could spend a bit of time talking about some of the hoops 
American landowners have been put through by the endangered 
species legislation in the United States but I do not have time. I 
hope the member for Davenport and, more important, the Minister 
of the Environment become familiar with these issues.
<P>
	Saskatchewan on two occasions, first under a New Democratic 
government and second under a Conservative government, 
attempted to introduce endangered species legislation without 
properly consulting all the stakeholders involved, particularly the 
landowners.
<P>
	Landowners are certainly conservationists. They are 
environmentalists. They have the best interest of the land they are 
stewards of and the species that live on that land at heart. Coming 
from an area on the South Saskatchewan River, the river valley, it 
has been a joy to watch species flourish and live in harmony with 
nature and with the people who are the stewards of the land both for 
cultivation and for grazing of livestock.
<P>
	There can be a co-operative approach to protecting endangered 
species and not limiting the rights of landowners and the lessees of 
crown land.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15554"> 15554 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1745 )</B>
<P>
	I implore the government and the Minister of the Environment to 
pursue that approach. I also encourage the member for Davenport 
in his legislation, should it go farther than this point in the House, 
to be willing to look at amendments to his bill that might respect 
the rights and interests of land owners in this whole situation.

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Ringuette-Maltais (Madawaska-Victoria, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I welcome the opportunity today to speak to 
Bill C-275, an act respecting the protection and rehabilitation of 
endangered and threatened species, standing in the name of the 
hon. member for Davenport.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The paddlefish, the swift fox and the black-footed ferret have 
one thing in common: They no longer exist in the wild in Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	As for the Labrador duck, the sea mink and the blue walleye, all 
three have ceased to exist.
<P>
	The Eastern cougar, the Salish sucker, the right whale, the white 
Prairie gentian and the spotted owl are endangered in Canada.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The white-headed woodpecker, the blue ash, the western Atlantic 
harbour porpoise and the spiny softshell turtle are threatened. The 
polar bear, the eastern bluebird, the orange-spotted sunfish, the 
pug-nose minnow, the prairie rose, the blue whale and the 
trumpeter swan are vulnerable.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Canada now has 244 animal and plant species on the endangered 
list. These species are affected by the loss of essential habitat, 
excessive harvesting, introduction of exotic species, climatic 
change and contamination by toxic products.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The time has clearly come for the federal government to release 
a legislative proposal for a Canadian endangered species protection 
act. The government has decided to ask for public comment on this 
proposal before introducing a bill in Parliament because it wants as 
much input as possible from as many Canadians as possible.
<P>
	The document is short and straightforward. We have eliminated 
as much of the legalese as we could in order to allow Canadians to 
participate in constructive discussions before the final drafting of 
the bill.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Protection of endangered species is the responsibility of all 
groups in our society and each and every citizen in this country. We 
need legislation that will make the Canadian public feel directly 
involved.
<P>
	The bill before the House today seeks to regulate the following 
activities: the killing, wounding, capture, collecting or disturbing 
of endangered species, including plants, birds, fish, mammals and 
their embryos. The bill also seeks to establish Canadian controls 
over the purchase, sale and international trade in endangered 
species. To me it is quite clear that Canadians want the maximum 
penalty imposed on anyone who tries to make money by unlawfully 
importing or exporting endangered species.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The committee on the status of endangered wildlife in Canada, 
an arm's length scientific body, would assess the species at risk on 
an annual basis. The Minister of the Environment would be 
required to establish a list of species at risk in areas of federal 
jurisdiction.
<P>
	Response statements outlining a plan of action would be 
mandatory. Recovery plans, if required, would be prepared within 
two years for endangered species and within three years for 
threatened species.
<P>
	The proposal would also permit emergency measures to be taken 
to conserve and protect species requiring the equivalent of 
emergency ward treatment.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The proposed legislation would authorize the Minister of the 
Environment to enter into financing or conservation agreements in 
partnership with other governments, agencies and property owners 
for the purpose of preserving endangered species.
<P>
	The bill would also provide for strict enforcement and severe 
penalties.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The federal government has a responsibility to set a benchmark 
for effective endangered species legislation in all of Canada's 
jurisdictions, but that is not enough. We also have a responsibility 
to work with the provinces and the territories to ensure a 
comprehensive national approach to the protection of endangered 
species in all parts of Canada. The federal government is 
committed to doing its part in this shared enterprise. Acting alone 
however, the federal government cannot come close to solving all 
of the problems.
<P>
<B>(1750)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Manitoba, 
Ontario, Quebec and New Brunswick for previously adopting 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15555"> 15555 </A></B>
<P>
legislation to protect endangered  species. I am convinced that in 
the coming months we will be able to sign a document setting forth 
a formal, national approach. And I am fully supported in this 
conviction by the fact that Canadians expect us to pool our 
resources for this common cause.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Over the last year of consultations leading up to this legislative 
proposal, the Minister of the Environment has especially benefited 
from the wisdom of the Endangered Species Conservation Task 
Force, a group with representation from wildlife experts, 
environmentalists, farmers, fishermen, foresters, and the mining, 
pulp and paper, and petroleum industries. They are the people on 
the front lines. They have acted in good faith despite their often 
divergent interests.
<P>
	She has asked the task force to reconvene to provide advice on 
some outstanding issues, including a strategy for education 
programs and the application of the legislative proposals to crown 
corporations. She would also like further advice on issues of cost 
and compensation. She is particularly concerned that farmers and 
aboriginal peoples, the stewards of the land, are treated fairly by a 
new law.
<P>
	The minister asked the task force to give thought to how we can 
ensure the active participation of the maximum number of 
Canadians in protecting endangered species. In effect, how do we 
ensure that there is a national safety net for species at risk?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	As we prepare for new legislation on the protection of 
endangered species in Canada, we should feel particularly grateful 
to the young people in this country. Students across the country 
have kept up the pressure on the minister. They have circulated 
petitions and sent thousands of individual letters into which they 
put a great deal of thought.
<P>
	The minister means what she says when she wants Canada's 
young people to continue to help her write this legislation. The bill 
will be available on Environment Canada's green line on Internet, 
and the minister urges everyone to send their comments. We want 
to have the best possible legislation that will support economic 
growth while protecting genetic diversity and the species and 
ecosystems that constitute the biological basis of our world. We 
owe it to endangered species and to future generations of 
Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to participate in the debate on Bill C-275, an act respecting the 
protection and rehabilitation of endangered and threatened species, 
tabled in the House on September 28, 1994 by the member for 
Davenport.
<P>
	This bill provides for the identification, protection and 
rehabilitation of flora and fauna in Canada threatened or 
endangered by human activity and for the protection of  habitat and 
the restoration of population. It gives the Minister of the 
Environment a mandate to develop and implement programs to 
restore and maintain these species.
<P>
	I congratulate the member for Davenport for tabling this bill and 
for his devotion to the cause of ecology. The goal is a very 
plausible one.
<P>
<B>(1755)</B>
<P>
	It must be said that, despite international conventions and the 
very important United Nations conference on development and the 
environment held in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, I note that, generally, 
countries and governments do not do enough in this area.
<P>
	As you know, I come from Chile, which, like other countries in 
Latin America, has rich flora and fauna. However, there as well, 
certain species are threatened and endangered. There is the condor, 
for example, a huge and majestic bird that lives in the Andes, or the 
llamas or the guanacos. These are species that inhabit the countries 
of the Andes, Peru, in particular, and Chile. Fortunately, for the 
first time, the Chilean government has enacted legislation on the 
environment. Another example is Costa Rica, which has very 
special and wonderful flora and fauna and is also doing a lot to 
preserve its natural wealth.
<P>
	Efforts in species preservation must be concerted. National and 
international co-operation must be established. Fish, marine 
mammals and migratory birds must be protected first and foremost. 
This bill provides for the creation of two organizations: the 
Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada and the 
Committee on the Recovery of Nationally Endangered Wildlife.
<P>
	It also authorizes any citizen to submit an application to the 
Minister of the Environment to have species added to or removed 
from the list of threatened or endangered species. The minister will 
have six months to respond to such applications and will have to 
table a full report on June 1 each year on the matter.
<P>
	Canada still has a lot of work to do, despite its fine international 
reputation in environmental matters. In November 1994, the 
Minister of the Environment published a working document 
advocating the strengthening of laws to protect species threatened 
with extinction in Canada. In addition she announced new federal 
legislation in this area. At the moment in Canada, 236 species of 
flora and fauna are endangered, threatened or at risk.
<P>
	Since the 17th century, Canada has lost at least 14 species of 
bird, mammal and fish. The situation worsens each year. These 
species are lost due to human activity. Over hunting is the most 
serious threat. There are fewer and fewer old forests. Wildlife is 
threatened by chemical pollution in the environment. Acid rain, air 
pollution and global warming add to the pressures on these species.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15556"> 15556 </A></B>
<P>
	Canada should apply more firmly the Convention on 
International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and 
Fauna. It must put a stop to the over harvesting of endangered 
species in the world as a whole. Illegal trade in certain wild 
animals has almost led to their extinction.
<P>
	I would like to take a moment to voice my criticism at the 
decision by the Nova Corporation of Calgary, which was awarded 
the contract to build a pipeline between Argentina and Chile, and, 
to save money, will cross right through the city of Pirque and has 
already started cutting through extremely rare and ancient trees in 
Chile along the way. The Chilean parliament recently adopted a 
resolution supporting the demands of the population of Pirque, a 
city located at the foot of the Andean Cordillera, who want the gas 
pipeline to be kept at a distance from their city.
<P>
<B>(1800)</B>
<P>
	That resolution also calls for a complete study on the 
environmental impact to be carried out before the pipeline is 
constructed. In my opinion, Canadian companies in other countries 
ought to respect the same environmental standards as those in 
effect in Canada. I have taken the liberty of writing to the Minister 
of the Environment deploring this situation and asking that she 
intervene with the management of the Nova Corporation of Calgary 
to ensure that it will comply in Chile with the standards already in 
force in Canada. I would ask the same of all Canadian corporations 
who invest in other countries. There is a moral duty to respect the 
minimum legislation already in place in Canada.
<P>
	Although this is typically a provincial responsibility, much to 
our dismay only four provinces have passed legislation to protect 
these species, and I am referring to Quebec, Ontario, New 
Brunswick and Manitoba.
<P>
	I am delighted to say that for years Quebec has had its own 
legislation and its own Department of the Environment and 
Wildlife, one of whose objectives is to protect threatened species.
<P>
	The federal government has limited jurisdiction in this area. It is 
responsible for the preservation of fauna and flora on federal lands, 
for instance, parks managed by Ottawa. It is also responsible for 
regulating international and interprovincial trade and for 
preventing illegal trafficking in endangered species. However, it 
should not encroach on provincial jurisdictions, and especially 
Quebec's.
<P>
	This legislation has raised many questions in this regard. The 
Quebec Minister of the Environment and Wildlife, Jacques 
Brassard, has already announced his own strategy for the 
preservation of Quebec's biological diversity. He has asked the 
federal government to remain within the sectors that are its 
exclusive responsibility.
<P>
	My Bloc Quebecois colleagues, the hon. members for 
Laurentides and Anjou-Rivières-des-Prairies, previously 
commented in considerable detail on the subject during the debate 
last June.
<P>
	Although the bill's objectives are indeed praiseworthy, I cannot 
support this legislation because it encroaches on provincial 
jurisdictions, and more particularly that of Quebec.
<P>
	Once again I would like to congratulate the hon. member for 
Davenport on his dedication to environmental issues, which I fully 
support, but I also wish to inform him that the Bloc Quebecois will 
vote against this bill.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Glen McKinnon (Brandon-Souris, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
is my pleasure to rise today to speak on this bill. Previous speakers 
today have enunciated the fact that there has been or still is a 
patchwork of legislation across the country.
<P>
	There appears to be some consistency lacking. Concerns about a 
lack of endangered species legislation in greater Canada has been 
expressed for well over a decade.
<P>
	It is my view that all Canadians have a moral responsibility to 
ensure that future generations enjoy and benefit from the presence 
of diverse wildlife species. The federal, provincial and territorial 
governments together must provide the required leadership and 
legislative tools thereto. That strategy will set the stage for action 
in a number of areas, including the identification and protection of 
endangered species.
<P>
	The biodiversity convention calls for the development or 
maintenance of necessary legislation to protect wildlife and their 
habitats at risk.
<P>
<B>(1805 )</B>
<P>
	The responsibility for protecting endangered species is shared 
among the federal, provincial and territorial governments. Options 
for federal endangered species legislation have been explored with 
the preferred course of action being a co-operative national 
approach. The federal government continues to work 
co-operatively with the provinces and the territories to develop and 
ensure this national approach. Because there is currently no federal 
endangered species legislation in Canada and only a patchwork of 
provincial legislation, we need a strengthened national effort to 
ensure endangered species conservation.
<P>
	In November 1994 the Minister of the Environment was 
presented with a 75,000 signature petition calling for a law to 
protect endangered species. This petition, the more than 5,000 
subsequent letters and the comments made during public 
consultations clearly indicate that Canadians, children and adults 
alike, expect federal leadership on this issue.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15557"> 15557 </A></B>
<P>
	An Angus Reid poll conducted in May showed that an 
overwhelming majority of Canadians, 94 per cent, support the idea 
of federal legislation to protect species at risk. The support for 
legislation is firm. Seventy-five per cent of Canadians strongly 
support such legislation and 20 per cent somewhat support it.
<P>
	Last November the Minister of the Environment released a 
discussion paper on endangered species legislation in Canada, 
another one on a proposed national approach to endangered species 
conservation in April and a series of public workshops were held in 
May.
<P>
	In August 1995, with full cabinet approval, the Minister of the 
Environment released for public comment a legislative proposal to 
protect endangered species entitled ``The Canadian Endangered 
Species Protection Act: A Legislative Proposal''. The legislative 
proposal was released to ensure that the federal government is 
doing its part and working co-operatively with other jurisdictions 
to protect endangered species throughout the country.
<P>
	The minister encouraged the public to provide comments on the 
legislative proposal prior to introducing legislation in the House of 
Commons in the spring. The comments received will help the 
federal government finalize its plans for protecting endangered 
species.
<P>
	The proposed legislation would help prevent wild Canadian 
species from becoming extinct as a consequence of human 
activities and mandate the recovery of species where technically 
and economically feasible. It would apply to species on federal 
lands and waters or under federal authority.
<P>
	The proposal arises from discussions with the provinces and 
territories on a national approach to Canadian endangered species 
protection. It also responds to the comments, suggestions and 
briefings made by Canadians at the public consultation workshops 
held across the country, as well as to the recommendations of a 
federal endangered species conservation task force. There were 
also many useful aspects of Bill C-275, which stands in the name of 
hon. member for Davenport and was introduced in September 
1994, which were also considered in drafting the proposed 
legislation.
<P>
	The proposal under consideration by the Minister of the 
Environment is consistent with the commitment enunciated in the 
red book which puts forward a vision of society that ``protects the 
long term health and diversity of all species on the planet''. The 
proposed legislation would also clearly demonstrate this 
government's commitment to the Convention on Biological 
Diversity.
<P>
	The federal endangered species conservation task force, made up 
of representatives from environmental groups, industry and 
industry associations, academia and small business was established 
by the Minister of the Environment to advise her on the contents of 
the federal  endangered species legislation. The task force 
reconvened early in October to provide additional advice on a 
number of key issues, including the best way to achieve the desired 
safety net that will ensure that all endangered species in Canada 
receive the protection they deserve. The task force is expected to 
provide its report to the Minister of the Environment by 
mid-November.
<P>
	The legislative proposal is intended to form the federal 
component of a comprehensive national safety net for the country's 
most vulnerable species.
<P>
	With the co-operation of federal, provincial and territorial 
governments, the proposed legislation will succeed in providing a 
strong national approach for the conservation of endangered 
species.
<P>
<B>(1810 )</B>
<P>
	The proposed legislation will apply to the full extent of federal 
authority to federally managed species everywhere and federally 
managed marine areas. The proposed legislation would establish a 
national listing process for all species in Canada regardless of 
where they occur.
<P>
	Federal government actions will not intrude into provincial and 
territorial responsibilities. The common but differentiated 
responsibilities of the federal, provincial and territorial 
governments with respect to endangered species are recognized. 
The proposed legislation is intended to complement, not contradict, 
provincial and territorial actions.
<P>
	The release of the legislative proposal prior to the tabling of a 
formal bill demonstrates our commitment to protecting Canada's 
endangered species and our commitment to open and transparent 
government. The federal government remains committed to 
working co-operatively with the provinces and territories to 
develop an effective national approach to endangered species 
conservation. By taking action at the federal level and getting our 
own house in order we are demonstrating our commitment to 
making the national approach work.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gurbax Singh Malhi (Bramalea-Gore-Malton, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today in support of Bill C-275, an 
act respecting the protection and rehabilitation of endangered and 
threatened species proposed by my hon. colleague, the member for 
Davenport.
<P>
	The protection of endangered flora and fauna must be a matter 
which concerns us all. Extinction is forever. When a species 
becomes extinct, it is a loss for both the world and for Canada. 
Anyone who cares about maintaining healthy ecosystems for future 
generations must by extension care about endangered species.
<P>
	In Canada, known throughout the world for the richness of our 
wilderness areas, the preservation of our animals, birds and plant 
life is akin to the preservation of our national identity. We have a 
tendency to think that  species extinction is someone else's 
problem. However, the truth is that since the arrival of Europeans, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15558"> 15558 </A></B>
<P>
at least eight of our distinct animal species and at least one 
population of caribou have become extinct.
<P>
	More than 105 species, subspecies or populations of plants and 
animals are listed as threatened or endangered and more than 111 
are considered vulnerable. It is our problem too. We can count 
ourselves very fortunate to have not only the hon. member for 
Davenport working on the problem but also the Minister of the 
Environment.
<P>
	In the modern world, species extinction is alarming not because 
it happens but because of why it happens and the rate at which it 
happens. In the days of the dinosaurs species disappeared at the rate 
of roughly one every thousand years. By the Middle Ages 
extinction rates began to accelerate rapidly because of increasing 
human intervention in the environment. Between 1600 and 1900, as 
human beings learned to kill more and more efficiently, species 
were lost at a rate of one every four years. In the years between 
1900 and 1975 the disappearance rate climbed to about one species 
per year. Today biologists estimate human beings destroy from one 
to three species per day. Some predict that by the end of the century 
the rate will have accelerated to one per hour and that up to 15 per 
cent of all species now on earth will be gone.
<P>
	Protecting the species that are threatened today entails far more 
than merely restricting hunting and trapping. In our modern, 
industrialized world habitat destruction and environmental 
contamination are the most hazardous perils to our endangered 
species.
<P>
<B>(1815 )</B>
<P>
	Each of them is far more deadly and more subtle than the gun or 
trap and far more difficult to control. Canada's wildlife habitats are 
vanishing very quickly.
<P>
	Millions of hectares of marshes, swamps and other wetlands 
which are extremely important for waterfowl and as breeding 
grounds for fish have already been destroyed.
<P>
	In the interests of what we thought was progress they have been 
drained or filled in for highways, airports, housing and industrial 
complexes. They have been absorbed by expanding farmlands and 
flooded behind large power dams. Forests have been cleared and 
grasslands have been fenced off, ploughed under or paved over.
<P>
	Too many of Canada's wetlands have already been lost. Up to 71 
per cent of prairie wetlands have been degraded by agricultural 
practices. In southern Ontario over 70 per cent of wetlands have 
been lost. The problem of wetlands is particularly serious. A 
dramatic decline in the waterfowl population is taking place.
<P>
	Canada's modern lifestyle with its heavy dependence on 
industrial, household and agricultural chemicals also poses a 
serious risk to endangered species. Modern society puts species in 
jeopardy in many ways. Acid rain can kill pond and other aquatic 
life and has a negative effect on soils and forest growth. Unless it is 
stopped it is quite possible acid precipitation will begin to take a 
toll on endangered species.
<P>
	Some wildlife biologists already believe that acid rain is at least 
a partial culprit in the population declines of some species of 
waterfowl and amphibians.
<P>
	Although the environment minister has proposed draft 
legislation in this field, it is important to note Canada does not yet 
have a national endangered species act. Legislation is in force in 
only four provinces.
<P>
	Unfortunately endangered animals, birds and plants do not 
recognize provincial or even international boundaries. For this 
reason it is imperative that Canada have a federal presence in this 
area.
<P>
	In terms of our international commitments Canada must have 
clear, strong legislation protecting and rehabilitating our 
endangered and threatened species.
<P>
	As my hon. friend said before, Canada's responsibility goes back 
to the UN Conference on Sustainable Development and the 
Environment in Rio in 1992. Canada was among if not the first 
nation to sign the convention on biodiversity when delegates of 
some 150 nations arrived at a consensus on what needs to be done. 
We can be proud of this but we can be even more proud once we 
have adopted strong legislation backing up our commitment.
<P>
	I thank the hon. member for Davenport for his unflagging 
devotion to the cause of protecting our vulnerable wildlife. I also 
commend both the member and the Minister of the Environment 
for joining forces to ensure that strong law protecting threatened 
species and their habitats becomes a reality.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jane Stewart (Brant, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure 
to join in the debate on this bill.
<P>
	Our colleague from Davenport has worked his whole career in 
the area of environmental sustainability and environmental 
support. I am pleased to support him in the efforts he brings to the 
House to help us understand and continue with his striving to 
support the environment and in this case endangered species in 
Canada.
<P>
<B>(1820)</B>
<P>
	One of my favourite things to do in my riding of Brant is to go 
into the schools, public schools or high schools. Without a doubt in 
every circumstance the issue of the environment is always raised.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15559"> 15559 </A></B>
<P>
	When I think back to my days as a young student it was never a 
top of the mind subject. We truly have come a long way in terms of 
appreciating and understanding  the importance of our environment 
and the role it plays in the lives of our young people. I am so glad to 
see the changing attitudes of Canadians toward our environment, 
toward the importance of sustainability.
<P>
	In my riding I have the great fortune to live on a farm. My family 
has been there for five generations. One of the things we enjoy 
doing every Sunday if possible is walking through the fields along 
the railway tracks, through the wooded areas and looking at the 
wildlife. We see red foxes, racoons, deer. We look at the flora and 
every spring we wait to see the blooming trilliums and the 
may-apples. It has become a tradition in our family that we pass 
along from generation to generation. It is one of my favourite 
things to do with my two sons on a Sunday afternoon.
<P>
	At the schools the children always ask me what the government 
is doing about the environment. I am always very pleased to 
explain to them that our Deputy Prime Minister also has the 
responsibility for the environment and that she is taking very 
assertive and definite approaches to making sure the things that 
have become very much a part of our country remain in our 
country.
<P>
	I was shocked to find out as I was preparing for this discussion 
that there are 244 endangered species in Canada alone; 244 
endangered, threatened or vulnerable species. Knowing that, we 
can understand why the hon. member for Davenport feels so 
strongly about the importance of this legislation.
<P>
	I am not sure this is true but as I look at information I see nine 
extinct species, things in my lifetime I will never see. A further 11 
species used to exist in Canada but are now extinct. The importance 
of preparing to maintain and protect our fragile environment is 
something that has to be critical to all of us.
<P>
	I am very proud of a project undertaken by a number of groups in 
my riding, the Brant Waterways Foundation, the Grand River 
Conservation Authority and the Grand River Trails Association. 
They came together in partnership with the federal government 
through the environmental partners program to develop the 
Brantford environmental education project. Along the Grand River, 
now a heritage river, we have created walkways, bike paths and 
trails that all can enjoy.
<P>
	The thing that is so important in this regard is along the shores of 
the Grand River are Carolinian forests, themselves an endangered 
and rare set of flora and fauna. We are very lucky in our community 
to have them as part of our surrounding environment, something 
we can enjoy with ease. We are also lucky to have organizations in 
Brant that are conscious of how fragile this great resource is.
<P>
	Coming together and with the support of the federal government 
we have protected that it in a way that people can enjoy it. It is not 
for the people of Brant only.  I encourage members of the House 
and Canadians from across the country to come and join with us.
<P>
	At our local level we have a consciousness, an awareness of the 
importance of the environment. I am glad that will continue. 
However, when we look at the rest of the country it is interesting to 
note that only in Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec and New Brunswick is 
there legislation to protect our flora and fauna. Again, another 
reason why I would congratulate the member for Davenport for 
bringing this legislation forward.
<P>
<B>(1825)</B>
<P>
	The federal government can play a real role in ensuring that our 
natural heritage remains with us. It will not be a role that is 
interventionist or that gets in the way of what the provinces want to 
do. Rather it is one that will co-ordinate activities, that will add to 
that which we already have, that will make sure the Canadian 
citizenry understands the importance and has access to our 
environment.
<P>
	We know from looking at things that have taken place in the past, 
and I have to reference the Canada Health Act, that very often it is 
promises that start with good pieces of legislation. However, it may 
be very slow to evolve across the country. That is where a strong 
federal government can play a role.
<P>
	I make that relationship with this particular piece of legislation 
and say there is a role for us to play at the federal level to ensure 
that Canada from coast to coast to coast maintains what has 
become world renowned in natural beauty, natural strength, natural 
resources and natural heritage.
<P>
	I am pleased to be part of the debate. I know people back in my 
riding who are so sensitive and appreciative of the issues of the 
environment will also be glad to know that the government is 
sponsoring this kind of legislation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Larry McCormick (Hastings-Frontenac-Lennox and 
Addington, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to speak to Bill 
C-275.
<P>
	I congratulate the hon. member for Davenport on this bill and 
also the Minister of the Environment and her parliamentary 
secretary for the work they are doing on this very important topic.
<P>
	It is very important to take the initiatives of these people and 
work with them. We owe our children and our children's children 
our prompt attention to this very important endangered species Act.
<P>
	This past year I attended two open houses at the Body Shop, one 
in Kingston, Ontario and one in Belleville, Ontario. This 
respectable company had a great display set up with everything 
from colouring contests to T-shirts and it encourages children to 
take part. It has done a great job of making people aware of 
endangered species around the world.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="15560"> 15560 </A></B>
<P>
	I am sure if we looked at the bottom line of the Body Shop 
stores across Canada and talked to the individual owners, we 
would find that their number one customers are the teenagers and 
the youth of today. Our daughter is one of those customers. I 
commend our youth. They understand the importance of our 
environment.
<P>
	We are very fortunate that our children, including my daughter, 
Kayla Rebecca, have developed this great love for country, love for 
the environment and our wildlife. I realize that we do not have to 
go to the Body Shop to be reminded on their interest.
<P>
	My colleague previously mentioned visiting schools. I also want 
to mention this. I was on a local school board a few years ago when 
we started up a community school and we now have a day care 
situated across the road from our home. I visit schools and day 
cares. Posters are plastered on the walls. It does not matter what 
topic is displayed, sports or the environment, we see birds and 
other species depicted on the posters for any topic. Our youth are 
very aware.
<P>
	We all agree that the greatest asset of our country is our youth. 
We are very fortunate. They are very wise in their respect of the 
planet, our country, our lands and our waterways. Therefore, we 
owe our children attention to this now.
<P>
	My riding of Hastings-Frontenac-Lennox and Addington 
extends from the Thousand Islands, which we are glad to share with 
my colleague for Kingston and the Islands. Then we circle around 
and go to the Bay of Quinte, the walleye capital of the world. That 
is where we had the live release tournament this year, the largest 
walleye tournament in North America with 7,000 to 8,000 
fisherpeople, but they released all the fish and it made our children 
very happy.
<P>
<B>(1830)</B>
<P>
	I drive from my office in Napanee to Bancroft and on up to 
Algonquin Park. My riding touches quite a bit of Algonquin Park. 
Quite often I see wildlife. It is a real thrill.
<P>
	The other day I was in Algonquin Park for the Art in the Park 
show. My wife and daughter were with me. We were driving along 
and a tour bus and cars were stopped. People were having the thrill 
of a lifetime because there was a bear in the bush. The bear was 
playing up for the public. The bear was standing there scratching 
on the trees and foraging a bit. It certainly reminds us of what we 
would lose and what we do lose any time we lose one species.
<P>
	Someone else mentioned that when I went to school we did not 
pay all this attention to the environment. No, we did not but 
perhaps it was being introduced into our subconscious minds. One 
of the highlights in public school was arbour day, when we went 
out and planted trees. Over a few years we did plant a few thousand 
trees and made a small contribution. I am sure I have driven  by 
some of those areas. The trees are tall now because that was a while 
ago. Trees are very important; they provide a natural habitat for 
birds.
<P>
	When I went to school we did not have respect for the wetlands, I 
admit. Today our children are more curious and more in love with 
all of these endangered species.
<P>
	What do we do? Where do we go from here? We have all heard 
that there is no national law to protect them. Some of the provinces 
have laws. I am glad to see that the federal government and 
Environment Canada are going to work with the provinces on this. 
They are going to work with different stakeholders, groups, 
provinces, territories, aboriginal groups and wildlife management 
boards.
<P>
	We can learn a lot from the aboriginal groups, from the natives in 
our communities. Someone listening to me is going to say: ``Yes, I 
heard about some natives that went out during the fish spawning 
season and speared a whole lot of fish''. Yes, there are bad apples in 
every barrel, but I will tell you our native populations live in 
harmony with this country. There is much we can learn from them. 
They have always practised conservation.
<P>
	When you tap any natural resource you leave some for seed. My 
uncle was a trapper many years ago, a colourful character. He made 
a lot of money some years trapping beaver. One day I was with him 
and I used an axe to cut through two and a half feet of ice on the 
river behind our home. He set the trap and took out a very nice 
beaver, but he said that was it. I went with him the next day and he 
said: ``We will not set any more traps here. We have to leave some 
for the future''.
<P>
	I will conclude by saying I really appreciate the opportunity for 
me an other people to speak on this. I want to acknowledge that our 
youth will lead the way. They remind us every day and every 
weekend at home.

<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 deemed 
to have been moved.

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CLIMATECHANGE">CLIMATE CHANGE</A></H4>
	<B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
September 21 I asked the Minister of the  Environment what 
measures the government was taking to counter the human causes 
<P>

<B><A NAME="15561"> 15561 </A></B>
<P>
of climate change. In the meantime, a draft report by the United 
Nations panel on climate change has been published citing human 
activity as the contributing factor to climate change. In addition, 
there has been an Environment Canada report citing increasing 
summer temperatures in the last 10 years.
<P>
<B>(1835)</B>
<P>
	What is the cause of climate change? Briefly, it is caused by an 
envelope in the atmosphere which is created by the burning of 
fossil fuels on our part as a society, beginning with the industrial 
revolution 150 years ago.
<P>
	What are the effects of this envelope? This envelope does not 
allow solar rays deflected once they touch the earth's surface to 
re-enter the atmosphere. Thus, the greenhouse effect is gradually 
formed. In other words, the effect of solar rays as deflected by the 
earth's surface is no longer the same as in the past. They are 
contained by the greenhouse gases envelope.
<P>
	What is the main problem at the base of this? In essence, it is our 
dependence on fossil fuels, coal and gasoline, but also the emission 
of methane gases in our dump sites and the production of other 
gases that are mostly correlated to human activities or the 
necessities of agriculture and the like.
<P>
	Next month the international panel on climate change will meet 
and likely approve a draft report which will mark a major turning 
point in the climate change debate.
<P>
	Until now some members of the scientific community believe 
that the rising temperatures since the beginning of the industrial 
revolution could be attributed to at least in good part a variability in 
climate rather than the result of human activity. With this draft, the 
scientific panel will likely state and confirm that climate change is 
taking place as a result of human activity. Hence the adoption of 
this report by the international panel on climate change would 
result in an authoritative confirmation that global warming is 
posing a threat.
<P>
	Some have suggested that the effects of climate change may 
actually be advantageous to Canada. These assumptions are now 
being refuted.
<P>
	The report I am referring to predicts the changes associated with 
climate change are likely to have a negative impact not only on 
human health but on other human activities such as agriculture, 
forestry and the like.
<P>
	The consequences are far reaching in economic and social terms. 
These are again explored in the panel's draft report as discussed 
last week in Montreal. The first attempt to assess the social and 
economic impact of climate change is the one that took place in 
Montreal.
<P>
	I would appreciate very much a reply by the parliamentary 
secretary to this issue which, although stretched into the long term, 
is going to be of significant importance for the human family the 
globe over.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member for Davenport raised an important issue when he 
asked this question of the Minister of the Environment a month 
ago. He of course based it on an editorial in the Globe and Mail. I 
want to refer to that which was on the subject of the need to take 
action on climate change. It was published shortly before the hon. 
member asked his question.
<P>
	The editorial makes some good points about voluntary 
approaches and the need to adapt to a rapidly changing climate. 
These clearly are not enough to deal with the problem. After all, the 
evidence that our climate may be changing at an unprecedented 
rate is rolling in on a daily basis as the hon. member has indicated.
<P>
	In Canada, the summer of 1995 was the third warmest in a 
century. The year 1995 was the second worst year in history for 
forest fires. Record rains have hit Alberta and five early season 
tropical storms hit parts of the Atlantic provinces.
<P>
	This year is shaping up as the earth's warmest year on record. It 
is also a preview of what we can expect in the future. Scientists are 
concluding that recent data constitute growing statistical evidence 
that their previous predictions of climate change are being borne 
out.
<P>
	Therefore, in calling for voluntary reductions of emissions of 
greenhouse gases the <I>Globe and Mail</I> is heading in the right 
direction. After all, the <I>Globe and Mail</I> would have us recognize 
that the costs of climate change are also rapidly rising. Damages 
from the Alberta floods in June exceeded $50 million. Heat and 
humidity helped fuel one of Ontario's most destructive storms, 
causing $20 million in property losses and firefighting costs 
associated with the loss of nearly seven million hectares of forest 
across Canada.
<P>
	By reducing our emissions of greenhouse gases we will reduce 
the threat and costs of climate change and at the same time create 
jobs and become more competitive economically. I am quite sure 
that as Canada's business leaders continue to respond to the 
economic opportunity associated with reducing energy 
consumption, thereby reducing emissions of greenhouse gases, the 
<I>Globe and Mail</I> will take another step in the right direction and 
agree that the goals contained in Canada's national action program 
on climate change must be met, that we must stabilize our 
emissions of greenhouse gases at 1990 levels by the year 2000 and 
address further reductions over the longer term. Meeting such a 
goal will require that we take a mix of approaches, voluntary 
measures wherever possible and market-based or regulatory 
measures where appropriate.
<P>
	As my time has run out, I conclude my remarks.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Colleagues, pursuant to Standing Order 38(5), the 
motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted. 
Accordingly, this House stands  adjourned until tomorrow at 10 
a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 6.41 p.m.)
