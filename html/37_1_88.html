				Agreement between the Government of Canada and the Government of the Republic

				</p>


	<A NAME="Int-52961"></A><a HREF="#Int-52966"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Pat O'Brien (Parliamentary Secretary
					 to the Minister of International Trade, Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to address Bill
					 C-32 which would implement the Canada-Costa Rica free trade
					 agreement.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This agreement is an important step forward on several
					 levels. To begin with, the success of this endeavour clearly demonstrates that
					 free trade agreements can be negotiated between larger and smaller economies.
					 That bodes well for the future of the free trade area of the
					 Americas.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, this agreement will open up a new
					 market with exciting potential for Canadian exporters. It also includes
					 precedent setting chapters in the areas of trade facilitation and competition
					 policy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canada-Costa Rica free trade agreement includes
					 side agreements on the environment and labour that are an important improvement
					 on those found in earlier agreements.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am especially pleased that we have concluded an
					 agreement with Costa Rica, sometimes called the Switzerland of Central America.
					 As a country of some 3.9 million citizens with no military and longstanding,
					 democratic institutions, Costa Rica has been an important beacon of stability
					 in Central America. With a large percentage of its budget devoted to education
					 and health care, Costa Rica's future looks very bright.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada and Costa Rica share similar political cultures,
					 placing primacy on respect for the rule of law, democracy, respect for human
					 rights and the environment. Our relationship with Costa Rica has been one of
					 longstanding co-operation, trust and mutual benefit. Formal trade relations
					 between our two countries date back more than 50 years to a bilateral
					 commercial agreement concluded in 1950. Since then our relationship has
					 developed steadily. A free trade agreement will only make it
					 stronger.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both countries' citizens will be able to share in the
					 prosperity that freer trade creates. Already our bilateral trade with Costa
					 Rica has seen an average annual growth of over 6% in the last five years with a
					 7% increase in exports and a 5% increase in imports. The FTA will accelerate
					 this growth.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although our bilateral trading relationship is small,
					 approximately $270 million, this number is rising rapidly. Indeed, there was a
					 25% jump in our exports in the year 2000. It is also worth mentioning that we
					 have invested about $500 million in Costa Rica.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians are quick to seize an opportunity which could
					 explain the enthusiastic response to the extensive consultations that were
					 concluded regarding this initiative. The response from Canadians was strong and
					 indicated support for pursuing an FTA with Costa Rica. It should also be noted
					 that a significant number of small and medium sized enterprises expressed an
					 interest in such an agreement. For them, numbers like $270 million, our
					 bilateral trade with Costa Rica last year, are very large indeed. Their support
					 is not surprising considering that there are considerable opportunities in the
					 Costa Rican market for many Canadian goods, including automotive products,
					 prefabricated buildings, some fish products and a number of agricultural
					 products.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The improved access we will gain with this FTA will
					 give Canadian businesses an edge in Costa Rica, particularly over foreign
					 competitors who do not have preferential access to the Costa Rican market. As
					 our businesses that benefited from preferential access through the Canada-Chile
					 FTA could tell us, getting into a market first matters.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The agreement will include immediate elimination of
					 Costa Rican tariffs on most Canadian industrial exports. It is expected that
					 over 90% of Canada's current agriculture and agri-food exports to Costa Rica
					 will realize market access benefits.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada and Costa Rica believe that a commitment to
					 environmental and labour co-operation along with the effective enforcement of
					 domestic laws should go hand in hand with trade liberalization. That is why, in
					 addition to the FTA, two complementary co-operation agreements on the
					 environment and labour were negotiated in parallel. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These parallel agreements are practical and reflect the
					 scope of our relationship with Costa Rica. </p>


	<A NAME="T1010"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1010"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1015"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1000"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1010)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are also designed to promote values shared by both
					 countries, such as the rule of law and sustainable development.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considering the benefits I have mentioned, as well as
					 many others, it is not surprising that free trade enjoys widespread support in
					 this country. As I am sure everyone in the House knows, to the chagrin of some
					 I might add, the vast majority of Canadians, more than 70% in fact, support
					 freer trade. They recognize that increased trade is a prerequisite for economic
					 growth and Canada's continued prosperity and social well-being.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The statistics demonstrate that this is true. In the
					 year 2000 Canada's exports of goods and services represented over 45% or almost
					 half of our GDP, a substantially higher proportion than that of our major
					 trading partners. This share is up from 43% in 1999 and up considerably from
					 just 28% in 1990.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some 80% of the over two million new jobs created since
					 the government took office in 1993 can be attributed to our increased trade.
					 That means that one in every three jobs in Canada is now linked directly to our
					 success in international trade. One in every three jobs is directly related to
					 our success in international trade. That is so important that it bears
					 repeating. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of our exports are now high value-added goods and
					 services: telecommunications, aerospace, software, environmental technologies
					 and other areas of the new economy. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Canadian companies, including small and medium
					 sized firms and their employees, depend on trade for their growth and success.
					 Trade puts money in the pockets of Canadians who teach in our schools, work in
					 our factories and run our hospitals. As well, Canadian consumers and producers
					 can obtain a broader choice of cheaper and better goods and services through
					 trade. To put it simply, trade translates into better and higher paying jobs
					 and increased opportunity and prosperity for all Canadians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to turn now to the importance of new WTO
					 negotiations which have been the subject of increased attention and some
					 concern over the past few days. Given the growing importance of trade to the
					 Canadian economy, it is obviously in our interest to have clearly understood
					 and widely accepted rules to ensure that we are not left subject to the whims
					 of larger and more powerful economies.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A rules based trading system also gives Canadian
					 companies access to larger markets abroad, while at home these companies can
					 take advantage of global economies of scale and maintain or increase employment
					 in their communities. Canada's continued prosperity depends on an open and
					 healthy global economy. That is why we strongly support the launch of new WTO
					 negotiations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although differences over an expanded negotiating
					 agenda remain, most WTO members are seeking a launch of new negotiations at the
					 next ministerial meeting scheduled to take place in November in Doha, Qatar. In
					 Canada's view, expanded negotiations should improve access to emerging world
					 markets and ensure trade rules keep pace with changes in technology and
					 business practices. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are working closely with our trading partners,
					 including the United States, the EU, Japan and key developing countries to
					 build support for new negotiations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WTO members have many challenging issues left to
					 resolve before Doha, but I believe, with political will on all sides, we can
					 make good progress in bridging the differences among members. A new round
					 offers our best hope to gain access to dynamic new markets and to both expand
					 and strengthen the rules based system which has worked so well for
					 Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to say that in light of the tragic
					 events that took place recently in the United States, I firmly believe that it
					 is more important now than ever to pursue the goal of worldwide trade
					 liberalization.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bob Zoellick, the United States trade representative,
					 has recently stated that trade reinforces openness, opportunity, democracy and
					 compassion. I think Canadians overwhelmingly endorse that statement. I believe,
					 as he does and as does the Minister for International Trade, that the WTO
					 meeting in Doha should proceed so that the world trading system can continue to
					 promote international growth, development and openness.</p>


	<A NAME="T1015"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1015"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1020"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1010"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1015)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The many benefits of free trade are evident on a
					 regional level. Canada's continued engagement with regional trade agreements
					 such as NAFTA and more recently the FTAA are critical to our collective
					 economic prosperity and social well-being. With a combined population of 800
					 million people and a GDP of some $17 trillion, the Americas is one of the
					 fastest growing markets in the world in terms of consumers and growth in per
					 capita income.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The FTAA represents an historic opportunity to unite
					 the countries of the hemisphere in a comprehensive free trade area that would
					 contribute to job creation and growth throughout the region, including Canada.
					 That is one of the reasons we are enthusiastic supporters of the FTAA
					 negotiations now under way and why Canada continues to play an active
					 leadership role in the negotiations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The FTAA would create greater prosperity throughout the
					 entire region. Poorer countries of the hemisphere would have the opportunity
					 not only to improve their economic situations through trade and investment but
					 to begin to address the real problems of poverty, crime, environmental
					 degradation, threats to democracy and human rights.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will quote from UN Secretary General Kofi Annan's
					 report to the preparatory committee for the high level international
					 intergovernmental event on financing for development. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The secretary general was speaking of the important
					 benefits of freer trade to less developed and developing countries which are
					 struggling to enjoy the benefits we in Canada and other countries enjoy. This
					 is exactly what he said:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>There is now widespread acceptance
						  that, in the long run, the expansion of international trade and integration
						  into the world economy are necessary instruments for promoting economic growth
						  and reducing and eradicating poverty...Estimates of the potential gains in
						  developing countries from a variety of liberalization measures range from $100
						  to $150 billion. There are thus large gains to be captured by developing
						  countries from continued liberalization in goods markets.</small></td>

</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have heard it argued by a minority of Canadians and a
					 minority of members of the House that free trade is somehow bad for the poorer
					 countries of the world. They argue that it is a trick meant to take advantage
					 of poor nations while benefiting only wealthier countries like Canada and the
					 United States. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of my colleagues and I sat in the Chamber and
					 heard the prime minister of the United Kingdom, Tony Blair, state the same
					 sentiments as the UN secretary general. He said we must challenge false
					 accusations about liberalized and globalized freer trade. He said that in his
					 view as prime minister of a major country freer trade is fundamental to helping
					 poorer nations develop their economies.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those were not popular statements with a minority of
					 Canadians and some members of parliament on the far left. Nonetheless the facts
					 support them. An independent person like Kofi Annan, whose statement I quoted,
					 cannot be dismissed as someone who does not understand the reality of the
					 global trading system. Poorer countries of the world stand to gain immeasurably
					 by liberalized and globalized trade if we go about it in a careful and fair
					 minded way. That is what Canada is strongly committed to.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada is also committed to pursuing technical
					 assistance programming for the Caribbean and Central America to help countries
					 build their capacities for trade, investment and financial stability. At the
					 same time, Canadians have invested $54.8 billion in the nine NAFTA countries of
					 the Americas. Canadian investment in those countries increased sixfold over the
					 past decade. This means that more Canadian money is flowing into South and
					 Central America and the Caribbean.</p>


	<A NAME="T1020"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1020"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1025"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1015"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1020)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canada-Costa Rica free trade agreement is a symbol
					 of our long term commitment to the hemisphere. It will help advance
					 negotiations leading to the free trade area of the Americas. The agreement will
					 provide much needed insight into how to address the needs of smaller and more
					 vulnerable regional economies. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end our efforts to liberalize trade on the
					 multilateral, regional, and, as in the case of Costa Rica, bilateral level will
					 all lead to the same goal: a more open and rules based trading system which
					 will benefit all economies and nations of the world, a system in which there
					 are only winners and no losers. That is what Canada is strongly committed to.
					 Such a result would greatly benefit the people of Canada and people around the
					 world.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sincerely hope members of the House will support the
					 legislation. Concerns have been expressed about it already, even by some of my
					 colleagues. We are quite prepared to hear and address those concerns. However
					 let us make no mistake. Canada is a free trading nation. We stand by that and
					 support Bill C-32.</p>


	<A NAME="Int-52966"></A><a HREF="#Int-52971"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-52961"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian
					 Alliance): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to enter the debate today on
					 Bill C-32 which gives considerable detail to expanding free trade. I will set
					 out a preamble to my comments today and say that in general members of my party
					 and I are supportive of free trade. It is in fact our party policy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have another adjective we use with respect to trade.
					 Trade should not only be free, that is free from tariffs, countervailing duties
					 and all those things. It should also be fair. That is unfortunately where the
					 Liberal government often fails. It is imperative that we vigorously defend
					 Canadian industries.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government does not have a good record for doing
					 that with other commodities, including agricultural commodities. The government
					 has often entered into agreements without enough forethought about the
					 implications. As a result it backs itself into a corner and we in the country
					 suffer enormously. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot help but digress to the whole question of
					 western Canadian farmers and the tariffs and controls the government has put on
					 grain marketing over the years. Canadian farmers are not able to market their
					 product at the best price. Instead the government controls it. It is almost an
					 inverse Zellers' law. Zellers says the lowest price is the law. The Government
					 of Canada has told farmers the worst deal for them is the law. That is
					 unfortunate. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government is making the same error with Bill C-32
					 in that it is not giving enough thought to the long term effects. There are a
					 few things we ought to be aware of. Bill C-32 would expand free trade with
					 Costa Rica. It outlines a 10 year plan. Some tariffs would be reduced in stages
					 over 10 years and others would come into play rapidly.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be noted that we already have a free trade
					 agreement with Chile. There is also NAFTA which is about seven years old. The
					 purpose of these free trade agreements is to give Canadian producers better
					 access to foreign markets and give our trading partners abroad better access to
					 our market.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A problem arises. Canada for some reason has gone ahead
					 of all the other countries in the agreement by being the only country to refuse
					 to substantially subsidize its producers. All the other countries subsidize, in
					 some cases very richly, their producers of agriculture and food products.
					 Canada is way down the list, almost at zero. When it comes to sugar producers,
					 subsidies from the Canadian government are essentially zero. Yet the other
					 countries subsidize them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How are we to compete? It is impossible. That is common
					 sense. It should not escape Liberal members of the House and the Liberal
					 government.</p>


	<A NAME="T1025"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1025"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1030"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1020"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1025)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is another country competing with our
					 producers and its producers are being substantially subsidized over and above
					 what Canadian producers are, that puts our guys at a huge disadvantage. It is
					 as if we were to enter a race and we were to say to our athletes that we would
					 like them to carry an extra 50 pounds. I guess I already have mine and that is
					 why they do not enter me into Olympic races, because it is a bit of a
					 disadvantage.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadian producers are operating under this
					 disadvantage. They are working against a trade barrier of price because of the
					 fact that producers in other countries like the United States and those in
					 Central America substantially subsidize their producers. As a result, our
					 people have to be very efficient to compete, which they are, but in many cases
					 they lose out on the fight. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should be aware that 80% of the products that Costa
					 Rica exports to Canada, and we are talking about fruits and vegetables, coffee
					 and coal, already at this stage enter Canada duty free. Therefore the market in
					 Canada is already largely open to Costa Rica. Canada of course is now looking
					 to expand its market into Costa Rica, so in that sense it is a good initiative
					 because if it already has so much duty free access to our market then it only
					 makes sense that we should negotiate with Costa Rica to remove its tariffs to
					 give Canadian producers access to that market.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately this is done sector by sector. Sometimes
					 we fail to recognize that when we are in a trading agreement like this we must
					 have all of the food on the platter at the same time. We cannot make a deal
					 commodity by commodity and then in the end land up with a few commodities left
					 that were not negotiated, because consequently we are unable, because we have
					 lost our bargaining position, to get a really good deal for our own
					 producers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It just so happens that in the year 2000 Canada
					 exported to Costa Rica approximately $86 million worth of goods. In that same
					 year we imported from Costa Rica $183 million worth. At this stage, then, we
					 have basically a net loss in income as a country because of the fact that while
					 Costa Rica spends $86 million a year here we spend $183 million there. That is
					 fine because it allows us to bring into this country products which we need and
					 which are saleable here, but we must recognize that those products are also
					 competing with those of Canadian producers and Canadian processors.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the areas of much concern to us as a party is
					 the impact on the sugar industry. One of the fond memories that I have of being
					 a youngster growing up in Saskatchewan, and which young people of today would
					 not have any knowledge of at all, is that there used to be metal pails of
					 Rogers Golden Syrup. It is probably the best syrup in the world. If I recall
					 correctly most of the sugar beets that produced that syrup were grown in
					 southern Alberta and some in British Columbia. If I am not mistaken, the
					 processing refineries for this sugar were actually in eastern Canada, in
					 Ontario and Quebec. At any rate, we had this syrup and it was a wonderful
					 product. In fact I would hasten to surmise that perhaps Rogers Golden Syrup has
					 had a significant contribution in making me into the man I am today, and I mean
					 that in a humorous sense of that word, because we used that syrup a lot in our
					 home.</p>


	<A NAME="T1030"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1030"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1035"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1025"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1030)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogers syrup came in little 10 pound pails that when
					 empty became our lunch buckets that we carried to school. Nowadays this of
					 course would never be done. Nowadays the youngsters have designer lunch kits.
					 However in those days we were not different from our neighbours. We were poor
					 and we made use of everything we had. When the pails were empty they became our
					 lunch buckets and we walked to school carrying these pails with Rogers Golden
					 Syrup written on them. They contained our sandwiches or whatever our mother
					 produced for us for the day. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can see that the history of the Canadian sugar
					 industry is a long one, not that I am terribly old, but we are talking about 50
					 years ago at least. Even at that time the syrup was a wonderful, very good,
					 high quality product.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this stage, as far as I know, Costa Rica does not
					 have any substantial amount of output in actually refining and processing its
					 sugar. This means very simply that the tariff on sugars, which is designed to
					 protect the market in whatever country, is very one sided. In fact, the United
					 States and most Latin American countries have an import tariff on their sugar
					 ranging anywhere from 50% to 160%. In other words, when we export that product
					 our people have to be very efficient in order to compete in those markets since
					 there is an automatic price added to our product as it crosses a
					 border.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My biggest complaint about Bill C-32 is that there is
					 not nearly a rapid enough or substantial enough removal of those tariffs that
					 tend to inhibit the flow of our product into the other countries. As a matter
					 of fact, knowing the way the Liberal government operates I can see that in the
					 future, perhaps under CIDA or some other of our other wonderful plans, we would
					 actually be helping Costa Rica build a processing plant so that it could
					 process its sugar there and export it to Canada duty free. If we try to do that
					 with our product when sending it there, we will have a tariff to pay in various
					 stages for at least 10 years. There is no guarantee, as I see it in the bill,
					 that the tariff would ever be removed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why would we not negotiate on this issue in such a way
					 that it is fair for Canadians instead of lopsided? We may have all sorts of
					 altruistic motives in this matter. Perhaps we want to help the Costa Rican
					 people. I have no problem with that. Sure, let us help them, let us trade with
					 them, but if we are to compete let us compete on a level playing
					 field.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hasten to point out that this agreement could become
					 a template for future agreements with some of the other Central American
					 countries. If we do not fix this problem, it will be embedded in the agreements
					 with countries like Guatemala, Nicaragua, El Salvador and Honduras. Each of
					 those countries not only has some considerable capacity to refine their sugar
					 and to export it, but they also have large subsidies. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the life of me I cannot see why we would not, while
					 we are negotiating these tariffs, also make sure that we do not repeat the
					 errors that we made with wheat agreements. We should say very clearly that if
					 we remove tariffs they must remove their subsidies. We did not do this with
					 wheat. That is why the United States, still subsidizing its farmers
					 substantially more than Canada, is a very unfair trading partner with respect
					 to the sale and the movement of Canadian products. </p>


	<A NAME="T1035"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1035"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1040"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1030"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1035)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Canada with respect to wheat we have the barrier of
					 the wheat board which applies, by the way, only to the prairie provinces. Go
					 figure that one. Why should wheat producers in Ontario or Quebec or Atlantic
					 Canada be able to sell their grain without going through the wheat board? If
					 the wheat producers happen to be in Manitoba, Saskatchewan or Alberta the
					 mighty thumb of the federal government is on top of them. If they try to make a
					 move they go to jail. That is scary. We have actually had our own government,
					 not the importing country, not the United States, put our own farmers in jail
					 because of their attempts to sell their own products at a price that is better
					 and more immediate as opposed to what the wheat board offers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In negotiating a free trade agreement with the United
					 States did we insist that it remove its subsidies? No. Consequently it has
					 them. Consequently our farmers are operating at a disadvantage.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we have Canada making this agreement with Costa
					 Rica and looking ahead at some of the other countries with which we will
					 undoubtedly be processing a trade agreement . We are in favour of that, but we
					 had better make sure that we put all of the elements on the negotiating table,
					 not just the tariffs and the free trade. Let us also very clearly specify and
					 demand as a condition that the subsidization be included in those negotiations
					 and that the subsidization be removed. How can we compete? </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of years ago I had a friend who sold one brand
					 of imported Japanese vehicles in Canada. Along came another importer from
					 Korea. The Canadian government for some reason exempted the Korean
					 manufacturer's automobiles from some of the import tariffs. As a result it
					 became a very unfair playing field, just because of the negotiations of the
					 government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to make sure that all Canadians in these trade
					 agreements are treated fairly.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should also note that right now, to the best of my
					 knowledge, every country in the Americas, Central America and South America,
					 and including the United States, subsidizes its farmers except Canada. At least
					 to put it this way, their subsidies are much higher in proportion. We are
					 remiss in our duties to our own people if we do not make sure that these
					 tariffs are not stacked against us in view of those duty free
					 agreements.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to say that there is a considerable
					 movement of agricultural goods around the country and it is so important to
					 Canada. It is my belief that approximately 80% of our food production is
					 destined for export, so we had better have good trade agreements. We had better
					 have fair tariffs. We had better make sure that our producers are
					 protected.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a matter of fact, our economic well-being is largely
					 dependent on the export of those agricultural products. For every $100 worth of
					 food that Canadian farmers produce we Canadians consume only about $20 worth of
					 it and $80 of it goes to feed people in other parts of the world. That is
					 great. We should be very proud of that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I happen to come from an agricultural community. I grew
					 up on a farm in Saskatchewan. To this day my brother farms on the family farm
					 and on more land he has added. We often speak in our family of the contribution
					 that we have made in providing food not only for Canadians but also for people
					 around the world. One of the great things that some of our people have done in
					 Saskatchewan, and I think this happens in other parts of the country as well,
					 is that farmers have actually given some of their surplus as a donation to some
					 of the third world countries where people are starving because of a lack of
					 food when we have so much.</p>


	<A NAME="T1040"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1040"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1045"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1035"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1040)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It behooves our government to make sure that we have a
					 market for the food we produce for export, but it has to be done
					 fairly.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had a considerably lengthy and interesting debate
					 last night on agriculture. I do not think we adequately recognize that a good,
					 solid, secure food source is a very important base of our national security. If
					 we were ever to lose our agriculture industry, and I mean all agriculture, our
					 food producing sources, the farmers and fishermen, and our infrastructure to
					 process food, we would suddenly no longer enjoy the security of a plentiful and
					 safe food supply.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is incumbent upon on us as a country, especially in
					 these troubling days, to make sure that our producers and processors can
					 survive and be strong economically and in their businesses. We need to make
					 sure we do not jeopardize that in any way.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am inclined right now to vote against the bill simply
					 because it is not good enough. I absolutely love the idea of free trade and
					 being able to export our food around the world. I love the idea that we can
					 provide it to those who do not have as much we do. However let us make sure
					 that we do not hobble our own farmers. We should not attach a weight to their
					 ankles.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is just a small diversion. In the agreement dairy,
					 poultry, egg and beef products are excluded from this present provision.
					 Presumably that will come at some future time in some future agreement, but it
					 is not included now.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have laid my case in front of the House and
					 the Canadian people. It is very important that in this instance our government
					 be given a message. It should go back to the bargaining table. It should
					 strengthen the protection of our sugar industry. It is not there now. Unless we
					 change that, I cannot vote in favour of the bill because of that very serious
					 and fatal flaw.</p>

				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues for agreeing to my
					 proposal to share our speaking time on this important debate.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, this is an important debate. Each time Canada
					 signs a free trade agreement with another country, it is, in theory, excellent
					 news, because when these agreements are carefully negotiated, and especially
					 when we have been able to have some input, they pave the way for improved
					 bilateral or multilateral trade.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These free trade agreements and multilateral agreements
					 also contain a certain amount of discipline, which is quite welcome, given that
					 over the last 50 years we have experienced some extremely turbulent times in
					 international trade, with subsidy wars and price wars, particularly in the
					 agricultural sector, as my colleague from the Alliance mentioned
					 earlier.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, in theory, we can only applaud each time an
					 agreement is signed to civilize trade, to ensure that there are clear rules,
					 and to improve trade, employment and investment opportunities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are, however, three problems in this agreement
					 between Canada and Costa Rica. Despite our support of it in principle, these
					 three problems are worth raising. Perhaps the government, if it is open, if it
					 as smart as it claims to be, could remedy them readily.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first problem is the lack of transparency as far as
					 the negotiation of free trade agreements is concerned. This applies to the
					 agreement between Canada and Costa Rica, it applies to all other agreements, of
					 which there have been many in recent years. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second problem concerns the provisions relating to
					 investments. We have frequently criticized these provisions within NAFTA and
					 now we find them again in the Free Trade Agreement between Canada and
					 Costa-Rica.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third, one that crops up every time there are
					 negotiations, even for the entire 50 years there have been negotiations for
					 GATT, the WTO, and bilateral agreements, concerns the international
					 distribution of the sugar market. A dangerous precedent was set with
					 negotiations between the Canadian and Costa Rican governments. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the first problem is concerned, that is the
					 lack of transparency and a certain lack of democratic spirit on the
					 government's side, people are becoming somewhat annoyed by it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the one hand, we have a government that claims to be
					 democratic and, particularly since the dramatic events of September 11 in the
					 United States, a defender of democracy, freedom and democratic institutions.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet every time there are negotiations on free trade
					 agreements, bilateral or multilateral, or any other—and their numbers are
					 increasing with each passing year—parliament, the direct expression of our
					 democratic system, is not involved. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And every time an attempt is made, particularly by my
					 colleague from Joliette, who is the Bloc Quebecois trade critic, to introduce
					 bills here to ensure that parliament is consulted at every stage of trade
					 treaty negotiations, every time those bills have been introduced, they have
					 been roundly rejected by the Liberals. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. member:</b> Disgraceful.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</b> In other words, the Liberal
					 members—each of them—who claim to represent the public, do not even want the
					 public involved. And yet, the agreements increasingly concern, not only
					 international trade and the economic terms of trade, but culture, services,
					 education and even health. These are things that affect the public
					 directly.</p>


	<A NAME="T1050"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1050"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1055"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1045"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1050)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, how can they have the gall to deny us the right to
					 properly, honestly and vigorously represent the public who put us here in this
					 House? It is disgraceful. And it is not for lack of trying to teach our Liberal
					 colleagues the values of democracy, the fact that parliament is the ultimate
					 symbol of these values and that parliamentarians ought to be included at all
					 stages of negotiation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five times my party, and the member for Joliette
					 specifically, introduced bills calling for the participation of the public and
					 MPs at all stages of the negotiation process for any trade agreement. There are
					 many. In 1998, to give an idea of what is involved, Canada signed 44 agreements
					 with different countries. This year, some 50 agreements are expected to be
					 signed. This is not insignificant.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When government talks of globalization and says it will
					 increasingly determine the direction national governments take and affect our
					 daily lives, the least if could do would be to include the public and, first
					 and foremost, parliamentarians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first bill introduced by the Bloc Quebecois
					 concerned this. It asked as well that all treaties be tabled in the House for
					 debate, prior to their ratification, specifically to avoid the government's
					 presenting flawed agreements, as we have seen, containing things that do not
					 suit the majority of the people and that require more work.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one is going to convince me that the Minister for
					 International Trade, despite what he claims, is the source of all truth.
					 However, he, without consulting anyone, decides with a few officials what they
					 are going to involve the Canadian and Quebec public in by signing this sort of
					 treaty.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the private members bills we introduced in this
					 House, we asked that the provinces be consulted as well. Why? Because,
					 increasingly, as I mentioned earlier, international treaties do not involve
					 just the economy and trade. They concern education, health and all other
					 services provided to the public. The areas of jurisdiction involved are often
					 exclusively those of Quebec and the other provinces. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provinces then find themselves in a bind, because a
					 single minister along with a few public officials negotiated, on their behalf,
					 international treaties that concern their jurisdictions. They find themselves
					 in a bind because they have to implement these agreements, and moral pressure
					 is exerted on them if they decide not to do so. If we find this acceptable,
					 then it follows that anything goes in this parliament.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever such bills were introduced, we always asked
					 for transparency with a capital T. We asked for public hearings on the progress
					 of negotiations, we asked that the public be kept informed of these
					 negotiations and of their content, and we asked that the impact of these
					 negotiations on the daily lives of people be explained. But the Liberals
					 rejected all our requests for transparency, in a negotiation process that ought
					 normally to be open and accessible to the public. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does the government have to hide? What are the
					 government and the pedantic minister up to, when they show us an agreement
					 after it has been negotiated, signed and approved and tell us “Vote in favour,
					 all you have to do is approve it. This is your only role in this parliament”?
					 The members who sit here, who represent Quebecers and Canadians, are only here
					 to rubber-stamp things. We are all here to approve the agreement once
					 everything has been negotiated without our input and without knowing the terms
					 of the agreement before it is signed by Canada and the other country. This is
					 unacceptable. Things are worse since 1993. The process is even less transparent
					 since the Liberals came to office in 1993.</p>


	<A NAME="T1055"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1055"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1100"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1050"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1055)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the number of agreements is growing; more and more
					 of them are being signed every year. And this trend will continue, because
					 globalization is now a given. It is in our interests to negotiate agreements
					 with all countries of the world.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me that it would be easy to have a little
					 more transparency, to be guided by a stronger sense of democracy than that
					 which has guided this government in the hundreds of international agreements it
					 has signed since 1993.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all remember what happened with the MAI, the
					 multilateral agreement on investment. For two years, an agreement on investment
					 was negotiated, behind closed doors, between the world's richest nations, the
					 OECD nations. Had the principles in this agreement not been condemned by Lionel
					 Jospin, in France, and by ordinary citizens, who mounted a campaign over the
					 Internet, which is now a global link, no one would have known a thing about it
					 until after it was ratified by 28 OECD nations. This multilateral agreement on
					 investment would have been disastrous.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would have meant that governments worldwide would
					 have had their hands tied by transnationals, by multinationals, which have no
					 interest in the common good. As for investments, these companies would have
					 controlled all the countries who signed this terrible agreement.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet the Minister for International Trade told us that
					 he would consult Quebecers and Canadians. As recently as last January, he said
					 that consultation of Canadians is an ongoing process, which is an integral part
					 of Canadian trade policy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where is this consultation? Where is this consultation
					 at all stages of the process of negotiations with countries with whom Canada is
					 signing trade agreements? Where is this consultation with parliament, whose
					 members are democratically elected to represent the people of Quebec and of
					 Canada?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are used to the minister doing the opposite of what
					 he says. At some point, he is no longer taken seriously; he no longer has any
					 credibility. What are his statements and his promises worth when, a few months
					 later, what happens is the complete opposite of what was said in the House?
					 Where is his sense of dignity? Where is his conscience as a member, if he has
					 one? So much for investments.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since I see that my time is running out, I will resume
					 after oral question period.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These awards celebrate Canadian performers who have

					 theatre; dance; classical music and opera; popular music; film; and
					 broadcasting.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year marks the 10th anniversary of these
					 performing arts awards, and six great artists have been selected.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all my research I have yet to come across a security

	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

					 allowing someone into our country and why are we not doing more to keep Canada
					 safe and secure?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of what the Prime Minister says, Canadians are
					 concerned that Canada has become a safe haven for terrorists. It is high time

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pierre Trudeau showed us that Canada was more than the
					 sum of its parts; that to aspire toward a just society was a noble and worthy
					 cause and that we really could all make a difference. His vision included all
					 Canadians, whether from the east, west, Ontario, Quebec or from foreign shores.
					 Indeed, many Canadians call this country home today because of him.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A year ago today Canadians shared their grief at the
					 loss of a man who helped us to see not what we were, but what we could
					 become.</p>

					 tribute by remembering the vision and the passion that Pierre Elliott Trudeau

					 the brutal National Islamic Front regime.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today the Ottawa <i>Citizen</i> indicates just how
					 involved in international terrorism the Sudanese regime has been. It has used
					 its embassy staff to raise funds for Osama bin Laden. It has given diplomatic
					 credentials to bin Laden's followers so they can travel anywhere in the world.
					 It has worked with bin Laden to manufacture chemical weapons for use on
					 civilians. It has fostered close working relationships between bin Laden's
					 followers and both Sudanese intelligence officers and high ranking Sudanese
					 military officers. It has used its military officers, working with al-Qaeda
					 members, to ship arms across the country of Sudan.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, CSIS documents say that for the past 10 years or
					 more, bin Laden operatives have used Canada as a support base for terrorizing
					 Americans. The CSIS report states that the group al-Jihad in Canada is part of
					 a co-ordinated international al-Jihad effort aimed at pursuing a terrorist
					 agenda.</p>

					 actions and protectionist American lumber industries?</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has been very active on three specific
					 fronts relevant to softwood lumber. First, we are committed to trade action. We
					 are now in the process of requesting a WTO panel and the government will take
					 six measures to the WTO for adjudication regarding the U.S. trade action. We
					 continue to hold official discussions. Last week in Toronto there was enough
					 progress made that there will be discussions next week in Washington to look at
					 the root causes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In light of the tragedy in the United States, the
					 government is advocating quietly but persistently for our lumber
					 industry.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Transport was quite right
					 when he said our airport security does not need to exactly mirror the U.S. to
					 be safe. Many people think that some of the U.S. measures like armed air
					 marshals are making it easier for generals to shoot down civilian airliners and
					 will actually make people feel less safe in the air.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That being said, the minister has not convinced
					 Canadians that our security systems are fine as is. One can become an airport
					 security guard in Canada with 20 hours of training. That is the same amount of

					 Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I wish to report a situation that, in my
					 opinion, infringes members' rights.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On May 30, I put a question in the House to the member
					 for Ottawa West—Nepean in her capacity as the spokesperson for the House's
					 Board of Internal Economy on the subject of a Library of Parliament service
					 that was being developed for parliamentarians, including the members of this
					 House.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing Order 37(3) affords all members the
					 opportunity to debate a matter further if they are not satisfied with the
					 answer. This is what I am doing right now. I gave notice here, to the table,
					 that I intended to raise the matter in the House during adjournment
					 proceedings.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We recognize that there is a bit of a gap between the
					 time the member gives notice of intent to raise a matter and the time the
					 announcement of matters to be raised during adjournment proceedings is given,
					 since only three matters may be debated at that time.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I let some time go by, thinking that, by parliament's
					 resumption on September 17, I would have been told when I might raise the
					 matter.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I noted the first week that subjects were lacking for
					 adjournment proceedings. So, I made inquiry with the table, which referred me
					 to the Private Members Business Office.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 26th, a letter arrived at my office. The next
					 day I notified the Speaker of my desire to raise this matter of privilege. Here
					 we are.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the letter, which I will table, if necessary, I am
					 told that, according to the Standing Orders, I cannot request debate on the
					 matter during adjournment proceedings, because the member for Ottawa
					 West--Nepean is neither minister nor parliamentary secretary. Standing Order
					 38(5) provides, and I quote:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>A Minister of the Crown, or a
						  Parliamentary Secretary speaking on behalf of a Minister, if he or she wishes
						  to do so, may speak for not more than two minutes. When debate has lasted for a
						  total of thirty minutes, or when the debate on the matter or matters raised has
						  ended, whichever comes first, the Speaker shall deem the motion to adjourn to
						  have been carried and shall adjourn the House until the next sitting day.
						  </small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This paragraph sets out how the privilege may be used
					 during adjournment proceedings.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the member, the spokesperson for the Board of
					 Internal Economy, is neither minister nor parliamentary secretary, my privilege
					 is infringed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It clearly says “if he or she wishes to do so”. This
					 means that if the government wants to, someone may reply to the comments of the
					 hon. member who has the privilege of speaking for longer on the issue of
					 concern to him or her, that is four minutes instead of the 30 seconds that are
					 available to put a question.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, because there seems to be an internal conflict in
					 the rules of the House, there is a breach of my privileges.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This may not seem like a very important issue to some,
					 but it seems to me that a parliamentary institution, the Library of Parliament,
					 seems immune from questioning.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot, as a member of parliament, ask questions to
					 the Speaker of the House—this is what I am told—even though the Library of
					 Parliament is accountable to both Chairs, in the House of Commons and in the
					 other place. Since I cannot address the Chair in the House before the Canadian
					 public about issues that are of importance, who can I turn to? </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I asked this question in the House. I was allowed to do
					 so. But I am not being permitted to elaborate and I think this is a breach of
					 my privileges.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I would like to know why we waited until I
					 raised the question? I had to go back to the Office to find out when
					 adjournment proceedings were scheduled, only to then receive a letter saying
					 that they would not.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion, my request could have been replied to
					 when I submitted it, or soon thereafter, instead of waiting until the month of
					 September. This seems to become a pattern with parliamentary institutions. I
					 will probably have the opportunity to raise another question of privilege on
					 another case dealing with a similar situation. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not understand why I would be deprived of my
					 privilege to address the House on what is a current issue, this under the
					 pretence that no one can answer my question.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do hope that the Chair will determine whether there
					 is indeed an internal conflict in the rules, as seems to think the clerk at the
					 Private Members' Business Office and, if so, that it will be corrected. But in
					 the meantime, I hope I will not be deprived of my privilege to address the
					 House.</p>

				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I have a great deal of sympathy for the
					 hon. member and the question he is raising.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was informed of the situation about a week ago. I
					 myself approached our clerks, who do such a great job for us, to indicate that
					 I saw a problem developing.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that when we changed the Standing Orders a few
					 years ago, allowing questions to be asked concerning the Board of Internal
					 Economy—prior to that, no questions whatsoever relating to parliamentary
					 spending were allowed—and when we changed to rule about questioning the whip or
					 leader of the opposition in the House, these generally being the spokespersons
					 for the board, that made it possible for a question to be asked in the House.
					 But for other questions, the rule is that an adjournment debate is allowed,
					 what is often called “the late show” in the vernacular.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when the Standing Orders were changed in the case
					 of the Board of Internal Economy, we did not change the other one. This is most
					 unfortunate, and creates an injustice. I agree with the hon. member on
					 that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, in the near future, the clerks could prepare for us
					 the necessary amendment to the Standing Orders, I would be agreeable to
					 discussing it with the other House leaders, with a view to amending the
					 Standing Orders and making things equitable. It seems to me that is the
					 solution.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We frequently find rules in parliamentary law that need
					 to be adjusted. You have just presided over a review of the entire
					 modernization process in which a number of us were involved.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have met twice with my colleagues in the House. No
					 one on my side of the House raised this, no one had even imagined
					 it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under these circumstances, perhaps the hon. member's
					 request could be left pending, rather than doing away with it completely, and
					 we could all focus on changing the rule promptly so that the question could
					 then be allowed. If the Chair could take that into consideration, it seems to
					 me that this would be the way to remedy the situation.</p>

					 BQ): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise following the member
					 for Saint-Hyacinthe--Bagot. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, the focus of my remarks will be to show my
					 solidarity with the workers and the management of the Lantic Sugar refinery
					 located in my riding, not very far from my office, on Notre-Dame street. I will
					 have the opportunity to explain further during my speech. It is a world-class
					 refinery, and people there are extremely concerned about the liberalization of
					 the sugar industry that will result from the bill before us today. Before
					 getting to the central part of my speech, I would like to make some preliminary
					 comments. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, never ever should one believe that the members
					 of the Bloc Quebecois, or the rest of the sovereignist family, are against free
					 trade. Everyone knows that Quebec played a leadership role in the first free
					 trade agreement that was signed in 1988. Quebecers are essentially in favour of
					 free trade. Nearly half of Quebec's production is exported to the United
					 States, to the Canadian market or to other destinations. So there is no
					 question that Quebecers support free trade.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know full well that any bilateral or multilateral
					 agreement Canada enters into can generate economic growth over time. We are not
					 questioning that. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is troubling with the way the government acts is
					 that we are being confronted with a done deal. One must not think that today,
					 when two sovereign states sign a treaty that will have an impact on trade, it
					 will only affect the manufacturing sector or the business community. The
					 liberalization of an industrial sector may affect culture, financial
					 institutions in the short term, medical equipment and, consequently, the
					 viability of businesses and the maintaining of employment. What is particular
					 with the way the government acts is that we are being confronted with a done
					 deal.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for International Trade, who is very
					 self-confident, as we know--the least we can say, as Jacques-Yvan Morin put, is
					 that he thinks he is the cat's meow--came to the House saying “I signed an
					 agreement, I have committed the executive and I ask parliamentarians to ratify
					 this agreement without prior debate”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One could also use the same logic for the bills
					 introduced by the hon. member for Mercier: we want treaties involving the
					 executive and, ultimately, parliament, to be submitted to the House before
					 their final approval. The same applies to treaties on foreign policy.
					 Unfortunately, our demands have fallen on deaf ears: the government has not
					 listened to us. This is deplorable.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Signing a trade agreement is not an isolated, rare, and
					 marginal phenomenon. We can even say that it is increasing at an incredible
					 speed. Some 28 bilateral and multilateral treaties signed by Canada came into
					 force in 1997, 44 in 1998 and the forecast is for that number to be over 50 in
					 the years to come.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe one cannot talk about valuing the role of
					 members of parliament, of striking a better balance between the executive, that
					 is to say the government, and the legislative, which is the parliament, if we
					 are only a rubber stamp and are not involved in the making of treaties before
					 they are ratified.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the implementation of the free trade
					 agreement between Canada and Costa Rica, there are a few issues of concern that
					 I would like to talk about.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The free trade agreement Canada signed with Costa Rica,
					 which of course is a multi-dimensional agreement involving several sectors of
					 the economy, raises concern regarding a particular sector, namely the sugar
					 industry.</p>


	<A NAME="T1220"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1220"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1225"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1215"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1220)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be known that the free trade agreement with
					 Costa Rica will totally eliminate tariffs on refined sugar. This is one of the
					 main problems we, as parliamentarians, see in this agreement. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More to the point, there is an agreement with Costa
					 Rica. As we know, this country is tiny albeit beautiful. I went there on my
					 second honeymoon. As one can easily imagine, I had the opportunity to see Costa
					 Rica in very romantic terms. This small country is politically stable, its
					 agrifood industry is extremely important, and of course it is very interesting
					 for its fauna as well as the way it welcomes tourists.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be said that the agreement between Costa Rica
					 and Canada could be used as a model, and be a prelude to freer trade with four
					 other countries in Central America. I refer of course to Guatemala, Honduras,
					 El Salvador and Nicaragua.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spokespersons for the sugar industry, be they on
					 the workers' side or the management side, are worried. They are wondering
					 whether the free trade agreement between Canada and Costa Rica is a sign of
					 freer trade in the sugar industry among El Salvador, Nicaragua, Guatemala and
					 Honduras.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If that is the case, then we have a problem. Let me put
					 it very simply: if the same model were to be used to liberalize trade with four
					 other countries, then whole segments of the sugar industry would
					 collapse.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we know, the sugar industry is extremely fragile,
					 not only because the profit margin is not very high, but also because--as the
					 hon. member for 
					 Saint-Hyacinthe--Bagot
					 reminded us--in the 1970s, an international cartel made up of a number of
					 countries tried to fix the price on the world market, something which caused
					 significant price increases at one point in time.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The governments then decided to subsidize the sugar
					 industry to ensure that the product could be sold on the world market at a very
					 competitive price per tonne. We then found ourselves in a situation where the
					 U.S. generated a dramatic drop in the demand for sugar products, which resulted
					 in an extremely low demand price.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. member for 
					 Saint-Hyacinthe--Bagot
					 reminded me that we are not immune to the schemes of another cartel. At such a
					 time, I am sure that I will find the input of the member for Longueuil very
					 useful.</p>


	<A NAME="T1225"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1225"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1230"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1220"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1225)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

	I would like to get to the core of the issue and say
					 that I fully support the workers of Lantic Sugar Limited, in the riding of
					 Hochelaga--Maisonneuve, and the management of that company. This is not a
					 dispute between the union and the management. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is very interesting and I am proud to say that
					 when this Canadian sugar company had to streamline its operations and choose a
					 location to carry on its production, it opted for Hochelaga--Maisonneuve. This
					 was made possible because the union agreed to review existing collective
					 agreements and sign a new long term collective agreement. This is a very good
					 example of industrial peace where both the workers and the management at Lantic
					 Sugar made compromises to ensure the survival of the company and to protect
					 jobs in Montreal's east end.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lantic Sugar is a world class refinery. It is at the
					 very top of the world's leading sugar refineries.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we are speaking, the company operates at 90% of its
					 regular capacity. In 1999 and 2000, it invested $100 million to modernize its
					 operations. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is with regret that I must say that while the city,
					 the Quebec government and local stakeholders developed a plan to rescue the
					 company, the federal government did not invest one penny in that plan to save
					 Lantic Sugar.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is another example which shows that, when it comes
					 to regional development, particularly in Montreal, it is extremely difficult to
					 enlist the federal government's co-operation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lantic Sugar refinery, which is a world class
					 company, currently employs 345 people. Imagine what it would mean for these
					 workers if there was a sudden drop in the demand for sugar products at the
					 international level. When we look at the negotiations conducted by the Minister
					 for International Trade, we truly get the impression that the sugar industry
					 was not considered at its fair value. The possible threat facing the sugar
					 industry was not taken into consideration, as it should have been, following an
					 early and unfavourable liberalization process, as I will show later on.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that if changes are not made and if the
					 government intends to use this model for negotiations to come with four other
					 Central American countries, we could lose tens of jobs. But rest assured,
					 because the Bloc Quebecois will not let this happen.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A business employing 345 workers has made major
					 investments, to the tune of $100 million, on the east side of Montreal, which
					 means essentially from Papineau street to the end of the island. Mr. Speaker, I
					 believe that you spent part of your childhood in Montreal, as we have discussed
					 before, so you know the city pretty well.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I was saying, investments were made in that business
					 that provides $28 million worth of salaries and benefits. That business also
					 needs supplies and services for its day-to-day operation and has a list of 200
					 suppliers. This represents investments totalling $40 million. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is interesting is that Lantic Sugar does not
					 provide just any type of jobs; it provides interesting jobs for blue collar
					 workers. We are not talking here about people with university degrees, but they
					 are honest workers who do their job well and who have received serious
					 on-the-job training. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I asked what the average salary was at Lantic Sugar.
					 Members will not be surprised to know that it is $20.67 an hour. This is very
					 interesting for workers to have businesses offering these kinds of jobs in a
					 neighbourhood like Hochelaga--Maisonneuve. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now let us go to the heart of the issue. As we all
					 know, the Minister for International Trade is bursting with self-confidence. He
					 is proposing a treaty with Costa Rica that will liberalize trade in one
					 particular industry, without really thinking about the impact this could have
					 on people's lives. </p>


	<A NAME="T1230"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1230"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1235"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1225"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1230)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the present time, Costa Rica does not produce
					 refined sugar, which is primarily produced by Lantic Sugar. Costa Rica will be
					 permitted to export 20,000 tonnes to Canada, starting next year, in 2002. Costa
					 Rica's access to the Canadian market will be progressively increased from
					 20,000 tonnes in 2002 to 40,000 tonnes in 2009.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada, in turn, will be permitted to export 3,528
					 tonnes to Costa Rica beginning in 2002, and this will increase to 6,990 tonnes
					 in 2009. Why am I giving these figures? Because the public needs to understand
					 that when the Minister for International Trade negotiates with Costa Rica to
					 liberalize trade, there is some give and take involved. One has the impression
					 that the sugar industry was sacrificed to the benefit of other sectors. That is
					 what is unacceptable.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the minister's parliamentary secretary, who
					 is nodding his head, will give us guarantees that not only will the signing of
					 this agreement not be used to implement other agreements with four other
					 Central American countries, but that there will be no loss of jobs in the sugar
					 industry. That is my concern as the member for Hochelaga--Maisonneuve, because
					 of the importance of Lantic Sugar.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this agreement, Canadian exports are based on the
					 country of origin rule, so that it will only be possible to export products
					 containing sugar produced in Canada to Costa Rica.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for raw sugar--not refined--there will be no tariff.
					 Right now, there is no tariff on raw sugar. In the four countries of Central
					 America, imports of raw sugar rose from almost nothing in 1995 to 275,000
					 tonnes in 2000.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is interesting to note--I hope that the Minister of
					 Agriculture and Agri-Food, who has been kind enough to be in attendance for
					 this debate, is aware of this--that, in relative terms, the countries of
					 Central America and Costa Rica have been given ten times the access to the
					 Canadian market than they have to the United States.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This adds to the concerns of manufacturers because--as
					 I will point out--the U.S. sugar market is much more protected than the
					 Canadian sugar market, although it is ten times larger.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note that the agriculture minister is nodding. I am
					 not convinced that these considerations were taken into account in the Costa
					 Rica-Canada agreement.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore have a few raw figures I will try to refine
					 somewhat during my speech.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Canada, the tariff on refined sugar products is
					 $30.86 a tonne. Let us understand clearly that the rate for the Central
					 American countries is far higher than that. For example, it is 160% in
					 Guatemala, or 20 times the Canadian rate. The two countries wish to give access
					 to the market in the same proportions, but they do not start with the same
					 basic reality because of the different levels of market protection. What have
					 the consequences of this been? </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Refined sugar imports from countries in Central America
					 are constantly increasing. This is not hard to understand. For example,
					 Guatemala exported almost nothing over the past five years, but in 2000
					 exported 3,200 tonnes of refined sugar to Canada. This is a situation of
					 considerable concern for those working in the industry and for their company
					 management.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What needs to be done? What the industry is calling
					 for, both employees and management, is that the sugar market not be freed up
					 with a single country, and that any liberalization not take place until
					 discussed in a multilateral forum.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be other WTO negotiations in 2005, held in
					 Latin America in fact. People are saying “Why not look at the type of freer
					 trade we want with a number of countries?” Allowing the sugar industry to be
					 placed in a negotiating or competing position with countries that have
					 historically protected their market to a far greater extent than Canada has
					 been able to does not seem fair. I am being told my time is up, so I will
					 close.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I call upon the minister and the parliamentary
					 secretary to be very much aware that, should the agreement in place for Costa
					 Rica ever be applied and then used as a model for four other Latin American or
					 Central American countries, we would be placed in a situation where there would
					 be considerable risk of job losses in the sugar industry. And that we will not
					 accept. </p>

					 NDP): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be able to enter the
					 debate on Bill C-32 regarding the Canada-Costa Rica free trade agreement. I
					 think it is quite well known that the NDP party has great reservations about
					 liberalized trade agreements, about the way Canada enters into these agreements
					 and about the terms and conditions that are either within or fail to be within
					 the agreements.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our position is quite clear. We do not think Canada
					 should enter into any free trade agreements or liberalized trade agreements
					 that do not enshrine basic labour rights, environmental standards or human
					 rights. We believe there is a role within trade agreements to deal with those
					 social issues. We reject the argument that there is no other place for those
					 other issues within trade deals of that nature.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I point out the irony that we should even debate or
					 consider this bill in the legislature or in parliament. These free trade
					 agreements are specifically designed to bypass freely elected legislatures and
					 parliaments around the world. It is part of their job to provide a charter of
					 rights and freedoms for corporations that bypass freely elected governments.
					 Some of our ability to control our destiny within this country is taken away by
					 these free trade agreements.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may sound like a strong statement, but Ruggiero, the
					 former head of the WTO, said that there was a surplus of democracy in the world
					 that was getting in the way of the free movement of goods and services and
					 capital. That is why we need free trade agreements to bypass this tedious
					 democratic process that we spend our lives representing. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That in a nutshell sums up what the NDP's concern is
					 about free trade agreements. There are people who actually believe that there
					 is a surplus of democracy in the world which is interfering with the free
					 movement of capital and investment. It is a frightening thought.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canada-Costa Rica free trade agreement resembles in
					 many ways NAFTA, the FTAA, the GATS agreements and other free trade agreements.
					 There are many similar features in it. There are no noticeable improvements. In
					 other words, all the things we pointed out as flaws or omissions in those other
					 agreements are not dealt with in this new Canada-Costa Rica free trade
					 agreement. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada as a nation is dealing with challenges under the
					 current free trade agreements under which we are living, NAFTA challenges, et
					 cetera. I point out some cases where we are vulnerable to these challenges, one
					 of which is dealing with the bulk sale of water. We just heard eloquent and
					 passionate debates about Canada not getting into exporting bulk water, or the
					 bulk sale of interbasin transfer of water.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Americans, through the free trade agreement, are
					 challenging Canada now. Sun Belt California is a company that is challenging
					 Canada, saying that we have denied them economic opportunity by refusing to
					 commodify our water resources. This is the kind of thing to which we are
					 vulnerable.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another issue is our postal service. We have chosen to
					 have a federally owned postal service to deliver our mail. However, American
					 companies such as UPS, have challenged that. They have said that this is a
					 service they wish to provide and that they have a right to offer free
					 competition in that arena. Because they want to provide the delivery of mail
					 service, they have said that Canada cannot give Canada Post a monopoly on its
					 courier service.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an example of where we are losing our ability
					 to control our own destiny and shape the kind of country as we want it because
					 of the free trade agreements we have entered into at times.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the onset of my speech I mentioned that we are
					 critical of any liberalized trade agreement that fails to recognize core
					 labour, environmental standards and basic human rights issues. When we raise
					 that, we are often told that by trading with less developed nations, those
					 standards will be elevated by some kind of osmosis and that they will naturally
					 come up to our level.</p>


	<A NAME="T1240"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1240"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1245"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1235"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1240)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, we will not go to the lowest common
					 denominator, they will come up to ours. There is no empirical evidence anywhere
					 in the world where that has been the case. In fact, the opposite has been true.
					 The harmonization has been a downward trend, except in places where it is
					 specifically contemplated and dealt with, such as the European
					 Union.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The EU was a free trade agreement that the NDP could
					 probably have endorsed. Over 20 years they carefully set out the terms and
					 conditions that would not harmonize to the lowest common denominator. In fact,
					 the less developed countries were brought up to a mean average at
					 least.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We look at examples like the APEC meetings in Vancouver
					 that resulted in riots and the pepper spray incident, et cetera. We objected to
					 inviting somebody like Suharto to our country. We considered him an
					 international criminal, a butcher. Yet we hosted him in our country. When we
					 raised that as an objection the government said that by dealing with people
					 like that and trading with them, we would pull them into the democratic world
					 and would elevate their standards of labour conditions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we ended up pepper spraying our own citizens for
					 having the temerity for a peaceful protest, it looked like we went down to his
					 level. That kind of harmonization to the higher common denominator does not
					 seem to happen. We are very critical of it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are specifics in the bill that I should deal
					 with. First, the preamble of this hefty piece of legislation is written in such
					 flowery language. It is almost poetic. It is almost beautiful to read the
					 principles being espoused in that preamble. Unfortunately those same principles
					 do not find any room within the actual text of the document.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It says that the Government of Canada and the
					 government of Costa Rica have entered into this agreement to strengthen the
					 special bonds of friendship among their peoples and to contribute to the
					 harmonious development and provide a catalyst for broader international
					 co-operation. They are all very lofty goals and wonderful principles that
					 anybody would be happy to be associated with, until we see what it really
					 translates into.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If our interest is really to elevate the standards of
					 living conditions for people around the world and if it is true that the
					 globalization of capital is supposed to bring with it the globalization of the
					 rule of law, the globalization of human rights, the globalization of foreign
					 labour standards, then where is it in this document? Where is it in the
					 empirical evidence around the world where these trade agreements exist? It does
					 not exist. It is a fraud. We are being sold a bill of goods here that do not
					 translate into elevating anybody's standards. In fact, it has had a reverse
					 effect. It has had a negative effect on wages and working conditions. It serves
					 only one interest and that is the interest of global capital.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NDP is concerned. I should make it clear there is
					 nothing anti-free trade about the NDP or our party's policy. We are very much
					 for free trade. Other speakers mentioned that we are more interested in fair
					 trade. The world should develop and evolve, toward a fair, rules based trading
					 mechanism, not a free hand in the market shall prevail and good
					 luck.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Labour standards are of particular concern to me as a
					 former trade unionist and labour leader. We have watched Costa Rica for many
					 years. Frankly, Costa Rica has a terrible reputation for labour
					 standards.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of our criticisms about this trade agreement is the
					 same as with NAFTA. It relegates labour issues to a side agreement. They are
					 not found within the actual text of the document. All those annoying labour
					 issues will be dealt with by a separate tribunal, which is slow, tedious,
					 cumbersome, bureaucratic and has not given any satisfaction to the working
					 people who object or have a legitimate grievance.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Costa Rica is notorious for its persistent denial of
					 basic labour rights, especially the rights of freedom of association,
					 collective bargaining and the right to withhold services.</p>


	<A NAME="T1245"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1245"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1250"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1240"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1245)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this agreement requires the parties to do is
					 enforce their existing labour legislation. There is nothing in here about
					 enhancing current labour legislation to bring it up to the highest common
					 denominator. It just says that there is a requirement to enforce whatever
					 labour legislation they have. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Costa Rica's labour legislation is woefully behind
					 western standards or standards within the free world. It is another one of
					 those countries, through no fault of its own but through its desire to bring
					 economic development to its country, that has bought into this idea of free
					 trade zones or economic trade zones. They are called export processing zones,
					 or EPZs, in Costa Rica. These are areas that are excused from the pathetic
					 legislation that exists in that country. These particular zones, these fenced
					 compounds, do not have to live up to those regulations. It is a cowboy attitude
					 toward labour standards.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have watched Costa Rica develop over recent years.
					 Whether it is Central America, South America and Costa Rica, there is no
					 exception, they have what we call anti-worker Solidarista movements or phony
					 union movements. They are unions of convenience, much like CLAC, the Christian
					 labour alliance, in Canada. By voluntarily signing a contract with CLAC, real
					 unions are prohibited from organizing in a particular workplace. These dummy
					 unions have been organized nationally and are put place to try to keep bona
					 fide unions from organizing. This was a conspiracy to deny people basic union
					 rights and freedoms.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we were sincere about elevating the standards of
					 wages and working conditions of people in developing nations and using trade
					 agreements to help do that as an instrument, then we would require our trading
					 partners to adhere to the same standards of freedom and rights to association
					 for collective bargaining that we give our workers. The agreement is completely
					 and deliberately silent on that. We object to that. If nothing else it is a
					 missed opportunity for those of us who do genuinely care about international
					 development and moving society forward in a global way. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not the instrument to do that. Once again, this
					 is an instrument of exploitation. If we do not say it here, there is certainly
					 no opportunity for the working people of Costa Rica to object. This is
					 happening above and beyond any input from them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I stand in solidarity with my fellow working people in
					 Costa Rica to object to this agreement and to any so-called free trade
					 agreement that does not recognize core labour standards, the right to free
					 collective bargaining and the basic principles that we take for granted in this
					 country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People say that trade unionists object to free trade
					 agreements for selfish reasons because they are worried that their standard of
					 living will be dragged down. Frankly, if labour and commodities are cheaper in
					 one of our trading partner's country, there is nothing to stop Canadian or
					 American companies gravitating to that country for manufacturing
					 purposes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I resent that and object to that position. I also
					 resent the argument that we are worried about losing our good paying
					 manufacturing jobs. We are worried. We would be crazy if we were not. The only
					 sensible thing Ross Perot ever said in the election in the states was with
					 regard to the great flushing sound of Canadian and American jobs racing to
					 Mexico with the first free trade agreement. We noticed that and have not fully
					 recovered from all the promises that those blue collar jobs would be replaced
					 with better paying jobs. That has not happened among the neighbours that I
					 know.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are watching Canada negotiate badly on our behalf.
					 Every time it enters into a trade agreement we are dumbfounded. What kind of
					 negotiators are these people who negotiate on our behalf, go into these closed
					 door meetings and sign deals like this?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was in Quebec City, I was outside the fence
					 protesting while the negotiators were inside the fence signing yet another free
					 trade agreement. There is kind of a cruel irony there as well.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bill falls short of any of the lofty goals and
					 principles that are talked about in the preamble of the bill. If the government
					 were serious about doing something to move the global community forward in
					 terms of bringing less developed nations up to our standard of living, I could
					 endorse it. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NDP caucus would happily buy into any kind of
					 agreement that would move society forward in that way. Bill C-32 and bills like
					 it keep people back. It does nothing to elevate the human condition on the
					 planet.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I put it to the House that the Canada-Cost Rica a free
					 trade agreement is less about eliminating trades and tariffs and more about
					 institutionalizing a freedom that global capital enjoys today. It enshrines it
					 in such a way that even freely elected democratic institutions like parliament
					 cannot touch.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members are made irrelevant by agreements like this
					 one. Renato Ruggier, head of the WTO, said that there was a surplus of
					 democracy in the world that was getting in the way of the free movement of
					 goods, services and capital, and that therefore we needed free trade agreements
					 to bypass annoying nuisances such as legislatures, parliaments, et
					 cetera.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best example is Ethyl Corporation. I am sure hon.
					 members heard this case cited before in the House of Commons. We as a nation
					 decided that it was bad to have MMT in our atmosphere and environment. MMT is
					 poison as a gasoline additive; it kills people and causes cancer. We decided to
					 ban and outlaw it. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However Ethyl Corporation which produces MMT said that
					 we could not do that. It said that we were interfering with its right to
					 capitalize on selling MMT. In other words there was a lost opportunity. It sued
					 the Government of Canada because it had nation state status under the free
					 trade agreements. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A company can sue a country because we allocated a
					 nation state status to a corporate entity and it won. We had to back off. We
					 had to pay it damages for lost opportunity because we as a nation decided that
					 for our children's benefit we would ban a toxic chemical as a gasoline
					 additive. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was ruled that we could not do that any more.
					 Somebody traded our right away. Some bright eyed negotiator on behalf of the
					 Canadian government signed away our ability to protect our own environment in a
					 free trade agreement. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not being alarmist to raise these issues. These
					 are legitimate concerns and I am horrified by that. What did these people agree
					 to? It is like sending Jack to the market with a cow and he comes back with
					 three beans. There is no guarantee that any of those beans will even sprout. It
					 is a serious concern and a legitimate issue. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our NDP caucus, along with a significant number of
					 Canadians who are concerned about the globalization of capital and the free for
					 all interest in the free trade agreements, is disappointed. Speaking on their
					 behalf, we are very concerned that we have failed to represent the real issues
					 at hand. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is our goal, duty and obligation as elected
					 members of parliament to elevate the human condition and to move society
					 forward, how can we knowingly sign on to something like this which has the
					 reverse effect? It broadens the gap between rich and poor by enshrining bad
					 behaviour. It institutionalizes irresponsible corporate behaviour and locks
					 people in developing nations into that situation and holds them
					 back.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a missed opportunity here. This free trade
					 agreement should specify that if a country wants to trade with Canada its
					 standards of labour conditions have to be elevated in harmony to those of
					 Canada. Otherwise Canada would not trade with it. If it wants to do business
					 with Canada it must do something about the abominable, wretched labour
					 conditions in its country. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would then be using our position of privilege as a
					 nation to help raise standards in that country. However there is no mention of
					 that here. When we raise it we are told that it is a deal between economies,
					 not countries, and that it is not our job to deal with social issues.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are told that we cannot do anything about child
					 labour, but if those children were burning bootleg CDs the economic community
					 would intervene in a minute. It would be down there in a second to protect its
					 intellectual property. In some cases it acts very quickly. In other cases it
					 says child labour is not its issue. We should wait until child labour is
					 bootlegging CDs to see how quickly it acts.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-32 does not deserve our support. It does not

					 Moody—Coquitlam—Port Coquitlam, Canadian Alliance):
				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I am sure the good people of Costa Rica
					 rest well at night knowing the member from Winnipeg is standing up for their
					 human rights, particularly given that Costa Rica has proportional
					 representation, something the NDP likes but Canada does not have.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Costa Rica has a constitutional democracy and a
					 presidential system. The president is elected for a four year term and can only
					 be in office for one term. He can then run after eight years. It has 57 members
					 in its legislature, which is a unicameral legislature, and a two-thirds vote of
					 the legislature is required to change the constitution. Costa Rica has more
					 checks and balances in its domestic law than we do.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Canadian member of parliament states that he will
					 lance any injustices that happen in Costa Rica. He also says that parliament
					 has been rendered irrelevant and he references the MMT decision. The MMT
					 decision proved that parliament had power because it was taken to court. That
					 decision consistently gets misrepresented by the radical left in the
					 House.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MMT decision stated that according to the law put
					 in place by the Government of Canada one could not import or export MMT. It was
					 a badly written law given the realities of free trade. Free trade mandates a
					 level playing field. A properly written law would have said that people were
					 banned from possessing MMT on Canadian soil. In that way everyone would have
					 been banned from possessing MMT and it would not have prejudiced Canadian
					 people who were importing or exporting it. The law must be applied equally to
					 everyone.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is a standard of equality that I thought was the
					 foundation of the NDP. The law was badly written and it did not prove that
					 legislatures were irrelevant. In fact it proved the exact opposite.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member says that free trade deals have a negative
					 impact on human rights. I hesitate taking that as a credible source after the
					 NDP bashed and attacked Suharto, the former president of Indonesia, when he
					 came to the University of British Columbia. At the same time the British
					 Columbia NDP were holding policy conferences in Havana, Cuba, like it did last
					 year. Cuba is a country where Fidel Castro has driven out, incarcerated, or
					 murdered one-fifth of the population.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also question the veracity of the NDP when it says
					 that it is protecting human rights and that it is opposed to free trade unless
					 it enhances human rights. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given that he is so in favour of international
					 standards for human, labour and environmental rights, did he communicate that
					 to NDP Premiers Romanow, Dosanjh and Doer when they went on the team Canada
					 trade mission to China, given China's record on the environment vis-à-vis the
					 Three Gorges dam and its human rights approach to Falun Gong and labour
					 standards? Has he given the same preaching sermon to the NDP premiers of those

				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, that is probably the longest question in
					 the history of the House of Commons. The member did come to the point so I
					 suppose he deserves a response.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is our position that the Canada-Costa Rica free
					 trade agreement is more notable for its omissions than what is in it. When we
					 talk about core labour, environmental standards and basic human rights issues
					 it is not just the NDP talking. We are not the enemy here. We are not the only
					 voice in the wilderness calling for these things. It is the ILO, the United
					 Nations, and international NGOs from around the world that are calling for a
					 more progressive attitude toward our trade policies. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know the hon. member has a thing about the NDP. He
					 wants to place us as the enemy or the lone voice on this issue. In actual fact
					 the rest of the world agrees with us. Most of the developed nations are
					 questioning their role and trade as an aspect of their overall policy.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will use the European Union as an example. If free
					 trade agreements were comparable to the economic harmonization within the
					 European Union, we would not have any objections and I would not be standing
					 here complaining. However in that case one is dealing with countries that are a
					 lot more similar in size and shape. There is not the incredible imbalance in
					 the power structure between the two signatories. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have used the example of when the lion lays down with
					 the lamb, the lamb does not get much sleep. That has never been truer than in a
					 situation like this one. It is an overwhelming imbalance in the power
					 relationship between the two signatories to this agreement.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is not true in the European Union. It is finding
					 consensus and agreement that took 20 years to negotiate. The agreements at the
					 European Union were not written on the back of a napkin. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deal we have here was signed at the Quebec summit.
					 While we were protesting outside the fence the deal was being signed inside the
					 fence. It was a hasty and flawed job because it failed to address the real
					 issues that most people care about. These are issues that would affect the
					 quality of life of the people in those countries.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What else matters? If profit is the only motive then we
					 have a satisfactory document. However it falls short if it was intended to
					 elevate the human condition by using trade agreements. There is nothing radical
					 about an observation like that. It is an objective opinion that we could do
					 better. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a missed opportunity any time we enter into one
					 of these trade deals that does not use every tool in our toolbox to try to
					 elevate the human condition. What else is it all about and why else are we
					 here?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I resent the tone and the content of the hon. member's
					 intervention because it fails to appreciate the legitimate concerns I am trying
					 to raise. I speak for a significant percentage of the population when I do
					 that.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, as part of the government I speak for a
					 more significant part of the Canadian population in that survey after survey
					 has shown that over 70% of Canadians support freer and liberalized trade.
					 Therefore I will stand with the 70% and my colleague from Winnipeg Centre can
					 stand with the 30% if he chooses.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I listened to his remarks and several times he cited
					 that the EU as a great example in trade agreements. I attended on behalf of the
					 Minister for International Trade a trade discussion day concerning less
					 developed countries. I hope my colleague will listen to this point because I
					 will ask him a specific question and expect a specific answer with no ducking.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that trade discussion day EU ministers of
					 development were categorically opposed to including labour agreements in trade
					 deals. The very EU ministers that he cites with such praise were categorically
					 opposed, led my none other than the U.K. minister, Clare Short. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would my colleague from Winnipeg Centre tell us why the
					 NDP seems to be one of the few voices anywhere in the world that is insisting
					 that labour agreements be included in trade deals, when almost everyone else
					 including his cousins in the U.K. labour party is saying that it would lead to
					 back door protectionism?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How could the member ignore the comments of a man like
					 Kofi Annan who said that liberalized and globalized free trade are the best
					 possible courses of action we can take to help the poor countries my colleague
					 addressed in his comments? </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have never had an answer from the NDP on those two
					 points, so I am anxiously awaiting one now.</p>

				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, life must be so simple when one is a
					 Liberal. It must be really convenient to be such a gifted chameleon, to
					 flip-flop from one's position.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember the Liberals in the late 1980s and early
					 1990s arguing and opposing free trade vehemently and vigorously. They had
					 passionate debates saying that free trade would bring us down and that Brian
					 Mulroney was evil for trying to foist free trade upon us. Today they have
					 conveniently flip-flopped and are now the champions, the vanguards of the free
					 trade movement. It must be really easy to be a Liberal. I guess that is why
					 there are so many Liberals, it is so bloody easy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When labour issues are raised within free trade
					 agreements, the side agreements are so hopelessly feckless, absolutely useless,
					 that no workers ever get any satisfaction from them. That is why we are saying
					 they should be within the actual document, not in some parallel side accord.
					 Those side accords have never given satisfaction to the grieving
					 parties.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If they set up an institution that is completely
					 feckless, they are dooming it to failure, and it is a deliberate thing. There
					 was a conscious choice to not put those terms and conditions within the
					 contract and to put them on a side deal because they would brush those issues
					 off to the side so nothing would interfere or interrupt with the free movement
					 of goods and services of capital, not even the legitimate grievances of working
					 people who are being affected in a negative way by these issues.</p>


	<A NAME="Int-53291"></A><a HREF="#Int-53296"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-53288"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Peter MacKay
					 (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have an opportunity to
					 hopefully contribute somewhat to the debate before the House on Bill
					 C-32.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not necessarily attach myself to very much, if
					 anything, that the previous speaker puts before the House other than to say
					 that at the very least his party and he himself have been consistent in their
					 approach to this issue. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member spoke in his remarks about <i>Jack and the
					 Beanstalk</i>. I am reminded of other fairytale red book promises that pertain
					 to this issue of free trade. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I listened to the member, I could not help but think
					 that the current Prime Minister would have been on the other side of the
					 barrier in Quebec City if that free trade negotiation had taken place in the
					 1980s. He would have been out there with the protestors. He would have been
					 espousing the complete opposite position that his current government is
					 presenting through Bill C-32. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we are certainly glad that the Prime Minister
					 has seen the error of his ways and recognizes that this is a global trend and
					 the direction in which countries, not only in North America but countries
					 worldwide, are headed in terms of liberalizing trade to the benefit of those
					 participating countries.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is not to say that it does not take a great deal
					 of intellect and a great deal of effort in negotiating these agreements to see
					 that they are beneficial. I will give the hon. member for Winnipeg Centre and
					 his party their due. They raise very important issues that pertain to human
					 rights, working conditions and the type of social issues that are very often
					 given short shrift in these negotiations. We do know that the multinationals
					 and companies that engage in trade are interested in the bottom line. There are
					 national state concerns that often should be addressed during these
					 negotiations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill recognizes that a Central American country,
					 like Costa Rica, is a very dynamic and developing country. This is a country
					 that arguably has led the way for that region of the world. As other members
					 have pointed out, this small country is a very interactive, democratic country.
					 It has implemented a new constitution. It has a bicameral system of parliament.
					 It has checks and balances which, in many ways, we ourselves might learn
					 from.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Former President Arias hosted the first meeting that
					 was the precursor to the North American Free Trade Agreement. The diplomatic
					 skills exercised by Costa Rican politicians are very admirable on a number of
					 levels.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of interest is the fact that Costa Rica has no military
					 budget. It has a national police force but much of its resources and much of
					 its governmental focus is on trade, which is beneficial to those countries that
					 wish to participate, as Canada will, under this new agreement.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of Central American standards, Costa Rica is
					 very much at the forefront. It has been very proactive in reaching out not only
					 to Mexico and the United States but now, through this agreement, it is looking
					 north. It is exploring new markets looking for ways in which it can export its
					 raw and manufactured materials and looking to improve the standard of living
					 and the quality of life for its citizens by enabling access to goods and
					 services to which it might not otherwise have access.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Costa Rica has a very extensive program for social
					 housing which would be of interest to many Canadians. A number of Canadian
					 construction companies have played a very active role in Costa Rica's attempt
					 to provide adequate shelter and housing for its citizens.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opportunities for both participants in this agreement
					 abound. Costa Rica has co-operated closely in the past with other countries. It
					 has exhibited the goodwill that is tantamount to a good basis of bridge
					 building when it comes to trade.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the purposes behind Bill C-32 will evolve over
					 time. Much like the commentary we hear quite often about the benefits of trade,
					 time will tell. </p>


	<A NAME="T1310"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1310"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1315"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1305"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1310)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would be quick to point out that some of the same
					 arguments that we have heard against this agreement were heard prior to 1988.
					 In fact some of the members opposite on the government side, who are now
					 wrapping their arms around the legislation, endorsing it and espousing its
					 virtues, were the same members who stood on this side of the House and berated
					 the government of Brian Mulroney and the Conservative Party of Canada for
					 taking the initiative, for spending the political capital that is sometimes
					 necessary, and for taking the risk that is sometimes necessary for the good of
					 the country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think even the most critical of individuals in
					 viewing free trade would have to admit that huge benefits have accrued to this
					 country, particularly for the people of western Canada who are very much the
					 beneficiaries of this particular practice of free trade.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-32 would implement all the negotiation that took
					 place leading up to this bill. I believe the agreement itself was signed in
					 April 2000. Miguel Angel Rodriguez, the president of Costa Rica, was here in
					 Canada signing the agreement, and the bill would put those elements into
					 effect. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is quite clear that Costa Rica's economy is growing
					 and expanding rapidly, arguably not at a rate that we would consider rapid by
					 North American standards, but it is certainly moving in a direction that will
					 help its citizens, help to improve conditions and help to improve those very
					 essential things that all humanitarians should be concerned about.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a chance for Costa Rica. This is a legitimate
					 opportunity that it hopes to seize upon. To its credit, it has been very
					 proactive in looking at other countries' economies and trying to find a way in
					 which it can be a greater participant in those economies. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The agreement itself will be two way in terms of the
					 merchandise exchanged between Canada and Costa Rica. It is interesting to note
					 that in the year 2000 the trade between our two nations rose by $269 million
					 according to figures. That was a jump of 25% over that short period of time.
					 The agreement itself would naturally accelerate that growth.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to take into account, as others have, the
					 difference in size of economy and levels of development. However I believe
					 there is a mechanism that is supposed to help integrate this trade system, this
					 difference in the size of the economy and that is that Canada will, more or
					 less, move at a more rapid rate in terms of liberalizing trade. Our economy
					 will be more open to Costa Rican products at a faster rate. The lack of tariffs
					 will be phased in in Canada over eight years, whereas in the Costa Rican
					 example it will be over fourteen years.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our borders will be open at an earlier rate allowing
					 Costa Rica to tap into the Canadian market somewhat quicker, taking into
					 account this difference in size and scale of economy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest that the overall benefit to eliminating
					 the trade barriers is to facilitate these goods and services at an accelerated
					 rate and facilitate and promote conditions of fair competition that are the
					 underpinnings of any free trade agreement. Those are set out in some detail by
					 the enactment of this bill. It would also establish a framework for further
					 bilateral, regional and multilateral co-operation to expand throughout the
					 years and create effective procedures for implementation and application of the
					 agreement.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also built into this contract, as in any contract, are
					 methods of dispute resolution and of monitoring the progress. Where disputes
					 might break out there will be a procedure that can be followed to try to
					 resolve those types of disputes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the products that will be affected in the short
					 term will include fruit, coffee, raw sugar, gold, flowers and jams, Costa Rican
					 imports that we currently see quite often on the Canadian market.</p>


	<A NAME="T1315"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1315"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1320"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1310"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1315)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trade agreement will allow those products to come
					 into Canada with ease, with fewer tariffs in the coming years, and will allow
					 those companies, because of their climate and agricultural potential, a greater
					 market and potential for growth and therefore a higher standard of living when
					 they achieve the success they badly want.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, Canada currently exports to Costa
					 Rica paper, wheat, potato products and automotive parts. When I think of
					 potatoes I will not say the solicitor general. I am obviously thinking of the
					 potato crisis Prince Edward Islanders have faced in recent years and the great
					 potential the agreement will provide for them. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They suffered through two abysmal years in terms of
					 their potato exports because of the potato wart which was blown hugely out of
					 proportion. We were virtually excluded from entering the American market. This
					 will provide a new and large market for potato products.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For provinces like Prince Edward Island I would suggest
					 that Bill C-32, which brings to effect free trade with Costa Rica, will expand
					 their potential and help island potato farmers explore this new
					 market.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I draw attention to some of the other positive elements
					 of the agreement that include building up the free trade of the Americas, which
					 links the 34 countries currently in North America that are working with South
					 America. That unfortunately is something upon which perhaps we have not focused
					 enough. The expanding markets in Central America and in all of South America is
					 the direction in which we recognize we are moving.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada has taken a much more inclusive view and can
					 play a much more active leadership role in this regard. I would suggest that
					 this step is very much reflective and representative of Canada's leadership
					 role. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada's national identity, the Canadian economy and
					 our competitiveness as a trading nation are areas of which we have to be very
					 conscious. We have to be innovative. We have to portray ourselves as a country
					 that is ready and willing to take part in this vibrant new economy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was the intent behind the original free trade
					 agreement with the United States, followed up by NAFTA. This is a natural
					 extension of the direction in which the Canadian economy is moving. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government of Canada, Canadian producers and
					 Canadian manufacturers can benefit if we go about this in an intelligent and
					 aggressive way.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About 94% of Canada's current agriculture and agri-food
					 exports to Costa Rica will get better access as a direct result of the
					 implementation of this bill. Goodness knows we need to make extraordinary
					 efforts at this time to help our farmers with the drought situation that has
					 been endured in western Canada. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout the country there have been extreme weather
					 conditions and climate turns which have grossly affected the ability of the
					 agricultural industry in Canada. Blueberry farmers in the province of Nova
					 Scotia have suffered great hardships due to the dry conditions this past
					 summer.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we sign agreements with countries like Costa Rica
					 and other South American and Central American countries, it opens up new
					 markets for our agricultural industry. Canada's exporters will gain an
					 important advantage over some of their principle competitors in Costa Rica,
					 including American, European and Asian suppliers. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, by giving Costa Ricans preferential trade
					 partners in North America we can be competitive with some of those other
					 countries that have in the past associated themselves and traded with Costa
					 Rica. Costa Ricans hopefully will be looking to Canada as opposed to some of
					 the far off European countries to which in the past there has been a propensity
					 for Costa Ricans to turn.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As with every trade agreement and contractual
					 obligation there are concerns that have to be examined and kept in mind. There
					 are shared concerns on the part of Costa Ricans and Canadians.</p>


	<A NAME="T1320"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1320"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1325"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1315"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1320)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I understand it, Costa Rica currently exports only
					 raw sugar and does not refine sugar within its own boundaries. In the event
					 that Costa Rica as a result of the trade agreement starts to construct
					 refineries and export refined sugar, Canadian sugar producers would have real
					 concern. They have expressed concern already. I know that the member for Saint
					 John has long been a proponent of protecting and assisting the sugar refining
					 industry in her province of New Brunswick. This is one issue that has been
					 raised by sugar producers in Canada as a direct upshot of the proposed
					 agreement. Costa Rica is also a labour intensive country. Having just said that
					 there may be benefits to the increased open market for potato farmers, I will
					 note that some producers have raised concerns about the impact on frozen
					 potatoes exported to Costa Rica from Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are a just couple of industry related concerns
					 that have been raised by Canadians who would be impacted directly by Bill
					 C-32.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada has an obligation to enter into these agreements
					 in good faith and to maintain good bilateral relations with our other
					 significant trading partners. At the same time we have to diversify the market
					 and seek additional international trade agreements. That is exactly what the
					 bill would do.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The direction in which we are headed is very much one
					 the Progressive Conservative/Democratic Representative Caucus Coalition
					 supports. It has been our consistent position in doing so that Canada must play
					 a leading and aggressive role at a time when countries are re-examining their
					 relations with other countries vis-à-vis trade and security and on any number
					 of levels. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To that end there is implicit in all our efforts an
					 emphasis on the responsibility of government to proceed with caution but also,
					 I would suggest, with some degree of aggression when looking for new markets to
					 bolster the Canadian economy to ensure that we are competitive and innovative
					 in a very competitive global time.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We support the initiative. We support the direction of
					 Bill C-32 and similar types of agreements. It is imperative as well that we in
					 the Parliament of Canada have an opportunity to have our say and to have input.
					 We must look at the bill at the committee level. We must hear from witnesses
					 who have specific information about the countries in question, the pros and
					 cons of the agreement, the benefits and the contractual obligations that will
					 flow from it. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On balance we feel it is good legislation that is
					 consistent with the direction in which Canada is headed. We feel it would help
					 Canadian producers engage in free markets and it would raise access to products
					 by lowering tariffs. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To that end and for those reasons set out, the
					 coalition will be supporting the legislation. We look forward to its
					 implementation. We hope to see the government play a leadership role in its new
					 and, I would submit, post-1993 support of free trade agreements.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the type of legislation Canada needs if it is
					 to be a global competitor in the 21st century.</p>

					 Centre, BQ): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak to Bill S-14, to
					 establish a national holiday in honour of Sir John A. Macdonald and Sir Wilfrid
					 Laurier.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision to establish a national holiday in honour
					 of a parliamentarian or any other person may seem unimportant to some people,
					 but not to the Bloc Quebecois.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bill aims to pay tribute to the very first Prime
					 Minister of Canada, Sir John A. Macdonald, as well as to the first Prime
					 Minister from Quebec, Sir Wilfrid Laurier. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John A. Macdonald worked relentlessly for an extremely
					 centralized federation in Canada, while Sir Wilfrid Laurier fought very hard to
					 protect Canadian unity, at the expense of the progress of his own
					 people.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bill would give Canadians the opportunity to
					 reflect on the history of their country and to be proud of the contribution of
					 these two men to Canada and to all of its communities. Do members really think
					 that the people of Quebec will feel like celebrating on such a day? I do not
					 think so.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the minds of Quebecers, John A. Macdonald wanted to
					 give the impression he was negotiating the terms of federation with Taché and
					 Cartier. Later on, some would go as far as to talk about a confederal treaty
					 when talking about the so-called consensus that is supposed to have taken place
					 before the British North America Act was passed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It bears reminding that when Lower Canada joined Canada
					 in 1867, it was by a very slight majority, 24 against 22. Needless to say we
					 are talking about parliamentarians who were duly mandated to speak on behalf of
					 the people, but the people were not consulted. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the British North America Act is drafted in
					 such a way that instead it envisions a very centralized state made up of
					 provinces—which is a far cry, you will admit, from the concept of sovereign
					 states—without in fact the exclusive authority to pass and implement laws
					 without interference from the central government. This historical ambiguity
					 regarding the creation of a Canadian federation or Canadian confederation could
					 only lead to numerous problems later on, both for Canada and Quebec.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lower Canada displayed a lukewarm interest in what some
					 mistakenly called a confederal treaty but was in fact a constitutional soup by
					 chef John A. Macdonald, seasoned with a unitary, centralized and centralizing
					 federal regime.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Sir Wilfrid Laurier, he indeed worked very hard
					 to unite the Canadian federation. His 15 year government was marked by a lot of
					 tension: on the one side, French Canadians, who were afraid of being
					 assimilated, and rightly so; on the other, English Canadians, who wanted to
					 have closer ties to the British Empire. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir Wilfrid Laurier governed Canada by trying to find a
					 middle ground and keep the country together. Today, the current government's
					 approach, true to Wilfrid Laurier's ideal, espouses the strategy of Pierre
					 Elliott Trudeau, who wrote that of the ways of making separatism less appealing
					 is to spend time, energy and a lot of money to promote federal nationalism.
					 Such is the goal of Bill S-14.</p>


	<A NAME="T1335"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1335"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1340"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1330"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1335)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The establishment of holidays to celebrate John A.
					 Macdonald and Sir Wilfrid Laurier is part of that strategy. All Quebecers know
					 that the federal government does not hesitate to spend millions of dollars in
					 public funds to promote the Canadian identity. And what about the virtual
					 monopoly of federalist forces on the media? </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his book <i>Le déclin du fédéralisme canadien</i>,
					 Joseph Facal, the Quebec minister for relations with the citizens and
					 immigration, minister of Canadian intergovernmental affairs, and minister for
					 relations with French-speaking and Acadian communities, wrote this:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>The federal government takes a subtle
						  and seemingly generous attitude when it professes to recognize the different
						  identities, the Quebec identity included. What it refuses to this particular
						  identity is its full access to a collective, institutional and political
						  expression. This can be seen in the incapacity of the Canadian constitutional
						  order to recognize the fact that Quebec is a nation, in its refusal to
						  institutionalize its definition of Quebec's specific character, and its
						  untiring efforts to control Quebec's international relations. </small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1867, Quebec has been held back because of the
					 numerous barriers the federal government has put up. All of this stifles the
					 social, cultural and economic development of the Quebec people.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amongst all the days celebrated in Canada, whether
					 national or international days, only one commemorates a person. And, would you
					 have guessed, it is Queen Victoria. No other person is honoured in such a way.
					 Previous parliaments may have recognized that in cases like this, and many
					 others, discretion is usually the better part of valour.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many ways to commemorate the role that men
					 and women have played in politics: streets, parks, cities, government
					 buildings, ports, airports, statues, highways, aircraft carriers, ice-breakers,
					 stamps, libraries, sportsplexes and what not. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A national day that is not representative of a wide
					 consensus is a moot one and it can easily be considered as arrogant.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I call upon the common sense of all parliamentarians.
					 They should vote against Bill S-14 to prevent a precedent that could create
					 pointless tensions. If we create a day for John A. Macdonald and a day for Sir
					 Wilfrid Laurier now, when will we create one for the prime minister who is
					 responsible for free trade? When will we create one for the prime minister who
					 unilaterally patriated the Constitution? When will we create one for the prime
					 minister who stayed in office the longest? The answer is obvious. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find it extremely dangerous for Canada to start
					 commemorating everything. It is clear that the Bloc Quebecois will vote against
					 this bill. I hope there still are sensible people in this parliament.
					 </p>

					 Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I was born on a small tropical island,
					 then a British colony, located on the other side of the world. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like hundreds of thousands before and after me, I came
					 to Canada to find peace and stability for myself and for my children. Canada is
					 my country, and I feel deeply attached to it. I am most grateful for the spirit
					 of openness, tolerance and generosity that I have always found here.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why I am truly honoured to pay tribute to two
					 men who played a most important role in our history, Sir John A. Macdonald and
					 Sir Wilfrid Laurier. Indeed, it is no doubt to these two statesmen and prime
					 ministers that we owe the values that have characterized Canada since its
					 founding and that have made Canada a country that respects others and is
					 peaceful, a country that is open to the world and most welcoming, a democratic
					 country where individual rights and freedoms are truly promoted and defended.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When thinking about Macdonald and Laurier and the
					 enormous political and socio-cultural heritage they have left us, differences
					 in parties, language or origin become blurred. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One was a Conservative; the other was a Liberal. One
					 was of Scottish origin, therefore anglophone; the other was French Canadian.
					 Macdonald was a Protestant; Laurier was a Catholic. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were from different origins and different
					 backgrounds. Yet, they were united by something that was far more important
					 than their differences, that is their vision and their faith in this new
					 country that they were about to create and shape for the future. </p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of Macdonald's and Laurier's contribution to
					 the building of Canada and the values it represents is so immense that it
					 dwarfs the differences of party, of cultural origin and of religion and makes
					 those seem trifling. It also dwarfs the many missteps along the way for indeed
					 there were missteps, as there must always be when building a country and
					 running governments.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Builders, creators and visionaries all saw in the
					 vastness of this beautiful land not only new horizons to reach but a new type
					 of country where the two founding cultures and languages could not only coexist
					 but flourish, where the broad expanses and spaces could welcome settlers and
					 new citizens from elsewhere to a life, in the words of Laurier himself, of
					 “peace, harmony and prosperity”. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The challenge of joining one coast of this immense land
					 mass to the other by building a railway was in itself a gigantic undertaking
					 and feat, especially given the context and conditions of the day. If that was a
					 gigantic undertaking and feat, how even more remarkable was the founding of a
					 new and bilingual country open to others and dedicated to democracy, to freedom
					 and to diversity.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we view statistics and comparisons, we see that
					 Canada remains a modest contender in the bigness stakes. We have a
					 comparatively small population. Our economy is dwarfed by several others. Our
					 military power is very limited. If countries were to be judged by population,
					 their GNP size, or the might of their military arsenal, Canada would be a very
					 moderate success.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The country Macdonald and Laurier sought to build was
					 not a powerful one in the quantitative sense but a new type of country, one of
					 ideals and values that would transcend statistics and numbers. What they have
					 left us beyond infrastructures and material achievements and prosperity,
					 important and impressive as those are, is an infinitely more precious legacy.
					 In the words of Sir Wilfrid Laurier himself: “It is to our glory that hatreds
					 have ended on Canadian soil. There is no longer any family here but the human
					 family. It matters not what language the people speak or at which altars they
					 kneel. There is glory in this fraternity of which Canada can never be proud
					 enough. Mighty nations indeed may well come to us to seek a lesson in justice
					 and humanity”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, their legacy is above all that of our enduring
					 democracy, cherishing its core values of peace and peaceful assembly, of
					 individual freedoms and respect for others and their differences, of openness
					 and generosity to others less fortunate than ourselves.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it is for the lasting achievement of these values
					 and ideals which have marked the building and evolution of Canada that I feel
					 privileged to honour Sir John A. Macdonald and Sir Wilfrid Laurier today. It is
					 with pride and conviction that I join Senator John Lynch-Staunton and my
					 colleague from Don Valley West and so many other colleagues from all sides of
					 the House and Senate in supporting Bill S-14 and wishing it Godspeed. I pray
					 that we find a large majority here to support the bill and make it a
					 statute.</p>

					 Canadian Alliance): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, Bill S-8 would set aside two days, January
					 8 and November 20, as national memorial days, but not actually statutory
					 holidays, in honour of arguably the two greatest prime ministers of this
					 country, Sir John A. Macdonald and Sir Wilfrid Laurier.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In making these two days memorial or remembrance days
					 we are giving them a status similar to the status given to Remembrance Day,
					 November 11, for example, as opposed to Canada Day, which is of course a day on
					 which work ought not to be performed. There is a distinction there that I think
					 is important.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bill is significant for its symbolic value and for
					 what it says about what we think about these two figures and therefore what we
					 think about ourselves. It is a sense of our own picture of our history. In our
					 view of our own history, in our national mythology, we are in fact building our
					 image of ourselves and our attitudes towards the world.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a question of particular interest to me. In my
					 private life I am a Ph.D. candidate in history at Carleton University, working
					 on a doctoral dissertation on evolving Canadian attitudes toward the monarchy.
					 I see some parallels in the studies I have done on evolving Canadian attitudes
					 toward the monarchy and the kinds of evolving attitudes we have had over time
					 toward our historical figures, including of course the great Sir John A. and
					 the great Sir Wilfrid.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just to draw out the analogy a bit, the monarchy in the
					 eyes of a man like Maurice Duplessis, and in his words at the time of the world
					 visit of 1939, was dramatically different from the status of the monarchy in
					 the eyes of the Quebec nationalists who greeted Queen Elizabeth when she
					 visited Montreal about 30 years later in 1964. This was because the perceptions
					 of the world had changed. The symbolic value that was given to the monarchy and
					 to the visiting monarch had changed over that period of time.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same thing of course can be said of our views
					 toward Sir John A. and Sir Wilfrid Laurier. Keeping this thought in mind, the
					 most striking thing to be said is the very fact that we have never previously
					 set aside the birthdates of either of these two men as national memorial days.
					 That in itself says a great deal about our attitudes, not only toward them but
					 toward ourselves and our own history. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think there are probably two reasons why this is the
					 case. First, until recently Sir John A. and Sir Wilfrid to some degree were
					 seen as partisan figures, in much the same way that in the decades following
					 their deaths Abraham Lincoln or Thomas Jefferson were seen respectively as
					 being a northern republican and a symbol of division rather than of unity, and
					 a southern agrarian democrat and perhaps also a symbol of division rather than
					 unity. Later on as the partisan considerations faded, their overarching
					 greatness was recognized and they were properly memorialized and honoured. Of
					 course in the case of Jefferson, no holiday has been set aside for his birthday
					 but there is a beautiful monument in Washington, and of course everybody knows
					 about the Lincoln monument. I think there is still a little bit of this element
					 with Sir John A. and Sir Wilfrid. Of course they died much more recently than
					 either Lincoln or Jefferson.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A predecessor bill to this one, honouring only Sir John
					 A., was introduced in the last parliament by my hon. colleague from Calgary
					 Southeast . There was some discussion at the time as to whether it was
					 appropriate to honour a representative of the Conservative stream in Canada
					 without similarly honouring a representative of the Liberal stream. I would
					 suggest that this is perhaps an indication that we have not yet matured in our
					 views toward these two men. I would suggest that while it is entirely
					 appropriate to honour Sir Wilfrid, and I am glad that he is being honoured
					 here, it is appropriate not because he was a Liberal and Sir John A. was a
					 Conservative. It is appropriate because they were both men of extraordinary
					 vision.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason that I think we failed in the past to
					 honour these two men is that for decades we saw ourselves, our Canadian
					 identity, as being subservient to another identity. It seems pretty clear that
					 we saw ourselves as being primarily British for at least the first half century
					 of Canada's history as a confederated country.</p>


	<A NAME="T1350"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1350"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1355"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1345"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1350)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great holiday of the 1920s and 1930s that went on
					 and did not vanish in Ontario until the 1960s was Empire Day, later
					 Commonwealth Day. That was a celebration of our perceived Britishness. That of
					 course has diminished over time. As the diminution of that particular identity
					 has taken place, it has seemed more appropriate to honour clearly and primarily
					 Canadian figures.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we memorialize and mythologize these men, it seems
					 to me it is appropriate that we recognize them not only for the way in which
					 they governed us during their lifetimes, and if one gets into the details of
					 how they governed us, of course they governed in this place, with its
					 adversarial politics and its partisanship, with a fair bit of what could be
					 called sausage making. As one tries to produce laws, there is a bit that is
					 perhaps not all that attractive. I do not think we are memorializing them for
					 that. I think we are memorializing them for some over-arching values they
					 represent.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest that there are five overarching values which
					 each of these two men represent and which we ought to make reference to as we
					 proceed to honour them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, both men were clearly reconcilers of competing
					 interests, competing ideologies and competing regions. This is evident in the
					 fact that both men were able to cobble together out of the extraordinarily
					 diverse Canadian political landscape two remarkably effective and long-lasting
					 coalitions. Sir John A. Macdonald was able to govern for 19 years and Sir
					 Wilfrid Laurier from 1896 to 1911 in an unbroken streak that has never been
					 matched.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were able to obtain representation from all
					 regions of the country. They were able to represent the two great competing
					 religious bases that at the time represented a great division within Canadian
					 politics, to represent both linguistic groups in the country, to represent both
					 longstanding Canadian interests and more recent arrivals to Canada. They were
					 extraordinarily effective in that. That clearly is a primary value in the
					 politics of a diverse country like Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, we should honour them as parliamentarians and
					 for their profound respect for this institution.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course Sir John A. Macdonald was eminent in actually
					 creating this institution in its present form out of its predecessor, the
					 parliament of the province of Canada. Sir Wilfrid Laurier was known for, among
					 other things, his encyclopaedic knowledge of parliamentary rules of procedure
					 and precedent and for his ability to converse fluently in these matters in both
					 languages.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, we should recognize them as
					 constitutionalists.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir John A. Macdonald's greatest accomplishment perhaps
					 was that he was able to create for the first time anywhere in the world a
					 constitution that combined the unwritten constitutional foundation of the
					 British system and the written constitutionalism, and indeed federation, of the
					 American model. This is a model that has been achieved with remarkable success
					 in Canada and later on was emulated in Australia. It is indeed an absolutely
					 extraordinary accomplishment that should make all of us very proud or at least
					 very grateful to him.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, we should honour them as
					 federalists.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is interesting to note that in 1867, Sir John A.
					 Macdonald really in his heart of hearts would have favoured what was referred
					 to in those days as a legislative union, which meant of course a unitary state.
					 At that time, Sir Wilfrid Laurier, who was of course a young man in private
					 life, was actually a separatist. He would have liked to have taken Quebec out
					 of Canada and worked on some new deal. He spoke quite strongly against the new
					 arrangement in his newspaper at the time. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But through the union of the centripetal forces
					 personified in Sir John A. Macdonald and the centrifugal decentralist forces
					 personified in Sir Wilfrid Laurier, we have in fact achieved a model of
					 federalism which, despite perhaps some maladministration in the intervening
					 century, has functioned remarkably well. It has remained generally and
					 genuinely federal to a greater extent than many other federations, indeed most
					 other nominal federations around the world.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifth and last, I think we should honour both these men
					 as extraordinary visionaries.</p>


	<A NAME="T1355"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1355"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1400"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1350"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1355)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course the vision of Sir John A. was confederation
					 itself. Sir Wilfrid Laurier is known best of all for his comment that the 20th
					 century would belong to Canada, perhaps not in the sense that Canada would be
					 the dominant world power, but in the sense that Canada would provide an
					 extraordinary vision which so many other countries around the world could
					 emulate.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I do very much support the bill. I hope
					 other parliamentarians will do the same.</p>

					 Laurier were singled out. We should take special measures to honour and respect
					 the enormous contributions that these two leaders have made to our country.
					 There is an irony here as well. As we see the Liberal government honour Sir A.
					 Macdonald for the great things that he did in cobbling together a federation, a
					 very bold move, we see this particular Liberal government taking deliberate
					 steps to dismantle the whole idea of a strong central government. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The very vision of Sir John A. Macdonald which we seek
					 to recognize, the Liberals are taking active steps to dismantle, that very same
					 strong central confederation. It is worth noting what an achievement it was to
					 pull together a confederation and to make the conscious choice to form a
					 federation rather than a single state. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Federations are the hardest form of government in the
					 world to keep together. Of all the world's countries, I believe less than 20
					 are federations for that very reason. It is very difficult to pacify all the
					 competing interests and the regionalism that goes together. Of those 20
					 federations in the world, India is the most populous. The United States is
					 probably the most powerful and wealthiest. Even the United States only lasted
					 75 years before bursting into a bloody civil war.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of those 20 federal states in the world, three in
					 recent times have either disappeared or are at risk. I refer to the Soviet
					 Union and Yugoslavia, and Canada which is just hanging on by a thread. It is a
					 very tenuous form of government. It is very difficult to keep a federation
					 together. Sir John A. Macdonald to his credit pulled it together. It is a bit
					 ironic to see the government, or individual members of the Liberal government,
					 promoting a day to honour the founder of confederation when they themselves are
					 actively taking steps to weaken the whole concept of a strong central state
					 through the devolution of power to the provinces and a diminishing role for the
					 federal government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should recognize Sir Wilfrid Laurier. Again, I do
					 not believe in a memorial day but we should recognize the enormous contribution
					 that he made to basic democracy. He is the man who gave us the secret ballot
					 vote. That is significant. Something we take for granted as always being there
					 was not always there until someone like Sir Wilfrid Laurier came along and said
					 that in the interests of fairness, in the interests of true democracy, this is
					 the way we are going to do things.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I refer to the public schools act. With true vision Sir
					 Wilfrid Laurier and his government decided that school should be free of charge
					 until grade 12, and that financial status should not be a barrier because that
					 is what people need to take part in the workforce today.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, it is ironic to see the government seeking to
					 honour the founder of the public school system with a memorial day when it
					 itself is taking active steps to preclude the participation in post-secondary
					 education. If anything, if the government wanted to dedicate a couple of hours
					 of debate in the House of Commons, we should be debating the concept of
					 extending the public schools act to include the first university degree. There
					 should be free tuition for the first university degree. That would be worthy of
					 debate in the House instead of a token gesture to memorialize Sir Wilfrid
					 Laurier by a memorial day.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another of Sir Wilfrid Laurier's achievements we should
					 make note of is immigration, building the west. The member who spoke previously
					 mentioned Sir Wilfrid Laurier was in government from 1896 to 1911, 15 years
					 uninterrupted.</p>


	<A NAME="T1400"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1400"><!-- Hour: 2--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1405"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1355"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1400)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During that period of time Manitoba grew about by 300%.
					 In my home province of Manitoba there were waves of immigration. It took real
					 foresight and real vision to open our borders and invite the world to come and
					 help us build a great nation. That took real, inspired vision. I recognize that
					 and I have a great deal of respect for it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I am outlining these things, more come to mind.
					 There is another irony associated with this in that one of the greatest
					 achievements of Sir John A. Macdonald was building the national railway. The
					 single greatest achievement of that century, perhaps, in terms of building this
					 nation was our national railway, the great dream. Here we have members of the
					 Liberal government opposite proposing to honour Sir John A. Macdonald, the
					 architect of that dream, when they themselves are again taking active steps to
					 dismantle the national dream of a continuous rail line from east to west. For
					 years we have been criticizing the dismantling of our rail system. For all the
					 environmental reasons and economic reasons we should be encouraging rail
					 transportation in this country, accentuating it and adding to it, not tearing
					 up the tracks. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot help but comment on the irony associated with
					 that. The Liberals seek to honour the memory of Sir John A. Macdonald with a
					 memorial day when the very things that Sir John A. Macdonald dedicated his life
					 to building in this country they themselves are dismantling piece by
					 piece.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot support the bill. I know it is a private
					 member's bill and so my party members will be voting their own conscience. I am
					 not speaking for my caucus, but I myself support the remarks from the member
					 for Laval Centre, that we do not think it is appropriate to start dedicating
					 memorial days to the memory of prime ministers, no matter how great their
					 contribution to building this country. I will not be supporting Bill
					 S-14.</p>

					 (Pictou--Antigonish--Guysborough, PC/DR): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased on behalf of the
					 coalition, on behalf of the Progressive Conservative Party, to rise in support
					 of this initiative, private member's bill, Bill S-14, which I think is
					 significant as well as timely and is one that I almost feel very humbled by
					 when speaking of these two individuals in the political context.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, as you would know, this bill came from the
					 other place. I want to congratulate and commend the hon. senators, particularly
					 John Lynch-Staunton of the other place for bringing this matter forward, as
					 well as the hon. member for Don Valley West for his sponsorship here in the
					 House of Commons. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a worthwhile initiative. In the spirit that it
					 encompasses these two great men it has a bipartisan element to it and it
					 honours two men who played a huge, fundamental role in founding our country.
					 How fitting, how national, how correct and how positively politically correct
					 that we should bring forward a bill in the names of Laurier and Macdonald, and
					 how necessary at a time when our nation is casting its eyes inward and looking
					 for symbols of identity and the symbols with which we define ourselves in
					 troubled times.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleagues and I are extremely supportive and we are
					 extremely pleased to see that the bill has made it to this point.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We already know that Sir John A. Macdonald and Sir
					 Wilfrid Laurier have very much galvanized their place in history, their figures
					 cast in bronze around these historic buildings. Yet I feel that this initiative
					 would very much allow us to set aside two days of recognition, two days on
					 which all Canadians could pause and reflect upon the contributions of these men
					 in a truly Canadian way. This is an important recognition of men who displayed
					 great vision, political passion and perseverance at a time when our nation was
					 in its infancy. </p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a time when some people suspect that Canadians have
					 become isolated and have turned away from their history, I believe this bill
					 may help Canadians to rediscover the origins of this great country, as well as
					 the two men who helped to shape Canada into the country we know today.

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through Bill S-14 we are not honouring a Tory or a
					 Liberal. This is not about partisanship, which so often takes precedence in
					 this place. We are simply honouring two great Canadians who represent the two
					 dominant languages, cultures and religions of their day. One was a founding
					 father and the other was an equal contributor as the first francophone to lead
					 the country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill S-14 does not call for a national holiday, only to
					 recognize their two birthdays.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, perhaps the Bloc member does not

	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I was saying, Bill S-14 does not just set aside time
					 for a national holiday. This is not about expanding time off for schools or
					 businesses. This is very much about recognizing in a formal way the birthdays
					 of two great Canadians, Sir John. A. Macdonald and Sir Wilfrid Laurier, the
					 birthdate being January 11 in the case of Sir John A. Macdonald.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an interesting footnote, the birth records of Sir
						John A. Macdonald, who was born in Scotland, indicate that he was born on
						January 10. When he and his family emigrated to Canada his father, Hugh,
						recorded his birthdate as January 11, so there was some dispute. On the other
						hand, I suppose the record keepers are more precise in the province of Quebec
						and they indicate quite clearly that November 20 was the day on which Sir
						Wilfrid Laurier came into the world naked and screaming and, from that point
						on, went on to become one the country's leading francophone
						politicians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bill to honour Sir John A. Macdonald and Sir
						  Wilfrid Laurier arguably sets aside time to reflect on two of Canada's most
						  important politicians and certainly prime ministers. Sir John A. Macdonald was
						  obviously the prime minister during Confederation. In 1867 he led the country
						  into a new federal state. Though he was defeated in 1873, he was re-elected
						  four times subsequent to that: in 1878, 1882, 1887 and again in 1891. He was
						  elected five times as prime minister of the country. He died in office in June
						  1891. More than any single individual in our entire country's history, we have
						  to give him credit for bringing this great nation together. His efforts and
						  leadership created the country, gave birth to a nation. One cannot emphasize
						  enough the magnitude and the majesty of that accomplishment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What accomplishment can compare in any way to
							 what Sir John A. really did? It was a tremendous act of will to bring together
							 this vast, diverse and enormous land. He united the country not only through
							 his political efforts but arguably he united the country physically, through
							 the construction of the railway, and philosophically, by having like-minded
							 people pull in the same direction. Through his long range vision, foresight,
							 perseverance and certainly unquestionable inner fortitude, Sir John A. is very
							 worthy of the bill that is before us.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His professional life included his time as a
								lawyer and a businessman. He worked in a bank and entered politics as an
								alderman for Kingston, Ontario. He died, as I mentioned, on June 6, 1891, while
								still in office and is buried in the Cataraqui cemetery near Kingston,
								Ontario.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His party, quite apropos and relevant in
								today's political environment, was one of the liberal Conservatives. One can
								imagine how incongruous. In the current context, it was a coalition that he
								led. He was the party leader from 1867 to 1891 and was able to bring together
								like-minded Conservatives with a social conscience.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He represented the constituencies of Kingston
								and Victoria, British Columbia. Many Canadians are probably not aware that Sir
								John A. represented the constituency of Victoria from 1878 to 1882 and then
								returned to Ontario between 1882 and 1887 to represent Carleton, Ontario. His
								ministries included receiver general, militia affairs, justice, attorney
								general for Canada, minister of the interior, superintendent general of Indian
								affairs, railways and canals. He obviously had a diverse interest that he
								brought to public life.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to touch for a moment on Sir Wilfrid
								Laurier and his accomplishments. He was the seventh prime minister of the
								country serving from 1896 to 1911. He was the first elected French Canadian
								prime minister. He drafted John Abbott, who became the first prime minister
								from Quebec, into the job. When he left after one year, Mr. Laurier, who was
								seen by many as a young radical, and by some standards today may have been
								called a separatist, came into an age of wisdom and became the first elected
								prime minister from Quebec.</p>


	<A NAME="T1410"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1410"><!-- Hour: 2--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1415"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1405"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1410)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was key to promoting national unity from
								that moment onward, and like Sir John A., came from a professional life of the
								practice of law. He was called to the bar in eastern Canada in 1864. He was the
								editor of a paper and an ensign in the Arthabaskaville Infantry. He served as
								an MLA in the provincial legislature of Quebec. He died in February of 1919 in
								Ottawa and was buried at the Notre Dame Cemetery.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His political record, like Sir John A.'s, is
								  stellar and is one that displays an incredible ability and degree of
								  leadership. Although Macdonald was a Conservative and Laurier a Liberal and
								  they were opponents in and out of the House, they had a common belief in a
								  strong and united country where everyone, regardless of religion, race or
								  language lived and worked for the benefit of one nation. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout our remarks we have avoided the
									 degree of partisanship that sometimes slips in. It is an effort for us to ban
									 together to present a bill that would benefit Canadians in the sense that they
									 could recognize, in an official way, the history and the cohesiveness that
									 these two men represent to us. I encourage all members to support this
									 important initiative.</p>
