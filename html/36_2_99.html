</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Irwin Cotler (Mount Royal, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am rising 
to pay tribute to the memory and the accomplishments of the 
honourable Mr. Justice Jules Deschênes, one of the great jurists 
of our time.  His life “in the line of fire”, as the title of 
his autobiography describes it, encompassed six distinct 
careers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was law professor, renowned legal expert, author of high 
profile decisions as Chief Justice of the Quebec Superior Court, 
head of the Commission of Inquiry on War Criminals, 
international jurist par excellence, and head of various NGOs, 
both Canadian and international. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motivated as he was by a passion for justice and the courage of 
his convictions, most of his life was indeed lived “in the line 
of fire”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>May his memory and his great merit be a source of inspiration to 
us all.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, $300 million is what farmers would 
save each year if we had a commercial grain handling system.  Yet 
last week the Liberals announced a plan that will continue to 
control and restrict Canadian farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In their news release the Liberals admit that moving the 
Canadian Wheat Board out of grain transportation would save 
farmers money.  Why is the government only cutting the board's 
involvement in grain transportation by 25%?  This action proves 
that the government is more concerned about the Canadian Wheat 
Board's monopoly than cutting costs for farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed changes to the grain handling system will do 
nothing to address the congestion of rail cars at the ports. 
This costs farmers millions each year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The plan to put $175 million into prairie roads over five years 
is also a farce.  That works out to about $12 million per 
province per year.  That is enough to rebuild about 50 kilometres 
of secondary roads. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of deregulation, farmers have a system that continues to 
take money out of their pockets.  It is evident the government 
does not want to give farmers the freedom they deserve.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, on 
Sunday I participated in a memorial service for victims of ethnic 
violence in Indonesia.  The struggle for human rights is as 
ancient as recorded civilization.  From time to time, however, we 
should note signposts of progress. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Three years ago there was a flare up of ethnic violence directed 
against people of Chinese origin.  It was vicious and brutal and 
the Government of Indonesia did very little to prevent the 
outbreak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Representatives of Canadians Concerned about Ethnic Violence in 
Indonesia asked me and other members for support in their 
struggle.  I am pleased to say that the Secretary of State for 
Asia-Pacific, the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration and the 
Government of Canada were very responsive to concerns raised by 
CCEVI. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Secretary of State for Asia-Pacific, through the minister, 
was able to confront the evil and change things to support the 
government of President Wahid.  Needless to say, it is far from 
over, but President Wahid is deleting references to ethnicity in 
laws and Chinese people have felt free to celebrate their new 
year for the first time in many years.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For 10 years the Burmese military has refused to accept the 
result and continues to rule without respecting the will of the 
Burmese people.  Last year more than 1,000 political activists 
were sent to prison.  In March of this year 55 members of 
parliament were incarcerated.  Tragically, five MPs have died 
while in detention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge my hon. colleagues to sign a declaration showing Canadian 
parliamentary solidarity for our Burmese counterparts.  This 
declaration will be sent to the offices of every member and every 
senator.  I strongly feel that this show of support will help 
bolster the resolve of persecuted Burmese politicians.  It will 
also pressure the military regime into accepting the democratic 
result of a decade ago.

the City of Hull received some good news about the Laramée 
Boulevard construction project and full completion of the 
McConnell-Laramée axial highway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This project will be carried out with the financial 
participation of Transports Québec and Transport Canada.  It 
consists in the construction of a four-lane boulevard, with a 
speed limit of 50 km/hr for heavy truck traffic in the 
residential area.  The boulevard will have European-style traffic 
circles and another traffic circle will be built at the corner 
of Montcalm and St-Joseph. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is excellent news, not only for the cities of Hull and 
Aylmer, but also for the overall economic development of the 
Outaouais region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to take this opportunity to point out that Canadian 
federalism is an effective way of ensuring the economic 
development of our regions.  This project, in fact, will require 
the financial participation of both governments.  The 
governments of Quebec and of Canada will provide equal funding 
for the project, whose cost is estimated at $35 million.

who made this championship so successful and memorable.  I would 
also like to congratulate the parents and families who supported 
the team on the road to victory.  They should all be very proud

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Grierson Centre should be the happiest little jail in Canada.  It 
isn't.  Instead, it is plagued with low staff morale, lack of 
trust and respect, gossip and rumour, in-fighting and petty 
disagreements, lack of job satisfaction and a developing syndrome 
of hopelessness and helplessness. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It spoke of the management style as autocratic, motivated by 
fear, intimidation, threats of punitive action and manipulation. 
The most appalling statement was that the staff is being watched 
by surveillance video cameras and listened to with bugging 
equipment by management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For once Correctional Service Canada got a lot for its money 
because this report could be applicable to any institution in

<P><A NAME="LINK25"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, there 
are far too many Canadians in desperate need of organ transplants 
and far too few organs being made available to meet that need. 
Due to the unavailability of organs for transplant, the wait for 
a needed transplant is excessively long and results in long 
periods of suffering and a compromised recovery for transplant 
recipients. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a limited time window for the taking of organs for 
transplant and many grieving families are unable to cope with the 
decision of organ donation at the time of the death of their 
loved one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An increased availability of organs for transplant would result 
in a decreased burden on the health care system by decreasing a 
need for dialysis or specialized medication and shortening the 
length of hospitalization both pre and post transplant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The critical shortage of organ donations in Canada as well as 
the safety system for organ transplantation demand immediate 
action and decisive leadership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government needs to set forth a plan for establishing a 
national donor registry along with the financial commitment to 
support hospital based donor teams and strong measures to ensure 
the safety of organs and tissues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take charge of our future and make Canada a world leader 
in organ donation and transplantation.

recently members of Branch 10 of the Royal Canadian Legion in my 
riding developed a resolution to make the veterans' independence 
program more accessible to veterans.  The motion proposes to 
increase the cut-off threshold from approximately $17,000 of 
income to $25,000, more in line with the poverty level for Canada 
and only reasonable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion was moved by Mr. Harold Ettinger and seconded by Mr. 
George Evans.  It was signed branch president Peter Lind and 
branch secretary Virginia Chandler, and has the support of zone 
commander Les Nash.

Higgens who served in many positions in the Legion and is himself 
a veteran who works tirelessly for veterans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My office has forwarded the information about this resolution to 
over 1000 branches of the Royal Canadian Legion across the 
country asking them to support the motion at the upcoming 
Dominion Command meeting in Halifax.  If it is passed, thousands 
of veterans will have their lives improved at a small cost to the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian

mismanagement and bungling is collecting sensitive information on 
33 million Canadians.  Tax and employment information, travel 
details, immigration and ethnicity details, information on 
families, disabilities, moving patterns and education are now 
under the control of the biggest bungler in this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the government think that it needs to— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  I would prefer if we called

<P><A NAME="LINK33"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development,

scare Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at what the privacy commissioner actually did say 
about the department, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I don't question that they had, and they have, good reasons for 
doing this and that it is useful information in terms of 
improving the quality of their programs.  I am not suggesting 
either that they've done anything unlawful here.  They are 
complying with the strict letter of the law.... 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The commissioner goes on to note “the very responsible 
management that this file is getting right now”. 
<P><A NAME="LINK34"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>   Mr. Speaker, let us look at some irresponsible 
management.  I have just uncovered another internal audit on the 
assessment of information technology security which was brought 
forward in September 1999.  It is about information technology. 
The audit states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since few people know of the existence of the IT security 
policies and procedures, personnel knowledge of IT security 
standards and practices needs improvement. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the minister's own department.  Could she stand up and 
defend the fact that her own department does not even need to 
know what it is doing in terms of information technology 
security? 
<P><A NAME="LINK35"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, what I will stand up and defend is the 
fact that my department does internal audits and that these 
audits are very useful tools in helping us to continuously 
improve the operation of the programs in my department. Is she 
suggesting that we should not be looking at ourselves or that we 
should not be challenging ourselves to get better?  Is that what 
the hon. member would like? 
<P><A NAME="LINK36"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  No. Mr. Speaker.  What we would like is for the 
department to do the job that it was hired to do and not be so 
involved with political manipulation from the top.  The minister 
needs to come forward with ministerial responsibility and 
accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will again quote from the document: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Additionally, hard copies of IT security-related documents are 
regularly distributed to HRDC personnel, however, their knowledge 
level of IT security policies and procedures is not good. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Either this minister takes responsibility or she does not.  Will 
she stand in her place today and say that things are a mess under 
her watch? 
<P><A NAME="LINK37"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development,

that I do take my job responsibly.  If nothing else, the last 
five months in this House prove that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to remind the hon. member again that it is a department 
that is continuously looking at itself, using audits to identify 
areas where we can make improvements and it is a department that 
makes changes to improve the services that we provide to 
Canadians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK38"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Canadian

who has the most private information about each and every one of 
us says that we need to make improvements in the security 
arrangements with which we handle this information.  This is our 
life.  This is information about every single Canadian and the 
minister— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the minister's own 
departmental audits talk about inconsistent security measures and 
security risks not being appropriately addressed.  We have a 
minister that cannot keep personal information secure.  Why is 
the minister not concerned? 
<P><A NAME="LINK39"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, in the context of this issue, let us 
again look at what the privacy commissioner said about the men 
and women in my department.  He said “We have over at HRDC right 
now some very well motivated public servants who are being very 
careful”.  He understands that the men and women in my 
department appreciate the issue of privacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to confirm to the House that indeed we are ensuring that 
the information we use is encrypted, that it is secure.  I would 
note that in March a deputy of my department wrote to the privacy 
commissioner and asked him to join us in a working group to 
ensure that we continue to provide privacy into the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Hear, hear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I am sure we all want to hear the questions 
and the answers.  I would encourage members to please keep their 
voices down when a member is on his or her feet. 
<P><A NAME="LINK40"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Canadian

ring some very loud alarm bells and Canadians are listening.  I 
hope the minister is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister's database contains the address, income, employment 
history, marital status, living arrangements and health history 
of every single Canadian.  In the hands of private business such 
information could keep someone from getting insurance or a job. 
Imagine this information in the hands of criminals because of lax 
security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the minister immediately end her practice of sharing 
private information about Canadians without their permission? 
<P><A NAME="LINK41"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development,

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
have learned some troubling things from the privacy 
commissioner's latest report, which says that HRDC has thousands 
of pieces of information on thousands of people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The commissioner points out that HRDC is more concerned about 
protecting the security of the information collected than the 
privacy of individual citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Prime Minister tell the House why this file was 
created.  Why is there such a file? 
<P><A NAME="LINK43"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
think that if one reads the commissioner's entire report, one 
will see that he says clearly that he thinks there is a problem 
there.  He is ready to discuss it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone knows that the department has had this information for 
a long time, since well before we took office.  It is a question 
of information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My information is to the effect that, as early as March, the 
department and the privacy commissioner began discussions with a 
view to taking the necessary action to prevent any abuses with 
respect to this file. 
<P><A NAME="LINK44"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
unlike the minister responsible, the Prime Minister admits that 
there is a problem.  That is already something. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I do not understand is that the alarm was sounded two years 
ago.  Through the privacy commissioner, the government has known 
that there was a problem for two years now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How could the Prime Minister stand by and do nothing when he has 
known about the existence of such a file, with the potential 
problems, for two years?  Why did he sit tight, take no decision 
and allow such a state of affairs to continue?  Could I hear 
from the Prime Minister on this? 
<P><A NAME="LINK45"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
if the hon. member read the entire report, all that the 
commissioner said was that he saw a certain problem.  He said he 
had already got in touch with the department in March in an 
attempt to resolve the situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said he fully realized that the department has to have this 
sort of data, that in general the department and the other 
departments involved complied with the Parliament of Canada Act.

permanent and, to all intents, invisible citizen profile” 
although the commissioner had already made recommendations to 
the minister in September 1998, which the minister did not 
accept.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important to note that the information is secure, it 
is encrypted and access to data that is not encrypted is 
available to only six employees in the department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also note that the commissioner recommended that the 
information contained in these files should be managed within a

</I></B></P><P align=left>I also remind the hon. member that the Prime Minister said that

of our concerns about the adverse impacts of higher interest 
rates, for example, on students who were forced to take out huge 
loans to pursue the education they need in the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Canadians can buy a car with 1.3% financing or a 
chesterfield with 0% financing, why has the government fixed the 
cost of education at prime plus 2.5%, which today means— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The hon. Minister of Finance. 
<P><A NAME="LINK52"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, let me answer, at least in the time permitted, the first 
part of the question in terms of students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member will know that in the 1998 budget we brought 
down a $7.5 billion contribution to education, including loans to 
students.  In the most recent budget, there was not only the 
creation of 2,000 research chairs, but we lifted the exemption on 
scholarships from taxation from $500 to $3,000.  We have brought 
in a program that will enable students to handle their loans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, the focus on education has been very important 
for this government in order to help students— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The hon. leader of the New Democratic Party. 
<P><A NAME="LINK53"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, let us 
talk reality.  The reality is that for every dollar in new 
educational initiatives, this government has slashed $2 from the 
post-secondary education system, with the result that student 
debtloads have more than tripled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other governments around the world are increasing their 
investments in education.  Why is Canada mortgaging our 
children's future? 
<P><A NAME="LINK54"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the premise of the hon. member's question is simply 
bunk.  The fact is that since this government took office we have 
put more money into helping students finance their education and 
more into ensuring that post-secondary educational institutions 
have the labs and facilities in which to do it.  We have 
increased the transfers to the provinces every single year for 
the last four years.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make it clear that the privacy commissioner recognized 
that the information is now securely protected.  It is encrypted.

That is just great, Mr. Speaker.  But what the minister does not 
tell us is the audit says that according to one network

promotion party”.  Unfortunately not all network administrators 
are invited to these parties, particularly in larger offices.

that this practice made no sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, according to the 
rule that people are not guilty until they are caught, nothing 
happened, as usual in the other files.  The minister signed 
agreements with eight provinces to obtain even more information 
on the citizens of Canada.  That stopped with Quebec, it did not 
work with Quebec, because the law in Quebec does not permit this 
sort of data collection.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke—Lakeshore, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, in a recent report Canada was accused of not having a 
comprehensive strategy to respond to the global trafficking of 
women and children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is for the Secretary of State for the Status of 
Women.  Could she tell us what we are doing to stop this horrific 
practice of the trafficking of women and children? 
<P><A NAME="LINK103"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism)(Status 
of Women), Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the government considers this 
form of trafficking to be the most despicable form of 
exploitation in the world.  We have taken steps.  There is a nine 
department committee, of which the Status of Women is co-chair, 
that is looking at setting up legal and other social solutions. 
We are working with experts and with community groups to devise 
solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to point out one solution which was recently made in the 
immigration and refugee legislation.  There is a new 
offence against trafficking that will increase the penalty to 
$1 million or life imprisonment for people who resort to this 
kind of exploitation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Yesterday the hon. member for Wild Rose 
raised a point of privilege about information which he claims was 
deliberately withheld from his staff.  At that time he mentioned 
specifically the Department of the Solicitor General. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had hoped that the solicitor general would be here.  When the 
solicitor general comes to the House we will take up this point 
of privilege.  The only reason we are not going directly to it is 
because the minister is not here at the moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we are waiting for the minister to come to the House I 
will hear a point of order from the hon. House leader for the

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>ORAL QUESTION PERIOD 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK108"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of 
order.  I rise in this House to raise a point of order.  I am 
deeply distressed by the events in this House yesterday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the start of this parliament, an agreement was reached among 
the parliamentary leaders, which we passed on to you, to the 
effect that the order of oral questions is always prepared in 
advance to ensure the House functions better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was also an underlying principle, which was that a 
political party wasting the time of the House, using up time in 
question period for other purposes, would be penalized in the 
number of questions available to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been quite a few Oral Question Periods in which the 
Bloc Quebecois—each time it is the Bloc—has lost its seventh 
question.  Today we lost our sixth question because, on the 
other side of the House—and they have frankly admitted it—they 
were happy to take fewer questions because the minister, who was 
in an awkward situation, had fewer answers to give. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals have two questions in Oral Question Period. 
I do not understand why, under a principle of fairness, under 
the agreements reached among the parliamentary leader, which 
must still be in effect—if they are no longer in effect, I would 
like to be informed, and we will get that straightened out 
quickly—under what principle did the Bloc Quebecois today lose 
not only its seventh question but its sixth as well, whereas the 
Liberals had all theirs, but they wasted the time of the House 
by standing up, heckling, applauding and fooling around, while 
we were discussing a matter of great importance? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I call on you and ask the following: What sort of 
rules will it take for us to also be entitled to the number of 
questions set out in the original agreement?  It always comes 
just before the Bloc Quebecois' question and it is beginning to 
get under our skin in a big way, to put it frankly.

<P><A NAME="LINK109"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am the first to admit that today 
there may have been less discipline than usual in the House. I 
readily recognize that fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If some of my colleagues have slowed down the proceedings, I 
apologize for that. However, let me say that this is certainly 
not happening only on one side of the House. We know that some 
questions are provocative and can sometimes trigger answers that 
are also provocative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recognize that those who engage in provocation are not 
necessarily those who suffer the consequences. Sometimes, there 
are third parties involved, particularly in a House with five 
political formations. I also recognize that, because it is true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would add that, based on our usual way of doing things, three 
questions are asked every day by government members. Today, the 
hon. member for Guelph—Wellington was not recognized. In other 
words, the same thing also happened on our side of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> We lost two. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am in the process of providing 
an explanation and apologizing. I was polite to the hon. member 
and I hope his colleagues will show the same courtesy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I just indicated, the hon. member for Guelph—Wellington wanted 
to ask a question on the university in her riding, one of the 
most important institutions in the country, particularly in the 
agricultural sector. She was not able to put her question 
because—and I also recognize that—of the disturbance in the House 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I undertake to raise with my colleagues the fact that we must do 
our part to ensure that the allotted number of questions can be 
asked, or better yet supplementaries.  I think that questions 
and answers in the House are a fundamental principle of 
democracies—they make the government accountable to the public. 
I will raise this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Naturally, I urge the others to do the same, obviously so that 
we can work together toward a co-operative atmosphere, 
notwithstanding our disagreements as to substance, because there 
will be such disagreements, we admit.  That is only fair and it 
is good for democracy.  I undertake to do my part as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, I wish to point out that, notwithstanding the 
enthusiasm of some people sometimes, a number of 
parliamentarians on this side also felt hard done by today. 
Considering that there are in fact more so-called eligible 
members on our side of the House than in any party on the other 
side, we too have parliamentarians who are disappointed at not 
being able to ask their questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I admit that the questions are different in nature.  I admit 
that, by the very nature of things, they are perhaps less 
pointy, less partisan.  But this does not mean that members on 
this side with questions to ask feel that their concerns are not 
important.  They are important regionally, in terms of their 
riding, or when it comes to whether or not to support the 
government.  Questions are just as important on this side of the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I too have spent many years on the other side. 
I know about the frustration of getting ready to make the 
government accountable and being unable to speak at the 
appointed time after having done all the groundwork for this 
exercise which is so fundamental to democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I have raised this point today and it is one in 
which I believe deeply.  I think that the Bloc Quebecois House 
leader will agree that I am being sincere because I too believe 
in this fundamental principle of democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will close by repeating the undertaking being given by our 
side of the House—I am sure the whip will agree with me—to do our 
best.  We must all work on this, both sides of the House, all 
five sides—if the House can be said to have five sides—all five 
parties, with all the challenges that involves. 
<P><A NAME="LINK110"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> I address myself directly to the hon. member 
to let him know that I too feel frustrated in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I have stood up at least a dozen times to call for order, 
so that we could hear ourselves in this House, and hear the 
questions as well as the answers.

<A HREF="#LINKT15"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every five or six weeks we have a day like today.  I wish that 
all days could be like Monday, when we had 47 questions and 47 
answers in this House.  That was a good day for Parliament. 
Tuesday, there were 42 of each. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to be able to say that it is all on one side or the 
other, all one party or the other. However, the hon. members 
were here for Oral Question Period.  The last time, I called 
upon you all to take a look at yourselves.  Can one or the other 
side say that they are not to blame?  If so, good for you, and 
thank you. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If not, we keep coming back every six weeks or so because we 
cannot get our questions in at the end of question period.  Then 
we stand up, stalk out and some yell “partisan” and “taking up 
time”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest to you that unless you want me, as your Speaker, and I 
will happy to do it, every time someone raises his or her voice, 
that I stop them and tell them to leave, which I will do, but I 
do not want a question period like that.  Do you? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House leaders from the different parties are all ready to 
get in.  Every six or seven weeks we have a day like this.  It 
has not been a good day.  Again, I come back and appeal to you 
that if you want a House that is just going to have me here, 
kicking people out on both sides, that can be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appeal to you, as parliamentarians of Canada, to take your 
responsibilities too.  If it is such a joke and so funny, go 
laugh in the lobbies.  Do not take up our time here, we who want 
to do the work of our country, and surely do not attack your 
Speaker every six weeks because we, collectively, have a bad day. 
I do not think that is fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had my say. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to clarify a 
number of things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know very well that today was frightful and trying for 
everyone, probably more so for the Speaker than for the others. 
I have done my part to try to stay calm as much as possible. 
But I, like others, have been known to heckle a bit in this 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the worst case scenario, let us be frank, we will understand 
each other—I do not want to attack you, Mr. Speaker—let us say 
that today half of the trouble came from this side and half from 
the other.  This was not the case, but let us say we all caused 
about as much trouble.  I just want to humbly submit to you 
that, each time we cause trouble about equally, the Liberal 
Party never loses questions, while we lose them regularly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> We will conclude on that.  I hope we will have a 
better day tomorrow.

for the House.  It dealt with a member of a department—and I 
think I am quoting the member—deliberately misleading a member

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Elinor Caplan (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, 
Lib.)</B> moved that Bill C-16, an act respecting Canadian 
citizenship, be read the third time and passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She said:  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to stand today to introduce 
third reading of the new Citizenship of Canada Act in the House 
of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation helps to define who we are as Canadians.  It 
may not be as dramatic or glitzy as a beer ad, but as we enter 
the 21st century, it is a reflection of the values that we 
Canadians share.  It sends a message to the world that the 
currency of Canadian citizenship is not dollars or showmanship 
but honesty and an often quiet but nonetheless deeply held 
commitment to equality, tolerance, freedom and the celebration of 
our diversity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-16 updates and modernizes our citizenship process from 
the current Citizenship Act that was passed in 1977.  It promotes 
equality for all who seek to become Canadians by treating adopted 
children in a similar manner to natural born children. 
It extends the citizenship process to common law and same sex 
partners of Canadians.  It creates a process which is fair and 
fast, and requires a clear attachment to Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past parliament, the former Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, my colleague and predecessor, introduced Bill C-63, 
an act to replace the current Citizenship Act.  Bill C-63 
received extensive debate in the House as well as hearings and 
consultations through the standing committee.  The 
recommendations of the standing committee on Bill C-63 were 
incorporated into this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The standing committee also reviewed Bill C-16 and made several 
recommendations to clarify and tighten the proposed process under 
this legislation.  I thank the committee for its diligence and 
hard work.  I would like to acknowledge the able chairmanship of 
the member for London North Centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A key element of the new citizenship act is its definition of 
physical presence.  The current Citizenship Act includes a 
residency requirement of three out of four years.  However over 
the past several decades we have seen many inconsistent rulings 
on what constitutes residency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have been clear that they believe the integrity of 
citizenship means having an attachment to Canada.  I believe that 
an attachment comes through familiarity with our official 
languages, our customs, our diverse cultures, and our 
communities. One must be in Canada to feel and appreciate what it 
really means to be Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The standing committee on the review of Bill C-63 proposed that 
a person should be physically present in Canada for a minimum of 
three out of six years in order to receive citizenship.  I agree. 
Bill C-16 makes it clear that the three years out of six years 
rule for physical presence is the basic requirement for 
citizenship in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-16 proposes another important change to ensure 
consistency and equal treatment.  Bill C-16 will allow Canadians 
who adopt children abroad to bring their children home as 
Canadians.  The act will see that the children adopted abroad by 
a Canadian parent are treated in the same manner equal to 
children born of Canadians abroad.  This will ensure that our 
Citizenship Act is consistent with our charter of rights and 
freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-16 also includes an important change in the role of 
commissioners.  The process under our current Citizenship Act 
involves the use of citizenship judges who must consider each 
citizenship application.  However, over 90% of our citizenship 
cases are quite straightforward.  Bill C-16 proposes to use a 
clear, consistent process in making decisions on citizenship 
applications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The role of the judge will be replaced by a commissioner who 
will oversee citizenship ceremonies and who will review the 
language and knowledge requirements for the few who cannot use 
standardized tests for reasons of age or disability.  Most 
important, commissioners will go out into the community and into 
the schools to talk to people about what it means to be a 
Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-16 modernizes Canadian citizenship.  It strengthens the 
integrity of citizenship by making the requirements clear and the 
process consistent.  It builds on the lessons of the past by 
including a mechanism to remove citizenship if it is obtained by 
fraud.  Revocation of citizenship is not new, nor has the process 
been changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian citizenship is not a right.  It is a privilege.  It 
should not be extended to those who enter or acquire status in 
Canada by telling lies.  Above all, Canada is not and will not be 
a safe haven for war criminals, those who have been involved in 
terrorism, and those who have committed crimes against humanity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This country was built by people from all over the world who 
came here honestly in pursuit of new opportunities and old 
dreams.  These people have worked to make Canada a beacon of 
economic hope and democratic freedom, the democratic freedom that 
we cherish so deeply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are envied around the world.  We have been recognized by the 
United Nations for the sixth year in a row as the best country in 
which to live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The act honours those immigrants and refugees who over the years 
have built this country, who have acquired Canadian citizenship. 
The act affirms the core values which we all share and it honours 
the enduring commitment to those who have built Canada, their 
commitment to this true north strong and free.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak to this bill which would replace 
the current citizenship act with a new act.  I listened to the 
minister and she said a lot of nice things. If the bill delivered 
on some of the things she said, I would support it, but in fact 
it does not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to point out in my presentation some of the 
shortfalls of the bill that make it a piece of legislation which 
I and the Canadian Alliance cannot support. It is very 
unfortunate because citizenship is a very touching issue.  New 
Canadians feel pride in obtaining Canadian citizenship. Certainly 
members of parliament who have attended citizenship ceremonies 
share that sense of pride new citizens feel when they obtain 
citizenship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member of parliament I feel pride in being a Canadian 
citizen. I was fortunate enough to have been born as a Canadian 
citizen and did not have to come to our country and go through 
the process to obtain citizenship.  It is a very positive issue 
and it would be very difficult to place a value on it. It is just 
too important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately the bill does not deal with obtaining citizenship 
and retaining citizenship in a satisfactory way.  I am going to 
talk later about one particular area which has caused some very 
serious problems in committee and in the House.  Many witnesses 
pointed to the revocation of citizenship as being an extremely 
important issue.  The government refused to support amendments to 
the bill and in the first place refused to put in the bill that 
the ultimate responsibility for revoking citizenship would go to 
the courts with leave to appeal to the supreme court if 
necessary. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would call your attention to 
the fact that we are short of a quorum. The hon. member is 
making an interesting speech, but there is no one to listen to 
it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I would like to note that the hon. member who raised the 
point of order of the absence of a quorum promptly disappeared and 
has not been seen since.  This is— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I interrupt the hon. member for 
Vancouver Quadra because it is not proper to refer to the absence 
of members from the House.  However, if he has something more to 
say I will allow it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, my point was simply that 
an hon. member intervened when another hon. member was on his 
feet speaking.  I do not remember that he ceded to the intervener 
and it seems to me that in a case like that you are entitled not 
to take notice of the objection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I am afraid the precedents in the 
House are that if the Speaker's attention is drawn to the lack of 
a quorum the Speaker makes a count.  If there is no quorum found, 
the bells are rung to summon the members.  I believe that is the 
established precedent of the House.  I could check chapter and 
verse of Marleau and Montpetit, but I am sure the hon. member for 
Vancouver Quadra, who knows these things, will want to do that 
himself to satisfy himself that the Speaker acted properly in the 
circumstances. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Earlier, reference was made to my not being present in the 
House. I did ask the Chair to check and see if we had a quorum. 
I am asking the Chair, to make it clear for everyone, including 
those who are listening to us, whether, under our rules, it is 
the government's responsibility to ensure a quorum. How can we 
tolerate a situation where the Canadian Alliance member is 
making a speech in front of two government members only, when 
the minister is not even here?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> We can see the problem. It is not the 
government's obligation to maintain a quorum in the House. That 
obligation rests with all members of parliament. Each member has 
an obligation to attend and take part in the debates of the 
House. Each member must be here for the debates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the Parliament of Canada Act and the royal proclamation, 
all members of parliament are required to attend the sittings of 
the Parliament of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not an obligation for government members only, but for 
all members of this House. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we continue to refer to the presence and absence of members 
we only create difficulties which lead to recriminations.  I know 
that hon. members would wish to refrain from such conduct, which 
is clearly contrary to the rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Lakeland has the floor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am happy to finally 
return to my presentation.  I must say that I am impressed with 
your knowledge of the rules, more impressed than I could state. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I started by making some general comments on the issue of the 
revocation of citizenship.  I will get to that topic a bit later. 
Right now I would like to put a bit of background to this 
citizenship bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-16 was tabled in October 1999, with very few changes from 
the previous bill, Bill C-63.  Bill C-63 was tabled in December 
1998 and did not make it back to the House for report stage 
before parliament was prorogued in the fall. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation will repeal and replace the current Citizenship 
Act, something which is long overdue.  The current Citizenship 
Act was put in place in 1977 and there are several areas which 
need change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In some areas the bill is an improvement.  However, as I said 
before I was interrupted, there are so many problems with this 
piece of legislation that I cannot support it.  I do not believe 
my Canadian Alliance colleagues would support it.  I would be 
surprised if there were many others who would support the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation makes several changes to the current act, with 
the intention of providing more clear guidelines in areas such as 
residency.  That is something which is much needed. 
Unfortunately, the bill falls short in that regard and I will 
talk a bit about that later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed bill, as I said, is somewhat of an improvement over 
the previous bill, but not enough of an improvement that I could 
support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister received recommendations from the government 
dominated standing committee in 1994.  That was over six years 
ago.  Some excellent proposals were put forth.  What we see today 
does very little to deal with the recommendations put forth by 
the Liberal dominated committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some insupportable elements in the bill.  There is too 
much reliance on regulation.  This is another one of those bills 
which are becoming common fare from the government in which there 
are huge gaps in the legislation so that we really do not know 
what is the intent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe that everything that is included in regulation 
should necessarily be put into legislation, but at the very 
minimum, in every area of legislation, it should be made clear 
what the principles will be that will guide the legislation and 
its implementation.  In this bill there are several areas in 
which there is too big a gap and it is too hard to really know 
what are the principles guiding the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to know that when regulations are presented on 
legislation they are drafted by civil servants in the department. 
They need the approval of the minister, but they are never 
subjected to a vote in the House of Commons. 
They do not get proper scrutiny.  Often they do not get any 
scrutiny by the House of Commons.  How can we allow a piece of 
legislation to go ahead when so much is left to the regulations 
and the House of Commons never gets a chance to vote on whether 
it approves or disapproves of the regulations?

<A HREF="#LINKT23"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is becoming a habit of the government to leave those huge 
holes in its legislation.  In the new immigration act there is so 
much left to regulation that it really is hard to know what the 
act is intended to do.  Because of that, the minister has started 
to refer to that piece of legislation as a framework act.  It is 
obvious that so much is left to regulation.  There is the same 
problem in this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, some very important definitions have been left to 
regulations.  I want to talk about those. They are extremely 
important definitions which could have a serious impact on the 
Canadian family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are definitions for such things as what constitutes a 
genuine parent-child relationship.  The bill refers to a 
parent-child relationship in several places. Nowhere is it 
defined.  That will be left to regulation and that is 
unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, who can make an application on behalf of a minor is 
left undefined and unclarified.  It is leaving too much to 
regulation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What would be in the best interests of the child was something 
which several Liberal members of the committee saw as a problem. 
That is left undefined and to regulation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What fees will be allowed is left to regulation.  We know what 
happens when fees are left to the government.  We have seen a 
head tax of $950 plus other fees put on every single person 
coming into the country either as an independent or economic 
immigrant or as a refugee. Under pressure from the official 
opposition in committee a motion by my colleague which I 
supported was rejected by the government, but it has at least 
stated that the head tax or landing fee on refugees will be 
removed.  That is an important step but it has not happened yet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot trust the government to make the fees fair. How do we 
know what kind of fee could be put on the processing or 
administration of the citizenship act?  There is nothing to say 
we could not have a $1,000 fee put on this process which is 
unacceptable.  Too much is left to regulation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second area I would like to talk about is that of patronage 
appointments, something which has been talked about by all the 
opposition parties and even by government members. They have said 
that there are too many patronage appointments and that it is 
time we hired people based on merit.  There should be a hiring 
process similar to that of the civil service.  Yet in this bill 
the government has opened up more opportunities for people to be 
appointed based on the favours they do for the party rather than 
on merit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The citizenship commissioners are examples of this.  That is 
particularly disappointing.  The commissioners will replace the 
citizenship judges and most of their job will be given to people 
in the department in the civil service to do.  Yet the patronage 
appointments continue.  That is hard to explain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The role of the commissioners will be minimal, mainly 
ceremonial.  It makes no sense to leave these patronage positions 
in place.  The government has done it so it can reward MPs who 
will not win in the next election, or maybe other friends who 
make substantial political contributions and that type of thing. 
That is unacceptable.  It is something we all agree has to end, 
but it is still here in the new citizenship act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now deal with what is probably the most important flaw in 
the citizenship act. 
I have to give credit to the member for Kitchener—Waterloo for 
his role in making it clear that this flaw is too important to 
ignore.  I have been told that the member for Kitchener—Waterloo 
feels it is important enough that he resigned as parliamentary 
secretary because the government did not listen to his proposals 
on the issue of revocation of citizenship.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Revocation of citizenship is something that everyone in the 
House should treat as extremely important. Every witness who 
commented on revocation of citizenship said that the power to 
revoke citizenship should be taken away from the minister and 
cabinet and should be given to the courts with at least leave to 
appeal to the supreme court if need be.  It is an important 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every new immigrant who has moved to this country should be 
looking at this.  They should be asking themselves why the 
Liberal government refused to give the power to revoke 
citizenship to the courts.  Why has it kept that power in the 
hands of the minister and cabinet?  Every single new immigrant 
should ask that.  On a political whim of the government, his or 
her citizenship could be revoked. I am not saying the government 
is going to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an issue which was pointed out by many witnesses.  It 
was pointed out by myself and my colleagues in the official 
opposition.  It was pointed out by members of other opposition 
parties.  It was pointed out, as I said, by the member for 
Kitchener—Waterloo, the parliamentary secretary to the minister. 
This is wrong.  The power should be left to the courts.  Any 
political connection should be taken out of revocation of 
citizenship.  There are too many potential problems as a result 
of that remaining. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we all gave the government several opportunities to 
change that.  I put forth a motion in committee to change that. 
The committee members voted like puppets and shot it down.  I do 
not believe that they did it based on what they believed; it is 
because they were whipped to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House voted yesterday on the motions I put forth.  They had 
been originally put forth by a Liberal member and I co-signed.  I 
thought they were good motions.  The person from the government 
party who originally signed the motions did not move them but I 
did as the co-signer. It was the right thing to do.  The 
parliamentary secretary believed strongly enough that it was the 
right thing to do that he resigned his position as parliamentary 
secretary because his government did not act on this extremely 
important issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to point out that the member for 
Kitchener—Waterloo is an immigrant.  He immigrated to this 
country many years ago.  He can understand, as can some of the 
other government members who voted against the bill yesterday, 
that it is wrong to have the power to remove citizenship 
concentrated in the hands of cabinet. He was willing to take a 
very strong stand by resigning as parliamentary secretary.  I 
give him credit for that.  It is not an easy thing to do but the 
issue is that important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did other government members not decide to finally take a 
stand and take the power away from cabinet and put it in the 
courts?  At least give people the leave to appeal to the supreme 
court as a final appeal process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a press release from B'nai Brith Canada which shows full 
support for the motions which were voted on yesterday in the 
House.  It states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Simply put, the amendments, designated as Motions 4 and 5 (Group 
2) at Report Stage, make the Bill more just.  They would 
modernize, simplify and expedite the process of revoking (or not 
revoking) a person's citizenship on an allegation that the 
citizenship was attained by “false representation or fraud or 
knowingly concealing material circumstances”.

</I></B></P><P align=left>That is from the B'nai Brith on these important motions.  I 
think they have correctly analyzed this situation and their 
lawyers agree with that.  Mr. David Matas, a well known 
immigration lawyer, has tendered that position which has been 
presented on behalf of B'nai Brith. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The German-Canadian Congress sent a letter as well.  I will 
quote one paragraph. I do not want to get into all of what is in 
the letter.  The last paragraph reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The German-Canadian Congress strongly believes that revoking 
Canadian citizenship should be a decision of the courts and not 
be decided by politicians.  In addition, a proper process for 
appeal must be in place and be followed. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To be more specific, it also says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We strongly urge you to vote in favour of adopting Motions 4 and 
5 (Group 2) as proposed at Report Stage in Bill C-16. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other groups.  I spoke with the Ukrainian Canadian 
Congress before the bill came to report stage.  I can safely say 
that it would fully support these motions based on what it said 
in committee and what was said to me in personal meetings.  We 
would find that many others, as they came to understand what a 
serious issue this is, would support those motions.  They would 
call for a change in the legislation so that only the courts upon 
leave of appeal to the supreme court would have the final say on 
revocation of citizenship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems quite reasonable.  The witnesses certainly thought so. 
Many of the groups that monitor this type of issue think so. 
Several members of the government party thought so and I give 
them credit.  They believed enough in that position that they 
stood and voted against the whip vote on the issue.  That takes 
some courage and I give them credit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This issue alone is important enough to cause me to not vote in 
favour of the legislation.  There are several other issues and I 
will brush over some of them because my time is limited. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This issue demonstrates very well that clearly too much power 
has been left in the hands of government on issues of citizenship 
without proper scrutiny, without proper review by the House or 
even by committee.  I put forth 20 some motions to improve the 
bill.  In some of my motions all I call for is scrutiny by the 
appropriate committee.  Were those motions supported by the 
government?  No. It was something the opposition parties 
supported but the government refused to support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are several areas which demonstrate very well that the 
government has kept too much power in its hands in a way which it 
is not accountable for in the bill.  We are not talking about a 
bill that deals with a minor issue; we are talking about a bill 
that deals with an issue which is extremely important to 
Canadians, the issue of Canadian citizenship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have another concern which I am not sure is shared by all of 
my colleagues.  It is shared by some members across the floor and 
by others in other opposition parties.  It is the issue of 
citizenship at birth and citizenship being granted automatically 
to any child born in Canada.  That is wrong.  The position of the 
reform party, which was the main political party at least which 
initiated the birth of the Canadian Alliance, is that a child 
born in Canada should not automatically obtain Canadian 
citizenship.

<A HREF="#LINKT26"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We said exactly the same as a parliamentary committee on which 
the government has a majority of members said back in 1994.  It 
said that children born in Canada should not automatically obtain 
Canadian citizenship.  They should only obtain Canadian 
citizenship if at least one parent is either a permanent resident 
or a citizen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That seems to be a fair position to take.  It is the position 
that parliamentary committee took six years ago, again a 
government dominated committee.  The thing to do is to make sure 
a child born in Canada automatically receives Canadian 
citizenship if he or she is born to at least one parent who is a 
citizen or a landed immigrant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that is a fair position.  I have a lot of information 
on that issue.  I feel I have to go into it to some extent.  I 
certainly will not present all of it, but I want to say what the 
minister said in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When minister was speaking about that issue before the bill was 
tabled she said she left in the clause regaqrding automatic 
citizenship at birth because there had not been enough research 
done to see how it impacted on Canada.  Even though the committee 
had recommended that it be changed, the minister said she would 
leave it the same because there just was not enough evidence. Yet 
it was six years ago that the committee made the recommendation 
to change it. Certainly the opposition has been calling for this 
change to be made for the last six years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After six years it is the responsibility of the government and 
of the citizenship and immigration minister to have done the 
research if they felt it was necessary to do so.  Perhaps the 
minister did not know whether or not automatic citizenship was a 
problem, but she certainly knows, as do I suggest most members of 
the opposition, that it is abused terribly in the country.  This 
is no secret. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is something that has been brought forward again and again 
and again.  There are people who deliberately come to Canada to 
have a child, knowing that the child will automatically become a 
Canadian citizen.  They may come as visitors or in various ways. 
As a result of the court ruling on the Mavis Baker case, we now 
have a court saying that we have to take into account the 
citizenship of a child before removing a parent who would 
otherwise be removed from the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the government leaving in automatic citizenship.  We 
have the court saying in the Baker case that we have to take into 
account the fact that the child was born in Canada and 
automatically is a Canadian citizen, and what kind of hardship it 
might cause if the mother or father were removed from the country 
and chose to take the child as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clearly an issue where the government's lack of action has 
led to serious abuse.  The department seems unable to deal with 
the abuse.  The minister shuns the responsibility by saying that 
we do not have evidence of just how much abuse there is or how 
much of a problem it is so we will leave it the same.  It is an 
odd way to make law.  I do not think it is what Canadians are 
looking for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to speak about a couple of more important issues in the 
legislation.  The next issue is the issue of physical presence. 
In the current citizenship act there are some problems, no doubt, 
with the definition of residency.  In fact the courts ruled that 
people can be residents if they have bank accounts in Canada. The 
court ruled that even if people never lived in Canada they can be 
residents if they pay taxes in Canada, if they are here now and 
again or if they have a business in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was need for change.  Clearly the current law on residency 
is not working. 
It was never intended, as the courts ruled, that anyone who pays 
taxes or has a bank account in the country would be considered a 
resident of Canada.  In the act a person has to be a resident for 
a certain length of time before he or she can obtain citizenship. 
That is the issue.  I think most people would consider that to be 
reasonable. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1620"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current definition is not working so what did the government 
do?  It made an improvement by saying that residency will be 
defined by physical presence in the country, that a person had to 
be physically present in the country three years out of six, 
basically.  I have no problem with that.  I think that is 
probably a pretty reasonable kind of compromise which was made as 
a result of hearing from witnesses, from the opposition and from 
government members in the committee which dealt with Bill C-63, 
the predecessor to this bill.  It is probably reasonable that 
there be 1,095 days or three years of physical presence out of 
six years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a problem.  Let us look at what the minister, the 
deputy minister, the ADM, and other department officials have 
said about physical presence.  I talked about this issue at 
committee and said that it sounded good, but I asked how we would 
know whether people had been physically present in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Officials from the department made it very clear that they had 
no way, or at least not a suitable way, to determine that.  They 
said it was not a big problem because they would only refer to 
actual physical presence in cases where they felt they wanted to 
do so.  They are saying they will apply the law only when they 
see a particular reason to apply it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe we should have laws that we cannot enforce. 
This is a law we cannot enforce.  Before the legislation was 
brought to the House there should have been an explanation by the 
minister of how she would enforce physical presence, but it did 
not happen.  While it is an improvement it is one of those laws 
that just is not enforceable.  For that reason I think it should 
be rejected by the House.  It is another reason to reject the 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will skip over a lot of things I wanted to say about physical 
presence and go to the issue of retroactivity on which we have 
some interesting comments from government members.  Subclause 
55(1) states that proceedings in relation to an application 
pending on the day on which the act comes into force must be 
dealt with under the act.  However subclause 55(2) stipulates 
that if the application is being considered by a citizenship 
judge at the time, the application will be considered under the 
old act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an issue of retroactivity.  The department claims that 
it takes about eight to twelve months to process a citizenship 
claim.  However it seems like the more realistic figure is 
seventeen months.  If a citizenship judge has been taking longer 
than another judge, we are saying that a particular case could be 
dealt with under the new act because it has not actually been 
considered or is not being considered by the citizenship judge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a case of retroactivity and is an unacceptable form of 
retroactivity.  There should not be two different paths for 
applications to follow depending on how efficiently or 
expeditiously an official has or has not been dealing with 
someone's application.  That is all wrong and has to be changed 
in the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it just me or is it just the Canadian Alliance that has been 
saying these things?  No.  In fact the member for Scarborough 
Southwest made some sense when he stated in committee on April 
28, 1999: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take a position on the traditional, historical pattern of the 
Liberal Party of not having retroactive legislation.  If this 
citizenship law passes as is, as I understand it, notwithstanding 
that someone has been making his plans in anticipation of the law 
as it currently exists, he/she will have to wait, for no apparent 
reason other than a change in law...to apply for Canadian 
citizenship. 
</UL>

<A HREF="#LINKT28"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Scarborough Southwest went on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That to me is retroactivity.  That to me is taking away from 
people who have relied on an existing law, and that is 
un-Liberal...I'd like to know why immigration department 
officials recommended that to a Liberal immigration 
minister...retroactivity is, generally speaking, anathema to the 
Liberal Party. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Scarborough Southwest is agreeing with the 
position we take on the issue.  This type of retroactivity can 
unfairly penalize someone due to an official not dealing with the 
issue of citizenship properly.  It is all wrong.   It is another 
reason I certainly will not support the bill.  It leads me to 
believe that most of my colleagues and others in the House will 
not support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk a bit more about another issue which I touched on 
earlier, the concept of having citizenship judges maintaining 
their position and salary which allow them to deal with 
citizenship when they will no longer have those responsibilities. 
The responsibility of actually dealing with who is a citizen and 
who is not, or who should be and who should not be, will go to 
departmental officials to determine who is eligible for 
citizenship and who is not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In spite of that change where most of the responsibility of 
citizenship judges is taken away, the act will allow those people 
to maintain their patronage appointments.  It will allow people 
in the future to be named as commissioners.  The salary has not 
been named, but it sounds like it will be at least the same 
salary or maybe higher when the responsibilities are primarily 
ceremonial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think everyone would agree that it is time to end this type of 
patronage appointment.  This is not something that is acceptable 
any longer.  It is time to end those patronage appointments and 
to hire people who are being put into positions of such 
importance, even if they are ceremonial, based on merit much as 
any public servant would be hired. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not talk a great deal about this point, but I recognized 
in a motion that it made sense to allow the government to appoint 
the top commissioner.  It is important that a government has its 
views reflected in that function in the department.  In the case 
of citizenship, therefore, I believe the top position will 
determine the general principles to be considered in areas of 
discretion.  It makes sense to have the person appointed to that 
position by government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have called for that position to be approved by the Leader of 
the Opposition and leaders of other opposition parties.  At the 
very least it should be approved by the appropriate committee of 
the House.  That is something which I think is only reasonable 
but unfortunately is not in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have talked to some extent about the importance of removing 
some of the discretion which will be put in place through 
regulation.  The bill has been in the process as Bill C-63 and 
now as Bill C-16 for two years.  I would think by that time 
regulation would be developed.  Why is the committee not looking 
at the regulation and saying that too much has been left to 
regulation which can be easily changed by the government without 
putting it through the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us put that in legislation.  Let us put at least the guiding 
principles in this area clearly in legislation.  That is what 
legislation should do.  It should leave less to regulation, 
something which is generally supported by members of the 
committee.  Yet it does not show up here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They voted down the motions I put forward to amend that in the 
act.  It is difficult to understand why when we hear many members 
supporting it in their speeches.  However, when a committee comes 
to a vote or there is a vote in the House they vote against 
something they support.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I am talking about regulation that sets fees, that defines what 
“in the best interests of the child” means, that defines what a 
genuine parent-child relationship is, something that could be 
very important.  It would define these important things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last thing I will talk about this afternoon are the 
penalties laid out in the bill for people who break the law under 
this legislation.  I believe that the penalties are much too 
light. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make a comparison.  We have heard a lot of talk lately 
about people coming to our country illegally with the help of 
people smugglers and people traffickers.  We have heard that 
these people often pay as much as $50,000, $60,000 or $70,000 to 
have a smuggler or trafficker, someone involved in organized 
crime, help them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, under the Citizenship Act, someone who 
falsifies a document, maybe after taking a bribe, faces 
relatively minor penalties.  I am sure my colleagues will talk 
about these penalties in their presentations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have people who come to our country illegally, paying $60,000 
or $70,000 to do so, when they could buy a citizenship for a 
couple of thousand dollars, and the person who would break the 
law to sell them the citizenship would be subject to relatively 
light penalties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What makes it even worse is that when there is someone in a 
position of trust, someone in the department or someone who is 
responsible for issuing Canadian citizenship documents, who 
accepts a bribe to falsify documents, that person receives the 
same penalty as anyone else who falsely issues citizenship 
documents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For much less money people could become actual citizens through 
the use of false documents, which probably would allow them to 
act and live as citizens in most cases, and yet the penalties 
issued are very minor indeed.  And the same penalties would apply 
to people in a position of trust, people in the department, who 
are responsible for issuing these citizenship documents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I put a motion yesterday which would increase the penalties to 
department officials and others who issue citizenship documents. 
It was rejected by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is much more that I would like to say about this bill, but 
my time is up.  I would encourage all members of the House, 
especially members of the governing party who voted against the 
important motion on the revocation of citizenship, to vote 
against Bill C-16.  Let us improve it and bring it back as a bill 
which would adequately deal with the important issue of people 
obtaining citizenship in our country.  That is what I ask. I 
think that is reasonable and I look forward to that kind of 
support so that we can do it right.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> We now have a quorum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will resume my speech on Bill 
C-16, the Citizenship of Canada Act.  I am pleased to rise to 
speak to this important bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will be recalled that when I spoke on this bill at second 
reading I was in agreement with the principles it contained.  I 
had naturally expressed certain reservations.  Our institution 
provides, through consideration of bills in committee or in the 
House, the opportunity to improve them.  That is what that 
allowed us to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would have been interesting had the government and a number 
of members approved the amendments of the Bloc Quebecois and 
other parties on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Initially, I would like to say that there is legal citizenship, 
which we all recognize.  It is citizenship based on a statute by 
definition, which gives the citizens of a single political 
community a certain number of civic, social and political 
rights.  A certain number of responsibilities and rights are 
also given, enabling the individuals to establish certain links 
and relations among themselves.  This is what fundamentally 
defines citizenship in legal terms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, and especially among sovereignists, we want a broader 
definition of citizenship based on the identity of the 
community, citizenship based not only on a set of rights and 
responsibilities but on individuals' ability to exercise 
democratic rights, to be part of society, enjoy citizenship 
based on the possibility of being a part of this society.  This 
is therefore the definition of more inclusive citizenship.  It 
is more pluralistic, more open to individuals and permits 
greater democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member opposite has played a significant part in this debate 
by introducing an amendment that, essentially, links 
citizenship with God.  Well, the granting of citizenship must 
not be discriminatory. 
We must ensure that it is, as far as possible, the most 
inclusive and the most pluralistic, open to all, to all 
individuals of all faiths, and perhaps also to non-believers. 
This is important, and is what inclusive citizenship is all 
about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B> You are a separatist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras: </B>Mr. Speaker, I am going to remain calm, as 
otherwise I shall have to ask you to use your authority to allow 
me to express myself properly in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, this is inclusive citizenship. 
Bill C-16 gives us that opportunity.  It must be kept in mind 
that there was legislation in place which dated back to 1977 and 
needed to be remodeled, updated, modernized, in order to take 
into consideration a number of elements that apply to new 
trends.

<A HREF="#LINKT32"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is precisely the means of carrying out an in depth 
review of citizenship.  It has provided us with the opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, I was in favour of the principle of Bill C-16 a few 
months ago, but the more we looked at it, the clearer it became 
that a number of elements encroached, to all intents and 
purposes, on areas of Quebec jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will look in particular at clause 8 of the bill, which deals 
specifically with the whole issue of international adoption. 
Under the Civil Code of Quebec, adoption is a provincial matter. 
In many respects, our system operates differently from that of 
the rest of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under Quebec's legislation, adoption takes place after the 
arrival of the child in Quebec and in Canada.  In addition, the 
adoption process is complete when there is a decision by a 
Quebec court.  What Bill C-16 is proposing is that adoption be 
completed in the country of residence of the adopting citizen. 
Citizenship could therefore be granted to a child even before he 
or she arrived in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has important repercussions.  First, it could be called 
discriminatory to a certain degree towards Quebec parents 
intending to adopt. 
In a note sent to the committee on April 11, the Quebec 
department of health and social services clearly indicated that 
there was a very definite risk of major interference in Quebec's 
jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though there have been a number of multilateral 
negotiations with the Government of Quebec, it took the 
intervention of the Bloc Quebecois in committee before bilateral 
negotiations could begin between Quebec City and Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, may I point out to you that there is only one 
member listening to me in the House? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> I am not listening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras:</B> He is not listening.  That is the worst of 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Out of respect for what I am saying, is it possible to call a 
quorum count?  There is only one member listening to me in the 
House.  That is about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><I>And the count having been taken:</I> 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> We do not have a quorum. 
Call in the members.

</I></B></P><P align=left><I>And the bells having rung:</I> 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> We now have a quorum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am not doing this to disrupt 
the proceedings of the House, believe me. I am doing this in a 
very constructive fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras:</B> Some members think that what I just said is 
funny. There was only one member in the House and all of a 
sudden there are several. That makes me happy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It took the filing of a note by the Bloc Quebecois, on April 11, 
with the Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration, to 
get bilateral negotiations started between Quebec and Ottawa, on 
the issue of international adoption. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said clearly, as members will see if they read the committee 
proceedings, that if the government clarified clause 8 to make 
sure that Quebec's jurisdictions are not encroached upon, I 
would agree with the government's arguments and, to a certain 
extent, I would be able to support the bill. But nothing was 
done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Until the very morning of consideration of Bill C-16 at second 
reading, while public officials were negotiating, I stated my 
intention to keep an open mind about this issue. Unfortunately, 
the negotiations failed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Quebec minister responsible for relations with the public 
and immigration sent me a letter on May 9, which is very recent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On April 11, the Minister of Health clearly indicated in Ottawa 
that Quebec's adoption secretariat had stated its 
dissatisfaction. Public officials were present and so were the 
minister's assistants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On May 9, the minister responsible for relations with the public 
and immigration wrote to the Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration indicating clearly, and I quote, that: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill as it is written will not only cause prejudice to 
parents and children, but it does not respect Quebec's 
jurisdiction in the field of international adoptions or its 
system of civil law. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the members opposite calling at the top of their lungs for 
the adoption of a motion recognizing Quebec as a distinct 
society, I think it is quite clear that this bill comes nowhere 
near to recognizing the distinct nature of Quebec, far from it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments introduced by the Bloc Quebecois simply proposed 
to clarify the situation.  What did the Bloc Quebecois amendment 
say? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 3 provided the addition of the following to clause 8: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(2) For greater certainty, the Province of Quebec shall continue 
to have full jurisdiction in respect of international adoptions, 
including the acceptance of any psychosocial assessment of 
adoptive parents and the issue of a letter of no objection to 
the adoption of a child. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois simply wanted the possibility of amending 
clause 8 to make sure that Quebec's jurisdiction in respect of 
international adoptions be honoured.  That is all we were 
saying.  The government opposed this motion by the Bloc 
Quebecois, which wanted to clarify the situation and avoid 
meddling in the field of international adoptions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is impossible to talk one way and vote another. 
If the government had wanted to be consistent with its own 
policies recognizing Quebec as a distinct society and 
recognizing Quebec's Civil Code, it would have voted for this 
motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another important aspect and that is the whole matter 
of the assessment of medical examinations.  On a number of 
occasions, we have explained that we want the reports on medical 
examinations and the health of the child to be given to the 
parents prior to the adoption proposal.

<A HREF="#LINKT34"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Quebec called upon the department and the 
minister, on April 11, clearly indicating that it wanted to see 
these aspects reflected in the regulations. This is one of the 
problems with this bill.  We would have liked to have seen it 
include clauses addressing this situation, but all that the 
government has done is to state, under “Regulation” in clause 43: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(<I>a</I>) respecting the evidence to be provided for applications and 
notices under this Act, including medical evidence to establish 
parentage, and the times when those applications and notices 
must be made; 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is, therefore, nothing specific about transmitting 
information on the child's health status.  We would have liked 
to see this transmitted at the same time as the proposal is 
made, not after processing of the application has begun. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not only the Bloc Quebecois and the Government of Quebec 
which were calling for this to be taken into account in the 
bill.  I took the trouble of looking up the minutes of the 
Standing Committee on Immigration and Citizenship from when it 
examined Bill C-63, which is to all intents and purposes the bill 
we are looking at today, Bill C-16. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the committee was addressing Bill C-63, one of the witnesses 
was the Association des parents adoptants du Québec.  That 
association provided some clarification as well as expressing 
dissatisfaction with the inappropriateness of the current regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what the association told the committee: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to improve our knowledge of children's health status, 
we would like immigration services to encourage medical 
examinations for children when a match is proposed. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through François Auger, a member of the board of directors of 
the Fédération des parents adoptants du Québec, they added that: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parents could then make an informed decision about their ability 
to take care of a child with a particular handicap.  This 
information should be provided when the match is proposed, and 
not when a passport is issued, when the adoption process is 
practically over and parents have already become attached to 
their child. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the government not accept these arguments?  I remind 
the House once again that, on April 11, the Government of Quebec 
indicated that this needed to be taken into account, that this 
obligation should be taken into consideration when regulations 
were drawn up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that this is important, because the Department of 
Citizenship and Immigration is saying that it is not possible to 
inform parents about children's health state at the time of the 
adoption proposal.  The department says it is impossible to 
require a medical examination before a match is proposed to 
parents, citing the best interests of the child. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is precisely what we are talking about—the best interests of 
the child.  How can a parent properly meet the best interests of 
the child if he is unaware of his health status?

<A HREF="#LINKT35"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parents' ability to meet the needs and, therefore, the best 
interests of the child actually depends on the child's health 
status when the proposal is made. We asked that this be taken 
into consideration. We would have liked to see it in the bill. 
Still, we hope that the regulations will take into account that 
rather important issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another important aspect is the whole issue of the amendment 
proposed by the Bloc Quebecois regarding the time of the oath. I 
submitted that amendment, of course, as the critic on these 
issues, with the support of my colleague, the hon. member for 
Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, the former Bloc Quebecois critic for 
citizenship and immigration. The amendment, which was rejected 
by the government party, reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Commissioner presiding over a citizenship ceremony shall, 
during the ceremony and in the presence of a representative of 
the Government of Quebec, give to every new citizen residing in 
Quebec a copy of the following documents and an explanation of 
their purpose: the Charter of the French Language (R.S.Q., c. 
C-11); the Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms (R.S.Q., c. C-12); 
the Election Act (R.S.Q., c. E-3.3); and the Declaration by the 
Government of Quebec on Ethnic and Race Relations, signed on 
December 10, 1986. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why give these documents at the time of the swearing in? This in 
fact answers the other definition to which I alluded earlier 
when I said that there was of course a legal citizenship, but 
also a broader one, based on collective identity. 
It is because Quebec is a receiving country and an open society 
that we wish the arrival of new Quebecers to conform to the 
reality of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Quebec Charter of the French language expresses the desire 
of Quebecers to be able to continue to live and work in French. 
Why?  Because Quebec, and the francophones of Canada as well, 
are in a precarious situation, representing only 2% of the 
population of North America, because we are a fragile society, a 
French society within North America, we want the message to be 
clear: Quebec is a country, a province in which people relate to 
each other in French.  We hope that new Quebecers will be able 
to come to know that reality, which is well represented in the 
Quebec Charter of the French Language but also in the Quebec 
Election Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec's election legislation is a source of pride to us, 
because it was the outcome of a consensus, a desire to involve 
the greatest number of people possible in a democratic society. 
Citizens are equal and have the right to clear expression.  In 
many ways, the Quebec Election Act constitutes a model of which 
we are proud.  We would like to be able to inform new Quebecers 
of their right to be able to express themselves democratically 
within the electoral process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would point out, if I may, that the proposal which aroused the 
ire of the hon. members across the way was not the position of 
the Bloc Quebecois alone.  The reaction could have been “Oh yes, 
it is those Quebec separatists who want to see these documents 
provided”.  No, I would like to remind hon. members of some of 
the stakeholders from Quebec who decided to support this motion.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will see that the represent a number of groups in Quebec 
civil society.  There is Antoine Dorsaint, the spokesperson for 
the office of the Christian community of Haitians in Montreal, 
representing one of the largest and most dynamic communities in 
Montreal.  He supported the motion of the Bloc Quebecois to have 
the documents given during the swearing in ceremony. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is Claude Corbo, whom many of you know well, among others, 
the minister who is the member for Westmount—Ville-Marie. Mr. Corbo 
is a former rector of UQAM, political science professor and 
author of a number of papers on the Quebec condition.  Mr. Corbo 
cannot be called a sovereignist. 
This motion makes a lot of sense and it demonstrates the desire 
of Quebecers to live democratically, with French as their common 
language. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have other names.  There is the Greater Quebec Movement, which 
decided to support this motion.  These people decided to say 
“Yes, Quebec is a democratic society. Yes, in Quebec we want 
things done in French, we want to work in French, live and grow 
in French.  We support the motion by the Bloc Quebecois”.  This 
is the decision a number of stakeholders made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was rather in favour of the principle of the bill. Yet, the 
more I studied this bill both in committee and with colleagues, 
consulting members of the community, the more I understood 
clause 8.  I find it unfortunate, because we gave the government 
a fine opportunity. 
It could have ensured that clause 8 will not encroach on 
Quebec's jurisdiction.  With this amendment, we gave the 
government a wonderful opportunity.  It guaranteed respect for 
Quebec's jurisdiction with respect to international adoption. 
The federal government refused to recognize this principle in 
our motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The door is wide open for the federal government to barge in. 
Even though this government introduces motions in the House 
recognizing the distinct character of Quebec, the fact of the 
matter is that this is just lip service when it comes time to 
pass bills that will have the force of law.  This government has 
shown no openness to an amendment to clause 8, even up to the 
end of consideration at report stage.  This bill discriminates 
against parents in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can tell the House today that it will be difficult at the end 
of this months-long process, which began with Bill C-63, to vote 
in favour of Bill C-16. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am warning the government. Recently, I discussed the 
interpretation of clause 8 with a number of constitutional 
experts.  They told me that there had certainly been a case for 
calling this clause unconstitutional.  The government should 
listen up.  It cannot shut its eyes and blunder into provincial 
jurisdictions.  It should be careful because there could be 
repercussions and the government should be ready. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I conclude my speech so that I will be better prepared to debate 
another bill later, that being the bill to amend the immigration 
act and the refugee determination process.  If there is a 
problem, it will be in this bill as well.  We must look at this 
closely because the system is not working. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are waits of 13, 14, 15 or 16 months for an IRB ruling, 
because it is a slow machine, a lax machine, a machine that is 
illogical and the cause of real human tragedies.

time the board takes to reach a decision must be looked at.  I 
believe six months would be acceptable.  Someone arriving here 
and seeking refugee status should not have to wait 18 months for 
the board's decision.  What message is being sent to the person 
who has settled in this host country, in the meantime? 
Sometimes, after 18 months, he is told that he does not meet the 
criteria of the United Nations Refugee Convention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The matter needs to be looked at in order to ensure that Quebec

rights and also respects the desire of communities to express 
themselves as freely and democratically as possible.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Price (Compton—Stanstead, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
will be splitting my time with the member for Saint John. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased again to speak to Bill C-16, the citizenship of 
Canada act.  We had 23 amendments before us last night in the 
House, which familiarized many of the members with the issues in 
this bill.  I hope to speak about some of the amendments that we 
voted for plus, of course, Motions Nos. 4 and 5, the controversy 
over revocation. I will speak about the positive points in the 
bill as well as some of the areas this party is concerned with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is an active department in the government these days, 
it would be the Department of Citizenship and Immigration.  There 
are presently two bills before parliament, this one and Bill 
C-31, the immigration and refugee protection act.  It is 
worrisome to note that the present acts, with the exception of a 
few amendments, date from the late 1970s.  These pieces of 
legislation should have been updated prior to now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I stated in my first speech on Bill C-16, the importance of 
citizenship cannot be questioned.  It allows for the ultimate 
sense of belonging, belonging to a state, a society.  Human 
beings have a need to be accepted and recognized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The importance of citizenship was not lost on the over 1,000 
delegates who attended the Progressive Conservative National 
Policy Conference in Quebec City.  Our policy task force 
travelled across Canada gathering views from over 23,000 
Canadians.  Our party and its members realize that Canada was 
built on immigration, from which citizenship naturally follows. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of our guiding principles is: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Citizenship is a very sacred status, which places duties and 
responsibilities on every Canadian to safeguard the integrity of 
Canada and to uphold the values and institutions of the nation as 
enshrined in the Constitution and laws of Canada. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When in government, our party took this seriously.  That is 
obvious by the significant increases in immigration numbers we 
accepted in the late 1980s and early 1990s.  Numbers prove the 
benefits immigration and citizenship bring.  One recent study has 
found new immigrants have accounted for more than half of 
Canada's population growth and 70% of the growth in our labour 
force.  This is not insignificant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister introduced Bill C-16 in November of last year.  The 
minister seems to adhere to our principle of the sacredness of 
citizenship.  Overall, Bill C-16 should maintain the integrity of 
Canadian citizenship.  I am glad the minister has borne in mind 
the importance of citizenship. 
I hope the bill is effective but it is certainly not perfect.  I 
wish to speak about some of the drawbacks we do have with the 
bill.

<A HREF="#LINKT38"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased that the minister incorporated many of the 
recommendations of the standing committee which were done last 
spring when Bill C-16 was then called Bill C-63. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One example is residency requirements.  The committee 
recommended that a person be physically present in Canada for 
three out of six years instead of three out of five.  I hope the 
minister continues to seek advice from the committee as the new 
immigration bill is deliberated and makes its way through 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One area of concern for this party is proof of residency.  An 
individual must be a permanent resident in Canada for three out 
of six years or 1,095 days.  Naturally a person must be able to 
prove that he or she has been in the country for that period of 
time.  We do not have exit controls in this country, and 
considering that we have a border that is very long, such 
controls would be difficult if not impossible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This also raises the question of individual rights and privacy 
from the state.  When we learned in the news today, and we talked 
about it in the House, that the government has detailed 
information on all Canadians, this does cause concern.  In any 
case, exit controls will not be here any time soon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the question remains:  How will citizenship officials 
determine whether or not an individual has met his or her 
residency requirements?  The answer we were given was “cheques, 
receipts and utility bills”.  This simply does not suffice.  We 
must attempt to root out fraud and falsification wherever 
possible.  While most individuals may be honest and provide 
accurate information, some do not, and no promise is offered in 
this bill to check the information provided. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Appointments at Citizenship and Immigration Canada have caused 
concern for quite some time.  This party wishes to ensure that 
competent, able officials are named to positions within the 
department.  This party fought on this in the last election and 
we have been unwavering ever since. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In last night's motions, the governing party voted against any 
intent to ensure that competent individuals be appointed at 
Citizenship and Immigration Canada.  It is interesting to note 
also that the first party even voted against Motion No. 7.  The 
motion stated that no one would be appointed as a citizenship 
commissioner if that individual had been convicted of an offence 
under sections 39 and 40 of the bill.  I find it intriguing, if 
not disturbing, that the governing party would not see fit to 
accept this motion.  Indeed, I now really worry about the kinds 
of appointments that will take place in Citizenship and 
Immigration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One area of controversy with this bill has been the revocation 
of citizenship.  Revocation of citizenship is no small matter. It 
is very serious.  This issue has attracted a lot of attention 
recently, especially since the parliamentary secretary voted 
against his own government and then resigned from the position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This party is comfortable with the provisions that are in the 
new legislation.  If a revocation occurs, the individual is free 
to appeal all the way to the supreme court.  On the other hand, 
our parliamentary traditions are respected.  We feel an 
individual's rights in dealing with the state will be protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said at the outset, this is a busy time for Citizenship and 
Immigration.  We have been dealing with two pieces of legislation 
making their way through the House and through committee. 
Citizenship and immigration go hand in hand.  Citizenship is 
dependent on immigration, so it is hard to discuss one without 
discussing the other.  If it were not for immigration, there 
would not be much need for citizenship, so allow me to address a 
couple of issues in immigration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The need for a new immigration bill has been known for quite 
some time also.  It is something we should have looked at a long 
time ago.  There are serious issues around immigration.  The 
Canadian public seldom receive assurances that criminals are 
being kept out of the country.  Border control is an issue. 
Newspaper articles just a couple of weeks ago were talking about 
more undocumented arrivals from China.  One article said that we 
could possibly expect another 1,200 arrivals by boat on the west 
coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I realize that in the new immigration bill, the minister has 
raised fines and penalties and is trying to secure better 
relations in these matters with China.  Fines and punishment work 
well, but there is only one problem:  A lack of both human and 
financial resources means these people are not being caught. 
CIC officials are strapped as it is.  Now, with added pressures 
to recognize and catch criminals, it will be very difficult. I 
hope the government has acknowledged the predictions of more 
arrivals and has a sufficient contingency plan in place.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can speak with some experience about our border officials.  I 
have seven border crossings in my riding and these crossings are 
understaffed.   Officers work alone and unarmed.  How are they 
supposed to handle potential security threats to themselves or 
the country?  Furthermore, these officials do not have the 
training in immigration matters required to deal with the 
technical refugee or immigration cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The department will receive increased funding over the next few 
years but I do not think much will be left for enforcement.  A 
lot of money has been spent already and desperately needed new 
computer systems will cost over $200 million.  Add to this the 
deficiencies the auditor general highlighted in his report last 
month with regard to medical and criminal records, and we find a 
department that is totally strapped. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister must address these issues.  I am not satisfied that 
Bill C-31 will do that.  There are no guarantees for continuing 
funding and no commitment to take photos and fingerprints of new 
arrivals to Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To come back to Bill C-16, this party will be supporting the 
bill.  We are content that the minister took the views of the 
committee into account last year.  As I did say there are a few 
problem areas and we will be watching carefully to ensure that 
citizenship is kept sacred. 
<P><A NAME="LINK163"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Canadian Alliance):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I want to ask the member about the issue of revocation 
of citizenship and about some of the amendments that his party 
voted against yesterday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These amendments were supported by the official opposition, by 
members of the Bloc and by groups that presented to committee.  I 
would suggest that the member has selective memory when he says 
that the issues which were brought to committee were dealt with 
in this bill, particularly on such an important issue as the 
issue of revocation of citizenship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The B'nai Brith, in a press release yesterday, and the German 
Canadian Congress have made it very clear that they thought these 
motions should have been supported and that they would have 
improved the bill in a way that was needed.  They stated that the 
motions designated as Motions Nos. 4 and 5, Group No. 2, at 
report stage, made the bill more just.  They said that the 
motions would have modernized, simplified and expedited the 
process of revoking or not revoking a person's citizenship. They 
said that the motions would not only have made it more just— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Could I ask the 
member to come right to his question?  We have bells at 5.30 p.m. 
and we need to give the member a moment to respond. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit:</B>  Mr. Speaker, in light of those 
comments and comments made by the Canadian German Congress and 
others, how can the member support the bill when revocation of 
citizenship is left in the hands of cabinet rather than the 
courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Price:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think that is very easy 
to say and the member for Lakeland said it himself.  He said that 
in both letters that he had the people understood.  I do not 
think that is very clear, which is part of the problem.  If we 
look at all the others who did not agree with the motion, the 
Canadian Jewish Congress being one, the minister has first say on 
it, yes, but then it does go through the court system.  The other 
way, it goes through the court system first.  It has to go all 
the way through the court system and then the minister has the 
say at the end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not the logical way.  I have no comfort with that part 
at all.  I have no problem dealing with it as it is now.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast, Canadian 
Alliance)</B> moved that Bill C-334, an act to amend the criminal 
code (wearing of war decorations), be read the second time and 
referred to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to begin second reading 
debate on my private members' bill, Bill C-334, an act to amend 
the criminal code (wearing of war decorations). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill would allow relatives of a deceased veteran to wear 
any decoration awarded to such veterans without facing criminal 
sanction.  The decoration must be worn on the right side of the 
relative's chest and would be limited to Remembrance Day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My bill would amend section 419 of the criminal code.  It would 
renumber this section as section 419(1) and would add the 
following: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(2) No person who is a relative of a deceased veteran commits an 
offence under paragraph (1)(b) where the person wears, on the 
right side of the person's chest, a distinctive mark relating to 
wounds received or service performed in war by that veteran or 
wears, on the right side of the person's chest, a military medal, 
ribbon, badge, chevron or any decoration or order that is awarded 
to that veteran for war services and the person does so on 
Remembrance Day. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, my amendment makes it acceptable for a person who has 
been legally adopted by a relative of a deceased veteran or by 
that veteran to wear these decorations as prescribed in the first 
part of my amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the outset allow me to say that my initiative is not meant to 
diminish or dishonour the service, sacrifice or valour of our 
veterans and those who have been awarded decorations. On the 
contrary, it is meant to celebrate and recognize the sacrifice 
and this achievement. Additionally it is meant to recognize and 
acknowledge bravery, gallantry and commitment to our nation. My 
initiative is meant to enhance and reinforce the honour bestowed 
on these very brave individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My initiative comes from the relatives of veterans who fear that 
decorations awarded to their family members are being forgotten 
and put away in dusty boxes and drawers.  They, like me, believe 
the time has come to move with the times and not let these 
precious decorations collect dust somewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I further believe the time has come to follow the lead of Great 
Britain, Australia and New Zealand, our Commonwealth partners 
which amended their respective laws to reflect the times and the 
need to unveil these decorations and re-commemorate the valour of 
those who were awarded these with such distinction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The law I seek to amend was written in 1920.  It certainly 
served the purpose it was intended to do back then but it is not 
reflective of the hard facts of today. Our veterans are passing 
on and their decorations are hidden in dusty trunks, forgotten, 
never to be seen again, all because of a 1920 law.  If they are 
not in trunks, they appear in flea markets where they are at the 
mercy of hucksters out to make a buck.  Is this dignified or an 
honour to the veteran to whom it was awarded?  I certainly think 
not. In fact it is offensive, undignified and a dishonour to the 
veteran.  There is not a dollar figure that can be put on these 
decorations. They are priceless and should be viewed that way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, the section of the criminal code I seek to amend, 
section 419, is derived from a time when legitimate veterans did 
not want those who did not serve to buy these decorations and 
wear them.  That had great merit and cause and was right for the 
times.   Who would want someone who had not served in the great 
wars insulting the valour and bravery of those who sacrificed 
their lives? But this is year 2000 and I consider locked up 
medals a diminishment of the honour and respect they should 
garner.  They should be exhibited by rightful relatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned that times have changed.  So has membership in the 
Royal Canadian Legion.  Sadly our veterans are passing on.  The 
last remaining vestige of the bravery of our war veterans is in 
many cases the decorations awarded to their family members. 
Why should it be a crime for a relative to want to display the 
decoration and thus honour their deceased relative?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hard facts concerning declining legion membership should 
give pause to reconsider the archaic law I seek to change.  In 
December 1998 legion membership stood at 494,107.  By December 
1999 it had fallen to 478,494.  In Pacific command in my specific 
area membership has dropped to 90,394 from 93,612 from 1998 to 
1999. In Ontario command the trend is the same.  It has fallen to 
about 181,007 from 186,562. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The trend is the same in every province in Canada.  As our 
veterans keep aging, the trend will not only continue but will 
speed up.  Where will it be in 10 years? In my own riding of West 
Vancouver—Sunshine Coast membership of Branch 60 in West 
Vancouver has fallen from 788 to 731. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, our veterans are aging and their relatives and family 
members wish to hold on to some vestige of the bravery these 
great Canadians exhibited.  Allowing them to wear the decorations 
on Remembrance Day is not asking too much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the trend in membership, I should point out that of the 
731 of Branch 60 in West Vancouver, there are 368 ordinary 
members and some 244 associate members.  There are not a lot of 
veterans left. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Allow me to give a more demonstrated breakdown of 
the age of legion members.  I believe the trend will be even more 
startling regarding the mortality of war veterans.  Of legion 
members, 44% are over the age of 65.  Another 18% are age 55 to 
64.  That accounts for 298,840 of the 478,000 total membership. 
When we factor in membership by age and gender, we find out that 
25.17% or 120,577 are 75 or older; 9.98% or 47,836 are age 70 to 
74; and another 9.10% or 43,663 are age 65 to 69. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our veterans are indeed aging, as we all are.  Would it not be a 
positive gesture to remember them by allowing their families to 
proudly display their decorations as their veteran family members 
pass on? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My motivation to move the bill comes from individuals whose 
family members were awarded medals and have passed on.  They wish 
to honour their deceased war veterans and heroes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One individual in particular, Christine Ballantine of West 
Vancouver, a legion member herself, has mounted a campaign to see 
this initiative realized. She recognizes that our veterans are 
passing on and she wants to honour her father, a decorated 
veteran, by wearing his medals on Remembrance Day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She has, as I said, mounted a campaign and gathered support from 
many legion branches. Besides her West Vancouver branch, 
Christine has gathered written support of the Howe Sound zone of 
the Royal Canadian Legion comprising approximately 3,800 members 
in six legions. She has also received support from the Sooke 
branch of Vancouver Island and the Whitehorse, Yukon branch. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My bill has also received support from the Billy Bishop branch 
in Vancouver and I believe in B.C. some 5,339 are on board.  I 
understand it is growing as recognition of the genesis, 
motivation and honourable and historical intentions of my bill 
become evident. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Allow me to read some of the comments I have received from some 
of the legion branches supporting my bill.  The Sooke branch of 
the Royal Canadian Legion writes, “We consider it would 
strengthen reverence of Remembrance Day”.  The Whitehorse, Yukon 
branch writes, “It would enhance Remembrance Day services by 
allowing family members to bring medals out on Remembrance Day 
and thus perpetuate the act of remembrance”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is my motivation: to recognize this important day and the 
significant and selfless contributions of our veterans who need 
to be honoured in a dignified and demonstrable fashion for many, 
many years to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to see the interest and support of the Royal 
Canadian Legion and the work it does to continue.  Individuals 
make the legion what it has become.  Members are the institution. 
The institution is not larger than the membership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Allowing remaining family members who may be members of the 
legion or inclined to become new members to wear their family 
decorations would help sustain and invigorate this important 
institution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To honour the past is laudatory, but let not the past disallow 
an act of remembrance by family members of veterans.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have received a letter from a very distinguished gentleman, 
Dr. John Blatherwick, who is a British Columbia doctor and has 
served that province well.  He is regarded as an authority on the 
issue of war decorations.  In fact, he has devoted a great amount 
of his time to the study and promotion of the issue of war 
decorations.  Lest we forget. I would like to quote from his 
letter of support for my bill. He writes: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question you have to ask is—What harm would removing the law 
create?  It would not take away from any legion members' medals 
in any way.  It would not debase the value of the person who was 
awarded the medal in any way.  So it would not harm anybody. What 
good would it do—It would keep that connection with the past and 
help some people to remember.  Bill C-334 is a good bill and it 
makes common sense. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Dr. Blatherwick also says, the problem with common sense is 
that it ain't so common.  He is, of course, quoting Will Rogers. 
Naturally, I hope common sense will prevail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dr. Blatherwick asked why we in Canada still cling to an old law 
regarding the wearing of medals.  The answer he says is again, a 
lack of common sense.  He is quite emphatic and states that some 
keep their heads firmly in the past and are out of step with 
today.  He says, as I mentioned earlier, the United Kingdom, 
Australia and New Zealand see no problem with moving on. They do 
not want to put people in jail for remembering. Surely Canadians 
do not want to see the family members of veterans put in jail 
either.  We should be trying to keep alive the memory of those 
who served rather than hide their sacrifices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dr. Blatherwick points out that it has been a long time since 
Canada has been involved in a declared shooting war. The 
peacekeeping forces in the former Yugoslavia have been shot at 
but they get the same peacekeeping medal that has been issued to 
multitudes of non-shooting missions.  One could not tell a 
shooting United Nations medal from a non-shooting United Nations 
medal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to this expert, as he further points out, we were at 
war in the gulf but did not suffer any casualties. As he says, 
the last real shooting war was Korea and before that, World War 
II. Therefore, there is not much danger in young men or women 
wearing medals they are not entitled to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He feels the entire exercise surrounding this issue boils down 
to one of common sense.  As he says, if the legion wants November 
11 and the Battle of the Atlantic Sunday and the Battle of 
Britain day and other military celebrations to remain important, 
one way is to encourage those medals to come out of the drawers 
and boxes and be displayed by the veterans' loved ones on 
Remembrance Day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask members to read this speech again if they are concerned 
about this over the next few months while this is being debated 
because Dr. Blatherwick, as I mentioned, is well respected in my 
province and is an expert on war medals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe these decorations are a birthright for the family 
members of those who were awarded them and sadly can no longer 
display them.  Allowing family members to wear these decorations 
is a dignified way to honour their family member for the 
sacrifice they made.  I firmly believe that those family members 
would treat and display these decorations with the respect that 
they deserve.  I do not believe they would take this honour 
lightly or be frivolous in the manner they display the 
decoration. Those individuals who are moved to recognize their 
deceased veteran take this issue seriously and with the dignity 
and respect that it warrants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not forget, but let us not make criminals of those who 
want to remember their veterans. 
<P><A NAME="LINK179"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Wood (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Veterans 
Affairs, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak to Bill 
C-334 which if passed will allow relatives to wear a deceased 
veteran's medal on Remembrance Day on the right side of the 
chest. On the surface this would seem like a reasonable idea. But 
if we scratch the surface, we will see why, for reasons of 
history and tradition, of practice and principle, this bill is 
not a good idea. Let me start with history and tradition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Gallantry and war service medals are personal honours.  They are 
intended only for those who earn them by virtue of their service 
or their action on the battlefield.  It is a tradition based in 
law, a law whose original proponent was the great War Veterans 
Association which was the Royal Canadian Legion's predecessor 
organization.  It is a tradition that dates back to 1920. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most veterans then and most veterans now oppose the idea of 
someone else wearing their medals.  They quite rightly feel that 
for someone else to wear their medals constitutes both a 
misrepresentation of fact and a misappropriation of the honour. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1830"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT46"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These feelings are very strongly held, both by veterans 
themselves and their representative associations, including the 
Royal Canadian Legion, the National Council of Veterans 
Associations in Canada, and the army, navy and air force veterans 
in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely, if we are to listen to anyone's wishes on the matter we 
must take our primary guidance from the men and women who were 
awarded the medals in the first place by virtue of their devotion 
to duty, their sacrifice and their courage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is fair to say that the vast majority of the public, 
when they see veterans walking in Remembrance Day parades, assume 
that the wearers are those who earned them.  They would be right. 
However, if this bill were to pass that assumption would go out 
the window.  No one would know during the parade who was wearing 
what medal or for what reason. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that the bill calls for the relatives to wear the 
medals on the right side of the chest, while the legitimate 
recipient of the medals, the veterans, wear them on the left. 
Such a distinction would be lost on many. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I might add that the bill does not even define what constitutes 
a relative.  Presumably its provisions are primarily targeted at 
children and grandchildren of deceased veterans.  What about 
stepchildren if they have not been legally adopted?  What about 
half sisters and brothers?  What about nephews and nieces?  What 
about cousins? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One can easily see in the years to come how these medals might 
be inherited by design or happenstance by relatives who are very 
far removed in their family relationship to the veterans who 
earned them.  Would they claim the right to wear them also?  How 
diminished would their symbolic value be when there is no 
personal claim to the service they represent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every November 11 we see veterans marching proudly, their medals 
polished brightly on their blazer lapels.  We who watch them 
applaud them as they go by in admiration and respect for their 
deeds.  With the passage of Bill C-334 it would be entirely 
conceivable, especially with the passage of years, that we would 
be applauding people wearing medals they neither earned nor 
deserved.  We could not even be sure they were being worn by a 
veteran's relative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once we let the genie out of the bottle we could never put it 
back in.  The guarantee of proper comportment would be gone 
forever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Heroism, sacrifice and service are not transferable 
characteristics to be worn from one generation to the next.  They 
are the result of specific actions, and each of us must earn 
whatever distinctions that come our way by our own actions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What would be passed on are the medals themselves.  They should 
be passed on.  They should be kept in the family or the 
community, proudly displayed or framed, perhaps alongside a 
picture of a veteran, as many families today have chosen to do. 
They just cannot be worn, and should not be worn, by anyone other 
than those who have actually received them for service to their 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can appreciate the sentiment that was expressed by the sponsor 
of Bill C-334 and some of his constituents.  I can also 
appreciate a concern, as our war veterans dwindle in numbers, 
that somehow allowing relatives to wear the deceased veterans' 
medals on Remembrance Day would fill the void.  I believe this 
would not be the case, nor is it the point of our opposition to 
Bill C-334. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further, I would suggest that there remain many ways of 
honouring a veteran's memory other than wearing his or her 
medals.  As I have already indicated, their appropriate display 
at home or even in local museums or community centres would be a 
valuable contribution to their remembrance.  Even better, why not 
participate in acts of community good in the name of the 
veteran's memory and participate in or organize events for 
Veterans' Week each year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that the very best way to keep the memory of our 
veterans alive is to tell their stories to our children and 
grandchildren.  That is all they have ever asked of us:  to 
remember what they did for us so long ago and what members of the 
current forces do for us today.  To fulfil that promise would do 
far more to honour their memory than appropriating their medals 
one day each year.

</I></B></P><P align=left>For all of these reasons, and despite the good intentions that 
may lie behind this proposition, the Government of Canada cannot 
support Bill C-334. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK180"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
first I wish to inform the sponsor of Bill C-334 that the Bloc 
Quebecois supports his initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it hard to understand the explanations provided by the 
government regarding this bill. Indeed, if we read it correctly, 
it answers at least two questions raised by the hon. member. 
First, how to distinguish the person who is wearing the 
decoration from the person who was awarded it? A spouse or child 
wears it, while it was awarded to the father, who is dead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill clearly states that the relative would wear the medals 
on the right side of the chest. I am not an expert on medals. 
The hon. member opposite surely knows a lot more than I do, even 
though he claims it is not the case. We all know that an 
individual wears the medals that he won on a battlefield on the 
left side of his chest. Therefore, we would immediately realize 
that, if a person wears such decorations on the right side of 
the chest, that person is not the one who was awarded these 
decorations, but a relative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to say something and I want hon. members to open 
their ears because this is from a Bloc Quebecois member, from a 
mean separatist. If my father or my grandfather had died in one 
of the two world wars, or in another war, to preserve freedom 
and democracy and Canada had participated in these operations, I 
would be very proud to wear his decorations on the right side to 
clearly identify me as a relative of the person to whom they 
were awarded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, the government is showing a lack of sensitivity. 
Here we have an arrogant government announcing “Here I am.  I am 
in the driver's seat.  I am the boss.  As for you people over 
there, nothing you have to say is any good”.  I find that 
deplorable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had some questions, however, and I would like to propose that 
this bill be voted on by the House and discussed in committee. 
The term “relative” can be confusing, but it could be clarified. 
Do first cousins qualify, for instance?  Is it only direct 
lineage or indirect as well?  The bill could very easily 
identify what is meant by “relative”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once a year we have Remembrance Day.  Decorated service people 
who have died cannot tell us that they would be delighted to see 
their grandchildren, their widow or their mother wearing their 
medals, but I think we can put ourselves in their place for a 
few moments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people left wives, children and parents behind when they 
went to war.  They lost their lives and were decorated.  I 
believe it would be very humane to allow a relative—mother, 
widow, child or grandchild—to wear on Remembrance Day the medal 
or medals which their family member had earned during the world 
wars or some other conflict in which he served his country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also wonder about another point, which merits examination. 
The desire is to amend section 419 of the Criminal Code, which 
states “Everyone who, without lawful authority, the proof of 
which lies on him, wears a medal—” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are there examples of court rulings or case law where an 
individual has worn the medal of a deceased war veteran and been 
charged with a criminal offence?  If this is the case, it makes 
no sense.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before us today is an attempt to regulate common sense. 
I think that section 419 covers the situation I have just 
described; there is a legitimate authorization, which goes 
without saying.  If that is not the case, then the bill is 
necessary and it should be passed at this stage and considered 
in committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should all be in agreement with such a bill.  I urge veterans 
to make their views known, before the government votes against 
such a bill.  If they agree with it, they should call their 
member of parliament, the government members, so that they show 
a little more sensitivity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since this is the first hour of debate, there is still time to 
backtrack and to vote in favour of this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois supports Bill C-334, and I congratulate its 
sponsor on his initiative.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
very pleased to have the opportunity speak to private member's 
Bill C-334, and act to amend the criminal code with respect to 
the wearing of war decorations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member of the federal New Democratic Party I stand in 
support of this move to allow families of deceased veterans to 
wear their veterans' war decorations on Remembrance Day.  Great 
Britain, Australia and New Zealand have already enacted such laws 
and I believe it is high time that the Canadian government 
followed suit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recognize that not all veterans feel the same about this 
issue.  It is with the deepest respect for veterans on both sides 
of this debate that I offer my thoughts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Veterans feel passionate about this issue because the medals and 
other recognitions of effort were earned the hard way and speak 
of great sacrifice, effort and love for this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, such a law would, in effect, keep these efforts, this 
bravery, valour and commitment to Canada alive through the 
families of the veterans.  Surely family members would wear these 
badges of honour with the dignity which they deserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The section of the criminal code which this bill would amend was 
legislated at a time when there was serious cause for concern 
about people who had not served sporting medals they had not 
earned.  However, I believe that allowing family members to wear 
their deceased loved one's medals on Remembrance Day is a way to 
maintain the honour and respect that the medals reflect. 
Otherwise, years down the road when there are no more veterans of 
the two world wars and the Korean war, the medals earned through 
valour and effort will be gone from the landscape of Remembrance 
Day and the very essence of Remembrance Day, which is to 
remember.  That very essence would be lost a bit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I have decided to support the bill.  I certainly had 
hoped that the federal government would support this effort, but 
from the speech I heard earlier I see that the government does 
not want to support it.  That does not surprise me too much 
because far too often we see situations where the government does 
not support our military and our veterans the way it should. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had a rather sad occasion a few months back when a veteran 
came to my office with his war medals.  He wanted to turn the 
medals over to me because he was so disappointed and so 
discouraged with the way he saw the government treating veterans. 
He had been a member of the merchant navy and also a member of 
the regular service, but he cited a number of examples as to why 
he was concerned and why he felt discouraged about the way the 
government was treating people who came back home from missions 
who were ill, people who had served in the merchant marine and so 
forth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was quite a sad state of affairs to listen to this 
individual, who had obviously, through bravery, through valour, 
through commitment to his country, devoted a good portion of his 
life, and he had earned these medals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I talked with him quite a bit and suggested that perhaps his 
family may have some reason to want to have these medals as a 
legacy, as a part of their heritage to reflect what he had done. 
I also suggested that, regardless of what may have happened to 
make him disappointed with the government, regardless of what had 
taken place, when he earned his medals he earned them for a 
reason and the value should not be diminished by the poor 
treatment he has received since then.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nonetheless, he was very much concerned about returning these 
medals, and I think even today he still wants to do that.  It is 
very sad.  I am really appalled that our government would relate 
to our people in a way that citizens would feel this way about 
the service they have performed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am appalled that the government has not brought justice to 
those veterans who were wrongly put in the Buchenwald 
concentration camp.  Those Canadian troops who suffered the 
horrors of living in Buchenwald deserve appropriate compensation 
and it is up to this Liberal government to ensure that such 
compensation is delivered.  It is appalling that this government 
tried to buy the silence of these veterans for about $1,000 each. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of these veterans, a constituent of mine who I have spoken 
about before, Mr. William Gibson, made it clear that this 
so-called compensation was offensive.  This constituent, who 
survived the horrors of Buchenwald concentration camp, sent the 
cheque that he had been given back to the Liberal government with 
the word refused written across this payoff, which he felt was 
insulting to him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those veterans, who were interred in the Nazi Buchenwald 
concentration camp instead of a prisoner of war camp where they 
should have been, feel very let down by their government.  Other 
governments have had the ability to convince the German 
government to provide appropriate reparation.  Our government has 
failed itself and failed these brave Canadians miserably.  I do 
not understand the inability of the government to secure a just 
settlement for these Canadians.  It is something that we will 
continue to work on and continue to push because we feel it is 
necessary that justice be brought about in that situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps even more insulting than the cheque to these Canadians, 
were the words that the Minister of Veterans Affairs, in his 
accompanying letter, said when he presented his cheque to them. 
He said  “I am delighted to be able to close the chapter on this 
longstanding issue”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, we should be concerned because the issue is not closed 
and there should be more action to try to resolve this 
outstanding issue.  The issue was raised in committee in 1994, in 
letters to the veterans affairs, defence and foreign ministers in 
1997.  It has been raised many times but the government has not 
succeeded in bringing about justice in that situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will close with a comment my constituent made when addressing 
the Nova Scotia government committee on veterans affairs in 
February 2000 concerning this issue.  He said “We have been 
fighting for German compensation since 1945, but we haven't got 
it yet and I don't know if we ever will get it because I don't 
think there is anybody in Ottawa who has the intestinal fortitude 
to go after it”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the government to respond positively to this issue. 
Such a positive response would encourage our veterans to be proud 
of what was accomplished through their devotion and dedication to 
their country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill we are looking at today is a step where the government 
could respond positively, could again inspire our veterans and 
their families with the kind of hope and inspiration that makes 
them proud to have served their country.  This could be done by 
recognizing that certainly the loved ones of these veterans would 
only want to wear these medals because of their pride in what 
their loved one has done and has sacrificed for this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Positive action on this bill by our government would give the 
families of the deceased veterans cause to be proud to wear these 
medals knowing that while they did not earn the medals, the 
medals reflect the accomplishments of their loved ones who fought 
and died for freedom and for the love of this country and their 
fellow human beings.  That is a very noble thing for the 
government and parliament to consider. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not talking about enabling people to make false 
representations.  Nobody has that in mind with this bill. It is 
important that we look at this in a positive way rather than 
trying to find a way to prevent this from taking place.  Let us 
remember them.  We must remember them and we will remember them.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is an 
honour to rise once again in the House regarding our very heroic 
and valiant war veterans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to state from the outset that my party is not in 
favour of the hon. member's bill. I am not against the hon. 
member's attempt to help recognize the sacrifices made by our 
very brave veterans and my party is not against the families of 
veterans honouring the memories of their ancestors and their 
accomplishments in battle. 
We are not against Canadians being proud of our country's 
military history, heritage and the sacrifices that have been 
made.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are against is the overriding of the will of the 
existing veterans who are here today:  the Royal Canadian Legion 
and its membership, the Army, Navy and Air Force Veterans 
Association, along with the War Amps and others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been in touch with the dominion command of the Royal 
Canadian Legion.  This afternoon I was in touch with my 
provincial command of the Royal Canadian Legion in New Brunswick. 
Neither the dominion command nor the provincial command offices 
support what is recommended by the hon. member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact remains that medals are very personal awards.  They are 
awarded to specific people for specific acts of valour.  It is an 
honour and a privilege that has been earned through sacrifice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In deciding what I wanted to say on this very emotional and 
sensitive issue, I consulted with the vets and heard their side 
of the argument.  I have two brothers who served overseas in 
France, Germany and Belgium and there is no way that my 
sisters-in-law would ever want to wear their medals if my 
brothers passed away.  They would frame them and have them on 
display for their children and grandchildren.  They feel that for 
them to wear these medals would be an insult to the sacrifices 
made by my brothers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also understand the reasons that my hon. colleague from West 
Vancouver—Sunshine Coast put forth this bill having reviewed his 
information.   My heart goes out to such people as Christine 
Ballantine and the Pacific command office of the legion who agree 
with this bill and are proud of their family and country history. 
These Canadians do not want to be considered criminals for 
displaying family heirlooms by wearing the decorations on 
Remembrance Day.  However, it is a criminal act.  Under the 
criminal code no one can wear those medals except the veterans. 
That is what the law currently states.  In speaking with the 
dominion command of the Royal Canadian Legion, it has not spoken 
out in favour of making changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe that it is up to the House of Commons to 
determine for veterans who should be allowed to wear these 
decorations of honour.  I believe we should listen to our 
veterans as to who they feel it should be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In consulting with veterans on their stance on this issue, it 
has been brought to my attention very clearly that this matter 
has been brought forward by the Pacific command office as a 
resolution for an upcoming convention.  The resolution was 
reviewed and the committee did not concur with the resolution 
being brought forward.  The dominion command office reiterated 
today that it stands against this bill's premise.  They 
understand the intent of families who believe they can promote 
Remembrance Day by wearing the medals, but the veterans 
associations do not agree with this action.  The dominion command 
office believes and states that medals are not symbols of 
remembrance but rather they are symbols of service and commitment 
made by those men and women who were overseas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Until such time as we, in the House of Commons, receive a very 
clear message from all of our veterans as a whole, I believe we 
would be doing a grave disservice to our honoured war veterans by 
agreeing to this recommendation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I propose that those families, veterans or legion members who 
are looking for a change in the law should make it known to their 
local legions and to dominion command, as only through 
communication can change ever be achieved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I maintain that we let the veterans themselves tell us what they 
want to do.  It is their honour and it should be up to them to 
decide if and with whom they would like to share it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would never propose that this House, which has only 12 members 
out of 301 who have any military service, should ever change a 
law that takes away the special recognition deserved by those who 
have sacrificed so much in serving their country in the interest 
of peace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While clearly the intent of the bill is to honour our valiant 
soldiers and their bravery, there is the strong possibility that 
the medals will slowly lose their significance. 
We have to be aware that some living veterans who proudly wear 
their medals on Remembrance Day could be offended by those who 
are wearing medals earned by others for their special acts of 
valour.  Is that fair to our living and proud veterans of today?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My final question about this bill, if it does pass, is: Who 
qualifies as a relative?  Other than specifying that adopted 
relatives are also eligible to wear the medals, there are no 
specifications on who is wearing and parading around in those 
hallowed decorations of honour.  There are no checks to be 
maintained or record of who is wearing the decoration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will a veteran's third cousin by marriage be wearing the medals 
or decorations, or the veteran's eldest child?  Understandably, 
this is a decision to be made by each family if this were to 
pass, but where is the honour that goes with wearing the medals? 
Where is maintaining and restraining enforcement?  Certainly 
there must be a status of decorum that must be upheld, and I do 
not see that in this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I state again, a war decoration is given to a particular person 
for a particular act of valour.  Just as only the person who has 
earned the Order of Canada can wear the pin or medal, only a 
person who has proven determination, valour and courage can wear 
a war medal, and rightfully so.  Not friends.  Not relatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that once a medal recipient has passed on, the 
decoration should be treated as a representation of the service 
and sacrifice of the veteran who earned it and display as such. I 
fear that it will be perceived through the passage of time to be 
a less substantial piece of jewellery just to be passed around. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me be clear.  I am not saying that those who are asking for 
change now have that ill intent.  Certainly not.  However, we 
must be wary and conscious of that possibility.  Do we want to 
open that door a little crack to allow that to happen? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For decades families have been framing the medals for display 
and they take the framed and preserved medals with them when they 
wish to display them.  They are treasured and the significance of 
their value is maintained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is how the memories of our Canadian war veterans have been 
preserved in the past.  My party maintains the position of the 
Royal Canadian Legion on this issue.  We cannot in good 
conscience dishonour the wishes of our Canadian war veterans. 
Therefore, we will not support Bill C-334. 
<P><A NAME="LINK183"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Canadian Alliance):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in my parliamentary capacity as official opposition 
critic for veterans affairs, I am pleased to rise today to 
contribute to the debate on Bill C-334, an act to amend the 
criminal code, wearing of war decorations, sponsored by the hon. 
member for West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>War medals in Canada represent a long and proud tradition of 
service to our country.  Shortly after Confederation, Canadians, 
both French and English, joined to halt the Fenian raiders and 
the Red River insurrection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1870, to commemorate this service, Canada's first medal was 
struck.  It was emblazoned with ribbon striped in red, white and 
red, appropriately the colours of Canada's present flag.  The 
maple leaf, long the symbol for Canada and carved in the walls of 
the trenches at Vimy Ridge, borders the medal.  This medal, and 
now our flag, are proud reminders of Canada's first war veterans' 
successful efforts at keeping Canada whole and defending our 
freedoms from insurrection and foreign invasion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is presently a criminal code offence for anyone, other than 
the holder of war medals, to wear them.  Under Bill C-334 it is 
proposed that section 419 of the criminal code be amended by 
adding a section permitting a relative of a deceased veteran to 
wear on Remembrance Day any medal that has been awarded to that 
deceased veteran.  To clearly indicate that the medals were not 
awarded to the relative, such persons are to wear them on the 
right side of the chest rather than the left side, as is 
customary among actual veterans.  To avoid confusion, relatives 
who are in the Canadian military and in uniform are not permitted 
to wear the deceased veteran's medals.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current prohibition against relatives wearing the medals of 
veterans is comparatively unique among commonwealth countries. 
Great Britain apparently has no law governing the issue.  This 
does not mean there is an endorsed practice concerning the 
wearing of military honours by family members.  It simply means 
that in Great Britain the issue has been largely left to the 
public's best judgment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Australia legislation provides that a family member of a 
deceased veteran may wear a service decoration if the family 
member does not represent himself as being the war veteran. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the United States, by contrast, the practice is specifically 
prohibited as it is in Canada.  In the United States a medal may 
be pinned on the next of kin of a deceased veteran, but such 
pinning does not entitle the next of kin to wear the medal 
publicly.  It remains the property and the honour of the deceased 
alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is noteworthy that the prohibition of the wearing of medals 
and related honours is found in a criminal code section which 
addresses the unlawful use of military uniforms or certificates 
as well.  The matter is considered to be so serious that there is 
a reverse onus of proof.  The accused must prove that he or she 
had lawful authority to wear a Canadian forces uniform or medal 
or to be in possession of a military discharge certificate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are several arguments made in support of permitting 
relatives of Canadian war veterans to wear their war honours, at 
least on Remembrance Day.  One of the key advocates of Bill C-334 
is Christine Ballantine, a constituent of the hon. member for 
West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast.  As has been publicly reported, 
the issue is of particular importance to her since she never knew 
her father who died in the second world war when she was about 
eight months old. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ms. Ballantine's father was a British airman.  His war medals 
are in her possession.  In 1994, upon visiting Normandy where her 
father died, Ms. Ballantine personally received an additional 
medal awarded to her father by the Government of France. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Ms. Ballantine were attending Remembrance Day ceremonies in 
Britain she could wear her father's medals in honour of his 
memory without fearing that she had committed an offence.  In 
Canada she must wear the medals concealed under her coat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Royal Canadian Legion appears to be of two minds with 
respect to the bill.  The Dominion Command appears to have strong 
reservations while local legion representatives are more 
supportive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One main argument for permitting the wearing of war medals by 
relatives relates to the diminishing number of war veterans. Many 
of the medals and related honours are now either private family 
mementoes or the currency of collectors.  The public's 
association with the actual person who was honoured diminishes 
year by year as our veterans pass away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where the bill could be improved is with respect to defining the 
term of relative.  Relative should be defined to mean the widow 
or widower of a deceased veteran or a parent, child, brother, 
sister, grandparent or grandchild, whether by blood, marriage or 
adoption.  Such definition would appear to provide constructive 
limitations as to which family members could wear the medals. 
Nephews and nieces and others not as closely connected to the 
deceased veteran would not be able to honour him or her through 
the wearing of medals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The definition of relative could be expanded as times change and 
circumstances warrant.  Under the current definition, if adopted, 
the youngest relative who could wear the medal of a deceased 
veteran would be his or her grandchild. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the bill the wearing by relatives on Remembrance Day of 
any ribbon, badge, chevron, decoration or order is also 
permitted.  In my opinion the bill should be limited in 
application to medals, in particular full size Canadian or 
commonwealth general service issue medals as opposed to 
miniatures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My reason for restricting the application of the bill is based 
on the question of how one could wear a ribbon, badge, chevron or 
any decoration or order when it is specified in the bill that 
relatives are to wear the medals on the right side of their 
chest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The term chevron refers to a badge in a V shape, sewn on the 
sleeve of a uniform indicating rank or length of service. 
Similarly such honours as the Order of Military Merit are not 
awarded as a medal but as a pendant to be worn around the neck. 
A relative wearing such an honour around the neck could not be 
readily distinguished from another who earned the honour.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For these reasons I suggest that the bill be limited to medals 
only and will propose an amendment to that effect.  I therefore 
would encourage that Bill C-334 be amended as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That subsection 2 of section 1 of Bill C-334 be amended by 
deleting the words “ribbon, badge, chevron or any decoration or 
order” contained therein. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a noble and worthwhile objective to permit close relatives 
to honour their departed veteran family members on Remembrance 
Day through the public display of their medals of honour. However 
this view is not shared by any major veterans organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that during the committee hearings these organizations 
will reconsider their position.  I consider myself to be obliged 
to respect their wishes.  As they are the representatives and the 
voices of veterans for the vast majority of veterans and 
ex-service personnel in Canada, I will reflect the collective 
wishes of these veterans when we vote.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with what my colleague from Berthier—Montcalm said 
earlier. I am surprised that some parties are opposed to this 
bill, although I agree with the argument as to what veterans 
want in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as I am concerned, I will repeat what my colleague has 
said. Wearing decorations on the right side clearly shows that 
the person wearing them is not a veteran but a relative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the committee to specify what relative means. It 
would obviously be too broad a definition if distant cousins 
were included. It ought to include only the veteran's mother, 
widow or children. It ought not to include anyone else. The term 
relative should be more narrowly defined.

the bill.  I join my colleagues on this side of the House in 
opposing Bill C-334, and oppose it we must. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have no doubt about the sincere intentions of the sponsoring 
member across the way and his desire to meet his constituents' 
wishes to wear a deceased relative's medals.  Quite frankly, the 
way he has explained it seems very reasonable.  What could be the 
harm in that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, this is one of those cases where the countering 
argument is much stronger, not because we on this side say so but 
rather that the opposition comes from a very impeccable source, 
as my colleague has already indicated, and that is the legions 
and the individuals involved in these conflicts who have earned 
the right to wear medals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If anyone has the right to have a significant say-so in this 
matter, surely no one could argue that it would be those who won 
the medals for the service they performed or for the acts of 
courage they displayed.  I am talking about the veterans, the men 
and women who served with such distinction over 100 years in 
world wars and in Korea defending home shores, seas and skies, 
and in the peacekeeping hot spots all over the world.  These 
medals and awards were not easily offered or won.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The legion recently shared those concerns in a letter to the 
sponsor of Bill C-334 in very precise terms.  Some of these 
concerns were repeated in the recent edition of the <I>Legion 
Magazine</I>, quoting Dominion Secretary Duane Daly.  I quote 
directly from the article in the magazine which stated that the 
hon. member for West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—has ruffled a few feathers in the veterans community by 
introducing a private member's bill in the House of Commons that 
would change the rules about who is entitled to wear medals. Bill 
C-334 would amend the Criminal Code to allow relatives of a 
deceased veteran to wear that person's medals on the right side 
of a person's chest to show respect.  Currently it is an offence 
under the Criminal Code for anyone to wear medals that have not 
been issued specifically to that person. 
</UL></UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The law, as it is now, was the result of the lobbying by the 
Great War Veterans Association, the predecessor of the Royal 
Canadian Legion.  We have in fact been working for years to 
destroy the myth that such wearing of medals is permissible, 
wrote Dominion Secretary Duane Secretary in a letter to (the hon. 
member for West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast).  They are presented 
to a person to reflect the nation's gratitude for service and 
commitment, and are not to be worn as symbols of remembrance.  We 
fear that the bill you are presenting will have the exact 
opposite effect because there will be no control on their 
comportment and thus the significance of the award will be 
compromised. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are pretty strong words reflecting some very heartfelt 
sentiments.  Given the status of the legion, being the largest 
veterans group in the country, I am a little surprised, given its 
views on the matter, that the hon. member has proceeded with the 
bill.  It seems to me that it flies in the face of tradition and 
logic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why he would want to annoy such a representative group of 
veterans is beyond me.  After all, the argument of those veterans 
has much merit.  All they are saying is that those who did not do 
the service, those who did not perform the acts that merit the 
medals, cannot wear them.  To do otherwise would diminish their 
significance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand that a similar position is held by two other major 
veterans organizations, the National Council of Veteran 
Associations in Canada and the Army, Navy and Air Force Veterans 
in Canada.  I dare say their views represent the vast majority of 
all veterans, ex-forces members and medal holders.  I also 
understand that Veterans Affairs Canada feels similarly, as do

</I></B></P><P align=left>For centuries countries have honoured and recognized military 
achievement of their soldiers by awarding a variety of 
decorations and medals.  They announce for all to see that the 
individual has served his or her country with distinction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To reiterate the legion's point, medals are presented to a 
person to reflect the nation's gratitude for service and 
commitment and are not to be worn as symbols of remembrance, 
which I believe the bill is mistakenly trying to do.  Changing 
their significance from service and commitment to remembrance is 
just plain wrong.  Bill C-334 is a well intentioned bill but 
quite frankly it is misguided.  We oppose it for the right 
reasons.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>TRAINING

<P><A NAME="LINK188"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
asked the Minister of Human Resources Development a question on 
budget day 2000.  The question was:  How can the government ask 
Canadians to save and pay for job training when the primary 
responsibilities for limited income families are food and 
shelter? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was in response to a Liberal policy balloon, which at the 
time would have asked people to pay for their own job training. 
In high unemployment areas this issue was an immediate concern 
for us on this side of the House and an immediate concern for the 
region I represent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked the minister why we could not place strategic investment 
in high unemployment regions with direct capital investment for 
public institutions such as community colleges and university 
access colleges.  This would be a solid investment for Canadians 
to rely on for sustainable human and regional development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister asked that I wait for the budget that was to be 
released that afternoon.  We waited and we looked at the budget. 
Certainly there were resources allocated to all departments, but 
the disappointment still remained.  There was still no strategic 
capital investment for education or higher learning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I share Canada's shock and outrage as a result of this budget. 
For every tax dollar that was cut, only 2 cents went to health 
care, and this involves the major portion of the transfers to our 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government is too busy trying to help corporate 
fundraisers.  Rather, it should be paying attention to the 
priorities of Canadians.  I am talking about a health care system 
which is in dire need of repair.  It is in a state of crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians found out that the government had no intention of 
improving the budget for health care, which was later clarified 
with bill 11 in Alberta to privatize hospitals.  This reflects 
the Liberal support for the reform-alliance platform for a two 
tier American health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I share Canada's outrage with student debt loads and rising 
tuition, which is another crisis that is being ignored in this 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ignoring the rising numbers of homeless people and the lack of 
affordable housing are also crises. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could continue to list the bad policies of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a wake up call.  This is a time of surpluses in our 
treasury.  The surpluses are mounting.  It is time to have a 
vision, and certainly not the vision that is being created by the 
Harris government, the Klein government or this right wing 
government which creates policies for its corporate friends. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A strategic investment is needed for training and educational 
opportunities throughout this country.  If we invested in our 
community colleges and university access colleges, which are very 
dear to neighbourhoods right across Canada, that would be a very 
sound investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to raise the issue of the northern living allowance, 
particularly as it concerns my riding of Churchill River.  The 
northern living allowance would offset the major costs of funding 
higher education and training opportunities and finding 
employment. There is a critical shortage of teachers and health 
professionals throughout the north.  There is an opportunity to 
create institutions and to strategically invest government funds, 
especially federal funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us work together for a common future.  I challenge the 
minister to make those investments properly. 
<P><A NAME="LINK189"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, in the 1998 
budget the $2.5 billion Canada millennium scholarship fund was 
introduced.  The 1999 budget built on this by investing in the 
development of new knowledge and by focusing on job creation in 
new sectors.  The 2000 budget provided a $2.5 billion increase in 
the CHST to help the provinces and territories fund 
post-secondary education and health care, the highest priorities 
of Canadians.  This is the fourth consecutive federal enhancement 
to the CHST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 2000 budget also includes a tax exemption for income from 
scholarships, fellowships and bursaries, giving students 
additional financial assistance to pursue their studies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such measures demonstrate in concrete terms the federal 
government's commitment to post-secondary education.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One statistic alone proves the Government of Canada's 
commitment, and that is the fact that Canada spends a larger 
percentage of its GDP on post-secondary education than any of the 
other G-7 nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada recognizes that skills and training 
acquired through post-secondary education are vital to the 
development of Canada's human resources development capacity, and 
hence to national economic growth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I might point out that other kinds of training to prepare people 
for the labour market have been devolved to the provinces under 
labour market development agreements, and the agreement with the 
province of Saskatchewan transfers $37 million to that province 
every year to be distributed and allocated as that government 
sees fit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  It being 7.21 p.m., this House stands 
adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 
24(1). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(The House adjourned at 7.21 p.m.)
