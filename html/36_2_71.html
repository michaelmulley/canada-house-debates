<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>MUNICIPAL GRANTS ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK3">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from February 23 consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-10, an act to amend the Municipal Grants Act, be read 
the third time and passed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK4"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a 
privilege to enter the debate on Bill C-10.  Essentially, we 
should recognize that it is a good bill.  It moves in the right 
direction and does some of the right things.  In particular, it 
changes the word “grants” to “payments”.  They were grants in 
lieu of taxes and now they will be be payments in lieu of taxes. 
In terms of what has been happening in the House in the last 
little while concerning grants, and the auditor general's 
comments yesterday before the HRDC committee and the reports of 
his statements this morning in the <I>National Post</I>, we can 
easily see that perhaps it was even some kind of a portent on the 
part of the minister of public works to change the word 
“grants” to “payments”.  There are some good reasons he would 
want payments rather than grants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to recognize that the bill accommodates much of what 
ought to be happening in the world of government and in the world 
of business generally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is also supported by the Federation of Canadian 
Municipalities, which has suggested that there are some things 
the bill should have accommodated that it did not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should also indicate that there was some reticence on the part 
of departmental officials as well as the minister to make certain 
amendments.  I think he should have adopted some of the proposed 
amendments, but he chose not to.  I will speak about them a bit 
later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third thing we should recognize is that we can support the 
bill as Reformers because our policy is very clear.  It states 
that all laws pertaining to individuals and the private sector 
apply equally to the Government of Canada, its personnel, its 
agencies and parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not believe that a parliamentarian is above the law. 
Neither do we believe that individuals who work for the 
Government of Canada ought to be above the law.  They are subject 
to the law just as any other citizen ought to be subject to the 
law.  This is particularly relevant when it comes to the business 
of taxes to be paid to municipalities or tax assessing 
authorities where there are government owned buildings and the 
municipality or the taxing authority provides services in the 
form of roads, infrastructure and utilities. 
It costs money to provide those services and government should 
not be exempt from paying an amount that is fair, equitable and 
comparable to that paid by other taxpayers to the taxing 
authority. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1010"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT1"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same issue applies to crown corporations.  We should be 
clearly cognizant of the fact that both crown corporations and 
the government ought to be responsible and pay their legitimate 
dues to the taxing authorities which provide services to 
government properties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some very serious issues that ought to be talked 
about.  The constitution of Canada says very clearly that the 
minister or the government cannot be forced to pay taxes to the 
taxing authority in the municipality where a particular piece of 
real estate might be located.  The constitution says that the 
government is exempt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation has been crafted in such a way that the 
minister may pay in lieu of taxes certain moneys to the taxing 
authority.  The key word is “may”.  It should be “shall”. 
Just like the people, the government should have to pay, but the 
constitution says that the government does not have to pay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another possibility which could have been adopted, 
which is that the minister may not unreasonably withhold moneys. 
Or, if he does withhold or amend the amount, he must give reasons 
to the taxing authority as to why he is amending, changing or 
withholding certain payments in lieu of taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not only go to that point; it also goes to the advisory 
panel which provides certain advice.  I will get into that in a 
bit more detail later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk as well about late payment of taxes.  Supposing 
that the government decides through its minister that rather than 
pay the taxes on the date specified in the tax assessment it will 
pay on some other date.  In that case, if the government decides 
to make a late payment, it is up to the minister to decide how 
late it will be—and there could be a dispute on the dates—and 
he may have to pay a bonus or an interest charge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Business people know very well that if they are late in the 
payment of their taxes they are assessed a service charge, 
interest on the late payment.  I believe that the minister should 
be in exactly the same position and should be obligated to at 
least give the reasons for which he is withholding the interest 
charges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also provides for an advisory panel.  This is a very 
useful mechanism.  The advisory panel would give the minister 
advice on the assessment.  If a building that the government owns 
is fully occupied by the government, then it should pay the full 
amount.  If the government has leased the building to a third 
party, who is liable?  Is it the third party?  Is it the 
government?  Who is liable?  The bill provides that the advisory 
panel would advise the minister on these issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the minister is not obligated to take that advice.  He 
may ignore the advice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The panel would be comprised of people who understand what this 
is all about.  It would be made up of tax assessors, people who 
know how to evaluate property for its fair market value, whether 
buildings or land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There could be disputes, as there are with tax assessments on 
real estate.  The minister might question the assessed value.  He 
might say that it is too high.  There is an appeal process. 
He may also talk about a variety of other issues when he comes to 
the appeal.  He may talk about ownership and things of that type. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1015"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT3"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT3"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1015
<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This advisory panel, which acts as a dispute resolution 
mechanism, may provide some advice to the minister.  It may say 
that the assessment, which the minister says is really too high, 
is correct.  Or, it may tell the taxing authority that their 
assessment probably is too high. Nevertheless, the minister, 
regardless of what it is, is not obligated to accept this advice. 
He may amend it, he may change it or he may use it.  It is 
entirely up to him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it that we are so concerned about these issues?  Why is 
it that the minister would want to ignore the advice of the 
panel?  Why is it that the minister might not wish to pay taxes, 
or he might wish to pay late, or he might wish to adjust, or 
whatever the case may be?  He is not obligated.  Why is it that 
he does not want to have the requirement of this parliament to 
give reasons.  He should be required to give reasons to the 
taxing authorities as to why he would not accept the full 
assessment of the taxes that he is to pay.  If he has the 
authority to pay he should be obligated to pay if he is operating 
in an equitable, fair and open basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It could be that the minister just simply wants the power to say 
that he is able to do this and do whatever he jolly well pleases. 
It is quite possible for him to do that.  If we look at some of 
the arrogance that exists on the front bench that we have seen in 
the last little while, it could be that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I happen to know the hon. minister in this connection and I do 
not believe that is his motivation at all.  It could be something 
else.  It could be manipulation.  There could be friends in some 
of these taxing authorities where the money should be paid 
immediately.  However, there should be no question that if there 
is a late payment the appropriate interest should be paid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There could be other municipalities or other taxing authorities 
where the particular management is not necessarily friendly with 
the minister because they may have voted for a different party 
rather than the one that is in power.  In this case the minister 
could say that maybe he should not pay the full amount, that he 
should wait a little while, or that he will reduce the interest 
rate on this one.  There is a possibility of playing favourites 
here. I happen to know that the minister involved would not do 
that but the possibility exists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we make legislation in the House we should write the 
legislation in such a way that partisan politics does not become 
an issue.  When it comes to the business of taxing and paying 
taxes, it should be done in a fair, equitable and transparent 
manner so that every Canadian is treated the same as every other 
Canadian.  There should be no particular advantages to one group 
vis-à-vis another group.  It should not be possible for a 
minister to intrude and manipulate the situation to his advantage 
or the advantage of the political party that he is involved with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The very same set of arguments also applies to the panel.  Why 
should the minister, having a group of experts that is available 
to him and providing him with good advice, be in a position to 
ignore their advice?  I think the advisory panel is there as a 
mechanism, as a protection for Canadian taxpayers so that 
disputes can be resolved equitably, quickly and in an impartial 
way.  If the minister chooses to ignore the advice of the panel 
he should be required to give reasons for doing so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also need to look at a couple of other things.  The first of 
these are the rights of the taxpayer.  What rights do we have as 
Canadian taxpayers who support the government, who support the 
programs and who pay for the programs even if they do not support 
them?  What are the rights of the individual taxpayer?  The 
rights of the individual taxpayer are that we should know where 
our taxes are going, how much our taxes are and the basis for 
those taxes so that they are equitable and fair and we know 
exactly what is happening in each of these areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes beyond that.  There are three crown corporations that 
are for-profit corporations.  They include the Canada Mortgage 
and Housing Corporation, the Canada Post Corporation and the 
Royal Canadian Mint.  These are only three Crown corporations out 
of many more that have somehow been exempted from a requirement 
to make payments in lieu of taxes. 
Simply because they are crown corporations they can be exempt. 
The Business Development Bank of Canada pays taxes because it is 
listed in schedule IV.  For some reason or other these three 
corporations, CMHC, CPC and the Royal Canadian Mint have been 
exempted.  We do not know why.

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was suggested by the Canadian Federation of Municipalities 
and by our amendment that these be included, but it was ignored. 
Why?  The National Housing Act was amended last year to allow 
Canada Mortgage and Housing to pay dividends to its major 
shareholder, the Government of Canada.  Clearly, it would not pay 
dividends if it did not have a profit.  We have here a 
corporation that uses the services of a municipality which are 
paid for by taxes.  Why should those corporations not be required 
to make payments in lieu of taxes, just like the other crown 
corporations? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the right of the taxpayer to be protected and that the 
taxes be equitable, fair and universal for all those who are 
liable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also a responsibility on the part of the minister for 
sound management.  There have been examples of good sound 
management in that particular department, and I commend the 
minister, but that is not the issue here.  On this particular 
issue there has been good management on the part of the 
department but there are other areas where the department has 
failed and where, I would suggest, the minister should call into 
question some of the management practices, in particular the 
Canada Post Corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The way in which the rural route mail couriers are being 
administered by that particular organization is scandalous, 
particularly the way in which the contract process is being 
operated.  Something needs to be done to ensure that the 
contracting procedure and process is fair and equitable.  At the 
moment it is not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I now want to move into the area of accountability.  The 
minister is accountable to this parliament and he should be held 
to account.  Parliament should know the reasons why taxes have 
not been paid, why payments are made in lieu of taxes, why some 
people are not paying as much, are late or have had their 
interest payments adjusted.  We need to have that information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also need transparency.  What needs to be hidden?   Nothing 
needs to be hidden.  Why should this be some kind of deep secret. 
It should not be.  Why not tell Canadians that the minister is 
appealing a particular tax assessment?  Why should we not know 
that in his or her opinion it should be reduced?  That is 
legitimate.  If members in the House have a question we can 
appeal to a tax appeal authority.  The minister is accountable to 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, there is the business of commitment.  We need to know 
if there is commitment to peace, order and good government in 
this department?  I will again refer to that specific instance 
with the contracting procedure at Canada Post.  It does not 
promote peace, order and good government because it pits one 
group against another.  The process is not open.  It is one sided 
and, in many ways, discriminates against other people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the minister would say that he will be accountable and that 
he is committed to this, then we would really be able to say that 
we have moved a long way.  It could be done with the amendments 
we have suggested on the report stage of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say how significant this is, particularly when I refer 
to Mr. Desautels, the auditor general, and his comments from 
yesterday.  This was reported this morning in the <I>National 
Post</I>.  He said “If members of parliament are involved in the 
decision making process”—in this particular instance he is 
referring to job creation grants, but it applies 
everywhere—“that blurs the line and makes it harder for them to 
play their oversight role of government”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot underline more strongly than the auditor general did, 
the significance of that statement. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1025"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT5"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT5"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1025

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is in the same way that I want to protect not only the 
minister but the taxpayers of Canada.  I want to tell them that 
they will be treated fairly and equitably, and that the decisions 
we make will be transparent.  If that happens, the auditor 
general would not have to give advice like that because we would 
be committed right from the start. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that we must decide to play fairly, equitably and 
honestly.  We need to tell our municipalities that we are here to 
recognize them and respect them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The principle is the same, whether it is with HRDC grants, EDC 
grants or loans, or with any other department.  The principle is 
that MPs, including the minister, should recognize that all laws 
pertaining to individuals and the private sector apply equally to 
the Government of Canada, its personnel, its agencies and 
parliament. A commitment to that principle characterizes all 
Reform MPs and will characterize all Canadian alliance MPs after 
Saturday's decision. This policy and this commitment I give to 
all hon. members on my behalf and on my colleagues' behalf. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recommend to the minister that although he missed the 
opportunity to protect himself and his successors, he can provide 
amendments in the next session of parliament to bring about those 
amendments that will protect him and make sure that it is clear 
and above-board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the three other corporations, CMHC, CPC and the 
Royal Canadian Mint, the minister could then bring that amendment 
forward and include them under schedule four.  We would then have 
a fair and equitable treatment of all crown corporations.  They 
would then be obligated to pay taxes to the taxing authority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we agree with the bill in principle and support it, and 
while there are many things about the bill we like, I suggest to 
the minister that he has not gone as far as he could have gone or 
should have gone.  It would have been in the interests of this 
parliament and all Canadians to have gone further and accepted 
some of the amendments that were presented to the House on the 
occasion of the reporting of the bill. 
<P><A NAME="LINK5"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, from 
the point of view of the NDP caucus and the investigation that we 
have done on the bill, we do recognize that the bill represents 
over two years of exhaustive consultation with all the parties, a 
cross-country tour and I think a genuine effort to allow all the 
stakeholders to have an adequate say and adequate input into 
developing what we think is a very important bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will go even further by saying that I believe this type of 
consultation process could even serve as a model for other pieces 
of legislation because it was such a well thought out process. 
All of the parties came away fully satisfied that the 
consultation was thorough and that they had adequate opportunity 
to make a difference and to help shape and craft this type of 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would like to see this happen more frequently with other 
bills and we would hope that all of the parties, to any piece of 
legislation that is crafted, could feel so positive about their 
opportunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP caucus believes firmly that Bill C-10 will be a direct 
benefit to almost 2,000 communities coast to coast to coast.  We 
believe that it succeeds as a piece of legislation because it 
will enshrine, once and for all, the principles of fairness, 
equity and predictability in the management of our federal 
payments in lieu of taxes, principles which I believe are 
important to all members of the House on both sides. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate the members of the joint technical committee, 
which was made up of representatives from the Federation of 
Canadian Municipalities, Treasury Board representatives and other 
government representatives. 
I would also like to recognize all of the municipal 
representatives, mayors and councillors who met with the 
consultation tour during 1998.  They also played such a valuable 
role in crafting this legislation.

</I></B></P><P align=left>All members of the House realize that the Government of Canada 
enjoys a constitutional exemption from local taxation. 
Nevertheless I think we all recognize and agree that we have a 
moral obligation as a property owner to help pay for the costs of 
local government.  We are major occupants of space in the 
municipalities and obviously we use the services of the local 
government.  It is only fair and right that we should be paying 
for them. Federal operations should contribute to the social and 
economic well-being of the community and certainly should not be 
a burden on the local taxpayer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the past 50 years federal governments have adopted the 
policy of paying grants in lieu of property taxes in recognition 
of the valuable direct and indirect services that it gets from 
the municipalities.  These payments are now in excess of $375 
million annually, which represents a significant transfer of 
federal dollars to local communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These federal payments contribute to the local economies.  They 
are of great benefit and as such contribute greatly to the 
well-being of Canadians in general. Imagine the impact on the 
finances of a region like Ottawa-Carleton or the city of Hull if 
the Government of Canada reneged on its burden as a property 
owner and stopped making payments in lieu of taxes. It would be 
devastating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is fair to say that we all recognize and accept the rationale 
for these payments.  Canadians realize their value and their 
necessity. That is not at issue today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-10 deals with ways to improve the administration of the 
payments. Taking into account the far reaching changes that have 
occurred in the municipal taxation front over the last two 
decades, the legislation needed to be revamped and upgraded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP caucus is satisfied that Bill C-10 will bring about 
positive, constructive and lasting program changes.  It will 
confirm that the federal government does have respect for the 
standards set for other property owners and that it values the 
services it receives from municipal governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The goal is to make the process more predictable and to 
strengthen the foundation of fairness and equity on which the 
program was built and on which it has operated over the last five 
decades. We want to make federal payments in lieu of taxes 
resemble the taxes paid by private landowners as much as 
possible.  We believe that Bill C-10 takes us one step further to 
that equitable position and still recognizes the federal 
government's constitutional exemption from local taxation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-10 will change the name of the legislation and the 
program.  In future, grants in lieu of taxes will be referred to 
as payments in lieu of taxes.  This more accurately reflects the 
more explicit and respectful relationship between the two levels 
of government.  The type of language used is very important.  The 
term “payments” rather than “grants” more accurately reflects 
the mutual respect between the two levels of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-10 also includes a goodwill clause that confirms our 
commitment to fairness and equity in the administration of the 
federal payments in lieu of taxes.  This is a very positive and 
necessary aspect of this newly redefined relationship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Changes in legislation include a commitment by the federal 
government to endeavour to meet the payment schedules put in 
place locally.  When payments are unreasonably delayed, the 
Minister of Public Works and Government Services will have the 
power and the authority to make payment of a supplementary amount 
to the municipality to compensate for the delay.  This is also 
something which municipalities needed to be able to rely on as a 
stream of revenue from the federal government so that their own 
services would not be interrupted by some late payment on the 
part of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-10 addresses the issue of resolution of any kind of 
disagreement between the two parties.  Any kind of relationship 
like this has to have some kind of mediation process that is fair 
and impartial and one with which both parties are comfortable.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all those reasons Bill C-10 will be of service to the 
municipalities.  We believe the local politicians in the 
municipalities are comfortable with it.  They have had a 
satisfactory opportunity to have input.  We believe the whole 
process should serve as a model for the development of other 
types of legislation. The NDP caucus will be happy to vote in 
favour of Bill C-10 at third reading.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, our party is pleased to support Bill C-10 and I am 
pleased to speak on behalf of it.  In fact I am filling in for my 
colleague from Tobique—Mactaquac. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have made important progress both on this bill and with this 
bill.  I would like to take a few minutes to summarize what we 
have accomplished and how it would benefit taxpayers across the 
country.  I want to review some of the key objectives of the bill 
and explain why our party supports these objectives.  I also want 
to review some of the problems that exist in the present system 
and how I think the bill addresses some of those problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some problems as well within the bill itself which 
various groups have identified for us.  I want to talk about 
these and how we attempted to resolve them and gauge how 
successful we were in resolving them.  Specifically I want to 
revisit our amendments to the bill and the benefits Canadians 
will see as a result of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally I want to look ahead and identify the areas that still 
need to be addressed and will need to be addressed in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I want to express personal thanks to the individuals and 
groups who worked with our party on this bill.  The executive and 
staff of the Federation of Canadian Municipalities, the Cities of 
New Brunswick Association, the Ontario Municipalities Association 
and the Appraisal Institute of Canada all shared their insight 
and ideas with us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to thank my caucus colleagues, specifically the hon. 
members for Brandon—Souris, Richmond—Arthabaska, 
Compton—Stanstead and of course the hon. member for Saint John. 
Memory will tell us that they were all mayors in their hometowns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to thank my colleagues from the other parties 
who traded ideas with us, and the minister who listened to us 
when we said that the bill could be improved.  It is not very 
often we can talk about a minister who actually wants to talk to 
the opposition in an attempt to improve a bill as the minister 
did. We thank him very much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As everyone knows, municipalities fund their activities through 
real property taxes and business occupancy taxes.  In exchange 
for these levies, property owners and businesses receive 
municipal services such as water, sewer and waste collection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the first 80 years of this country, the government of the 
dominion of Canada received all the same services that municipal 
ratepayers did without paying a single cent in municipal taxes. 
This changed in 1950 with the passage of the Municipal Grants Act 
which allowed the national government to make payments or grants 
in lieu of taxes.  The municipalities got their money from the 
federal government without the federal government jeopardizing 
its constitutional position as one of the only two levels of 
government authorized to collect taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The system has worked quite well for both parties, except of 
course when disputes from time to time have arisen.  In those 
cases of dispute, it has been the federal government that has had 
the final say over how much a municipality would receive on a 
given property with no appeal available to the municipality.  It 
has been a very one-sided process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-10 is an attempt to introduce a system that will be 
fairer to the municipalities in valuing and rating federal 
government real property.  Another goal of the legislation is to 
provide greater equity and greater predictability so that 
municipal governments can plan their budgets in advance with 
some accuracy knowing approximately how much revenue they can 
expect from federal property.

<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill will allow the federal government to pay compensation 
when it is late paying its taxes.  It authorizes the Government 
of Canada to make payments to municipalities when tenants on 
federal property default on their tax obligations.  Perhaps most 
important, this legislation will establish a formal dispute 
settlement body so that when disagreements arise over the amount 
of payments owed to the federal government, the municipality 
concerned or the federal government can refer the dispute to a 
dispute advisory panel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill will also expand the definition of federal real 
property to include federally owned outdoor swimming pools, golf 
course improvements, outdoor theatres, residential driveways and 
employee parking improvements so that the federal government 
property is treated the same way as other property within the 
municipality.  It will ensure that first nations governments 
receive equal treatment to that accorded other local governments 
under the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also improves predictability by clarifying provisions 
relating to the calculation of payments in lieu of taxes on 
federal farm property, the calculation of deductions when 
municipalities are unable to provide federal property with 
equivalent services to those accorded to private property and the 
status of Parks Canada assets as federal property. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Along with Bill C-10 some other important policy changes are 
being made.  For example, the federal government will consult 
with professional appraisal organizations, assessment 
authorities, municipalities, federal departments of the crown and 
crown corporations on the valuations of special purpose federal 
properties, such as penitentiaries, military establishments and 
national parks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government will also seek the advice of these 
stakeholders regarding appointments to and management of the 
dispute advisory panel.  A program advisory council will be 
established composed of representatives of stakeholders, to 
provide advice to the minister on administrative policy and 
legislative matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally the federal government will commit to paying its 
municipal taxes on time, the same as everyone else. Members will 
have to forgive me if I choke on that one; the federal government 
paying its taxes on time.  Who could actually believe that? 
Nonetheless the track record of the current federal Liberal 
government is not all that impressive on this point.  If it can 
make some improvements, it would be impressive but we will hold 
our breath on that until we see what happens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bottom line is that a system that has been unfair, 
inequitable and unpredictable will now be more fair and 
predictable.  The key word is predictable.  Ultimately this bill 
and the accompanying measures will put more money into 
municipalities on a regular basis.  That will benefit all 
municipal taxpayers.  That is why our party supports Bill C-10. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is not without its flaws.  When it was first introduced 
many complaints were received from the Federation of Canadian 
Municipalities that the bill was being rushed through the House 
before municipalities had a chance to see the bill, study it and 
provide feedback to the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although municipalities were generally pleased with the two year 
consultation process that preceded the introduction of the 
legislation, when the bill came out they received no notice and 
did not get a copy of the bill or briefing materials.  We 
complained to the minister's office about this.  I am not sure 
whether we can claim victory, but it seems that again the 
minister listened and almost immediately the schedule for second 
reading and the committee hearings on the bill were pushed back. 
Again the minister listened to those complaints.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most of the bill is straightforward but our caucus had some 
difficulties with the composition and mandate of the dispute 
advisory panel, as did some of the stakeholders to whom we spoke. 
One item of concern was the requirement that we have relevant 
knowledge or experience without defining what those terms meant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand what the intention of the phrase would be.  It was 
meant to ensure that only qualified professionals serve on the 
panel.  Unfortunately, because this term was not defined in the 
bill, our fear was that it would be left up to the minister of 
public works to define it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That leaves the panel open for political abuse.  For example, 
what would happen if the minister decided that relevant knowledge 
or experience meant that all a person needed to be qualified 
would be to be a card carrying member of the Liberal Party? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  You know better than that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  When the hon. member gets up I will 
listen very carefully to what he has to say.  I am glad the 
Speaker is not paying attention.  When I am finished with this he 
will understand what I am saying.  It will be very complimentary 
but he should be patient.  Members on the other side of the House 
are not used to compliments.  When we start out they are so 
frightened by our words that they either hide under their desks 
or get up shouting in a madman fashion, which we have seen 
recently in the House.  We are asking for a little decorum in the 
House, Mr. Speaker, by the member opposite.  When I am through I 
am sure he will come over here to shake my hand in support of my 
speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of this process, without a definition we could end up 
with some patronage in terms of stacking the deck on the panel. I 
am sure the member will agree that in future governments the same 
could happen.  We do not expect this government to be in power 
forever and ever, amen.  In fact it could come to a crashing end 
within the next number of months.  We are looking ahead to what 
might happen in the future, regardless of party affiliation.  We 
are saying that potential for abuse had to be eliminated and we 
are glad to see that something has been done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We consulted a number of people in order to attempt to define 
the terms of the bill.  I know the member for Tobique—Mactaquac 
spoke with the Privy Council Office, with some municipal 
organizations and with the Appraisal Institute of Canada.  In 
this case the institute was helpful in suggesting amendments to 
the bill that would have required panel members to be selected 
from a list provided jointly by it and the same organization in 
the province of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was not a bad attempt.  However there are two problems with 
this definition.  First, there are other types of professionals 
we want to have sitting on the panel such as real estate 
assessors and representatives of municipalities and federal 
departments.  Second, there is no consistent national definition 
of an appraiser.  It varies from one end of the country to the 
other.  It differs from province to province and most provinces 
do not require licensing, believe it or not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For now we are prepared to allow the panel to proceed as the 
bill describes.  I would urge all members to monitor the 
composition of the panel, particularly the member opposite. 
Should problems arise in the future the government operations 
committee has within its power the ability to review the 
legislation.  What more could we ask for than a review of the 
process? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were effective in two other areas as well also having to do 
with the dispute advisory panel.  In the original bill it was 
proposed that the panel be appointed by and paid by the minister. 
Its advice would be rejected by the minister without an 
opportunity for appeal.  Any or all panel members could be fired 
by the minister at any time for any reason.  For a panel that was 
supposed to impartially adjudicate disputes between 
municipalities and the federal government, usually the public 
works department, this process seemed like it was tilted in 
favour of the public works department and the minister.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the time the member for Tobique—Mactaquac likened the 
process to that of a criminal trial where the accused person got 
to pick the jury.  It sounds familiar in this place.  The accused 
person got to pick the jury, pay the jury, act as judge and face 
no appeal.  It did not look like a very fair system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We received the same complaints from the municipalities and 
their organizations.  Based on these complaints my colleague 
drafted amendments to make the dispute panel process much more 
balanced and submitted these amendments to the committee where 
they were considered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first amendment was to remove the threat of arbitrary firing 
of a panel member by the minister.  If a member could not be 
fired by a minister then the member could be free to give more 
independent advice without the fear of reprisal.  That sounds 
like cabinet across the street.  Where the bill originally stated 
that panel members would serve at the pleasure of the minister, 
we changed that so that members would serve on good behaviour. 
This means that panel members would now have tenure and could 
only be fired for just cause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second amendment we presented to the committee that was 
adopted was a change to the appointment process.  Bill C-10 in 
its original form had the panel members being appointed by the 
minister.  The amendment by the member for Tobique—Mactaquac was 
passed by the committee.  It proposed that the governor in 
council or cabinet would appoint panel members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Tobique—Mactaquac and I may slightly disagree on 
that point.  That means the Prime Minister hand-picking, but I 
guess that is better than just the minister himself because at 
least it would come under the scrutiny of cabinet.  The standing 
committee thought these two amendments made sense and would 
improve the bill and the performance of the advisory panel.  It 
adopted both amendments unanimously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of these changes the dispute settlement process would be 
fair and municipalities could seek larger payments.  Ultimately 
this could allow municipal taxpayers to get a break on their tax 
bills, something I think all municipal ratepayers would 
appreciate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, there is still one area yet to be resolved 
that has not been dealt with in the bill.  That is the 
outstanding matter concerning business occupancy taxes and 
certain crown corporations.  It has not yet been determined how 
and to what extent Canada Post, the Royal Canadian Mint, Canada 
Mortgage and Housing and similar crown corporations would pay 
taxes and business occupancy taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly the mandate of these corporations has changed over the 
years since the Municipal Grants Act was last updated.  It used 
to be that these crown corporations served purely for public 
policy purposes.  In the unlikely event they ever made a profit 
it was more by accident than by design.  Profit was never in 
their vocabulary.  Now these corporations serve two purposes. Not 
only do they continue to serve an important public policy role. 
They also have a mandate to earn a profit to recover costs and to 
lessen the burden on taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If these crown corporations are conducting business and earning 
a profit they should be paying business taxes.  The question is 
how much.  After discussions our party had with representatives 
from the Federation of Canadian Municipalities, and after having 
questioned witnesses from FCM and public works in committee, I am 
convinced that this problem will soon be solved.  Municipalities 
and the federal government are continuing to negotiate what 
portion of each crown corporation is devoted to purely profit 
making activities.  The discussion is not yet finished on this 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to seeing this problem resolved in the very near 
future.  In conclusion, the bill would bring a more balanced, 
predictable and fairer approach to the process of payments to 
municipalities.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour (Beauséjour—Petitcodiac, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have met with some municipalities that have serious 
financial problems because of the lack of taxes being paid to 
them when they have federal buildings in their very small 
communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is quite a disadvantage and it is very clear that the 
proportion being given in lieu of taxes to these municipalities 
is absolutely unacceptable.  These communities cannot provide the 
services because of this fact.  What is the member's view on this 
point? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, my view would be that 
federal government agencies, and we are talking about Canada Post 
in this particular case, should be paying their fair share of 
taxes.  They are in business now to make money.  It is not a case 
of being subsidized by the Canadian taxpayer.  If they are 
playing by the rules of business as every business should, they 
should be paying their fair share of taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It places an unfair burden on municipalities that have to rely 
on taxes to look after their communities.  I think the bill will 
go some distance toward improving that process and making sure 
that all municipalities get their fair share of taxes back from 
Crown corporations that are now commissioned to make money and 
show a profit.  What is good for a private business should be 
good for government.

Mr. Speaker, I call to the attention of parliament the plight of 
two billion people in the world who are infected with 
tuberculosis, 200 million of whom will develop the disease.  One 
hundred million will die if no proper treatment is made available 
to them.

exodus of refugees creates, but the scale of human suffering and 
lives lost is no less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot afford to be complacent only because the incidence of 
tuberculosis in Canada is low.  One can become infected simply by 
sharing the same air with an infected person in a waiting room, 
in a bus or in an airplane.  It is an ever-increasing risk in our 
global village. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The well-being of Canada and her citizens is well served by 
contributing our expertise and financial resources to combat this

let us pledge as we mark World Tuberculosis Day today.

today is World Tuberculosis Day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>World Tuberculosis Day commemorates the day in 1882 when Dr. 
Robert Koch announced his discovery of the cause of 
tuberculosis, the tuberculosis bacillus.  We take advantage of 
this opportunity to remind hon. members that this disease is 
still endemic and out of control in a large part of the world. 
One-third of the world's population is infected with the 
tuberculosis bacillus, and there are eight million new cases 
annually. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After many decades of continuous decline, unfortunately the 
incidence rate of TB cases in Canada has levelled off in the past 
several years.  With the emergence of drug resistant strains and 
the deadly interaction with the HIV/AIDS epidemic, Canada cannot 
afford to become complacent in the face of the worldwide TB 
threat.

Canadian agricultural products are known the world over for their 
high quality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the years supply managed farm commodities have ensured 
quality goods and stable prices.  Canadian farmers, processors, 
retailers and consumers alike have benefited greatly from the 
steady and safe supply of regulated products.

benefits of continuing such programs in the wake of a rapidly 
changing global agricultural landscape. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge the government to retain supply management for the 
benefit of all Canadians.  Canadians have a right to enjoy a safe 
and healthy food supply and this should be first and foremost in 
our minds as we embark on WTO negotiations.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Cliff Breitkreuz (Yellowhead, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
lives of our national park wardens are in danger and the heritage 
minister refuses to protect them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Federal park wardens have been forced to work without the proper 
equipment needed to protect themselves.  Wardens constantly 
encounter poachers, drug dealers and others who are potentially 
violent and armed.  Poachers face up to five years in jail and 
become desperate when apprehended by a park warden. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Knowing these facts, why does the heritage minister ignore her 
committee's recommendation that wardens should carry service 
revolvers?  The government allows Brink's security guards to 
carry sidearms to protect money, but refuses the same right to 
wardens who protect wildlife, tourists and their own lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I proudly represent the people who live in Jasper National Park 
and I strongly urge the heritage minister to provide park wardens 
with the basic tools needed for their protection and the 
protection of the public.  Why put our officers at risk when on 
the line of duty simply because they were denied basic 
protection?

experienced an earthquake, and the Turkish people were there to 
reciprocate immediately.

building great relationships by working together on both social

after we put in an access request for that audit.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of

</I></B></P><P align=left>We have released 75,000 pages this fiscal year under the Access 
to Information Act.  In the past 10 weeks alone, the department

we received in the entire 1998-99 fiscal year.

<P><A NAME="LINK104"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Andy Mitchell (Secretary of State (Rural 
Development)(Federal Economic Development Initiative for Northern 
Ontario), Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, there is a number of very 
specific initiatives in the budget:  $54 million for community 
futures; $160 million to connect rural Canadians to the Internet; 
a $2.6 billion infrastructure program, a large portion of which 
will go to rural Canada; and $30 million to assist our natural 
resource industries both in forestry and mining. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most important is that the budget recognized that the 
circumstances of rural Canadians were different from those of 
urban Canadians.  Unlike the Reform Party there is a recognition 
that government will work in partnership with rural Canadians, 
communities and businesses to better the lives of rural 
Canadians.

the same time only 26% of AIDA money that the Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food promised to farmers in December 1998 
has made it to them.  As a result the agriculture minister is 
guilty of financial mismanagement.

to find fault with a government that will be providing $3.3

Mr. Speaker, yesterday's report from the expert panel on Canada's

that services in the parks have deteriorated because of the 
government's chronic underfunding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Narrows campground in Prince Albert National Park is one 
example.  The park has struggled to keep the campground open but

Mr. Speaker, one of the things the member will find, if he has an 
opportunity to read the very comprehensive ecological integrity

we have to get our ecological house in order before we can go to 
the Minister of Finance for more money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the reasons we have to do that is that in the past each

Mr. Speaker, again on the environment, the study by the Pembina

policy is a complete failure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is relying on a voluntary program to have major 
polluters reduce emissions, but those emissions have actually 
increased by 7% since 1990.  We have to move quickly to put in

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of

While the government is saying everything is well, as we speak I 
have constituents in my riding who see themselves with no income 
because of the actions taken on the part of the Liberal

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>POINTS OF ORDER 
</H3><P align=left>
<P><A NAME="LINK145"></A></P>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>BILL C-206 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK146"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, my point of order is with regard to Bill C-206 and the 
fact that it has been dropped to the bottom of the order of 
precedence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, as you are aware, the status of the bill was 
challenged by the member for Athabasca, resulting in a committee 
study by the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speaker ruled on the complaint of the member for Athabasca 
and based his ruling on the recommendation from the Standing 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs, which recommended: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the Speaker require (the Member for Wentworth—Burlington) 
to demonstrate that Bill C-206 has the current support of at 
least 100 Members, including at least 10 Members each from a 
majority of the recognized parties in the House, by filing with 
the Clerk a list, in accordance with Standing Order 87(6)(a), 
prior to Bill C-206 being set down for the first hour of debate 
at second reading. For these purposes only, and without prejudice 
to any future cases or recommendations, “support” shall mean 
support that the item be added to the Order of Precedence. If 
(the Member for Wentworth—Burlington) is unable to demonstrate 
such support within the specified period of time, the Speaker 
should order that Bill C-206 be dropped from the Order of 
Precedence and replaced by the next eligible item under Standing 
Order 87(6)(b). Any such removal of Bill C-206 would not affect 
in any way (the Member for Wentworth—Burlington's) use of this 
procedure for Bill C-206 in the future. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the discussions at committee, it was suggested that the 
member for Wentworth—Burlington be apprised of the intentions of 
the committee before the committee actually finalized its report, 
in order to allow him time to seek the recommended support for 
his bill.  The reason for this urgency was because the committee 
intended the deadline to be the first opportunity for the bill to 
be considered for its first hour of debate.  That should have 
been today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By arranging to prevent his bill from being considered today, 
the member for Wentworth—Burlington has gone against the 
intentions of the committee and the spirit of the Speaker's 
ruling.  His procedural manoeuvre blocks the next eligible bill 
from making it on the order paper pursuant to Standing Order 
87(6)(b).

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>No other member enjoys the advantage of securing a position on 
the order of precedence until such time as he or she can obtain 
100 signatures.  All other members are now required to wait while 
the member dithers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House has been patient enough and it is unfair to all 
members to delay this any further.  In the Chair's ruling of 
March 21, 2000, the Speaker said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Failing the filing of the necessary list with the Journals Branch 
prior to Bill C-206 being set down for the first hour of debate 
at second reading, the item will be removed from the order of 
precedence.  It will, of course, remain eligible to be returned 
to the order of precedence through a later filing of such a list 
or by the normal process of the draw. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Wentworth—Burlington rose after the Speaker's 
ruling and sought further clarification.  He clarified with the 
Chair that if he could secure 100 signatures by Friday, March 24, 
2000, today, his bill could remain on the order paper.  It is 
obvious that the member did not obtain the required support in 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member had his chance.  He should now proceed as suggested 
in the Speaker's ruling.  He should file through the normal 
process and stop tying up a position on the order of precedence 
that would allow other members to take advantage of Standing 
Order 87(6)(b). 
<P><A NAME="LINK147"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
have listened carefully to this representation.  While I would 
not disagree with all or the greater portion of what was said, I 
suggest to the Chair that it would be inappropriate at this 
juncture to interpret what the procedure and House affairs 
committee reported to the House.  It is equally or even more 
inappropriate to second guess the ruling of the Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If what we have here is a stick handling, a legal compliance 
with the rules of the House for Private Members' Business, that 
is every member's right and privilege.  I am not so sure that the 
procedure that has been used to date is so egregiously out of 
order that it should cause the Speaker to further intervene. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is obviously not my 
intention to get into a lengthy debate today about this issue of 
what I feel is a circumvention of the intent of the Speaker's 
ruling regarding private member's Bill C-206.  However, I would 
like to be on record as completely disagreeing with the hon. 
member opposite with regard to it being up to every member to 
stick handle through the rules. 
<P><A NAME="LINK148"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The Chair has heard the 
submissions of both the hon. chief opposition whip and the 
parliamentary secretary to the House leader.  Obviously, in light 
of the allegations by the chief opposition whip in particular, it 
is important that the Chair hear from the hon. member for 
Wentworth—Burlington.  The hon. member suggested that he has 
taken advantage of the rules to avoid having the bill called 
today for debate.  The indication was that he was unable to 
proceed today.  He is not present in the House and accordingly is 
unable to give comments today on this matter and clarify the 
issue for the benefit of all hon. members and for the Chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the Chair does regard the matter as serious and wishes 
to take it under advisement.  Hopefully we will hear from the 
hon. member next week and then a decision will be made in due 
course. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate the hon. chief opposition whip drawing this matter 
to the attention of the Chair.

<P><A NAME="LINK185"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Judi Longfield (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Labour, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased and privileged to 
begin debate at second reading of Bill C-12, an act to amend Part 
II of the Canada Labour Code, which addresses occupational health 
and safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada is committed to safety in the workplace 
and ensuring that Canadians live in healthy and safe communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation also demonstrates our trust in the ability of 
federal employers and employees to recognize and solve their own 
health and safety problems together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill makes important amendments to Part II of the Canada 
Labour Code.  It is good social and economic policy because a 
safe workplace, combined with sound labour management relations 
and employee involvement in the decision making process, just 
makes good sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is the second of the Government of Canada's three phase 
reform of the Canada Labour Code.  The significant amendments to 
Part II of the Canada Labour Code communicate the Liberal belief 
that initiatives which promote a healthier and safe working 
environment, which foster sound labour management relations and 
which encourage employee involvement in decision making 
constitute not only good social policy but also good economic 
policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members can appreciate, occupational health and safety issues 
are highly complex. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part II of the code sets out a legislative framework for 
addressing those issues for employees who are within the federal 
jurisdiction.

<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal jurisdiction under Part II includes the federal 
public service, certain crown corporations, industries declared 
by parliament for the general advantage of Canada, such as grain 
handling and uranium mining, as well as industries which are 
international or interprovincial in scope, such as railroads, air 
traffic, pipelines, shipping, long-shoring, banking and 
telecommunications.  The federal jurisdiction is representative 
of a core infrastructure that provides for key economic linkages 
both nationally and internationally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Approximately 10% of the Canadian workforce is governed by the 
Canada Labour Code.  Part II of the code defines the duties of 
both the employees and the employers.  It also establishes three 
basic employee rights in the health and safety area:  the right 
to know about hazards in the workplace and ways of dealing with 
them, the right to participate in correcting those workplace 
hazards, and the right to refuse work which the employee believes 
to be dangerous or unhealthy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The code lays out a procedure to be followed in the event of a 
dangerous or unsafe workplace, and also defines the roles and 
responsibilities of workers, employers, workplace health and 
safety committees and safety officers.  The legislation also sets 
out the processes and procedures to be exercised in enforcing 
those basic rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Workplaces have changed and will continue to change.  Therefore, 
we must periodically review the code to ensure that it meets the 
social and economic needs of the day.  The last amendments to 
Part II were made in 1985.  Since that time both the federal 
government and stakeholder groups have identified areas of Part 
II in which changes need to be made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The resulting amendments were formulated, first, to ensure that 
Part II continues to do what it is supposed to do, namely, 
protect workers; second, to align Part II with occupational 
health and safety regulations in other jurisdictions; and third, 
to modernize the Part II approach to occupational health and 
safety regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What may be less obvious is that recent changes in the workplace 
have forced employers and employees to confront many new issues 
in the realm of workplace health and safety.  For example, the 
proliferation of personal computers has forced us to pay closer 
attention to the ergonomic considerations needed to prevent or 
ameliorate repetitive strain injuries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill not only addresses the human side of the equation, but 
also the economic side.  Each year between 30 and 40 workers in 
the federal jurisdiction die on the job, and another 60,000 
suffer occupational injuries or illnesses.  That is one million 
lost workdays annually, nearly 5,000 person years, costing over 
$350 million in lost wages, medical aid, rehabilitation and 
disability pension payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada significantly more workdays are lost each year due to 
injury than to strikes or lockouts.  In 1995 occupational 
injuries and illnesses cost the Canadian economy almost $5 
billion in workers' compensation payments.  Studies indicate that 
the direct and indirect costs of occupational casualties comes to 
about $10 billion annually.  This is a staggering financial 
burden, but it says nothing about the anguish and grief endured 
by those who have lost a loved one or those who have lost a limb 
or suffer a respiratory disease because of a workplace hazard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we could reduce the annual number of workplace injuries and 
deaths by just 1% we would realize a saving of approximately $11 
million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not mean to imply that Part II of the code is important for 
purely economic reasons.  On the contrary, the code is an example 
of legislation which has far-reaching implications both socially 
and economically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Occupational health and safety is a problem which we must face, 
and we must face it together—governments, employers, unions, 
workers and health professionals.  Jointly we must attack the 
problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada has recognized that the time has come 
to make changes to Part II.  The amendments contained in Bill 
C-12 are the result of extensive and exhaustive consultations, 
including the work that began in 1993 by a legislative committee 
composed of organizations representing employers and worker 
groups as well as officials of the federal labour program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This committee was directed to develop proposed amendments based 
on the consensus of the parties involved.  The process was not 
easy. 
The parties involved had to make difficult compromises on 
individual matters to reach an agreement on the entire package of 
proposals.  I congratulate the parties for the perseverance they 
showed throughout the process.  Their recommendations constitute 
the vast majority of the contents of this bill.

<A HREF="#LINKT28"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Overwhelmingly, the parties agreed that the existing code has 
worked well and that it could form a basis and a foundation for 
the new and improved system.  In particular, the parties agreed 
that the time had come for a new approach to the regulation of 
workplace health and safety.  This agreement is reflected in Bill 
C-12, which is based on the philosophy that the proper role of 
the Government of Canada is to empower workers and employers to 
assume responsibility for the regulation of their own workplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In general, the government's role should be that of a guide 
rather than an interventionist.  Workers and employers should be 
given the power and discretion to identify and resolve new and 
emerging health and safety hazards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have no doubt that this is the right approach.  The Government 
of Canada can only empower the parties rather than impose 
solutions from above. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This approach is evident in the amendments to the powers and 
duties of existing workplace health and safety committees.  These 
bodies will be required to regularly inspect their workplaces and 
to deal with problems and issues as they arise, reducing the need 
for direct government intervention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of dispute resolution, management and employee 
representatives of the committee will be responsible for 
investigating all disagreements and conflicts.  Only when the 
parties cannot reach an agreement will a government health and 
safety officer become involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an example of the trust of the Liberal Government of 
Canada in the ability of employers and employees to work 
together.  It demonstrates that the Government of Canada is 
committed to regulating more intelligently, regulating in a way 
that ensures the continued health and safety of everyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through Bill C-12 the Government of Canada empowers workers and 
employees by introducing health and safety policy committees. 
These committees will complement the work of the existing 
workplace health and safety committees.  Their role will be to 
deal with matters such as accident prevention, education of 
employees and the acquisition of protective equipment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The role of the Government of Canada in establishing these new 
committees is to ensure that health and safety issues make their 
way into the corporate agenda and are addressed at the highest 
possible level.  For companies which operate in more than one 
location, the committees will also ensure some level of 
consistency across the different sites. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although I hope that all companies will take advantage of this 
promising new mechanism, the policy committee will only be 
mandatory for firms with more than 300 employees.  This 
represents a small number of employers in the federal sector, but 
actually accounts for 85% of all employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although Bill C-12 represents a new approach to health and 
safety regulations and a significant realignment of the roles and 
responsibilities of the key players, it is clear that the 
Government of Canada is firmly committed to existing rights and 
is doing its utmost to strengthen workplace health and safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of the right to refuse dangerous work, this 
commitment means strengthening and clarifying the rights of both 
employers and employees.  For example, all employees prevented 
from working as a result of an employee exercising the right of 
refusal will be paid until the end of their shift, whereas the 
employee exercising the right of refusal will be paid until the 
matter is resolved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada is also mindful of the rights of 
employers, who will be given the discretion to discipline a 
worker when the right to refuse is abused or when it is found 
that a frivolous claim has been made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In an area as important as workplace health and safety, the 
Liberal government has shown that it is not prepared to stand 
still.  As promised in the red book, it is moving forward with 
regulatory reform which is both economically and socially 
progressive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Five features of the bill seem to be particularly important and 
necessary.  First, as a result of this bill, local health and 
safety committees will be mandated to conduct regular workplace 
inspections and will be given increased powers in dealing with 
complaints.  This will permit the parties to identify and solve 
problems swiftly as they arise.  This will be done with 
government guidance and it will enhance the role of the health 
and safety committees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, a management and an employee member of the committee 
will be empowered to investigate any unresolved complaint.  If 
they find a violation of the code, they will ask the employer to 
give a written assurance of compliance. 
If they find an immediate danger, they will shut off the machine 
or otherwise stop the activity.  If they cannot agree on a 
solution, a government health and safety officer will be asked to 
intervene.

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, a health and safety policy committee at the corporate 
level will be required for enterprises with 300 or more 
employees.  This committee will address a range of issues such as 
injury prevention initiatives and awareness activities.  This 
will apply to over 80% of the federally regulated workforce, many 
of whom have already voluntarily established such committees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, the Liberal government is committed to help establish 
family friendly workplaces.  This bill provides additional 
protection for pregnant and nursing employees.  If an employee 
has reason to believe that an activity or condition, such as 
exposure to a chemical, will adversely affect her, her fetus or 
her child if she is breast feeding, she will be able to withdraw 
from the work until she has had the opportunity to consult her 
doctor.  Under existing legislation the employee has to continue 
working until she receives a medical certificate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fifth, the bill provides for regulation that will require every 
employer to develop, establish and monitor in consultation with 
the workplace health and safety committee at both the workplace 
and corporate levels, a preventative program appropriate to the 
size of the workplace and the nature of the hazards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are all important changes.  They reflect the Government of 
Canada's commitment to occupational health and safety and its 
confidence in the willingness and ability of labour and 
management to solve their problems in a mutually beneficial 
manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I want to emphasize that we take our consultative 
obligations in drafting this bill very seriously.  It was 
lengthy, involved and extensive and included relevant agencies of 
the Government of Canada, the major labour organizations and the 
major employers and employer groups.  They all deserve to be 
commended and thanked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hope is that the occupational health and safety problem in 
this country will certainly be reduced.  I believe that this 
bill, because it tapped the commitment and concern of social 
partners, is an important first step toward this goal.  Let the 
workplace be what it is supposed to be: challenging, interesting, 
meaningful and conducive to good health.  By acting now we can 
ensure that Canada has in place the type of regulatory framework 
we need to compete and thrive in today's economic climate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada has shown that it remains committed to 
improving and protecting the health and safety of workers under 
its jurisdiction.  Employers and employees have made it very 
clear that they are eager to take on their new responsibilities 
and work together.  It is time that we gave them a chance.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise 
to debate Bill C-12, which is an act that purports to amend part 
II of the Canada Labour Code.  It deals with occupational health 
and safety.  Unlike parts I and III, this one also covers the 
federal public service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part II of the labour code has not been significantly updated 
for at least 15 years.  There seems to have been a lot of 
suggestion that the government moved with all speed, but it has 
been 15 years which does not show the alacrity which was 
attributed to the government by the previous speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few days before dropping the writ for the 1997 general 
election, a bill to amend part II of the code was tabled in the 
House of Commons. I am sure it was not just a move to shore up 
Liberal support, even though it took almost another three years 
to bring the bill back to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Employer groups and employer associations which have been 
involved in the lengthy consultative process now fear that if the 
government delays the legislation any longer, another election 
will be called and they will have to start all over again.  There 
is some urgency to move ahead with this bill so that there is not 
the same experience as last time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health and safety in the workplace is the responsibility of 
every person on the work site.  Whether it is a labour intensive 
industry or a high level high tech desk job, all have stress or 
other parts to them and health and safety factors are involved. 
The role of government is to set the standards and to provide a 
mechanism to resolve disputes when and if they arise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government legislation and regulations alone cannot promote a 
healthy workplace and prevent accidents.  This involves every one 
of us.  All of us who are involved in the workplace, in a 
supervisory capacity or in the actual work activity, are 
responsible to make sure it is as healthy and as safe as we can 
make it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In November a report prepared by the British Columbia Workers' 
Compensation Board for example showed that the province's 
stringent health and safety laws were doing little to curb 
workplace fatalities.  It just goes to show that there is another 
element here and that is the human element; all of us have a role 
to play. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to that report, British Columbians died from work 
related injuries at a rate of nearly three per week over the last 
decade.  Nationally there are approximately 800,000 occupational 
accidents annually of which 750 are fatal.  One worker is injured 
on the job every nine seconds of work time.  That gives us an 
idea of the magnitude of the problem. Work related accidents cost 
the Canadian economy $10 billion a year in direct and indirect 
costs. Approximately 18 million days of work were lost this way 
in 1997.  It is a serious issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any workplace if accidents are to be prevented, everyone must 
be involved.  The more people understand about workplace hazards, 
the better equipped they will be to prevent injury and illness. 
The question then is how will the proposed amendments contained 
in Bill C-12 help ensure that people are better equipped to 
prevent accidents? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The intent of the bill is laudable but some of the provisions 
require closer scrutiny.  That is precisely what I hope will 
happen as the committee delves into the details of this proposed 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, I would like to draw the attention of the House to 
the fact that companies with over 300 employees shall, they are 
required to form a health and safety committee as well as a 
policy committee.  The question really arises of why the number 
300 was chosen.  Is that some kind of arbitrary number?  What 
happens if a company has 299 employees?  Is that a materially 
different company from one which has 300 employees?  That is the 
real question.  The government is not so much setting a framework 
as saying, “This is what you shall do; this is how you shall 
manage your company”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The argument was made by the hon. member who spoke just before 
me that the government's role is to set standards and to provide 
mechanisms for the resolution of disputes.  However here in this 
provision the government is going beyond that kind of situation 
and saying to the president of a company, “This is how you shall 
organize. This is what you shall do.  These are the kinds of 
committees we want you to have and these are the ways in which 
that committee is to operate and exercise its mandate”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another area of concern is the lack of a second stage appeal 
process.  While we as Reformers favour a reduction in red tape, 
it is important to ensure that a fair and effective appeal 
process be set in place.  Not every decision is the right one in 
the first instance. There ought to be an opportunity for both 
management and workers to appeal a particular decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under section 146.3 for example, the appeal officer's decision 
is final and shall not be questioned or reviewed in any court. I 
think an appeals process is essential.  If by some chance the 
officer errs, there is no recourse for the employer or the 
employee to challenge that ruling.  It is my understanding that 
employer and worker groups have concerns about this particular 
provision.  I am sure the committee will deal with this and get 
into it in some detail. Hopefully a resolution of this concern 
can be reached. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently a lot of attention has been focused on workplace 
stress.  Mr. Speaker, in your role as Speaker you are subjected 
to all kinds of noise and conflict in this place and in your 
office.  I am sure you would recognize only too well what stress 
can do to an individual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-12 refers to workplace stress but it does not attempt to 
define it.  That is part of the problem.  What constitutes 
ordinary workplace stress and what constitutes exceptional 
workplace stress?  Stress affects different people differently. 
Different types of employment have their own built-in stress. For 
example, the stress of an air traffic controller is slightly 
different from that of someone who cleans the latrines in the 
airport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In some situations stress can lead to violence. While the bill 
contains a provision relating to workplace violence, it is vague 
and open-ended.  I am sure the committee will deal with this and 
other areas when it studies the bill in detail. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1240"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-12 also allows for the establishment of workplace 
violence regulations.  Are companies and their safety officers or 
safety committees free to develop workplace violence regulations 
or will the government impose them?  It is a very real question. 
A lot of vagueness and a lot of unanswered questions need to be 
addressed in this section. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In January at the coroner's inquest into the tragic shooting 
deaths at the Ottawa-Carleton Regional Transit Commission, 
employees focused attention on workplace stress and violence. The 
jury made 77 recommendations, including one stemming from the 
problems encountered by police who were not familiar with the 
layout of the massive facility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is an obvious thing that should have been looked at but it 
was not.  These are some of the things that ought to be looked at 
in some detail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While up to date information may not prevent a tragedy, it may 
save rescuers time and ultimately help to save lives.  That is 
really significant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to look at this as well with the firefighters.  In very 
many instances the nature of the fire and the elements that are 
actually in combustion dictate the kind of retardant that is 
applied.  The firefighter needs to know what it is that is 
actually burning.  It is not just the fire.  He has to know what 
kind of fire it is.  Also in a case like the OC Transpo 
shootings, it would have been good if the police officers had 
known exactly where to look and where to go and did not have to 
waste a whole lot of time in getting there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are some of the areas that we plan to address and look at 
in some detail.  I am sure the government will go along with this 
as we examine the provisions of Bill C-12. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the British Columbia Workers' Compensation Board 
study showed that 99% of accidents are preventable.  That is 
wonderful.  If we can prevent 99% of accidents, that is great 
but it depends on the workers and management working together, 
not some government person coming in and telling them what they 
have to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The onus is on both the employers and the employees to work 
together on how they are going to do this. As I said earlier, the 
primary role of the government is not to set the standards but to 
provide the mechanisms and show how the mechanisms can resolve 
disputes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These amendments have been in the works for almost 10 years. All 
sides have spent a lot of time and effort in coming up with 
provisions that are progressive and acceptable to the 
stakeholders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are anxious to move ahead and get this thing done so that 
people will be safe and healthy in the workplace.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a great 
pleasure for me to speak in the House today on Bill C-12, an act 
to amend the Canada Labour Code (Part II) in respect of 
occupational health and safety, to make technical amendments to 
the Canada Labour Code (Part I) and to make consequential 
amendments to other Acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part II of the Canada Labour Code has not undergone any 
substantial changes for more than 15 years, as if there had been 
no changes in the various areas covered by the federal 
legislation.  That is completely ridiculous. But what can one 
expect of the federal government, after all? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, the new Minister of Labour, the hon. member for 
Moncton—Riverview—Dieppe, is presenting her new reform of part II 
of the Canada Labour Code.  It was high time for this government 
to do something about reforming part II of the code, which has a 
direct impact on occupational health and safety in workplaces 
under federal jurisdiction.  Why do I say it was high time for 
the minister to present her reform?  Because work-related 
accident statistics are of great concern.  I shall come back to 
this point later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would nevertheless like to draw attention to the efforts the 
minister and her department have focused on this reform of part 
II of the Canada Labour Code.  Her efforts are praiseworthy and 
it is our duty to call attention to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois assumes the minister's good intentions to 
improve occupational health and safety in workplaces under 
federal jurisdiction. 
said, the Bloc Quebecois has done its homework as well, and 
has carried out a thorough examination of Bill C-12. 
Unfortunately, it contains several weaknesses, but I shall 
address tem later on in my speech.

<A HREF="#LINKT32"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is only at second reading. The Bloc Quebecois is 
prepared to give the benefit of the doubt to the minister and 
give her a chance to improve her bill. If this should not be the 
case, the Bloc Quebecois will have to reconsider its position, 
but for the time being, we are only concerned about the 
well-being of workers in Quebec and Canada. Bill C-12 is a good 
basis for discussions, but certainly not the definitive answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said earlier, the situation regarding health and safety in 
workplaces that are regulated by the Canada Labour Code is a 
serious concern. 
is why the Bloc Quebecois strongly condemns the 
government's lax approach and slowness in adjusting to the new 
realities of the global economy and to the growing requirements 
for productivity and competitiveness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These new realities, which have had a deep impact on the 
workplace, have also significantly changed occupational health 
and safety practices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As hon. members know, much has changed over the past 15 years in 
the workplace, both in Canada and in the world. Unfortunately, 
the federal government has let things drift along. The picture 
of occupational health and safety is far from rosy. Let me give 
you an overview. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every year, some 800,000 people are wounded or become sick in 
the exercise of their duties.  Of this number, over 750 die, a 
figure that translates to an average of three deaths a day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997 one employee in five, on average, was injured at work, 
a figure that amounts to an accident at the workplace every 9.1 
seconds worked.  One worker in 31 was injured badly enough to 
miss work for at least one day.  This translates into an 
accident with time lost every 18 seconds worked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1996, 38 deaths as the result of work-related illness or 
accident were reported in industries under federal jurisdiction. 
An equal number of deaths was reported in 1995.  There was a 
death resulting from an accident on the job every seven working 
days, on average, or one worker in approximately 20,000 died in 
the performance of his duties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The number of disabling injuries increased from 15 per million 
hours worked in 1995 to 15.24 for the same time in 1996.  In 
that year, the level was not as high as the level recorded in 
1994 of 15.44, and remains significantly lower than the figure 
for 1993 of 16.99. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of economic impact, these accidents are very costly. 
Compensation to victims or to their families amounts to some $5 
billion a year.  If the indirect costs resulting from accidents 
are added to this, the figure doubles to some $10 billion. 
Members know full well that these figures do not reflect the 
great suffering and pain of the victims and their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To complete this sombre picture, who do you think are the main 
victims of these accidents?  One would think that bad luck 
hounds this age group.  Yes, as you have no doubt guessed, it is 
the young. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are the most likely to be victims of an accident on the 
job, fatal or not.  The highest number of accidents involving 
time off work occur among young people.  Between 1993 and 1997, 
one third of accidents involving time off work for which 
compensation was paid involved young people between the ages of 
15 and 29.  In addition, the accident rate among men was more 
than twice that among women, 3.57% compared to 1.57% according to 
the 1997 data. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a very specific reason for saving the figures on young 
people until the end of this sombre description.  I would like 
to take this opportunity to digress for a moment on the topic of 
orphan clauses.  On October 14, I introduced Bill C-212, the 
purpose of which was to prohibit discriminatory clauses in the 
federal public service.  Unfortunately the government did not 
wish to debate this in the House.

<A HREF="#LINKT33"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The effect of Bill C-212 would be to render any provision in a 
collective agreement concluded under certain specified 
acts—excluding a provision based on the seniority principle—of no 
force or effect where employees hired after a specified date do 
not receive the same employee benefits, wages or conditions of 
employment as those received by other employees covered by the 
collective agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As with accidents on the job, orphan clauses, or discriminatory 
clauses as some prefer to call them, take a particularly hard 
toll on young people.  These clauses are a major factor in the 
increase in social inequality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Several studies have demonstrated that income inequalities in 
Canada are linked to wage inequalities between young and more 
experienced workers.  Between 1981 and 1993, men aged 18 to 24 
experienced a 20% drop in earnings, while men aged 45 to 54 
earned 20% more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like work related accidents, orphan clauses are another problem 
that has to be remedied.  They are preventing young families 
from providing their children with proper living conditions from 
a very early age. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Institute of Child Health has made the following 
comment on the financial difficulties being experienced by young 
families: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The economic situation of young families with children is worse 
than was experienced by the previous generation.  In 1976, a 
single parent with one child had to work 41 hours a week at 
minimum wage in order to keep the family above the poverty 
level. In 1993, the number of hours required had risen to 73 hours a 
week. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government, and the Minister of Labour in 
particular, need to realize the long term effects of a 
shortsighted solution such as this, which so heavily 
disadvantages the young.  What is even more aberrant is that the 
Minister of Labour and the federal government do not recognize 
these discriminatory clauses.  Hundreds of thousands of Quebec 
workers coming under the jurisdiction of the Canada Labour Code 
are not protected against these discriminatory clauses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When will the government realize that opposition to orphan 
clauses has nothing to do with intergenerational conflict and 
that, instead, it is these clauses themselves that are dividing 
the generations? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Discriminatory clauses penalize young workers and this has major 
social impacts on society. The intent here is not to portray 
young people as victims but to take time to review the facts, 
which seem to go against the values of solidarity and fairness 
required for social cohesion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The introduction of orphan clauses in collective agreements in 
the workplace leads to an equity deficit between generations and 
this deficit is all the more intolerable within a context where 
wealth is getting more scarce. More than ever, in this period of 
restraint, we have to show great solidarity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are serious about fighting and condemning the inequity 
suffered by the poor, the young and the elderly among others, 
solidarity between generations is essential. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us revert to the matter at hand, Bill C-12. I was painting 
the sad picture of the situation of work-related accidents in 
Canada. Let us now take a closer look at the changes the 
minister intends to bring about in her reform of part II of the 
Canada Labour Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, Bill C-12 wants to legislate in matters of health 
and safety for private and public sector companies under federal 
jurisdiction. Without getting into a comprehensive description 
of all the companies to which Bill C-12 will apply, we can at 
least indicate that it will affect the public service and crown 
corporations such as Canada Post or the Canadian Broadcasting 
Corporation, and international and interprovincial companies 
active in air, rail and road transportation, pipeline transport, 
banks, broadcasting, uranium mining, shipping, harbours and 
telecommunications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part II of the Canada Labour Code gives workers under federal 
jurisdiction basic rights, for example the right to know about 
hazards in the workplace, the right to be involved in 
eliminating these hazards, and the right to refuse dangerous 
work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part II also defines the role of the safety and health 
committees, and the roles and responsibilities of the health and 
safety officers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, Part II sets out procedures to determine whether there 
is a real danger when a worker refuses to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us now have a look at the changes Bill C-12 makes in Part II 
of the Canada Labour Code. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1255"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT35"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT35"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1255
<A HREF="#LINKT36"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT34"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us start with the local occupational safety and health 
committees. Their mandate was to inspect the workplaces. Now, 
they will also have to investigate and settle complaints. If the 
committee cannot get both parties to agree, a health and safety 
officer will step in to try to settle the dispute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another change is the new policy health and safety committees 
that will be set up in companies with more that 300 employees. 
An example of their activities will be the development of 
programs for the prevention of health and safety hazards in the 
workplace. 
In addition, they will be able to investigate, conduct studies 
and inspect the workplace.  Finally, they will evaluate workers' 
protective equipment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another major change in this reform of part II of the Canada 
Labour Code is a change in the right to refuse to perform 
dangerous work.  Under the new provisions, an employee who 
considers his rights infringed will be entitled to select anyone 
in the workplace.  This person will be able to participate in 
the investigation in the absence of a member of the occupational 
safety and health committee.  In addition, as was the case 
previously, employees exercising the right to refuse to work 
because they deem the work too dangerous will be paid for their 
shift or for the usual work period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, if one party gives up the right to attend an 
investigation, the employer may take disciplinary measures 
against the employee abusing the right to refuse dangerous work, 
solely so as not to delay an employer's investigation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The employee facing disciplinary measures may file an appeal 
with either the Canada Industrial Relations Board or the Public 
Service Staff Relations Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other noteworthy change introduced by Bill C-12 concerns the 
appeal and review process.  In fact, a position of appeals 
officer will be created and, as a result, the appeal process 
will be limited to a single stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Appeals from health and safety officers who concluded that there 
was no danger in the workplace will now be heard by a technical 
expert. 
This means that the Canada Industrial Relations Board and the 
Public Service Staff Relations Board will no longer hear 
complaints relating to disciplinary measures taken in exercising 
rights under the Canada Labour Code. However, these two boards 
will continue to hear cases relating to the right to refuse 
dangerous work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill contains new provisions to establish, through 
regulations, accident prevention programs in the workplace. 
Measures will also be taken to prevent violence in the 
workplace. Finally, work space ergonomics programs will be set 
up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the main changes to part II of the Canada Labour Code 
that are provided for in Bill C-12. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said at the beginning of my speech, the Bloc Quebecois has 
certain reservations about Bill C-12. According to the Minister 
of Labour, the new legislation seeks, among other objectives, to 
make employees and employers more accountable, when it comes to 
making their work environment safer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about this government's responsibility as an employer? As 
if the recent blunders at HRDC were not enough, now the Minister 
of Labour, whose department is an integral part of Human 
Resources Development Canada, also wants her piece of the pie; 
she wants to give jobs to good friends of the party. First, they 
gave grants and now they are giving jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-12 contains a number of provisions that create a conflict 
of interest or a situation where the Minister of Labour and the 
federal government are both employer and legislator, or both 
judge and jury. Such situations are found in eight clauses of 
the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no way the Bloc Quebecois will ignore these flaws in 
the sound management of public funds and public service 
employees. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1300"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT35"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Party politics is no longer appropriate when it affects the 
health and safety of workers in Quebec and in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have another example where the government is judge and jury, 
and the Minister of Labour is in complete conflict of interest. 
Subsection 135(3) reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>135. (3) Where the Minister is satisfied—on the basis of factors 
enumerated in subsection(4)—that the nature of work being done by 
employees at a work place is relatively free from risks to 
safety and health, the Minister may,—upon a request from the 
employer in the form and manner as prescribed from time to time 
by regulation—by order, on such terms and conditions as are 
specified therein, exempt the employer from the requirements of 
subsection (1) in respect of that work place. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this clause, it is implicitly stated that the minister may 
request, as the employer, an order allowing an exemption from 
the requirements of subsection (1) of this section.  This is 
another conflict of interest that the Bloc Quebecois feels is 
completely unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many reasons why the Bloc Quebecois cannot accept this 
state of affairs. 
How are we to trust this government to treat its employees 
fairly when we see how it approached the pay equity issue with 
200,000 of them.  This government has shown itself to be 
unacceptably lax on this issue.  These 200,000 public servants 
had to wait more than 15 years for payment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fortunately, with the unconditional support of the Bloc 
Quebecois, the 200,000 PSAC employees never lost hope in 
justice.  Pressure from public servants and from the Bloc 
Quebecois won the day and we are very proud of that fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, the minister would like the Bloc Quebecois to accept 
similar provisions in Bill C-12.  Surely she is not serious.  The 
Minister of Labour will have to amend these clauses so that 
there is no longer any conflict of interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is another problem with Bill C-12, in subsection 135(2): 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>An employer is not required to establish a committee under 
subsection (1) for a work place that is on board on a ship in 
respect to employees whose base is the ship. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must say I find this exemption quite amusing. In fact, it 
reminds me of a particular bill, Bill C-28, which was debated 
here in the House during the first session. Members will recall 
this bill that the finance minister was trying to have passed 
because it could presumably allow his international shipping 
company, Canada Steamship Lines Inc., of which he was the sole 
owner, to gain some tax benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill was sponsored by the finance minister himself. 
Both these facts still appear to be a conflict of interest that 
violates the government's code of ethics, and the Bloc Quebecois 
had demanded some explanations, which, incidentally, never came. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, with Bill C-12, ships are again exempted without any 
explanation. Members will understand that there is every reason 
to wonder about this situation. To quote a proverb, once bitten, 
twice shy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can say that the Bloc Quebecois is shy about the ships of this 
government and its finance minister. We are very anxious to 
discuss the matter with the minister, before the committee, to 
ask her some questions about this exemption. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another section of Bill C-12 raises several questions. It is 
subsection 137.1(3), and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>137.1 (3) The manner of selection of the members of the 
Commission, other than the chairperson and an alternate 
chairperson, and the term of office of the members of the 
Commission shall be such as may be prescribed. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is involved here is the term of office and the manner of 
selection of the members of the coal mining safety commission. 
If members reread the subsection carefully, some questions will 
surely come to mind. Why give a very special status to the 
chairperson and the alternate chairperson? Why not include in 
the bill the term of office and the manner of selection of these 
two officials? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Well, once again, welcome to the land of the cronies of the 
Liberal Party of Canada. These are other political appoinments 
for the government's friends. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the Bloc Quebecois is familiar with this kind of 
appointment, which is common practice for this government, we 
will put their last-ditch energy into making sure that this 
process is excluded not only from Bill C-12, but from all other 
bills the government will introduce that will include patronage 
appointments, like this one does at subsection 137.1(3). 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1305"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT36"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>From now on, these practices must be a thing of the past. Time 
has come for a shift, away from Liberal petty politics and 
toward political transparency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Minister of Labour wants the Bloc Quebecois to support 
the reform she is proposing to Part II of the Canada Labour 
Code, these patronage appointments must be eliminated. 
Otherwise, our party will have to reconsider its position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This new reform of Part II of the Canada Labour Code includes a 
revision of the monetary penalties imposed on any person who 
commits an offence. 
The penalties are much harsher, and the Bloc Quebecois 
wholeheartedly agrees with that, especially if we take into 
account the fact that, every year, in Canada, 800,000 persons 
suffer work related injuries or sickness, 750 of whom died. This 
represents three death a day on average. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of these frightening statistics, the government should 
send a clear message to those who do not comply with the Canada 
Labour Code and tell them that there might be a high price to 
pay for their offence. That being said, whether or not the 
minister gave herself the appropriate means to make sure that 
the offenders understand the message remains to be seen. It is 
not very clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Subsection 154(1) provides that, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a person is convicted of an offence under this Part on 
proceedings by way of summary conviction, no imprisonment may be 
imposed as punishment for the offence or in default of payment 
of any fine imposed as punishment. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happens when the person who has committed an offence and is 
convicted does not pay the fine? This person does not pay the 
fine and is not sent to prison either. Where is the punishment 
then? Does that mean that if one does not pay a fine, that 
person is subject to no other penalty? This certainly is a funny 
way to enforce the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to come back to the matter of financial penalties. 
We all know that the Bloc Quebecois is a political party that 
supports all practical and straightforward measures. An ounce of 
prevention is worth a pound of cure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois has an excellent suggestion for the labour 
minister on what she could do with the money collected from 
fines. 
Why not say in the bill that the fines collected should go 
directly into a fund that would be used for training and 
prevention programs in the various work places under federal 
jurisdiction. Would it not be a constructive approach? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This money would be used to train employers and employees, to 
give them the tools that they need to prevent work related 
accidents? This is a very positive approach that the labour 
minister cannot turn down, taking the money from the  fines and 
establishing programs to prevent the situations that led to the 
violation, providing the means to prevent work related 
accidents, training and creating awareness among workers and 
employers regarding the need to work in a healthy and safe 
environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To achieve this however, the law will have to be enforced and, 
as I have said previously, Bill C-12 lacks clarity in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One last aspect of this bill the Bloc Quebecois is questioning 
is clause 132, which deals with pregnant and nursing employees. 
Ever since it was elected to the House, the Bloc Quebecois has 
always made it its duty and a priority to stand up for all women 
and try to improve their status, including promoting 
precautionary cessation of work for pregnant or nursing women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With Bill C-12, the labour minister finally understood something 
had to be done for pregnant or nursing women in workplaces under 
federal jurisdiction. It is a start, but it is much too timid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec has always been a leader in the protection of pregnant 
women in the workplace. The same cannot be said of the federal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For years now in Quebec, under the CSST, pregnant or nursing 
workers who do not come under the Canada Labour Code may ask for 
a reassignment or precautionary cessation of work and still 
receive 90% of their net salary, if their work poses a risk to 
their health or that of the child to be born, and the employer 
cannot alter or change their work environment within the plant.

<A HREF="#LINKT37"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 132 of the federal act is greatly flawed. Quebec workers 
who come under the Canada Labour Code are not as well protected 
as those who come under Quebec law. Such discrepancy and two 
tier system are totally unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the federal level, as soon as an employee receives the 
physician's opinion, she can no longer invoke subsection 132(1), 
which allows a pregnant employee to ceases to perform her 
current job functions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, upon receiving a medical opinion, the employer must 
assign the pregnant employee to different functions posing no 
risk to the foetus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If her employer cannot reassign her to another job within the 
period prescribed on the medical certificate, the female 
employee may stop working immediately and her salary for the 
first week is paid by her employer and afterward she gets 90% of 
her net salary from the CSST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec is still leading the pack on preventive reassignment of 
pregnant or breastfeeding female workers. What is the federal 
government waiting for to follow suit? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is definitely a consensus among Quebecers and Canadians. 
But the minister and her government turn a deaf ear, even if 
some government officials are part of the consensus. Let me 
clarify. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In March 1998, the Université du Québec à Montréal organized a 
symposium on the health of working women. The event was even 
funded by the oh so righteous federal health department. 
The symposium was attended by experts and organizations from 
across Canada interested in occupational health and safety, and 
particularly in women's occupational health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be clear, the action plan developed at the symposium 
cannot be disregarded, as it was produced by our best experts in 
occupational health for women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give you a short list of participants. 
For Quebec: Gisèle Bourret, head of the Status of Women Division 
at the Centrale de l'enseignement du Québec; Maria DeKoninck, 
professor at the Department of Social and Preventive Medicine, 
Université Laval; Jocelyne Everell, union advisor at the Health, 
Safety and Environmental Division of the Confédération des 
syndicats nationaux; Carole Gingras, director of the Status of 
Women at the FTQ; Danielle Hébert, co-ordinator of the Status of 
Women Division of the Confédération des syndicats nationaux; 
Nicole Lepage, occupational health and safety counsellor, 
Centrale de l'enseignement du Québec; Katherine Lippel, 
professor in the department of law, Université du Québec à 
Montréal; and many others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were also equally credible experts and organizations from 
British Columbia, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Ontario, and even 
Newfoundland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is worth noting that Canada was represented by, among others, 
Diane Ponée, Director, Policy Analysis and Planning, Women's 
Health Bureau, Health Canada, and Michelle Simms, Policy and 
Program Consultant, Women's Bureau, Strategy and Coordination 
Unit, HRDC.  This means without a doubt that the Labour Minister 
and this government are aware of the conclusions of the seminar. 
Let us talk about those conclusions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Action Plan that all participants signed, including Health 
Canada and HRDC officials, reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In all federal and provincial jurisdictions, the legislation 
should provide for precautionary cessation of work for pregnant 
or nursing workers if their working conditions are a threat to 
their health or the health of their foetus or nursing infant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such programs should be modelled on the Quebec legislation which 
provides for reassignment to a job presenting no threat...They 
should include, whenever reassignment is impossible, the right 
to allowances equal to those given in the case of a disability 
due to an occupational injury. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Women across Canada cherish Quebec's policies on precautionary 
cessation of work for pregnant or nursing workers. 
Unfortunately, the minister will not impress the women of Canada 
and Quebec with clause 132 of Bill C-12. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1315"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT38"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not the one saying this, nor is the Bloc Quebecois. All the 
women of Quebec and Canada want to benefit from the progressive 
policies of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can already see the Minister of Labour and the federal 
government bragging about the new maternity leave under EI, 
saying that employees under federal jurisdiction are now very 
well treated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us get serious. Women need at least 600 hours of work to 
qualify for maternity leave. 
Just imagine a pregnant single mother of one; she will only get 
between 50 and 55% of her salary, whereas she would get 90% of 
her net salary with the precautionary cessation of work 
provision of Quebec's legislation on occupational health and 
safety. The federal government is light-years behind Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If section 132 of Bill C-12 is not amended, the disparity of 
treatment between employees covered by the bill and those 
covered by Quebec's legislation on occupational health and 
safety will remain. Does the Minister of Labour, who is a woman 
and a mother of two, really want to perpetuate this unacceptable 
disparity? Why should women be the victims of the discriminatory 
policies of the Liberal government? I will leave the minister 
with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As you can see, Bill C-12 is far from being perfect. The minister 
will have to make changes to her reform of part II of the Canada 
Labour Code. The Minister of Labour can depend on the Bloc 
Quebecois for these amendments. So far, the Bloc has done its 
homework and it will continue to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are outlining a very positive thought process to make Bill 
C-12 be even more consistent with the new realities of the 
workplace. But we do not yet know whether the Minister of Labour 
will consider this or whether she will turn a deaf ear on this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said at the outset, the Bloc Quebecois is in favour of Bill 
C-12 in principle. Who would be against a reform of part II of 
the Canada Labour Code in respect of the health and safety of 
the men and women who work in Quebec and Canada? Nobody. 
We strongly believe that Bill C-12 is not perfect, far from it, 
but it is a good start. It remains to be seen if the Minister of 
Labour will be openminded and allow the Bloc Quebecois to play a 
role in this reform. We will see.

honestly say, without any fear of contradiction, that in my own 
personal life this is the most important piece of legislation 
that I have had the opportunity to debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From my background as a blue collar construction worker and as a 
journeyman carpenter by trade, it has always been of major 
interest to me that all Canadians have the basic right to a 
clean, healthy and safe working environment; that no Canadian

go to work to earn a living.  They deserve to earn a living 
without the fear of unnecessary risk by the conditions in their 
workplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased to be here today to talk about Bill C-12, the 
much ballyhooed and long awaited amendments to Part II of the 
Canada Labour Code.  What we have in front of us today is the 
product of four long years of consultation, consensus building 
and of the development of ideas and recommendations that now 
manifest themselves in this very worthy bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The working group of labour, business and government tried its 
best to do everything by consensus.  There was no majority vote 
on these issues.  They worked it around the table in a spirit and 
atmosphere of true co-operation because they realized the nature 
of the work they were doing was so important and had such a 
direct impact on the lives of all those employees or Canadian 
workers governed by the Canada Labour Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada Labour Code actually has jurisdiction over about 
700,000 Canadian workers. This is nowhere near a majority of 
Canadian workers but it is certainly a significant number of 
Canadian workers, such that it can set a precedent and form a 
standard that all other labour relations jurisdictions should 
look to in terms of setting their own health and safety 
standards. 
That is what makes Bill C-12 so critical.

that we do here today and the work that we will do when the bill 
goes to committee has a direct bearing and a very important 
effect on the lives of many Canadians.  It is critical and it is 
absolutely crucial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I began by telling the House how I got interested in health and 
safety.  It was through my own background.  My first job as a kid 
growing up was to work in the asbestos mines in the Yukon, which 
is not a good career choice.  I would not recommend it to anyone, 
frankly.  The only reason I raise this is that at that time 
asbestos was not recognized as a hazardous material. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As young workers, we were there happily working with asbestos 
and earning a living.  We asked our bosses if there was any truth 
to the rumour that this stuff was bad for us and they told us 
that it was a harmless, white, fireproof substance.  They told us 
to continue shovelling it and that we should not worry about a 
thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was not until our union finally started to get active, to do 
some research and caution us that were realized that the stuff 
was not only bad for us but that there was no safe level of 
asbestos.  One part per billion in the air was too much.  At that 
time we became aware that on those issues the union was the only 
friend a working person had because everyone else was lying to us 
in the name of profit and greed.  That taught me a lesson when I 
was very young. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Later on in my work life I became a journeyman carpenter.  I 
became very active in my union and became a shop steward for my 
union.  A very big part of my job was to make sure our members 
were not put at risk by some arbitrary production schedule.  As I 
have said before, there is no production schedule in the world 
that warrants or justifies putting people's lives at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can honestly say that I have dedicated much of my working life 
to trying to elevate the standards of working conditions in terms 
of workplace safety and health in this country.  That is why I am 
so very gratified to stand here today and not only debate Bill 
C-12 but to actually recommend Bill C-12 with some minor 
amendments and modifications that I will be speaking about later. 
It is very gratifying for me to finally be here doing something 
that is in such a positive light for Canadian working people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was not that long ago that this really was not much of a 
priority for government or industry in the country.  There was a 
sort of acceptance that some jobs are just inherently dangerous 
and some people are going to get hurt doing those dangerous jobs. 
We can no longer tolerate that mindset:  (a) there is no reason 
for it, and (b) it is morally and ethically reprehensible to even 
contemplate that mindset. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the chief job steward for the carpenters on a hydroelectric 
dam, I was very proud that our dam was the first hydro dam in all 
of Manitoba that was ever built without killing anyone.  On 
previous hydro dams as many as seven people would be killed on 
the job. There was a saying in the carpentry trade that every 
building is a tombstone in a way because it was so normal to lose 
a couple of guys.  Companies would actually factor that into 
their cost and into their productivity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thankfully, we have moved away from those days but it really was 
not that long ago.  As I say, in the late seventies we really 
achieved something by building a dam without killing anyone. I 
put it to the House that there is no reason that anyone should be 
dying on the job.  All of those accidents are preventable with 
the right measures, with the right legislation and with the right 
enforcement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not really have to say anything more in this speech.  I 
could just stand here and say enforcement, enforcement, 
enforcement for the next 20 minutes and that would be the most 
important single message that we could deliver to the labour 
relations community, employers and employees across the country. 
It is so critical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recent years, partly due to shortages of enforcement 
officers, we have been seeing more and more governments relying 
on what they call voluntary compliance orders.  A voluntary 
compliance order, frankly, does not cut it, especially in the 
private sector where some people still view safety as a cost 
factor.  Even though it is a terribly outdated and obsolete way 
of viewing things, some people still look at stopping to put up a 
guard rail as a non-productive activity. 
Where is the payback?  It will slow us down and it will cost us 
money.  It is a terrible way of doing things.

<A HREF="#LINKT40"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give the House some figures that will illustrate how 
wrong-headed that is.  We all know the good, moral and ethical 
reasons why we do not want anyone hurt or killed at the 
workplace.  Let me tell the House some of the economics of 
workplace safety and health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my home province of Manitoba, we lose about 50,000 person 
days a year to strikes, lockouts and labour unrest.  It is a 
productivity issue.  In the same period of time, we lost 550,000 
person days per year to time lost due to accidents on the job. If 
we are so serious about elevating the levels of productivity for 
Canadian workers, we could clean up the workplaces, stop the 
carnage and save ourselves half a million person days a year in 
Manitoba alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Frankly, that does not factor in the other detail that we have 
looked at in the union movement, which is the secondary impact of 
a workplace accident.  This means that when one of our colleagues 
is struck down, falls or is hurt, injured or killed on the job, 
there is a ripple effect throughout the whole workforce. 
Productivity is slow on the day of the accident and does not get 
up to full speed until many days later. I have seen that happen 
many times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole concept of workplace safety and health legislation in 
this country is really geared around three things; the right to 
know, the right to refuse and the right to fully participate in 
the health and safety aspects of our workplace.  Those three 
things define and shape what we would like to see as a healthy 
and safe work environment.  The right to know means that we have 
the right to know what hazardous materials we might be working 
with.  We do have WHMIS legislation, Workplace Hazardous Material 
Information System, in this country where any worker has the 
right to say “Are you sure this chemical I am using is not bad 
for me?  Prove it to me”.  The onus is on the employer to prove 
to the worker that it will not hurt them.  If we had that kind of 
legislation when I worked in the asbestos mine, I would have quit 
a lot sooner than I did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a very complex field and it needs at lot of administration 
to make it work.  It is very complicated now.  We cannot just 
train people in WHMIS for eight hours and then leave them alone. 
We are dealing with very complicated materials now. There are 
secondary things that go off with the materials we work with. 
This element might be benign and that element might be benign, 
but put the two together in our kidney and they turn into a third 
element that will kill us.  We need to know that.  We cannot send 
workers in unprotected and ask them to do that kind of thing for 
the sake of economics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are more cognizant of the issue of workplace safety 
and health and the issue of people injured and killed on the job. 
The evidence of that is that we now recognize April 28 as the 
International Day of Mourning for Injured and Fallen Workers.  I 
am proud to say that the flag at the House of Commons is lowered 
to half-mast.  It is recognized officially by a motion passed in 
the House of Commons.  Canadians are sympathetic, aware and will 
be pleased that we are taking these steps to pass Bill C-12 and 
make their workplace that much safer.  I am proud to say that it 
was the former labour critic of the NDP, Rod Murphy, the member 
for Churchill, who moved the motion to make April 28 the day of 
mourning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, we think Bill C-12 has a great deal of merits.  We 
wish it to go speedily through the House, but not unamended.  We 
have to point out a number of things that are seriously lacking 
in this bill.  I will go through them briefly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Almost everything in Bill C-12 was dealt with by consensus 
building in the committee with FEDCO, the federal employers group 
for the employers, the Canadian Labour Congress Workplace Safety 
and Health Committee for the employees and the government at the 
table.  However, sometimes the language in the bill does not 
accurately reflect the consensus made and recorded at the 
committee.  In places where we saw a gap between what we thought 
was agreed to and what is in the bill, we had to ask for that to 
be clarified and amended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other cases, we felt that there were things that showed up in 
the bill that were never brought up at the table.  They are very 
minor details but surely nothing in this bill should be seen for 
the first time by our side because it was supposed to be 
developed by this consensus building process.

<A HREF="#LINKT41"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We find fault with one of the details that is not exactly as it 
was agreed to at committee.  We would like to see a two tier 
appeal system.  The recommendation in Bill C-12 is that we go to 
a single person being involved in the appeal process.  That 
person would be an appeals officer, not the Canada Industrial 
Relations Board.  We feel that is like the fox looking after the 
hen house. If one has a grievance about the activities of the 
health and safety division, a health and safety division officer 
should not hear the appeal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second detail we find fault with is the definition of 
health.  It may sound like we are nitpicking but frankly it is 
very important.  Definitions are contained in the preamble.  If 
our definition of a healthy workplace and the government's 
definition of a healthy workplace differ, we will have a lot of 
problems.  We thought we agreed to use the definition of the 
World Health Organization as such.  Until a letter from HRD on 
July 12, 1996, we thought we had a deal.  That was arbitrarily 
changed by the government side and we would like to know why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We find fault with the government's definition of health because 
it specifically excludes workplace stress as a physical disease, 
mental illness or compensable condition.  We wholly disagree with 
that.  We believe that workplace stress is a factor in a person's 
general health and must be included in the definition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has never been any complaint about stress due to traumatic 
events.  If one witnesses a terrible tragedy in the workplace and 
is unable to work as a result, it is considered a compensable 
lost time condition because it was due to a trauma.  We believe 
that workplace stress in general can also lead to that condition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We find fault with article 126(1)(j).  We call it the rat 
clause.  Employees are obliged to inform on a colleague who they 
may feel is causing unsafe circumstances.  The onus or the burden 
should not be placed on employees to rat on other employees.  The 
matter can be brought to the attention of the employer but they 
do not have to rat on fellow workers.  We want that changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Articles 126(1)(k) and 139(1) call for mandatory tests and 
medical examinations.  Mandatory medical tests are now illegal 
under human rights law and international practice.  Ontario has 
recently changed its law in this regard.  Section 28(3) of the 
Occupational Health and Safety Act, Revised Statutes of Ontario, 
1990, reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A worker is not required to participate in a prescribed medical 
surveillance program unless the worker consents to do so. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe these two articles violate International Labour 
Organization technical and ethical guidelines for workers' health 
surveillance which was ratified by Canada in 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Four conditions must be met for medical examinations in the 
workplace to be all right.  First, they must be completely 
voluntary.  Second, individual test results must be strictly 
confidential.  Third, workers should have the right to choose the 
examining doctor.  Fourth, there should be no cost whatsoever to 
the worker.  Only under these conditions could we agree to have 
any kind of mandatory testing program or to contemplate it within 
the Canada Labour Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to health and safety committee meetings, Bill C-12 
calls for mandating nine such meetings per year.  Our working 
committee believes that it should be twelve and that they should 
be monthly.  That is what we should be shooting for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometimes we do not get them all done.  They have to be 
cancelled now and then, but at least we should set out to try to 
do it once a month.  The single most important aspect to keeping 
a clean, healthy and safe work environment is the communication 
between labour and management.  There must be a co-operative 
attempt to work toward a clean, safe and healthy work 
environment.  Twelve would be the minimum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are provinces which already mandate that.  British 
Columbia requires monthly meetings in its health and safety act.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of pregnant and nursing employees we believe we should 
add the following language to section 132.  We think it should be 
more rigid and state, once it is established that there is a risk 
to the health of the pregnant or nursing mother or to the fetus 
or child, that division 7 of the Canada Labour Code, part III, 
the reassignment section, shall apply.  For greater and absolute 
certainty we would like to make reference in part II of the code 
to the provisions of part III of the code that ensure the safety 
of the nursing or pregnant mother. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another aspect currently in subsection 147.1(1) that 
will need some attention and of which we are critical.  This 
clause would guard against malicious or vexatious use of the 
right to refuse unsafe work provisions.  We realize that 
complaints under the right to refuse unsafe work can almost 
constitute industrial sabotage in a place where the labour 
relations climate is so hostile that the employees may seek to 
disadvantage the employer by somehow exercising their right to 
refuse in a malicious, vexatious or abusive manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a consensus among the working committee that such a 
clause could be present because neither party can deny that such 
a possibility may be raised.  It was felt that the language put 
forward by the government did not accurately reflect the intent 
of the agreement made.  The proposed language we will be putting 
forward as an amendment will achieve the same objective but in 
language that we believe will be more balanced.  The burden of 
proof is clearly on the employer to demonstrate malice or 
mischief, and not on the employee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The final thing I will talk about is what we see as a huge 
omission, a huge oversight and a lost opportunity to include what 
was voted on and ratified in the House of Commons a few days ago, 
and that is reference to the Westray motion.  We passed a motion 
in the House that the government should amend any pertinent 
legislation to pay deference to recommendation 73 of the Westray 
inquiry by Justice Richard.  Recommendation 73 states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada, through the Department of Justice, 
should introduce in the Parliament of Canada such amendments to 
legislation as are necessary to ensure that corporate executives 
and directors are held properly accountable for workplace safety. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We read that to mean to amend the Criminal Code of Canada to 
contemplate the concept of corporate manslaughter and corporate 
murder.  The Canada Labour Code should point to the directive of 
Justice Richard and the amended criminal code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If people are found guilty of gross negligence causing workplace 
accident or death, they will not only be fined and penalized 
under the Canada Labour Code workplace safety and health 
provisions but will also be charged under the Criminal Code of 
Canada for manslaughter.  That is what Justice Richard was 
talking about.  That is essentially what we believe we ratified 
in the motion the other day.  We would like to see some reference 
to it in the Canada Labour Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other than that, we look forward to dealing with the bill at 
committee stage.  We hope to work with business, labour and 
government to see it through the House for the betterment of all 
Canadian workers.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour (Beauséjour—Petitcodiac, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
is a great pleasure for me to say a few words on behalf of the 
Progressive Conservative Party in connection with Bill C-12, an 
act to amend the Canada Labour Code (Part II) in respect of 
occupational health and safety, to make technical amendments to 
the Canada Labour Code (Part I) and to make consequential 
amendments to other acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part II of the Canada Labour Code addresses occupational health 
and safety, as they concern workers and management.  The purpose 
of this bill is to promote health and safety with both workers 
and employers and to set out the rights and responsibilities of 
workers and employers in connection with existing or potential 
workplace hazards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Labour-related issues are mainly a provincial responsibility. 
However, the federal public service, federal agencies, and 
international and interprovincial industries come under the 
jurisdiction of Ottawa.  These industries include air, sea and 
rail carriers, oil pipelines, banks, broadcasting, uranium 
mining, ports and telecommunications.

<A HREF="#LINKT43"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main thrust of this bill is to expand the role of health and 
safety committees, by conferring upon them the power to identify 
and remedy existing or potential hazards, and refusals to work 
arising out of such hazards, as promptly and efficiently as 
possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the bill is to strike a better balance between 
the responsibilities of the government, employers and employees 
as far as promoting occupational health and safety is concerned, 
by placing emphasis on the rules and procedures enabling 
problems to be settled locally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is the result of consultations among the government, 
business and the unions in an effort to modernize our 
legislation on health and safety, which was last amended in 
1985.  In general, I think that this bill enjoys considerable 
support among the groups concerned and, on the whole, I support 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I feel I must raise a number of questions and make some 
observations on it.  No bill is ever complete or perfect.  The 
legislative process is a living one, and those familiar with it, 
like us, know that laws must continually be amended and improved 
with the passage of time and changes in circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-12 introduces a new concept in the area of occupational 
health and safety, namely ergonomics. 
Subclause 125(1)(<I>t</I>) provides that the employer is required to 
“ensure that the machinery, equipment and tools used by the 
employees in the course of their employment meet prescribed 
health, safety and ergonomic standards and are safe under all 
conditions of their intended use”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It looks good, but it is a bit vague and short on details.  For 
the layperson, ergonomics is a strange and sophisticated 
sounding word.  It is, if I have understood correctly, the art 
or science of designing or changing the workplace to minimize 
the risk of accidents employees are exposed to in the normal 
exercise of their duties.  I suppose that it is the application 
of the proverb an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. 
Ergonomics is a good thing for employees and, in the long term, 
for employers too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the government intends to come out with regulations or 
guidelines on ergonomics, but the press kit for Bill C-12 is all 
but silent on the topic.  However the U.S. Department of Labour 
has launched a major ergonomics initiative designed to prevent 
approximately 300,000 workplace accidents and save $9 billion 
annually. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The press release describes in detail the roles and 
responsibilities of unions and businesses with respect to the 
new ergonomic standards and shows clearly that the U.S. 
government is very advanced in this field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another aspect of safety in the workplace not mentioned in the 
bill is the psychological protection of workers, their right to 
work in an environment free of harassment and discrimination. 
These problems may cause just as much harm in the workplace as 
accidents or the risk of accidents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the bill provides protection against unfair 
disciplinary measures for workers who report potential hazards, 
it does not seem to make any provision for ensuring a 
psychologically healthy workplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, subsection 122(1) defines health as “the absence 
of physical disease or infirmity or mental illness arising out 
of, linked with or occurring in the course of employment”, but 
stipulates that “for the purposes of this definition, the effects 
of ordinary work place stress are not considered to be physical 
disease or infirmity or a mental illness”.  In the modern world, 
physical or psychological stress takes a heavy toll in the 
workplace, particularly if it is repetitive in nature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is largely in order to do something about repetitive physical 
stress that we are encouraging the healthy ergonomic practices I 
mentioned earlier.

<A HREF="#LINKT44"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the minister will want to touch on this issue during the 
debate, because I think stress elimination or stress prevention 
should have been among the main objectives of any legislation on 
occupational health and safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another positive aspect to this bill in that it takes 
into account the particular needs of pregnant or nursing 
employees. Under paragraph 132(1), an employee who is pregnant 
or nursing may refuse to work in conditions which she believes 
may pose a risk to the health of the foetus or child. She must 
have the existence of such a risk established by a physician of 
her choice. However, since the employer may reassign her to 
another job that would be less dangerous, we will have to see 
how this works out in practice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Public Service Alliance of Canada, one of the unions that 
took part in the consultations, to which I belong, wonders if 
the employee will be adequately protected under these 
provisions. Since it represents civil servants, of whom a large 
number are women, its concerns are legitimate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Public Service Alliance of Canada thinks it is unfortunate 
that employees who work on Parliament Hill are not subject to 
part II of the Canada Labour Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under part III of the Parliamentary Employment and Staff 
Relations Act, employees who work on Parliament Hill would be 
subject to part II of the Canada Labour Code, but it has not 
been enacted yet. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would seem that the Liberal government is less eager to 
improve the occupational health and safety environment of persons 
working in the political environment of this parliament.  I am 
not sure if that is meant to be a reflection on all of us or just 
the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 147 of the act prevents an employer from taking any form 
of disciplinary action against an employee who has taken part in 
a proceeding or inquiry relating to a workplace condition or 
incident.  Missing in this section however is any reference to 
the protection of an employee who testifies before a 
parliamentary committee looking into occupational health and 
safety incidents or policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As parliamentarians we must never forget that our committees are 
often courts of last resort.  No citizen should ever feel 
intimidated in appearing before or providing evidence to a 
parliamentary committee.  A person who believes he or she has 
been disciplined for taking part in a workplace intervention can 
make a complaint to the board, which I assume means the Canadian 
Industrial Relations Board or the Public Service Staff Relations 
Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These boards, I also assume, are filled by order in council and 
as such are political appointments by the government in power. 
Perhaps the minister could provide us with a listing of the 
individuals involved so that we can judge for ourselves if they 
are appointed on the basis of merit or heaven forbid, only on the 
basis of political affiliation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another concern here is that a complaint made under this 
provision cannot be referred to arbitration or adjudication. 
Similarly, section 145.1 states that the minister can appoint an 
appeals officer to adjudicate a decision made through a local 
health and safety process.  Again this is to some extent a 
political appointment and we have no guarantee that all ministers 
will be as circumspect as our current minister will be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 146.3 states that the appeals officer's decision is 
final and cannot be reviewed by a court.  I have big problems 
with any bill that consistently denies a citizen full access to 
due process.  Perhaps the minister could explain the need for 
such restriction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 135(1) indicates that a workplace with 20 or more 
employees must have a workplace health and safety committee.  Yet 
section 135(2) exempts a ship from being required to have such a 
committee, be there 20 sailors or 200.  Perhaps the minister 
could explain why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 137.1 calls for the establishment of a coal mining 
safety commission.  Why does this industry have its own safety 
commission? 
This commission too is appointed by the minister and serves 
during pleasure.  If the safety of coal miners deserves special 
attention, I am not sure that ministerial appointments are the 
way to go especially when their remuneration and expenses are to 
be set by cabinet.

practitioners to conduct medical surveillance and examination 
programs. Section 140 empowers the minister to designate a person 
as a regional safety officer.  This also causes me concern that 
we are mixing safety and political appointments.  I am not sure 
this is the way to go either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also contains some technical amendments to part I of 
the Canada Labour Code.  I am told that when the minister 
appeared before a Senate committee on this part, the minister 
indicated that the next time this part was opened, the whole of 
it would be rendered gender neutral.  The technical amendments 
have opened the matter but there is no sign of a gender neutral 
initiative. Will one be forthcoming? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All in all it is not a bad bill.  It certainly makes progress in 
the field of occupational health and safety.  However I have 
asked some questions and I have pointed out that there are too 
many political appointments, appointments that should be made in 
a more transparent arm's length process. I am confident the 
minister will address many of my concerns when she speaks again.
