	<B>Hon. Sheila Finestone (Secretary of State 
(Multiculturalism) (Status of Women)):</B> Madam Speaker, it is 
so nice to see you in the chair as I make a statement on today, 
International Women's Day.
<P>
	It is a day to look back and celebrate how far women have 
come and to look ahead to see what we still must do to achieve 
equality.
<P>
	On this day I hope all members of the House, women and men 
alike, will take time to reaffirm their commitment to equality for 
the women of Canada: equality in decision making, equality in 
the workplace, equality in the economy and equality in the 
home.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Canada is known as one of the world's leaders in promoting 
women's equality. Canada helped obtain recognition of 
women's rights as an inalienable, integral and indivisible 
element of universal human rights at the World Conference on 
Human Rights held in Vienna last year.
<P>
	Canada has also shown it is in the forefront of efforts to 
combat violence against women throughout the world. The 
survey conducted by Statistics Canada and the report of the 
Canadian Committee on Violence against Women, both 
published last year, were the first of their kind.
<P>
	Canada was also instrumental in preparing the United Nations 
declaration on eliminating violence against women, adopted in 
December 1993. Last week, the UN Human Rights Commission 
announced that it would appoint a special reporter on violence 
against women.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Later today I will be participating in an event with my 
colleague, the Secretary of State for Latin America and Africa 
and Canadian retailer, The Body Shop, as we continue our 
partnering efforts in the country to put an end to violence against 
women.
<P>
<B>(1010 ) </B>
<P>
	The daisy I am supposed to be wearing has not arrived yet. I 
will be wearing it this afternoon as it will symbolize those 
efforts today.
<P>
	As The Body Shop says, in the name of love let us stop the 
violence. That means violence against our sisters, our children, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1958"> 1958 </A></B>
<P>
our mothers and our elderly grandmothers. However all the 
words, the declarations and the research do not mean a thing if 
they are not supported by  consensus in society, a consensus for 
change. The women of Canada have serious concerns about the 
many continuing inequities in our country.
<P>
	Since 1976 the women of Canada have comprised the majority 
of the population, but we still represent less than 20 per cent of 
the members of the House. It is a record number, yes, but still 
not enough.
<P>
	In 1975 we only averaged 60 per cent of men's full time 
earnings. Almost 20 years later that figure is still at only 72 per 
cent, largely because most women are still in low paying, 
insecure jobs. The salaries of immigrant women are only about 
80 per cent of that of the average woman's salary in Canada. 
Women who are in the workforce should receive equal pay for 
work of equal value.
<P>
	In 1975 the poverty rate for families headed by women in 
Canada was 40 per cent. Today that figure has increased to 62 
per cent. The children, our future and theirs are at stake. I find 
those figures really frightening. This is one of the major 
challenges our social security review will have to address.
<P>
	Another disturbing challenge we will address is breast cancer. 
One in every nine Canadian women will get this disease. It is the 
leading killer of women ages 35 to 54. Breast cancer, like other 
women's health concerns, has long been neglected in terms of 
research and prevention.
<P>
	These few statistics speak volumes about women's inequality 
in Canada today. How do we move forward toward the goal the 
United Nations has set for equality by the year 2000? What we 
need are changes in attitudes, priorities and values on the part of 
individuals, communities, organizations and governments to 
give the concerns of women the attention they deserve.
<P>
	Within government we must realize that our decisions have 
the potential to affect women very differently from men. From 
tax law to legislation on dangerous offenders, from health 
policies to immigration guidelines, the impact can be different 
on women because of our different socioeconomic 
circumstances.
<P>
	I ask the members of the House to examine every issue, every 
policy and every program as if they were wearing gender tinted 
glasses, the rose tinted glass, looking at it from a woman's point 
of view.
<P>
	My goal is to ensure that all national legislation and policies 
are developed with full consideration for women for their needs 
and aspirations. I think there is the political will in the House to 
do so. I am confident that the House could become a model 
Parliament, demonstrating that a partnership between women 
and men is the only way to address the issue of women's equality 
right across the spectrum of political ideology.
<P>
	Our government is developing and implementing policies 
which are sensitive to the particular needs of women. I ask 
everyone to work together with us as we put in place a more 
equitable and just society for all Canadians.
<P>
	Next year the world will be looking at our progress and at that 
of other nations at the fourth UN conference on women in 
Beijing, China. We should think of the consequences if we do 
not work to improve the situation for women in Canada. What 
will we say to our daughters and granddaughters who look to 
their elected representatives to help lead the way in this process 
for change? We cannot ask our daughters to hold back their 
aspirations until we are ready for them.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Through our work in our constituencies, our communities and 
our parliamentary committees, each and everyone of us can 
make a difference.
<P>
	Today, on International Women's Day, I am counting on each 
and everyone of you to help me advance the cause of genuine 
equality for Canadian women.
<P>
<B>(1015) </B>
<P>
	In return, I can assure you that future generations of 
Canadians will remember the 35th Parliament of Canada as the 
one that made a difference, for the sake of our daughters and our 
sons.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec):</B> Madam Speaker, 
International Women's Day indeed affords us a unique 
opportunity to assess the progress made by women. Above all, it 
allows us to evaluate the genuine will of our leaders.
<P>
	In terms of statements and commitments, Canada is a world 
leader in this area. However, the government's actions have 
certainly not lived up to its promises. According to the United 
Nations' human development index for 1993, Canada only ranks 
eleventh in so far as the status of women is concerned, whereas 
previously it was in eighth place.
<P>
	As we can see, the actions of our government do not match the 
promises made. Should the secretary of state get the idea of 
responding that her party was not in power then, I would point 
out to her right away that the present government's 
commitments as contained in the throne speech and in the 
budget show no change at all in the course previously set out. No 
new initiatives whatsoever have been put forward.
<P>
	Mention is made of salary disparities between men and 
women. What does the present government intend to do to 
address this situation? Between the throne speech and the 
budget, I see no undertaking to correct the problem of wage 
disparities between men and women, even among the federal 
government's own employees.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1959"> 1959 </A></B>
<P>
	When the Secretary of State for the Status of Women speaks 
of the poverty rate among women, she should draw a connection 
between income and poverty and pursue this analysis, insisting 
that her colleagues comply with court rulings ordering the 
federal government to pay its employees a relatively modest 
sum of money in order to close the wage gap between male and 
female federal employees. No effort has been made in this 
regard and none is planned. What about the government's 
responsibility to address this serious injustice within its very 
own institutions?
<P>
	The secretary of state's goal is that in six years' time, policies 
and laws will take into account the needs of women. Madam 
Speaker, women need money, jobs, equitable salaries and 
adequate working conditions. Everyone already knows that this 
is what women need. How are we going to be any closer to this 
goal in six years when this government has nothing concrete to 
offer? How are we going to achieve this goal without daycares, 
without job creation programs geared to women, without wage 
equity, without occupational training, without a clear vision? 
Madam Speaker, I fear that we will not. Six years is too short a 
time frame given the pace at which the government is setting its 
priorities.
<P>
	I would be curious to know what kind of progress Canada will 
claim to have made at the Beijing Conference. Will it be 
announced that the women and men of this government have 
agreed to take no action whatsoever? Will it be announced that 
the Canadian government does not comply with the country's 
laws and courts?
<P>
	I would like to address the House for the first time in English 
and say:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Put the money where it should be.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Madam Speaker, I am prepared, as are all of my women 
colleagues in the Bloc Quebecois, to work with our male 
colleagues and even with those on the other side of the House. I 
am prepared to put my money where my mouth is.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> Madam Speaker, 
today is a special day, International Women's Day.
<P>
	It is a day to acknowledge together the wonderful 
opportunities that we have as Canadians as we strive to reach our 
full potential regardless of race, language, culture, religion or 
gender.
<P>
	As I speak today I look to the vision and effort of the women 
who preceded me in the House and in politics in general. There 
were some courageous souls who toiled long and hard for the 
betterment of this wonderful country. Nellie McClung and 
Agnes Macphail are two of the more famous names that come to 
mind. These are women of strong character, strong will and 
moral integrity.
<P>
<B>(1020) </B>
<P>
	With role models like these, it is not surprising that women 
have aspired to accomplish great things. Women everywhere 
should be proud of their roles as homemakers, lawyers, bankers, 
university presidents, welders, prime ministers, hockey players, 
pastors, members of Parliament and many more.
<P>
	When we remember Nellie McClung we remember the 
tireless effort to get women declared as persons, to get women 
the vote, to get women elected to provincial legislatures. These 
are the things we take for granted today but were hard fought for 
a mere 70 years ago.
<P>
	Agnes Macphail broke ground for us in the House of 
Commons. She was a woman of vision who spoke for her 
constituents passionately and effectively. Agnes Macphail did 
not see issues as gender specific as she argued on behalf of all of 
her constituents: children, women and the coal miners she 
served.
<P>
	There is no doubt that in our society women face numerous 
serious social challenges. However, special consideration has a 
weary habit of turning inward on itself. It does not guarantee 
equality but rather may generate resentment and hostility 
toward those who do make advancements, thereby diminishing 
their true potential.
<P>
	It is a fundamental Canadian belief that all persons should 
have the right of equality of opportunity and the right to not be 
discriminated against in the workplace or society at large. This 
is not to negate the fact that women do face discriminatory 
practices in the workplace, child care concerns and violence 
within the family unit. The net effect of these concerns has 
implications not only for women but for all of society and 
therefore requires societal solutions.
<P>
	Members of the House will notice that today the approach of 
the Reform Party to women's issues is different from what we 
will hear from others. We believe all Canadians, men and 
women alike, are entitled to equal rights. We also believe that 
the concerns of economic renewal, the deficit and job creation, 
the major themes of the government, belong to all of us.
<P>
	Instead of setting up barriers to equal opportunity by picking 
out special interest groups, we should provide opportunities for 
women, ethnic minorities and the disabled by improving 
education, emphasizing individual achievement and 
dismantling unfair systemic barriers to advancement.
<P>
	In 1982 Pierre Trudeau did just that. He patriated the 
Constitution to help eradicate injustices. Having done so, we 
have been given the opportunity to look beyond gender.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1960"> 1960 </A></B>
<P>
	The secretary of state has cited the problems of poverty for 
single parent families led by a woman. Resolving such a 
difficult issue demands more than merely thinking there is a 
political will for change. We need to get to the root problems and 
take action.
<P>
	It is time to look at our taxation system to see why it penalizes 
family when one parent chooses to stay home to raise the 
children. It is time to look at our judicial system to see why the 
families of divorce and the children of single parents are living 
in such abject poverty because of poor enforcement to secure 
maintenance payments.
<P>
	It is time to look at our criminal justice system to see why 
abusers are permitted to continue to abuse rather than being 
removed from that situation. It is time to look at our education 
system to ensure that all students are given the same 
encouragement and support to pursue their dreams and their 
goals.
<P>
	These issues, while most often affecting women, are not 
issues that fall exclusively to women. The Constitution values 
the importance of all Canadians and so should we as 
parliamentarians. The secretary of state for the status of women 
claimed that we are elected by the women of Canada to represent 
their needs and concerns in all of our decision making. The 
constituents of Calgary Southeast elected me to represent them 
collectively, not just the women. In all the debates and for all the 
issues that I will consider I will always consider all my 
constituents in my riding. They expect nothing more from me 
and nothing less. That is the point of difference in the 35th 
Parliament.

	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House urge the government to recognize the principle of economic 
equality between women and men and to implement measures, in areas of 
federal jurisdiction, to guarantee women equity in employment, wages and 
living conditions.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	She said: Mr. Speaker, in 1967, the United Nations 
proclaimed March 8 International Women's Day. Today, 17 
years later, this day of thought remains essential to the 
furtherance of the cause of women. While much progress has 
been made, women continue to suffer social, economic and 
cultural discrimination.
<P>
	To make a progress report on the status of women as we 
celebrate Women's Day would be a colossal task, a real feat, 
especially considering that each and every woman in Quebec 
and Canada is living her status as a woman in her own way. 
Women have to fight for their rights and dignity in various ways 
depending on their socio-cultural environment, values, age, 
background and civil status.
<P>
	At one end of the spectrum you have women who have chosen 
to stay at home and at the other end, women who have decided to 
combine career and family. In between, there is a large number 
of women who have no other choice but to stay at home for lack 
of adequate resources to get integrated in the labour market. 
Future generations will not accept such constraints imposed by 
outdated social patterns and attitudes, constraints which 
overlook the legitimate needs of 52 per cent of the population.
<P>
	Constraints put on women take many forms, but all describe 
the same reality: inequity and disparities. My remarks today 
will deal with inequity in employment, wage disparities, 
inequity within the family, inequity in tax treatment. While the 
status of every woman may be different, each has already 
encountered this bottom line, inequity and disparities.
<P>
	Countless speeches, reports, inquiries, petitions, briefs, 
testimonies and statistics have been presented to this House in 
support of women. All hon. members, past and present, have 
been made aware of their problems. One can wonder how many 
more economic inequities and acts of violence women will have 
to suffer and how many more barriers to autonomy they will 
have to encounter before the government takes concrete steps 
and fulfil its social leadership responsibility. For justice to be 
served, the government must pass proactive legislation to 
guarantee equality between women and men, while fulfilling its 
commitments to women.
<P>
	Equality between women and men should first be assessed in 
economic terms. This is very basic. As we know, the most 
common source of income is employment earnings. Recent 
statistics show a $11,000 gap between the average earnings of 
women and those of men. This discrepancy is explained mainly 
by the fact that the majority of women have low-paid jobs in 
retail, clerical and service trades.
<P>
	In 1992, part time jobs represented 16.8 per cent of all jobs in 
this country and we know that more and more jobs are part time. 
Seventy per cent of part time jobs are held by women. The fact of 
the matter is that the main characteristics of these jobs, besides 
meagre wages, are a lack of career opportunities and a lack of 
training, as  opposed to full time jobs. Also, it has been 
established that working part time reduced chances of finding 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1962"> 1962 </A></B>
<P>
stable full-time employment after having been unemployed, 
thus increasing considerably the risks of joining the ranks of the 
non-working population.
<P>
	In Quebec, in 1992, 24 per cent of working women worked 
part time, as compared to 9 per cent of men. Given the 
unavailability of full-time jobs, a certain portion of part-time 
work could be considered as hidden unemployment and in 
Quebec, for example, there are 113,000 women-twice as many 
women as men-in that situation. If these women were 
considered to be unemployed, their unemployment rate would 
climb from 11.9 per cent to 19.5 per cent, while that of men 
would increase from 13.4 per cent to 16.4 per cent.
<P>
<B>(1035) </B>
<P>
	In its report made public in July 1993, the Canadian Advisory 
Council on the Status of Women noted that, although the media 
give more coverage to massive layoffs affecting men, women 
are in a particularly disquieting situation. Those who lose their 
jobs during a recession have less chance of finding new jobs 
afterwards. Between 1981 and 1984, 25 per cent of laid-off 
women did not return to the workforce, compared with 12 per 
cent of laid-off men.
<P>
	I emphasize today that the creation of full-time, long-lasting 
and well-paid jobs must be among the Canadian government's 
top priorities. In this regard, I find it deplorable that this 
government's only concrete measure to create jobs is the 
infrastructure program. This so-called godsend will in fact 
contribute very little to the improvement of women's economic 
situation. Is this how the government demonstrates its interest in 
striking an equitable balance in job access? Let us be serious: 
the only jobs, even short-term jobs, likely to be created are 
almost exclusively in employment sectors traditionally 
dominated by men such as construction, transport and primary 
industry where heavy-machinery operators, road workers and 
labourers are needed.
<P>
	We must also underline and condemn the emphasis put by the 
federal government on reducing labour costs. The freeze on 
salaries and levels in the public service as well as personnel 
reduction plans have had disastrous effects on the economic 
situation of women, who account for 45 per cent of all federal 
public servants. Between now and 1996, the government will 
make cuts totalling around $1.5 billion. The Canadian Union of 
Public Employees predicts that women will be hit harder, since 
they are found in part-time jobs, even precarious, casual 
part-time jobs, in the Canadian public service.
<P>
	For example, while women hold 41 per cent of jobs in the 
administrative and foreign service category, they accounted for 
51 per cent of laid-off workers. In the technical category, 58 per 
cent of laid-off workers are women, who only hold 15 per cent 
of all jobs. Women lose their jobs more often than men and their 
jobs do not pay as well.
<P>
	We also learned that the government would close on March 
31, 1994 the office of representation and employment 
orientation for women created in 1983 under a government 
strategy to increase women's representation at the management 
level. This office will be closed because an assessment 
conducted in 1993 indicated that the government had achieved 
its goals. The Public Service Alliance of Canada has challenged 
the conclusions of this assessment.
<P>
	Allow me to express some reservations on these conclusions 
and to question the long-term effects of closing this office. All 
parents know how important role models are in teenagers' 
development. We have a right to ask how young girls who need 
such role models will be able to identify with successful career 
women if we water down the measures to increase their numbers 
in the public service.
<P>
	It should be obvious that a responsible government must act to 
remove barriers to women's full participation in the workforce. 
To achieve this, the government should strive to eliminate job 
segregation still alive today, which is the main obstacle to job 
equity.
<P>
	The need to act is all the more urgent, in job training for 
instance, that the key sectors for job creation in the medium 
term are identified as those traditionally dominated by men. In 
Quebec, this amounts to 80 per cent of the jobs that will be 
created in the next ten years.
<P>
<B>(1040) </B>
<P>
	The government must show leadership and seek to increase 
the presence of women in all fields of employment and at all 
levels. It must continue to reduce wage gaps and encourage the 
adoption of human resource management practices based on 
equity. What does it say about our society when our own 
government does not respect the measures and laws in place!
<P>
	In 1992, the previous government ignored the 
recommendations and rulings on pay equity rendered in 1991 by 
the Human Rights Commission. In 1993, an inquiry by this 
commission concluded that Canada Post paid its female 
employees $2,500 less for duties, skills, responsibilities and 
working conditions that were identical to those of men. The 
Commission concluded that the Canadian Human Rights Act 
was ineffective and not credible.
<P>
	Furthermore, at a press conference in March 1993, the Chief 
Commissioner pointed out that women in the Canadian Public 
Service earned 30 per cent less than their male colleagues. He 
also emphasized that economic disparities between men and 
women in Canada were a flagrant contradiction of our country's 
national and international commitments.I would remind you 
that in 1981 Canada ratified the United Nations Convention on 
the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1963"> 1963 </A></B>
<P>
and under this convention Canada promised to respect the 
principle of equal pay for work of equal value.
<P>
	At the United Nations World Conference on Women in Kenya 
in 1985, Canada also adopted action strategies to promote 
women, a project to ensure women's equality in UN member 
countries by the year 2000. Where are we today with these 
commitments? Is it not ironic that the theme chosen by Status of 
Women Canada is women's equality-towards 1995!
<P>
	In that organizations's pamphlet, we read that this is also the 
time to ask what still remains to be done for women to become 
full and equal partners in society.
<P>
	I dare suggest that the government implement these fine 
words with its own female employees. These women would 
hardly be surprised to learn that the United Nations human 
development index for 1993 puts Canada only in 11th place for 
the status of women, compared to 8th place before.
<P>
	Tax legislation is another reason for women's economic 
inequality. Allowing alimony paid for children to be deductible 
from income tax is systemic discrimination against women, 
since women in most cases still have child custody. By taking 
that approach, the law in a way rewards the ex-husband who 
does not have custody of the children and penalizes and 
impoverishes the former wife who has custody. By extension, 
the children are also penalized. This law, which goes back to 
1942, in no way reflects today's reality.
<P>
	On behalf of all women, I call for the abolition of this tax 
measure. I also ask for a thorough study of the unfairness of tax 
legislation to families.
<P>
	Having considered the economic conditions of working 
women with children, I will now deal with the economic 
situation of unemployed women.
<P>
	The government's recent cuts and budget restrictions 
affecting unemployment insurance will very clearly have a 
negative impact on the living conditions of many low-income 
women. The Canadian Advisory Council on the Status of 
Women points out that many people affected by these 
restrictions are single parents and that only the poorest people 
will be entitled to have their UI benefits increased to 60 per cent 
of their salary.
<P>
<B>(1045) </B>
<P>
	To be eligible to this tiny increase, women will have to declare 
their dependents and allow UI program officials free access to 
personal information regarding their family. I denounce this 
new form of interference in the private life of poor women. I 
denounce this form of humiliation that the government wants to 
impose upon them and which is tantamount to a violation of 
their dignity.
<P>
	Another form of violation of the dignity of women is the 
violence to which they are subjected within the family. In its 
recent report, the Canadian Panel on Violence Against Women 
points out that this abuse is unlikely to stop, as long as women 
are not treated equally. The government will have to take that 
into consideration when it decides on the measures required  to 
put a stop to violence against women. Is there any need to 
remind the House of the promises made in that regard? I have no 
choice but to say that those promises were certainly not 
implemented in the recent budget.
<P>
	In this respect, we wonder about the impact of the 5 per cent 
cuts to the funds allocated to various organizations. I am 
thinking here of those 376 battered women's homes in Canada, 
which form the main support network for women and whose 
usefulness has been demonstrated. Women of all ages now speak 
out and denounce the violence to which they are subjected. But 
what good is that if the government makes cuts in the budgets 
allocated to organizations which are in a position to provide 
concrete help?
<P>
	Police officers, judges and lawyers are also involved in the 
issue of violence against women. Did the government meet its 
commitment to allocate the necessary funds to train these people 
and make them aware of the need for a different kind of 
approach regarding these victims and their abusers?
<P>
	In conclusion, I believe that the basic principle of economic 
equality between women and men is far from being a priority for 
this government. I am talking of course of real, not verbal 
priority. Indeed, one wonders if the government has the will to 
facilitate access to jobs for women and to help them keep 
working. The Liberals made a nice promise to the effect that 
they would create 150,000 day-care spaces. We now know that 
this will not be the case. Indeed, by imposing as a condition a 3 
per cent annual growth for the GDP, the government has put this 
project on the back burner. Even the Minister of Finance 
admitted in the House yesterday that such growth would not 
occur for three years. Once again, the government shows how 
little it cares about family needs, and particularly the needs of 
women.
<P>
	We must change the course of history which, unfortunately, 
tells us that it is events such as wars and revolutions which best 
promote the participation of women in the workforce. These 
conflicts force the government to call upon women to replace 
men at work. When this happens, women are offered training 
sessions to become mechanics, welders or electricians. The 
skills of women are then put to full use. Daycare centres are 
created to make it easier for women to go to work. However, 
once those conflicts end, the men come back and politicians 
send the women home, offering them minimal compensation in 
the form of allowances to encourage them to do so.
<P>
	We want economic equality between women and men. We 
want the recognition of the principle of equality but, more 
importantly, we want the implementation of the necessary 
measures to ensure that equality now.

<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Finestone (Secretary of State 
(Multiculturalism) (Status of Women)):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with a great deal of interest to my colleague's discourse.
<P>
	Many of the issues with which she has indicated a serious 
concern are priorities we have enunciated in the red book, in the 
speech from the throne and will also be found in the budget.
<P>
	I would particularly bring to her attention the explicit 
undertaking by this government concerning child care spaces 
which we also recognize as the primary building block. When 3 
per cent of GNP is arrived at we will be investing another 
$50,000 a year. We already subsidize over 633,000 child care 
spaces.
<P>

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I want to thank the hon. member for Québec for her motion, 
because in it she asks this House to support a principle which is 
dear to my heart: economic equality between women and men.
<P>
	I want her to know that I have been active in women's groups 
for 30 years, and there is not a single objective we have pursued 
with as much energy and dedication as that of economic equality 
for women. The process is a slow one, and I believe there are 
other women in this House who would agree and who have 
fought these battles for many years. The process did not start 
with this generation. It started much earlier.
<P>
	The economic problems of the past ten years and the priorities 
of our Conservative predecessors caused the circumstances of 
many women to decline, often forcing them to live in poverty 
and dependency.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order, please.
<P>
	I would like to know whether the minister is taking part in the 
period for questions and comments after the speech by the hon. 
member for Québec.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Is the hon. minister speaking on debate?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Finestone:</B> On debate.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I am wondering if I could 
oblige. Following the intervention by the hon. member for 
Québec, there was a 10-minute period of questions and 
comments.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order, please. Today, 
pursuant to Standing Order 81(22), all members have a 
20-minute maximum and speeches are subject to a 10-minute 
period of questions and comments.
<P>
	A point of order was raised by the hon. member for 
Rimouski-Témiscouata.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay:</B> Mr. Speaker, we were advised that since the 
hon. member for Québec was the mover of the motion, there 
would be no limit on her speaking time and no period for 
questions and comments. Subsequently, the secretary of state 
would be able to speak to the motion as well, and then other 
members would have a 20-minute maximum, and so forth. That 
is what we were told, if I am not mistaken.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> With respect, I was 
simply following the Standing Orders. If the House agrees to 
proceed in this way, the Chair will of course interpret this as 
being the will of the House, and we will proceed accordingly.
<P>
	Is it agreed?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I will now recognize the 
secretary of state, and I apologize for interrupting.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Finestone:</B> I am sorry, I missed that.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I wanted to tell you that 
the Chair was simply applying the applicable standing order. If 
it is the wish of the House to continue as has been suggested by 
the secretary of state and hon. members opposite, certainly the 
Chair will adhere to that. On debate, the hon. secretary of state.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Finestone:</B> Mr. Speaker, the purpose of this very 
important day and the excellent choice of the opposition day 
subject matter encourages us to allow as many people as 
possible to speak in the House. Presumably that is why we went 
ahead with what would seem to be a contradictory situation. I 
thank you for your openness in accepting the decision of the 
House.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I think the time has come to renew our commitment to 
women's economic self-sufficiency and become even more 
dedicated to achieving economic equality and equity in the 
labour market.
<P>
<B>(1055) </B>
<P>
	It is a fact that women's equality, and equity and justice for all 
can only be achieved through economic independence. We are 
also aware that economic equality is both the basis and the 
measure of the status of women in our society.
<P>
	Women must have a place in the job world, receive equal pay 
for work of equal value and contribute their fair share to our 
collective wealth.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1965"> 1965 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I feel privileged to be part of a government which is 
determined to accelerate the advancement of economic 
opportunities for women. I am honoured to serve under a Prime 
Minister who is committed to that goal.
<P>
	The Liberal philosophy has always been based on fairness, 
equity and social justice. The Liberal tradition is rich in 
accomplishments and success toward women's equality.
<P>
	The last Liberal government brought us the Canadian Human 
Rights Act, the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and 
initiated the Royal Commission on Equality in Employment in 
1983. The same government appointed the first woman to the 
Supreme Court of Canada, the first woman Speaker of the House 
and the first woman Governor General of Canada.
<P>
	Now in a little more than 100 days our Prime Minister has 
appointed the first woman Deputy Prime Minister, the first 
woman Government Leader in the Senate and the first woman 
Clerk of the Privy Council.
<P>
	For the first time we have had a government sensitive to the 
different impact of programs and policies on women. It is a 
government willing to ensure that gender perspective is taken 
into consideration in all the proposed changes whether they are 
fiscal, social or juridical in nature.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We are aware that women make a tremendous contribution to 
our society and our economy. The economic disparities that 
affect women however, are related to a number of factors.
<P>
	First of all, women do much work that is not remunerated. 
Whether they do volunteer work in the community or take care 
of elderly parents, all women spend a significant part of their 
lives helping others without payment, out of love and 
dedication.
<P>
	Second, women today still shoulder more than their share of 
the responsibility for their families and their homes. I am often 
amazed to see how young men, and especially young fathers, 
share parental and household tasks. According to the statistics, 
however, women still do most of the work.
<P>
	The third disparity hinges on the kind of jobs where women 
tend to be concentrated, the so-called pink ghettos. In 
employment sectors like office work, sales or services, 80 per 
cent or more of the employees are women. Generally speaking, 
these jobs do not pay as well as jobs in sectors where men are 
more numerous.
<P>
	Finally, women face attitude problems. When they mention 
cases of clearly discriminatory behaviour, the answer is often: 
``I do not see what the problem is''. I am afraid people will have 
to learn to see, and this is particularly true in cases of sexual 
harassment and sometimes even in cases of violence against 
women.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I hope that every member in the House realizes how important 
it is for our country that women achieve economic equality. It is 
a matter of fairness and justice but it is also a true economic 
issue for all Canadians. In times of economic restructuring and 
increased international competitiveness, we have to make use of 
the full potential of all our citizens.
<P>
	I wish my hon. colleague had included in her motion the other 
designated categories of Canadians who are also struggling on 
the road toward equality, both socially and economically. I am 
referring to visible minorities, aboriginal peoples and persons 
with disabilities. Those are areas where I must be an advocate at 
all times and members will agree being an advocate for those 
people is very important. In each one of these groups there are 
women who must face double and sometimes triple factors of 
discrimination. Women politicians have a particular 
responsibility and a special opportunity to break down these 
barriers.
<P>
<B>(1100 ) </B>
<P>
	We can reach out to other women. We can help level the 
political playing field for them. We can call for action and get 
action. It may not always be as fast as we would wish. We can do 
this in partnership with men and we can do this from both our 
riding perspective as well as the perspective of our province and 
our country. That is our job. The total country is ours.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	That brings me to the second part of the motion presented by 
my friend from Quebec, who is asking the government to 
implement measures, in areas of federal jurisdiction, to 
guarantee women equity in employment, wages and living 
conditions.
<P>
	First, I would like to remind my colleague that, in our famous 
red book, we made three definite commitments in that respect.
<P>
	To start with, for the Employment Equity Act to be really 
effective, it must apply to the largest number possible so as to 
broaden its impact. I believe that members will agree with me on 
that. Now, for my second point.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We will through our human rights legislation enlarge the 
legislative authority to initiate investigations of employment 
equity issues.
<P>
	Third, federal contractors should be subject to mandatory 
compliance with the principles of the Employment Equity Act.
<P>
	I remember when that act came into the House. It had some 
very big holes in it. I hope, as we put in a mandatory review 
period which is coming up shortly, that we will have filled those 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1966"> 1966 </A></B>
<P>
holes with legislation before we even get to the review stage 
because they were very obvious by their absence.
<P>
	We believe that the federal contractors program presents a 
good opportunity to demonstrate our commitment to the 
principle of employment equity. The message is loud and clear. 
If one wants to do business with the federal government, one 
must implement employment equity in the workplace. That 
means fair jobs based on merit and those based on merit will get 
a first choice and open access to that job application.
<P>
	As I have mentioned before in the House, this rule applies to 
our infrastructure program as well. Our representatives at the 
selection committee have all been instructed to look into the 
employment equity aspect of every project and to take this into 
account in their final recommendations.
<P>
	I believe that this plan toward a more equitable working 
environment for women answers my colleague's motion for the 
most part. She knows, like every Canadian knows by now, that if 
it is in the red book it will happen because we are now quickly 
turning our promises into action.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I believe that the plan I just outlined directly answers the 
request made by my colleague from Quebec in her motion.
<P>
	However, I would like to add a couple of points. First of all, I 
firmly believe that legislation, agreements, regulations and 
policy statements are useful, if not essential, to bring us closer 
to economic equality and social justice.
<P>
	Nonetheless, I am convinced that without a reasonable 
consensus among citizens and without the active participation 
of all Canadians, we will progress at a snail's pace. However, if 
we all strive towards the same end, in a joint effort, we will 
progress by leaps and bounds.
<P>
	Therefore, I would suggest to Canadians that they put this 
International Women's Day to good use by drawing up a list of 
initiatives we could take to improve the status of women in our 
country.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Government cannot do it all. It takes everyone to participate, 
men and women in all sectors of our society.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	After seeing, these last few days, business and union leaders 
jointly and severally approve a recommendation package aimed 
at improving women's working and living conditions, I cannot 
help thinking that there is light at the end of the tunnel. It is only 
a matter of time.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	My second thought deals with a degree of opportunities. I am 
dedicated to pay equity and enhancing working conditions for 
women, but first women have to be able to find a job. This is 
where this government is being the most helpful to women. By 
making job creation and growth its top priority, the government 
is providing women with the basic essential opportunity to reach 
out for economic independence and equality.
<P>
	I have to point to the small and medium sized business 
undertakings in which we are going to ensure access to capital, 
where over 30 per cent of those businesses belong to women, 
where they are twice as successful as men and where 85 per cent 
of all new jobs are created in the country. This will indicate to 
everyone that we have a strong commitment to women.
<P>
<B>(1105 ) </B>
<P>
	We on this side of the House believe that a strong economy is 
the key to women's economic independence and we believe that 
a strong economy is based upon the full and fair participation of 
all our citizens. It is true that the greatest resource we have in the 
country is grey matter, intellectual property, and 50 per cent of it 
rests in the heads of women.
<P>
	This government knows that for Canada to prosper it must 
take full benefit of all the talents of all of our citizens and ensure 
that all Canadians are treated with fairness and equity. This is 
precisely what we intend to do.
<P>
	On February 7, 1994 the leader of the government in the 
House set forth the principle that the decision of this 
government as to how to vote on any motion would be 
determined on the basis of the merits of the motion. In 
accordance with that principle, in accordance with openness and 
right of obligations and actions in this House, and in keeping 
with the spirit of parliamentary reform, I am happy to inform the 
House that it is the intention of the government to support the 
motion now before us.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Daphne Jennings (Mission-Coquitlam):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on behalf of the whip of the Reform Party, I would like 
to advise the House that pursuant to Standing Order 43(2) our 
speakers on the motion will be dividing their time.
<P>
	In speaking on today's opposition day motion which 
addresses the economic equality between men and women, I am 
drawn back to my 30 years in the classroom where I hope I 
successfully taught our young people that they did not deserve 
special treatment because they were women or that the young 
men did not deserve special treatment because they were men. I 
hope I set high standards in my classroom. The only 
qualifications for achievement were hard work, the ability to 
respect all fellow students and the ability to accept 
responsibility.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1967"> 1967 </A></B>
<P>
	By now it is obvious that while I hold women in high regard, I 
also hold men in high regard. Part of this respect comes from my 
father, a military man of four wars: the Irish rebellion, the first 
world war, the Palestine uprising and the second world war.
<P>
	I do not remember him telling any of his nine children, six of 
them girls, that there were any restrictions on what they could do 
with their lives. I only remember one strong message given to 
each of his children: a man or a woman is worthy of their hire. 
Do not be asking how much pay you are going to get. Work hard, 
your employer will like your responsible attitude. If you treat 
others as you wish to be treated, this usually holds true.
<P>
	My mother never went out to work, enjoyed her home, raising 
her children, president of the PTA, and encouraged all her 
children to work hard. Although she never learned to drive, she 
encouraged her children to, and her daughters to carry their own 
weight in society. I remember while she was on the PTA our 
school board served hot lunches every day to each student 
through the help of volunteer parents and the community. The 
government did not pay for these hot lunches.
<P>
	Why am I saying all this? There are a lot of members in this 
House who, like me, are over 50 and who can attest to these 
strong teachings given to us by our parents of all cultures and all 
nationalities. These parents if still alive are grandparents and 
some great-grandparents. Many of us here today are 
grandparents. 1994 is the year of the family and I can think of no 
better way to celebrate International Women's Day than to pay 
tribute to grandparents around the world.
<P>
	In many cultures our senior citizens are treated with much 
more respect than here in Canada. They are given a position of 
honour and respect in the family. If we look at various cultures 
around the world we see the importance of grandparents in 
raising children. With the British Columbia Indians, for 
example, traditionally the grandparents raise the young people. 
Also in the Chinese culture and many other cultures around the 
world.
<P>
	Throughout the history of mankind societies throughout Asia, 
Europe and North America, all of them, had concerns for the 
children. Throughout all these societies, whether a modern 
society or aboriginal people, there was always a place in the old 
days where the elders were respected. The elders helped train 
the children. They passed on tradition, culture and heritage. It 
went way beyond that. It went to the point of giving the feeling 
of security, the feeling of love and warmth.
<P>
<B>(1110) </B>
<P>
	In today's world of broken marriages and single parents we 
need the support and the stability of our grandparents more than 
ever before.
<P>
	In this year of the family there are no special interest groups. 
Rather we must look at the whole family from the youngest to 
the oldest. It is very significant that grandparents seem to have a 
real natural regard and concern for grandchildren.
<P>
	Not so long ago this subject was debated in the Alberta 
legislature. Mrs. Hughes quoted a study by Jim Gladstone at the 
University of Guelph. He conducted a study in 1986 that 
reinforced the importance of grandparents to grandchildren. The 
report concluded that when marriages break down grandmothers 
have more contact with their grandchildren than perhaps ever 
before. Gladstone believes that this means that grandparents 
have an innate tendency to respond to the needs and the 
emotional upheaval of their grandchildren and their children.
<P>
	Previous research on children of divorces suggested that 
young children have very little opportunity to talk about the 
breakup.
<P>
	Gladstone goes on to say that through the child's unique 
relationship with the grandparents they can obtain the kind of 
counselling, comfort, reassurance that they need providing they 
have access, continuous access.
<P>
	Therefore there is a necessity for creative legislation that 
protects access for both grandparents. We can that see that 
grandparents have a great deal to contribute to the life of these 
children of broken marriages.
<P>
	I understand that article 611 of Quebec Civil Code states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In no case may the father or mother without serious cause place obstacles to 
personal relationship between the child and grandparents.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This is in Quebec civil law. It is the only province thus far that 
has enshrined it in law.
<P>
	We also need to look at precedents in legislation. For example 
50 states in the United States have similar types of legislation. 
Last week I had the honour of meeting with Nancy Wooldridge, 
president of Canadian Grandparents Rights Association, British 
Columbia Branch, formed in 1986. Nancy Wooldridge 
successfully defended her rights as a grandparent in the courts in 
1984.
<P>
	The purpose of the association is to promote, support, and 
assist grandparents and their families in maintaining or 
re-establishing family ties and family stability where the family 
has been disrupted, especially those ties between grandparents 
and grandchildren.
<P>
	We could give many practical examples of how grandparents 
have been obstructed through the court system from contacting 
children when they could have had a very positive effect on 
them. The Grandparents Rights Association has many 
documented cases.
<P>
	Again because of time we are not going to go into them today. 
In many cases it is a personal tragedy for the grandparents but 
more important for the grandchildren who are deprived of this 
most important asset.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1968"> 1968 </A></B>
<P>
	Therefore it is important that we have legal protection for our 
grandchildren. We can recognize that all grandparents are not 
beneficial to grandchildren but there are times when they should 
have direct access. However this can still be established by the 
courts. We do not suggest we change this.
<P>
	This would be a very positive step toward protection and 
development of the child. It is something that lawmakers in 
Canada could contribute to. I am asking the government in any 
consideration of future legislation to consider including the 
rights of grandparents in a fair and legitimate manner.
<P>
	I would be remiss if I did not recognize the past efforts of 
other parliamentarians who have brought to the House the 
concerns of grandparents. The hon. member for Ottawa West, 
one of our Liberal members, presented petitions and Stan 
Wilbee of the last Parliament presented Bill C-332 to amend the 
Divorce Act to protect the rights of grandparents as well as 
grandchildren. Now is the time for all members of the House to 
recognize the rights of the complete family in this 1994 year of 
the family.
<P>
	Tomorrow I will be presenting a petition containing over 
3,000 names in continuing support for the complete family and 
in support of our grandparents. At this hour I am awaiting news 
from British Columbia that my seventh grandchild has been 
born.
<P>
	I would like at this time to move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the motion be amended by adding immediately after the word 
``conditions'' the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``through measures that support equality of opportunity without resorting to gender 
discrimination of any kind''</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1115) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I wonder if I could ask the 
assistance of the member for Mission-Coquitlam to be assured 
that I understood clearly the terms made by the secretary of state 
regarding the agreement between parties on the intervention by 
the member for Mission-Coquitlam. I believe the member for 
Beaver River will have five minutes of questions and comments. 
Is that in the next round?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jennings:</B> That is correct, Mr. Speaker, five minutes 
questions.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The amendment has been 
deemed receivable.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River):</B> Mr. Speaker, I know we 
are not allowed to talk about who is not in the Chamber, but let 
me flip that around and say that on this day of women's issues I 
will make mention perhaps of who is in the Chamber. Before I 
started I counted 16 men and five women. I am proud to say that 
three of the women are Reformers here in this caucus. When we 
talk about women being important, we think we are. We would 
encourage all to be here and listen to this.
<P>
	I grew up in a single parent family in the greater Vancouver 
area. I would like to pay particular mention and tribute to my 
mother who raised, probably by the scruff of the neck, four 
daughters and one son. I pay tribute to her today because things 
were difficult back in the sixties doing that. It was the anomaly 
back then to be a single parent family. It almost seems like today 
we are strange if we grow up in a two parent home.
<P>
	In honour of my mother, Joyce Levy, I thank her for the job 
she did of raising four girls and one boy in greater Vancouver in 
the sixties when times were tough. It was difficult.
<P>
	I believe that any success our family would experience was 
because my mother said: ``You are special regardless''. She had 
four girls and one boy, but we were all treated equally. The 
success that any of us has experienced in our lives today is 
because she said: ``If you think that you can do something, I 
believe you are competent, I believe you are able, go for it''. It 
was not: ``You are a girl, so we think you should have special 
status''.
<P>
	I am grateful for that. I am sure that all of us here who were 
treated that way in a family when we were growing up are 
grateful We are not here in the Chamber today because we are 
women necessarily.
<P>
	I can think of nothing sadder than my campaigning in Beaver 
River, going door knocking and saying: ``Hello, my name is 
Deborah Grey. I am your candidate for the Reform Party. Please 
vote for me because I am a woman''. Nothing would be sadder 
for any of us in this Chamber, whether male or female, than to be 
able to appeal to the pity of someone to vote for us on those 
grounds.
<P>
	The secretary of state mentioned in her remarks that she was 
elected by the women of Canada. We as women in this House 
were not elected by the women in our ridings. I do not think 
there would be enough to carry the vote, frankly. I live in rural 
Alberta and I know that as many women as men voted for me.
<P>
	I was not elected to the Chamber by women to talk only about 
women's issues. I am here to talk about the economy, fiscal 
restraint, farming, the oil industry and everything else that we 
think is important in the constituency of Beaver River and all 
across Canada.
<P>
	Let us not continue to make these ridiculous delineations 
between women's issues and men's issues. I suspect that some 
guidelines and some division lines have been drawn.
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
	Let me refer a little more closely to what the Reform Party 
feels about the traditional lines of women's issues. We believe 
that our party's position is quite different from the traditional 
parties' positions in that we do not maintain a separate 
organization for women members. In the Reform Party women 
are dedicated to the same goals as men. These goals are fiscal, 
political and  constitutional reform. I do not think there are any 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1969"> 1969 </A></B>
<P>
lines to be drawn between women and men when we look at the 
things that are happening across the country.
<P>
	Reformers prefer to work together on these issues, searching 
for realistic solutions which are practical and acceptable within 
the framework of a democratic, individualistic society.
<P>
	Our party does not regard any political questions as being 
purely women's issues. Child care is not gender exclusive. It is a 
social, family and financial issue. Job and pay equity are not 
gender, age or ethnic exclusive. They are employment issues 
and should be dealt with as such.
<P>
	If we see ourselves going down the road to talk about 
affirmative action, pay equity, special status for some, we can 
see where that road would lead us. Let us back up to the fork in 
the road and say these are issues we need to deal with in terms of 
absolute equality for all Canadians. It is a slippery slope that we 
go down if we say child care, job and pay equity are specifically 
women's issues.
<P>
	What about sexual and domestic violence? They are not 
gender, age or ethnic exclusive. They are purely criminal and 
law enforcement issues and we should deal with them as such, 
not just breaking them off as women's issues. Then we see that it 
becomes a special interest group and dear knows we have 
enough of those in the country. I am not part of a special interest 
group. Let me make that very clear in <I>Hansard</I> forevermore.
<P>
	The Reform Party believes that the issues of child care, job 
and pay equity and family violence are of equal concern to the 
majority of both men and women in society and we should start 
treating them as such. The other federal parties prefer to 
separate many important issues into specifically women's 
issues. This approach has led to the segregation of women into a 
special interest group.
<P>
	I am not a special interest group. Let me say it again because I 
feel that strongly about it. I am a woman and I am proud to be a 
woman. First and foremost I am a Canadian and I would like 
people to think in this Chamber as well as in Beaver River and 
right across the country that perhaps I am here because of some 
capabilities and some abilities and specific skills, not just 
because of my gender. This place will sink when that happens.
<P>
	I resent being told that because of my sex I am entitled to 
special considerations. For what? It is demeaning. It is an insult 
to my intelligence and a presumption that I am unable to 
compete on my own abilities.
<P>
	I would like to expand on my statement on child care. We 
recognize that since only women bear children they often make 
choices about their lives that are different than those of men. For 
women who wish to devote their energy to child raising, a public 
policy framework sympathetic to families is necessary. My 
colleague talked about this being the international year of the 
family.
<P>
	Let us look at the family. The family is the basic unit of our 
society, far more natural than it is to just hunker down with the 
women and say that we will look at those issues specifically. 
This should include generous maternity leave and re-entry 
provisions to make it possible for women to combine a career 
and family.
<P>
	Our party supports child care programs that are based on 
financial need, not the method of child care chosen; programs 
that subsidize children and parents, not institutions and 
professionals. Therefore when we are always labelled as being 
anti-day care that is not the truth. We are in favour of child care 
but let us target it to the people who need it most and to people, 
not institutions and the professionals.
<P>
	While some parents believe that day care is a viable option 
others prefer to care for their children within their home. The 
Reform Party advocates policies which permits parents to 
decide how best to care for their own children. We believe they 
should have that right.
<P>
	For those unfortunate cases in which families break down, 
and I realize that they break down and I alluded earlier to the fact 
that I come from a single parent home, the federal government 
should assist provinces in developing reciprocal arrangements 
for enforcing realistic support payments from non-custodial 
parents.
<P>
	Initiatives in this direction would be in line with the Reform 
philosophy of individual responsibility and would help reduce 
the dependence of single mothers on family assistance.
<P>
	I turn to the issue of women in the workforce as we are in the 
Chamber, which for economic reasons includes a large majority 
of Canadian women. The Reform Party advocates a free and 
open labour market in which people are judged on their personal 
achievements.
<P>
<B>(1125) </B>
<P>
	Promotion on the basis of merits, not quotas, should govern 
the advancement of both men and women. This quest for 
statistical parity between men and women damages the very 
fabric of our society by compromising the merit principle.
<P>
	Let me say again that any woman who sits in the Chamber, at 
the table, in the chair or in a seat as a member of Parliament 
should be here on merit and not because of some hiring false 
quota that says we will have so many women sitting in the 
Chamber, at the table, in <I>Hansard</I>, in the translation booth or 
whatever. We advocate enlightened personnel policies to end 
condescension and harassment toward women and to develop 
mutual respect in the workplace.
<P>
	The Reform Party consistently supports the philosophy of 
treating people according to their individual merits and 
achieve-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1970"> 1970 </A></B>
<P>
ments. Our goal is to maximize individual freedom for all 
Canadians within the restraints of responsible citizenship.
<P>
	I will say a few words with respect to sexual and domestic 
violence in closing. The Reform Party believes these issues 
should be dealt with by a legal system based on common law 
principles in which sentencing is a more adequate penalty and 
deterrent. We have spoken at length in the Chamber about what 
inadequacies there are in the laws and regulations in our 
country. We need to tighten those up so that there are really 
serious deterrents for people who are tempted to go after 
spouses and batter them or whatever.
<P>
	We are looking forward to the day when all Canadians are 
treated equally and able to strive for their fullest potential 
regardless of race, language, culture or gender. Let us move 
ahead. Let us not get hung up with terminology. Let us move 
ahead to find real solutions to these issues that affect all of us, 
men and women alike.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have heard 
a good deal with which I can agree but I became a little confused 
with the amendment. I listened to it as carefully as I could. 
Perhaps I did not get the full sense of it but any action we might 
take with respect to the motion on the Order Paper today might 
not involve gender bias. That is how I understood it.
<P>
	The member was speaking of directing our efforts toward the 
people who need our help most. It seems to me that when we talk 
about child care, apart from the children, the people who need 
help most are women. When we talk about single parents we 
know the vast majority of single parents are women. Therefore 
they are the ones who need support.
<P>
	We think of some of the areas that the members opposite 
mentioned in which women are moving and making progress but 
in which they are still behind. An example would be in science 
and technology, in colleges and universities and in the 
workforce.
<P>
	It seems to me that at the moment, although goodness knows 
we do need improvements in science and technology and 
education of all sorts, the people most in need are female 
students. They have moved in other areas such as the arts and the 
humanities but they have moved least in science and technology.
<P>
	Similarly, if we look at the professional schools of all sorts, 
we would discover that women are still in the minority. I realize 
that there are other groups that need our support but women are 
the people who need our assistance most.
<P>
	In the general area of income, we can obviously break out all 
sorts of groups that are in the below average income category. 
However here is this mammoth group which is the majority in 
the country, females, and the statistics all show that it is 
significantly behind the other large group which is males as far 
as income is concerned.
<P>
	In my constituency, over two-thirds of women with children 
of school age work at the present time. They represent a low 
income group in my riding. I wonder if the member or the 
members opposite would care to comment on this point. How do 
we proceed on these matters without identifying women as 
people who are at the present time in need of support so they can 
move forward in these areas?
<P>
<B>(1130 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> Mr. Speaker, in the time remaining I want to 
thank the member for his question but mostly for his comments.
<P>
	In terms of our amendment we need to come up with what we 
think is a sensible definition and in fact the interpretation of 
employment equity.
<P>
	Where I live in rural Alberta it is very difficult to find the 
exact slots for people who are qualified, who have merit and 
who have some personal achievement in some of these areas. 
The minister referred earlier to the fact that in this whole 
infrastructure program we need to make sure every category is 
filled by employment equity. That is very difficult to do in many 
parts of rural Canada. Therefore let us determine what our 
interpretation is.
<P>
	I disagree with the fact that we should have artificially 
imposed quotas on employment equity right across the country. 
The hon. member made reference in his comments to the 
sciences. Let us make sure we realize that women are very 
capable in the sciences.
<P>
	Maybe we should have educational programs and teaching 
faculties to say that women are very qualified to be engineers 
and scientists. Let us make sure that is permeated through 
society. I do not know the problem would be solved by saying 
that we demand <I>x</I> number of women in those faculties. We in the 
Chamber need to make sure our legislation and regulations are 
sensitive to that, but I do not know that imposing artificial 
quotas will go the distance in terms of finding real answers to it.
<P>
	The member also commented on the fact that women are in 
lower paying jobs generally. We have seen all the studies. We 
have looked at both sides of the issues. Let me just sum this up 
by saying the following. I am a high school teacher by trade. I 
believe many women, myself included, choose to go into careers 
that are more humanities oriented. Perhaps it is because of our 
individual and special gifts we as women bring to a situation, the 
idea of consensus building rather than confrontation.
<P>
	Many of those are low paying jobs. Therefore we need to 
realize that we do not just look at the numbers on these charts but 
we look at some of the reasons behind it. Women as child bearers 
obviously take a particular time out of the workforce. Maybe 
they are not anxious to get into careers that have to come before 
family, children and husbands. We need to pay particular 
attention to that.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1971"> 1971 </A></B>
<P>
	Maybe that is one reason there are not as many women in the 
House as some people would demand. It is very difficult to be 
away from home. I know it is hard for every member but I find it 
particularly difficult to get on the plane every week and come 
here to Ottawa. I do not know if that is because I am a woman or 
because I am a homebody or because I am a newlywed. Who 
knows. I am finding it more and more difficult every week. 
However we need to be careful about the reasons there are not as 
many women in the Chamber rather than say we are going to fix 
the problem from on high.
<P>
	The problem needs to be solved with each of us in our home 
communities. We need to encourage women to choose careers in 
the sciences or perhaps politics, not because they are women but 
because they are capable and have real abilities in those areas.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Daphne Jennings (Mission-Coquitlam):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I know it is unusual for me to answer after I have 
spoken and someone else has spoken on debate after me, but I 
understand the hon. member wanted to hear from both members.
<P>
	Last year I listened to a woman with a career very high in the 
workplace speak on women's issues and their importance in the 
workforce. The item I picked up more than anything else is that 
those figures are grossly distorted. The reason is that women 
work part time in most cases. For many of them it is because 
they have to and for others it is because they choose to stay in the 
home and their only opportunity is to work part time. This pulls 
us way down when looking at those statistics. They are way out 
of whack and we have to look at them all carefully.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Before resuming debate, I 
am going back to the earlier intervention by the member for 
Mission-Coquitlam. I was touched when she shared with us 
that at some time during the course of this day she might once 
again be a grandmother. If I recall correctly it will be the seventh 
time. I join members on both sides of the House in saying 
congratulations and best wishes to mom and dad. We wish your 
new granddaughter or grandson a long, happy and healthy life.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to take this opportunity to mention the presence in the gallery of 
my wife Louise and two of my daughters, Marie-Hélène and 
Marie-Christine. I should also add that my other daughter, 
Isabelle, a student at McGill University, and my son 
Jean-François join me in stressing the importance of this day for 
all Canadian women.
<P>
<B>(1135) </B>
<P>
	On this day, March 8, I would like to talk about an issue of 
extreme importance to women and which we have to address if 
we are to give a true meaning to the word equality. I am referring 
to violence against women.
<P>
	The very existence of this violence shows clearly that there is 
a power relationship underlying a serious imbalance and the 
absence of effective equality. Violence against women is an 
integral part of our social structure.
<P>
	The tragic massacre at the École Polytechnique on December 
6, 1989 brought back to the fore a brutal and far reaching reality 
and we are still torn apart by the whole thing.
<P>
	This situation required action. In August 1991, the federal 
government set up a Canadian committee on violence against 
women. This committee was co-chaired by Mrs. Marthe 
Vaillancourt, a respected person in the field and also the director 
of the Centre d'aide aux victimes d'actes criminels in 
Chicoutimi, and by Mrs. Pat Freeman Marshall.
<P>
	The committee did a lot. Hearings were held all over Canada. 
A final report was submitted in July 1993. From these hearings 
in 139 communities across Canada, as well as submissions and 
research documents, we gained a better picture of the situation 
of women. The committee proposed 494 recommendations in a 
500-page document.
<P>
	A framework had to be established and the committee defined 
violence against women as all forms of violence committed by 
men, as opposed to marital and family violence.
<P>
	Violence takes different forms. It can be psychological, 
sexual, physical, financial and spiritual. Some aspects are 
unfortunately more familiar than others. There is no hierarchy in 
that list of various forms of violence; all forms of violence 
against women are to be banned, whether they are threats, rape, 
incest, unrequested sexual fondling, blows, withholding of 
money, contemptuous attitude towards one's personal beliefs, 
etc. Our tolerance of violence against women generates costs, 
human, financial and social costs.
<P>
	Let me quote the final report of the committee: ``A Quebec 
study compared the health of a sample group of women and 
children who had left a violent environment with women and 
children of a comparable group who had not experienced 
violence. It concluded that: The health of these women and their 
children was distinctly different from that of the general 
population, and they were affected first of all by problems of 
mental health''.
<P>
	We can see also that there are no case detection measures and 
that diagnostics are often false. Financial costs impact on health 
care and work-related costs and also on the judicial system. Let 
me quote the report again: ``The costs of one sexual offence, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1972"> 1972 </A></B>
<P>
where the offender serves three years in prison, can be very 
conservatively estimated at more than $200,000''. The Final 
Report of the Canadian Panel on Violence Against  Women first 
describes the problem and its various aspects and, in a second 
part, presents a national action plan.
<P>
<B>(1140) </B>
<P>
	That national action plan comprises an action plan for 
equality and a zero tolerance policy. The action plan for equality 
makes recommendations on two main aspects of the issue: on 
the one hand, improve the economic status of women which is 
directly related to violence against women and, on the other, 
acknowledge and treat women as independent persons. 
Emphasis is to be put on eight specific areas: right to equality, 
equal access to the legal system, equal participation in politics 
and the civil service, improvements to processus aimed at 
promoting equality for women, economy, family, taxation and 
transfer payments.
<P>
	Finally, the zero tolerance policy involves a responsibility 
structure for the implementation phases and an application 
model. This policy is based on the premise that no form of 
violence is acceptable and that sufficient resources must be 
allocated to eliminate violence against women.
<P>
	In my riding, according to the 1992-93 statistics released by 
the Centre d'aide aux victimes d'actes criminels of Chicoutimi, 
spousal abuse and sexual assaults make up close to half of all 
complaints made pursuant to the Criminal Code. Note that 82.3 
per cent of crimes are made against women.
<P>
	At the national level, a comprehensive survey of 12,300 
Canadian women conducted by Statistics Canada and made 
public in November 1993 provided eloquent information about 
violence against women. In Canada, more than one out of two 
women suffered physical or sexual abuse at least once during her 
adult life. In a great majority of cases, the assailant was known 
to the victim. The definition of an act of violence which was 
used refers to actions considered offences under the Criminal 
Code of Canada.
<P>
	According to Statistics Canada, physical assaults vary from 
threats of imminent bodily injury to assaults causing serious 
bodily harm, while sexual assaults vary from sexual 
interference to violent sexual assaults causing serious injury to 
the victim.
<P>
	This survey also shows that one in four Canadian women 
reported being abused by her current spouse or a previous one. 
The most recent national survey conducted in 1980, which was 
highly criticized for being speculative, indicated that one in ten 
women had been physically abused by her spouse.
<P>
	Most of the 10 per cent of women who declared being victims 
of violence in the 12-month period preceding the survey were 
young women, between the age of 18 and 24.
<P>
	The survey also shows that men tend to be more violent if they 
were witnesses to violence against their own mother.
<P>
<B>(1145) </B>
<P>
	Alcohol plays a major role since, as the study indicated, the 
assailant is intoxicated in more than 40 per cent of violence 
cases. One in five acts of violence mentioned in the study was 
severe enough to cause injuries, a quarter of which demanded 
medical attention. It is also noted that nine out of ten assaults not 
only caused physical injuries to the victim but left emotional 
scars as well.
<P>
	Fear is on the mind of a good number of women whose spouse 
is violent. It is made worst by the prospect of finding themselves 
in a potentially violent situation. Thus, 83 per cent of women 
reported being afraid to enter alone an underground parking lot. 
Seventy-six per cent are afraid to use public transportation at 
night. Sixty per cent do not feel safe walking alone in their 
neighbourhood at night. Only 14 per cent of violent acts and no 
more than 6 per cent of sexual assaults were reported to police. 
In only a third of the reported cases, charges were laid against 
the assailant.
<P>
	Further to this study, the Secretary of State responsible for the 
Status of Women stated that her government would launch a 
national campaign to heighten public awareness and take steps 
to force the violent spouse to leave the marital home. She 
promised in the same breath to better finance organizations for 
battered women and their children. As we say, desperate times 
call for desperate measures. One does not put a poultice on a 
gaping wound. These figures are very revealing and we deplore 
the fact that such a sad situation can exist in a country like 
Canada.
<P>
	The budget allocated to the Canadian Panel on Violence 
Against Women was $10 million. A great deal of money and 
energy has been invested in this initiative, and the situation as it 
is depicted requires a follow-up on this report. Furthermore, the 
survey conducted by Statistics Canada, at a cost of $1.9 million, 
shows the extent of the problem.
<P>
	Violence against women can now be measured. It is a serious 
problem that we must address despite its complexity. 
Community groups have shown us the way. At the moment, 
there are 360 shelters for battered women across Canada, and 
waiting lists to get in these shelters are often very long. The 
services provided are sensitive to budget cuts. Eighty per cent of 
these shelters were opened after 1980 and 95 per cent of them 
have less than 20 beds.
<P>
	In the vast majority of cases, the services provided are 
short-term, as 70 per cent of the women remain in these shelters 
less than 20 days on average.
<P>

<P>
<B>(1150) </B>
<P>
	Beyond emergency services, we must offer more to women. 
We need to adopt a more reactive approach. The status of women 
in our society is directly related to their economic situation, 
among other things. Equality is also a matter of money. Let us 
take, as an example, pay equity and access to housing.
<P>
	Women deserve the same treatment as men, and the violence 
that they have to suffer in our society clearly indicates that we 
have a lot of work to do. We must not think that it is a 
present-day problem. Let us remind ourselves of the 
suffragettes who fought for the formal recognition of women's 
political rights.
<P>
	In 1931 and 1964, successive reforms to the Lower Canada 
civil code guaranteed full legal capacity to the married woman. 
In fact, in 1931, the introduction of reserved property allowed a 
woman to administer the proceeds from her work because it was 
said that many men would go off and drink their wife's savings. 
Unfortunately, there are numerous examples and, not too long 
ago, women had to fight for their rights.
<P>
	The violence that they experience is a dramatic situation to 
which we cannot remain indifferent. It is very tempting to be 
legalistic, but we must go beyond that. To a systemic problem 
we must bring systemic solutions.
<P>
	In the 1994-95 Estimates, Status of Women Canada plans to 
launch the following project: Co-ordination of the preparation 
of the federal program concerning the equality and security of 
women in co-operation with federal departments and other 
partners. This will incorporate the government response to the 
report of the Canadian Panel on Violence Against Women.
<P>
	Status of Women Canada was given the mandate to produce 
the government response to the panel. That response will be 
submitted in the form of a federal program concerning gender 
equality and women security.
<P>
	Finally, the co-ordination of a national public information 
campaign geared towards prevention will be pursued in order to 
eliminate the circumstances that promote violence against 
women. In view of the magnitude of the problem, the proposed 
action only allow the government to make an act of faith.
<P>
	We are no longer trying to prove that there is violence against 
women; people are convinced that it exists. The consultation 
exercise has taken place, the problems have been identified and 
solutions have been suggested. What is the government waiting 
for to implement the national action plan that was tabled here in 
this House?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Graham (Rosedale):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
congratulate the hon. member for Chicoutimi for his speech. 
Surely I can say that all members here agree entirely with his 
comments on violence against women and the measures we 
should take to prevent such violence.
<P>
	What I would like to tell the hon. member is this: I believe he 
is right when he addresses the issue from a national perspective. 
He referred to Canadian activities to lessen the problem. He did 
not separate the women from his riding or his province from the 
other Canadian women. What I would suggest to him is that the 
women of his province or Canada should not be separated from 
the world they live in. I come from a riding where there is a high 
proportion of immigrants, and we know that the problem is 
international as well as national or provincial.
<P>
<B>(1155) </B>
<P>
	Therefore, my question to the hon. member is this: Given the 
complexity of the problem and the fact that it is a national and an 
international as well as a provincial issue, does he not agree that 
the initiatives required to correct the situation and better protect 
the women of Quebec and Canada should not be measures 
co-ordinated at the provincial, national or international level, 
but federal measures taken right here, together, because it is our 
responsibility?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fillion:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague for his 
question and comment. I must stress that in my presentation on 
the status of women, I have not taken a provincial political point 
of view because some would have said that the Bloc Quebecois 
wanted to use the issue to its advantage, that it wanted to score 
some political points.
<P>
	When I speak about the status of women, in my mind I know 
that problem concerns the riding of Chicoutimi, the ridings of 
my friends from the other side, all my colleagues' ridings, the 
province of Quebec, all the provinces in Canada and Canada as a 
whole. Given the amounts spent on the preparation of that report 
dealing with many subjects, which was requested by the 
Canadian government and cost $10 million, at a certain point we 
should use that document as a basis for discussion and as a basis 
for dealing equally everywhere with violence against women.
<P>
	Now how should we go about addressing the issue for all of 
Canada? What kind of committee could we create to make sure 
we are more alert? I leave it to those who will speak on the issue 
today to make some suggestions. I think that such a process is an 
important one; it is important to find solutions to the problems 
women are faced with.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Ringuette-Maltais 
(Madawaska-Victoria):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to take a 
few moments, not to ask questions, but rather to make a few 
comments following the remarks I just listened to.
<P>
	I would point out that the fact that these gentlemen rise and 
talk about violence against women is proof that it is a societal 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1974"> 1974 </A></B>
<P>
issue and not a women's issue. In the eyes of any self-respecting 
man or woman, this issue concerns us all and not only feminists.
<P>
	I would also like to say how pleased I am to see the Bloc 
member going beyond party lines when talking about abused 
women. I do hope that in future debates on common issues, we 
will be able to count on their support.
<P>
	I would like to conclude by telling Canadian men that the 
respect they feel for themselves automatically translates into 
respect for us, women.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fillion:</B> I thank the member for her remarks. You can be 
sure, Mr. Speaker, that what I said is not a one-day thing. I made 
my career in teaching. I spent 34 years of my life with teenagers. 
Through the years, I met a great number of parents who would 
come and confide in me regarding the many different kinds of 
problems their teenage daughters were experiencing and I 
always listened very carefully to them. My job as a teacher 
taught me that, beyond political partisanship, everybody must 
join the fight against violence.
<P>
<B>(1200) </B>
<P>
	In any case, I am grateful for a job which allowed me to 
celebrate every day, 365 days a year, for 34 years, this event we 
mark once a year, on March 8, Women's Day. Thus, I directly 
carry this over into my family life, with my three daughters, my 
wife and my son. As you can see, I am in very good company.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
very short question to ask. I also want to congratulate the 
member for Chicoutimi on his speech. I am very interested in 
what he had to say, since I too have a daughter, who studied at 
McGill University.
<P>
	My question is about comments made by Reform Party 
members. Does my colleague believe that the issue of violence 
against women only implies a need for more or less organized 
action, or that it is rather a matter of legislation and policies 
giving the preference to women?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fillion:</B> Mr. Speaker, if I understood the question 
correctly, I must say it is not a question of giving preference to 
women in legislation, but simply of wishing to ensure their 
equality with men in every sector of society. Then, whether we 
are looking at wages, social housing or equity in employment, 
the main thrust will be that our legistation must reflect the 
equality of men and women once and for all. At some point, men 
and women should be considered simply as human beings.
<P>
	I want to mention in passing that I have relied heavily on data 
prepared by Statistics Canada since some had criticized the 
figures contained in the report on the status of women. These 
figures were later adjusted, to a certain degree, to reflect today's 
reality and the data available from Statistics Canada.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board 
and Minister responsible for Infrastructure):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
welcome the opportunity this motion gives me to salute 
International Women's Day. It is important for the House to 
mark this day and to recognize the significant progress that has 
been made in Canada over the years toward greater equality of 
women and men.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	So, I am very grateful to have an opportunity to mark 
International Women's Day.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I can assure hon. members of my government's commitment 
to continued progress in the field of equality. That commitment 
is clear from our red book ``Creating Opportunity''. Whether we 
talk of women and health, or of streets that are safe for women, 
or of day care, the underlying principle is one of equality 
between women and men.
<P>
	Basic to all progress is the prosperity of Canada, and pleased 
is the minister responsible for infrastructure to be 
implementing, in co-operation with other levels of government, 
a program that will put many Canadians to work. Directly and 
indirectly this program will contribute in the short term and 
through long lasting benefits, to the economic growth which 
will ensure the greater equality of men and women.
<P>
<B>(1205 ) </B>
<P>
	I want to talk today most especially about employment equity 
within the federal public service and particularly about 
employment equity and women.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In this context, I would like to pay tribute to a particular 
woman, namely my parliamentary secretary.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Members of the House will be aware Treasury Board has 
legislated responsibility for employment equity within the 
public service because of the persistence of my parliamentary 
secretary, the hon. member for Ottawa West. She was in very 
large measure responsible for ensuring that the Public Service 
Reform Act passed in December 1992 contained an amendment 
providing specifically for employment equity.
<P>
	This amendment is important in its own right because it will 
advance employment equity throughout the public service. It 
has however a further importance. The Government of Canada 
has an obligation to serve, I would suggest, as an example in 
such matters of great significance. The amendment conveys a 
message to all Canadians, women and men, that equity in 
employment is crucial to the full economic and social 
development of Canada.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1975"> 1975 </A></B>
<P>
	The law sets out four designated groups that have encountered 
employment barriers. These are women, aboriginal peoples, 
persons with disabilities and visible minorities. Women are a 
designated group in their own right, but they are about half of 
those other three groups as well.
<P>
	If we discuss employment equity for aboriginal peoples we 
include aboriginal women. Progress for women as a whole must 
also be progress for any group that is disadvantaged.
<P>
	The point of employment equity in the public service is to 
increase the representation of members of designated groups in 
those jobs in which they are currently represented to a lesser 
extent than their participation in the Canadian labour force.
<P>
	It was a Liberal government that introduced one of the first 
programs designed to achieve this goal within the public 
service. The special measures program, as it is called, put in 
place in 1983-84 has contributed in a major way to increasing 
the number of women, and of men and women of the three other 
designated groups within the public service. The special 
measures program has continued over the years as a motor of the 
employment equity program.
<P>
	Last December I had the honour to preside over a meeting of 
Treasury Board that approved the continuation of this program 
over the course of the next four fiscal years. In total almost $70 
million will be allocated to the new special measures initiative 
program as it is now called.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I strongly believe that the renewed program will help to 
ensure employment equity within the public service.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Two particular programs have been of importance to women. 
First, the women's career counselling and referral bureau of the 
Public Service Commission counsels women who have the 
potential to rise into the executive ranks. It evaluates their 
management skills and refers women to appropriate 
competitions. The bureau cannot of course claim credit for all 
the progress that has been made, but there has been a real and 
notable increase of women in the executive group of the public 
service.
<P>
	In 1983 women were 5 per cent of the executive level. By 
1988 women's representation had more than doubled to 12.3 per 
cent. As of March 31, 1993 women were 17.6 per cent of the 
executive group, including a good number at the second highest 
level.
<P>
	In addition there has been a steady increase in the number of 
women in what is called the feeder groups, that is standing in the 
wings and waiting to take over from the executives who will be 
retiring in the coming years. The public service is providing 
leadership in this area not just for the government but for the 
whole country.
<P>
	The second aspect of the special measures programs designed 
especially for women is the OPTION program. The purpose of 
this program is to encourage the recruitment of women for what 
are called non-traditional occupations. A non-traditional 
occupation is one where the representation of women is under 30 
per cent. Again there has been encouraging progress. In all these 
areas progress has been made but there is still is a lot more work 
that needs to be done.
<P>
<B>(1210) </B>
<P>
	The progress is not always measured by numbers alone. The 
program has particular importance because through strategic 
placements, the way is open for women to become employed in 
areas that traditionally were almost closed to them. Let me give 
an example of what can be done in the area of non-traditional 
occupations.
<P>
	In 1992 the former Department of Energy, Mines and 
Resources received an employment equity award for its 
achievement on the recruitment of women in the science sector. 
Under its young scientists program that department has 
increased the number of women scientists by 63 since 1989.
<P>
	Various departments also have bridging programs for women. 
Women occupy the vast majority of positions in the 
administrative support category. However it has not 
traditionally been an easy matter for a woman to move from the 
position of a secretary to a junior administrative officer and so 
on up the ladder. Bridging programs provide women with the 
training and the skills necessary so they can compete for more 
responsible positions.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It is essential that women be given access to the training 
which will help them secure the advancement they deserve.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The renewed special measures initiatives program will 
provide even greater encouragement to employment equity 
within the public service. Programs that were successful in the 
past such as the OPTION program are being continued. A new 
flexibility has been introduced so that individual departments 
can receive the assistance they require to carry out on their own 
individually tailored programs to assist women and members of 
all those other designated groups to achieve better 
representation within the public service.
<P>
	Employment equity is all of these things but it is more as well. 
It is an attitude. It is a recognition that women and men are equal 
and that each of them can in her or his own way provide high 
quality service to the Canadian public as a member of the public 
service. It means that a man can easily take orders from his boss, 
a woman, that a woman has an absolute right not to be harassed 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1976"> 1976 </A></B>
<P>
in any circumstances, that a secretary could be a man and that all 
women and men are treated with dignity.
<P>
	We recognize that employment equity must be an integral part 
of human resource management. It is not something separate to 
be considered only after essential matters have been taken care 
of.
<P>
	Managers are being trained to understand that Canada today is 
a diverse country. That is its strength and the public service must 
reflect that diversity if it is to serve the Canadian people 
intelligently and well.
<P>
	For women there are other factors as well and legislation and 
policies are in place to provide for them. For example, pension 
provisions that discourage part time work and the taking of child 
rearing leave have been repealed.
<P>
	Flexible work arrangements are in place in recognition of the 
fact that it is women who still carry the major burden of 
household responsibilities. Telework may be of substantial help 
to women whose situation makes it difficult for them to leave 
the house for extended periods, for example.
<P>
	Job sharing may provide for many women an opportunity to 
participate in the public service that they otherwise would not be 
able to do, or elsewhere in the economy that is not available to 
them at this point.
<P>
	Let me say that these are not concessions that are being made 
to women or to any other members of any of the designated 
groups in the employment equity program. Employment equity 
implies that barriers to the employment of any member of 
society have been dismantled and all can compete on an equal 
footing.
<P>
<B>(1215 ) </B>
<P>
	With employment equity we in the federal government still 
expect to recruit the best and the brightest, but we shall be 
ensuring that the candidate pool is as diverse and as rich as 
possible and reflects what this nation's composition is all about.
<P>
	If some training is required to diversify and enrich the 
candidate pool, we will provide it where we can. That is the 
meaning of employment equity and of equality.
<P>
	We will have other occasions in which to discuss the growing 
role and equality of women in Canadian society and within the 
public service. I want to assure the House today of my own 
personal commitment, a commitment that goes back through the 
years that I spent in municipal government, to the principles of 
both equity and equality for women. I am pleased to have had the 
opportunity to participate in this debate today.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Thus, I am very pleased to reiterate in the House my 
commitment to employment equity, and equality between 
women and men.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
acknowledge the hon. minister's comments. I would like 
clarification on one part of the hon. minister's analysis. To me 
there seems to be something of a flaw.
<P>
	The hon. minister related a whole host of impressive statistics 
regarding the executive group of the public service from 1983 to 
1993. They show an impressive movement for that executive 
group. The minister went on to say that men and women are 
equal. If we are equal I would like to ask the hon. minister why 
we as women must be strategically placed. That does not 
necessarily explain that enhanced equality of opportunity and 
recognition based on merit is achieved through strategic 
placement. I would like the hon. minister to comment on that 
part of his discourse.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Eggleton:</B> Mr. Speaker, I used those statistics to indicate 
that we have advanced a fair bit. I also said at the point where I 
gave those statistics to the House that we still have a long way to 
go.
<P>
	Obviously we want to put the most qualified people in all of 
our jobs. We want to make sure that those who have experienced 
barriers to those opportunities have those barriers removed in 
order to provide the kind of training and preparation that is 
necessary to give them every opportunity to be able to advance 
into those ranks.
<P>
	The statistics indicate that we have come a fair direction but 
we still have a fair direction to go. I certainly would welcome 
the hon. member and any other member of the House giving 
suggestions and ideas about how we might better achieve that.
<P>
	This has been a learning process for all of us over the years. 
Perhaps it has been rather slow in appearance to many people, 
perhaps these changes have been too slow to come about. 
Certainly there is an increasing acceleration, as the statistics 
indicate. On top of that, there is a greater awareness and desire 
to find new mechanisms, new methods and new means of 
training and preparation for providing, as I said in my remarks, 
that pool of people from all of the different employment equity 
groups-women, aboriginals, disabled and visible 
minorities-in order to have a public service that better reflects 
the composition of our population.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I just have a couple of comments.
<P>
	First, as a member of the Reform Party caucus I am proud to 
serve in Parliament alongside the women members of the 
Reform Party, women who were elected as MPs to serve in 
Parliament not because they are women but because of their 
ability, determination and ambition. I feel very proud to say that 
I regard the women members of the Reform caucus first as 
members of Parliament and second as women. I appreciate them 
very much.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1977"> 1977 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1220) </B>
<P>
	In listening to the hon. member's comments I heard phrases 
about employment equity, equality, et cetera. Really what I 
heard was quotas. I heard affirmative action. I heard about 
concessions.
<P>
	I suggest that quotas have nothing to do with equality and 
everything to do with political correctness. If the government 
were serious about equality it would concentrate more on 
breaking down the barriers wherever they exist and inviting 
people of both genders, visible minorities, aboriginals and the 
disabled, to apply for jobs based on their ability, merits and 
qualifications for the job rather than talk about providing 
specific training for members of these four groups the hon. 
member mentioned so that they can be encouraged to fill some 
sort of quota that the government may have in mind for the 
public service.
<P>
	I submit and suggest to the hon. member that the government 
would be far better off to look solely at the abilities of people 
when it comes to filling public service jobs rather than the 
gender or cultural heritage or whether or not they are disabled. 
That is what Canadians are all about, the equality of all, which is 
understood to be a given. The thing that has been most 
destructive in our country has been the separation into different 
groups by governments past and caused dissension amount the 
Canadian people.
<P>
	I suggest that embarking on a path such as the hon. member 
has suggested is a path that leads to affirmative action and 
quotas in hiring. If we take a lesson from the United States we 
can see what kind of social problems that has caused. I hope it 
does not happen in our country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Eggleton:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am astounded at ``understood to 
be a given'' that equality exists in the country. Unfortunately 
there have been a lot of barriers for visible minorities, women 
and disabled and aboriginal people. They have not had the 
opportunities.
<P>
	We have a composition in the public service that in past has 
not represented the composition in the population. There have 
been barriers to employment and barriers in terms of pay 
opportunities. These are facts that do exist and have been 
substantiated time and time again by many studies.
<P>
	We are simply trying to break down those barriers. I never 
said quotas. I never used the word quotas at all. I talked about 
training. How do you equate training and quotas? Training is to 
help people. Training is provided for all people, men, women 
and all of the target groups I talked about today, training to help 
prepare them for jobs that can help them to rise higher in the 
service, to be able to perform to the best of their abilities.
<P>
	Surely there is nothing wrong with that. How does the 
member equate that to quotas? I never said anything about 
quotas. We are trying to prepare people to do the best they can, 
to be able to advance in the public service and to give them the 
kind of training and support they need so that we will have an 
even bigger talent pool to  draw from when we need to advance 
people. That surely is going to be to the benefit of the people of 
the country in terms of the public service we would provide.
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East):</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all, I 
would like to wish a wonderful International Women's Day to all 
my female colleagues in this House.
<P>
	I am proud of the solidarity which unites us today, in this 
House, where we wanted to be elected because we believed we 
could influence political decisions and protect the interest of the 
population of Canada and of Quebec.
<P>
	Women make up 52 per cent of our population. I firmly 
believe that it is the duty of a responsible government and 
members who were elected to represent their constituency to 
respect and guarantee equal opportunities and equal rights for 
men and women. The fact that there are not as many women in 
this House as there could be, shows how difficult it is for women 
to get into politics.
<P>
	I am also very pleased to make my first speech during a debate 
held on the International Women's Day. The status of women 
has always been a main concern of mine and my involvement as 
a founding member of the Centre des femmes de Laval gave me 
the opportunity to better understand the daily problems and the 
dramas some women have to deal with. Often, these women can 
only rely on the community resources made available to them by 
the women's groups to help them to take charge of their life to 
become independent and more aware of their own situation.
<P>
	Allow me, on this special day, to reiterate my support and 
send my best wishes to all women in Laval, and especially to my 
female constituents in Laval East. I would also like to mention 
the wonderful work done by women organizations in Laval and 
all the volunteers who care for the well-being of women in 
Laval.
<P>
	Like several other organizations, women's groups play a 
primary role by advocating changes to improve the standards of 
living of women.
<P>
	I was able to appreciate the quality of services provided to 
women in need, such as crisis centres, counselling services, 
referral services, shelters, health services, training, emergency 
services, and the list could go on and on.
<P>
	It is also the first time in federal political history, that Laval 
has female MPs. I want to take this opportunity to pay tribute to 
those women who work with such dedication at La Maison Le 
Prélude, Le Centre des femmes, Le Centre d'accueil pour les 
femmes victimes de violence, the AFEAS, Le Cercle des fer-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1978"> 1978 </A></B>
<P>
mières, Le Club des femmes d'aujourd'hui, Laval au féminin, 
Pause Carrefour-Santé, and other centres.
<P>
	I want to thank the volunteers and the workers of those 
various organizations which offer women a place where they can 
feel a sense of belonging and solidarity.
<P>
	The active contribution made by women to improve the 
quality of life for Canadian and Quebec societies takes many 
dimensions. In the past, women have shaped Quebec and 
Canadian societies, whether by making an economic and social 
contribution with their work at home or in the workplace, or 
through their entrepreneurship, their initiative, their dedication 
and their skills. Today, women are increasingly more present in 
all sectors, thereby continuing to play a major and active role to 
ensure the collective prosperity of our societies.
<P>
	Throughout history, the movement to promote women's status 
has always sought a greater recognition of the principle of 
equality between men and women. If the status of women has 
improved over the years, although a lot remains to be done, it is 
because of the efforts and initiative of women's groups. Let us 
not forget that women fought hard to have their rights 
recognized.
<P>
	Women often had to fight powerful religious and political 
institutions, as well as the press of the time.
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
	Women's groups have been the driving force behind change in 
the area of social, political and economic justice in our 
societies.
<P>
	The first women's organizations called for basic rights: the 
right to a higher education, the right to equality before the law, 
the right to vote. Great Canadian and Quebec women laid the 
groundwork for equality and for the right of women to 
participate in all spheres of activity. Their tenacity, commitment 
and determination gave rise to new hopes, struggles and 
victories. While some of these women's names are inscribed in 
the history books, others still echo in this noble House, 
reminding us of the ideal to uphold and encouraging us to 
continue following in their footsteps.
<P>
	At this time, I would like to recall several of the women's 
groups and pioneers who, through their dedication, sense of 
justice and fairness, were responsible for the emergence of 
important women's rights movements. They include Thérèse 
Casgrain of the League for Women's Rights, Marie 
Gérin-Lajoie of the Provincial Franchise Committee for 
Women's Suffrage, Carrie Derrik of the Montreal Suffrage 
Association, Grace Ritchie England of the Local Council of 
Women of Montreal, Idola Saint-Jean of the Alliance 
canadienne pour le vote des femmes, Laura Sabia of the Voice of 
Women, Léo Roback, the well-known feminist and activist, 
Laurette Slone of the League of Women, Madeleine Parent of 
the textile union, Azilda Marchand of AFEAS, the women's 
association for education and social action, Nellie McClung 
who fought for women's suffrage in Western Canada, Bessie 
Starr and Emily Stowe who, as early as 1888, spearheaded the 
drive for  the recognition of women's rights, and, last but by no 
means least, the celebrated Agnes Macphail.
<P>
	However, the history of women quickly brings us back to 
reality. Despite the major gains made, women's groups still 
must fight today, in 1994, to maintain what they have achieved 
and to have their rights recognized. Indeed, in the past few 
years, under the guise of deficit and debt reduction, we have 
witnessed an unprecedented conservative backlash and a move 
to push women back, whereas they still have substantial gains to 
make.
<P>
	In their day-to-day lives, women are still confined to job 
ghettos where, of course, they earn lower wages. According to 
the report of the Canadian committee on the status of women, 
one in seven women, or 71 per cent-works in one of five 
professional categories: teaching, nursing and other health care 
professions, office work, retail and the services sector. The 
percentage of women working in non-traditional sectors such as 
manufacturing, construction trades, transportation and 
communications and handling in fact dropped from 13 per cent 
in 1981 to 10 per cent in 1991.
<P>
	This same report also mentions that 85 per cent of salaried 
women work in service industries, as compared to 62 per cent of 
men. Moreover, 14.8 per cent of the female labour force works 
in production sectors. Not only are women confined to job 
ghettos, but in cases where they perform similar work of equal 
value to the work done by men, they are paid far less.
<P>
	Another example of disparity is access to the job market. If 
accessing the job market is difficult for men, it is even more so 
for women. Among other things, the provisions aimed at 
facilitating the entry of women into the labour force are 
inadequate. For example, daycare services are inadequate and 
there is a lack of alternative measures such as more flexible 
work schedules, adapted career paths and family leave.
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
	The result of the difficulty for women to access the labour 
market is dramatic: 55 per cent of the poor are women and, 
among them, the poorest are single mothers. Statistics show that 
one Canadian family in five is a single-parent family, 82 per 
cent of which are headed by a woman and 61.9 per cent are living 
under the poverty line.
<P>
	Do you know, Madam Speaker, what the annual income of 
unemployed single parents was in 1991? Scarcely $12,000, 
which puts them well below the poverty line. These are 
generally women like those you will find in shelters and 
transition centres, who have to rely on support agencies.
<P>
	Here is another fact. Our seniors who, through their hard 
work, sacrifices and generosity, have helped build this country 
find themselves in a similar situation. The report I quoted earlier 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1979"> 1979 </A></B>
<P>
indicates that nearly 50 per cent of women 65 years old and over 
have less than minimum subsistence income. While 85 per cent 
of older men  receive pension benefits, only 50 per cent of 
women in the same age group do.
<P>
	The list of cases where women invariably come off the losers 
is long: violence, inadequate job training, social housing 
shortage, unfair taxation. Allow me to say just a few words on 
the subject of taxation, as it speaks volumes.
<P>
	We all know that actions are planned regarding tax women 
have to pay on support payments which, sadly, they all too often 
do not receive. On the other hand, their estranged spouses can 
claim a deduction for all amounts paid in alimony. How can such 
inequity be justified? We often hear that it is intended for men, 
to induce them to obey alimony orders. I would like to remind 
this House that about 75 per cent of estranged spouses still do 
not pay.
<P>
	With the recession, deficit and debt always looming in the 
background, the dominant economic discourse would have us 
believe that excessive costs associated with social needs are the 
cause of all our problems. But this premise is incorrect. The cost 
of our social programs has not increased in over ten years. 
Social programs are not responsible for the skyrocketing deficit 
and debt. The Canadian debt crisis was brought about by 
government mismanagement. The deficit is growing because the 
government refuses to put in place a fair taxation system, 
because its monetary policy maintains interest rates artificially 
high, thus making the debt service charges increase and creating 
more unemployment, and because the government refuses to 
reduce waste and overlap.
<P>
	The women and women's groups mentioned earlier decided to 
get organized and to act to get equal rights. They showed the 
way. If women have been able to find help, comfort and justice, 
it is thanks to other community groups that have since joined in. 
As I said earlier, in 1994, women's groups still have to fight for 
their survival. The budgets and attitudes of the previous 
government, which seems to be the source of inspiration for this 
Liberal government, jeopardize the very existence of such 
groups. We have as evidence the 5 per cent cut announced by the 
finance minister in various support programs, in addition to the 
25 per cent reduction these groups have sustained since 1989. 
Their budget was slashed from $12.5 million in 1985-86 to $10 
million in 1993-94, and it will be even less if we believe the 
Minister of Finance. This is unacceptable, as the initial funds 
provided to these groups were already clearly insufficient.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	The 400-odd women's groups are active in many 
areas-including physical and mental health, employment, 
single parenthood, violence, and aging-which would cost a lot 
more to manage if the government was directly responsible.
<P>
	By pulling out and encouraging groups to get funding from 
other groups, the government shows its ignorance of the 
realities in these organizations. Most of the time, this forces 
women to spend a lot of time and energy on fund-raising, when 
this time and energy would be better spent on improving 
women's living conditions and, in the end, the well-being and 
quality of life of all Canadians and Quebecers.
<P>
	True, the private sector sometimes supports women's groups 
and associations, but only as long as they provide direct 
assistance services to the population. But what about awareness 
groups demanding economic equality, equity in employment 
and wages, parental leave, preventative withdrawals, child care 
services, in short, better living conditions for families? The 
private sector rarely subsidizes lobby groups. By gradually 
withdrawing their financing, the government once again 
penalizes the most disadvantaged, a group where women are in 
the majority.
<P>
	Is it not important to question the cuts introduced by the 
previous government, that the current government apparently 
wants to maintain and even deepen? Is this not a disguised way 
of muzzling women's groups that make claims and exert 
pressure? Should we not question the gag method designed to 
prevent them from criticizing government policies?
<P>
	I would now like to make a comment about interest groups. 
Contrary to what some people think, women's groups are not 
interest groups. As the National Action Committee on the Status 
of Women rightly stated, the interests of 52 per cent of the 
population are not special interests but public interests. The 
promotion of social, political and economic justice does not 
have anything to do with the lobby for multinationals, banks, 
family trusts and businesses that do not pay taxes.
<P>
	In its throne speech of January 18, the government expressed 
its intention to change its relations with lobbyists. Canadian and 
Quebec women would like the government to clarify what is a 
lobby and what is an interest group and who are their members.
<P>
	Finally, I would like to say that the involvement of both levels 
of government in the area of subsidies to women's groups and 
organizations in Quebec, like in many other sectors affecting 
women's lives, creates overlap and duplication in programs and 
structures, leading to a waste of public funds.
<P>
	I personally think that Quebec women's interests would be 
better served if there were only one level making decisions and 
distributing funds. It also makes it impossible for Quebec to 
develop a consistent policy on the status of women.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1980"> 1980 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	For example, the dual jurisdiction in family law often leads to 
inconsistencies. The federal Parliament has jurisdiction in 
marriage and divorce matters, while Quebec can legislate on 
solemnization of marriage and on property and civil rights. 
Quebec cannot in these conditions initiate a reform process that 
could give it a unified family court.
<P>
	In closing, I hope that this day of reflection and debate on the 
status of women will allow women to continue their long march 
towards equality and independence.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Audrey McLaughlin (Yukon):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak on today's motion especially because it is 
International Women's Day. All members should keep this very 
important motion in mind.
<P>
	I would like to make some comments today about the 
economy and women's place in that economy, not the place that 
is defined for us, but the place we define for ourselves. It is a 
place that is equal, just and co-operative. It is one that gives us 
choices and allows us to determine our own vision of who we are 
and who we want to become as individuals in society. I want to 
talk about what we can do as parliamentarians, as men and 
women in the House to bring about the fundamental change 
which is required if we are to make that vision a reality.
<P>
	Many people get nervous when we talk about fundamental 
change. It is very threatening to some. All kinds of excuses will 
be put forth as to why we cannot bring about real change. Sure, 
maybe there can be a program or two, a pay raise here or there, 
but tamper with the big stuff, talk about structural change and 
the alarm bells go off. Obviously someone has a good thing 
going but it sure is not the women of Canada.
<P>
	This is not to suggest we have not made extraordinary gains. 
International Women's Day is about some of those gains.
<P>
	Today we look at our universities with some satisfaction. Half 
the undergraduate students are women. Forty-one per cent of 
medical students are female; 48 per cent of law students are 
women; and 47 per cent of business students are women. 
One-third of all businesses started in Canada are started by 
women. The success rate of those businesses is very high and 
exceeds those started by men.
<P>
	In all other areas however, women still lag far behind. Only 17 
per cent of university professors are women. Only 18 per cent of 
members of Parliament are women. Only 1 per cent of corporate 
executives are women and one of them was so successful she 
was named ``Man of the Year''. Women also continue to be 
grossly underrepresented in engineering and in the sciences.
<P>
	Sometimes people ask me why we need to have 50 per cent 
female politicians, 50 per cent female engineers and so on. It is 
just common sense to me, common social sense and common 
economic sense. Our society can no  longer afford to ignore the 
expertise and knowledge of half of our population.
<P>
	Women have always played a key role in the economy as 
unpaid labour. This invisible cheap labour feeds and cares for 
the family, for the male paid workforce and raises future 
workers. It is called a labour of love. We know love is a part of it 
but so is exploitation.
<P>
	Money too often has been the measure of worth in our society 
and because women's labour has not been paid it has been 
historically undervalued. Because that work has been 
undervalued, far too often women have not been valued. That 
lack of worth has a whole array of consequences going beyond 
our lower paycheques. Women still make 69 cents on the dollar 
of men in our society.
<P>
<B>(1250 ) </B>
<P>
	We see it as well in the lack of commitment to women's health 
care needs and the controversies over breast implants, breast 
cancer and the overmedication of women. We see it in continued 
violence against women, victims of abusers in a too often 
abusive society. We see it when a woman cannot get the police to 
enforce a peace bond against her violent partner, yet the laws are 
always there to protect property in times of strikes. We see it in 
the twisted notion that somehow rape is not a war crime. That is 
changing to some extent but we recognize how much more there 
is to do. We see it in sexual harassment being treated as a joke by 
some.
<P>
	That is the kind of thinking which has to be challenged and 
changed. Who is making the rules? Who says it has to be this 
way and who says it cannot be changed? Many people who have 
profited from the way things are are the ones who are saying it 
cannot be changed.
<P>
	Some people will remember when slightly under 10 years ago 
former member of Parliament Margaret Mitchell mentioned in 
the House that one in ten women suffered from spousal assault 
and many members laughed. We have a way to go. Today people 
would not laugh. We have to go beyond the rhetoric to 
implementing real programs and take the trend in attitudinal 
change into real action. The reality is that the world has changed 
in many ways. Society has changed. It is time for politics to 
catch up.
<P>
	We know child poverty is a tremendous problem and shame to 
Canada. We have been sanctioned by the United Nations for 
child poverty. Poor children have poor parents. In Canada unlike 
many of our trading partners 58.4 per cent of single parents, the 
vast majority of whom are women, still live in poverty. 
Opportunities and choices are too often denied to them. It is not 
because people say they do not value the family. It is because the 
structural changes that would fundamentally attack these issues 
in our society have not been made.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1981"> 1981 </A></B>
<P>
	There are three important ways to broaden these choices and 
to expand those opportunities. They are pay equity, employment 
equity and a national child care program.
<P>
	I would like to deal with the issue of child care. No doubt there 
is a link between the ability of women to participate in the 
workforce and the availability of accessible, affordable child 
care.
<P>
	In a past career I worked for a children's aid society. After a 
number of years I was struck by the view that our society is not a 
very child loving one. We do not structure our society in a way 
that values our children and our future. The lack of this 
reasonably rich and resourceful country to come to terms with 
the need for affordable, accessible child care is one example of 
our failure to value families and children.
<P>
	Child care is not a charity issue. In many ways it is not a social 
issue. It is an economic issue. It must not be seen solely as a 
woman's issue. Child care is the responsibility of everyone in 
society. It is central to the functioning of our economy. Looking 
at studies from other countries it is very easy to see the 
correlation between the availability of child care and the ability 
of women to participate in the workforce.
<P>
	Other important steps can be taken to ensure women's 
economic equality. Labour legislation can be passed making it 
easier for workers to organize in sectors where women 
predominate and where work is very often part time, casual or 
temporary.
<P>
<B>(1255 ) </B>
<P>
	We can take it upon ourselves as legislators to see that part 
time workers, whose numbers are increasing and a large 
percentage of whom are women, receive adequate pensions and 
other benefits to ensure a more stable future.
<P>
	There can be labour standards with flexible and 
comprehensive leave policies that recognize family 
responsibilities and the rights of same sex couples.
<P>
	We hear much from different parliaments, not just in Canada 
but abroad as well on the question of family values. I ask each 
person today to examine their consciences in terms of how our 
actions show we care about families. If we really cared about 
families we would have child care. We would have appropriate 
labour legislation. We would ensure the family is valued not by 
rhetoric and not by simply longing for the long past nuclear 
family, if it ever existed, but by recognizing the situation as it is 
today and valuing the choices people make and valuing our 
children.
<P>
	We can have a clear definition of sexual harassment in labour 
legislation. The legislation can set clear policies for handling 
complaints and discipline.
<P>
	On the economic front we can make low interest rate loans 
more readily available to co-operatives and small businesses, 
many of which give women a greater say in their own economic 
future.
<P>
	We can find ways to value unpaid work. We can encourage 
young women and girls to study math and science. We can 
include women's studies as part of core curriculum and ensure 
post secondary courses accommodate women's needs.
<P>
	We can provide training programs to move women into trades 
and technologies. Those programs can be made available to 
women in both rural and urban areas.
<P>
	I would like to say a word about the focus needed for women 
in rural areas. The availability of training and educational 
opportunities is often more difficult. It is something our society 
has not really come to terms with. Our rural economy and the 
needs of rural women must be a focus for members of the House.
<P>
	We must ensure as well there are adequate old age security 
and income supplements so that older women do not have to live 
in poverty. Older women make up a disproportionately large 
percentage of those living in poverty.
<P>
	We can build more low cost housing so that women have a safe 
place to call home. We can make sure that health care meets the 
needs of women, not just those of drug companies. Women must 
be given choices in those health care needs. That means more 
funding for planned parenthood, more research into safe and 
effective contraception and ensured access to abortion services 
not just in urban hospitals but in community based clinics across 
Canada.
<P>
	True economic equality for women will come about only 
through these and other initiatives. That economic equality will 
go some way in addressing the imbalance of power between 
women and men in our society, an imbalance that contributes to 
violence against women.
<P>
	We will not be safe, be respected, get child care, get equal pay 
or get better health care unless we as women and men, as 
parliamentarians and decision makers, take leadership on these 
issues. Too often there has been a tendency for the House not to 
take leadership on these issues.
<P>
	I must say many men in this House have supported the kinds 
of equality measures I am talking about. It gives me great hope 
that together we can accomplish the kind of equality which will 
enhance our society, our families and our country. Equality and 
social justice require a true commitment not just from 
governments, not just from parliamentarians but from society as 
a whole. As parliamentarians we have a role to play. We help to 
formulate legislation which very often not only addresses 
inequities but leads the way. It takes more than that; zero 
tolerance for violence in our society for example.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1982"> 1982 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1300) </B>
<P>
	There is much we can do outside the House to support and 
promote equality for women. As women, we have to value our 
own experiences because sometimes we undervalue them, and 
recognize that someone who runs a home can very likely run a 
business or a country.
<P>
	Second, I would say that those of us who have had some small 
success in our careers have a responsibility to be mentors to 
younger women who will follow us. It is by our example that we 
can begin to redefine what is of worth in our society.
<P>
	I have had the opportunity to speak over the last six years on 
International Women's Day, both in the House and across the 
country. We have seen many sad things in the House as well that 
we have acknowledged having taken place. All of us remember 
the Montreal massacre, and it was of credit to the House that 
members supported December 7 as an official day of mourning.
<P>
	These are important statements that have been made by 
parliamentarians. Today is the day we should rededicate 
ourselves, men and women, to use the power we have, in the 
House and outside, to promote true equality.
<P>
	I have been involved for many years in the women's 
movement and I know that words do not change much, but the 
language we use can change the way we think about things. We 
have had some rather regrettable examples in the House of 
Commons where people forgot that. It does matter what we say; 
it does matter what we do.
<P>
	I believe the issue of women's equality is inextricably linked 
to the equality of everyone in our society-aboriginal people, 
visible minorities, persons with handicaps-and that when we 
tolerate structural inequality, as I believe we have at the moment 
in our society, we are ignoring a very basic political fact. Today 
we look at what is happening in South Africa where racial 
injustice was not only ignored but was promoted for many years. 
It affected every person in that society. It affected international 
relations.
<P>
	We do not necessarily have a sterling record on women's 
equality internationally. Members will remember that last year 
Canada was deemed the number one country by a United Nations 
report, the best place to live under a whole series of criteria. It 
also added that if the status of women was factored in we 
dropped to eighth.
<P>
	As the debate went on, I noticed that report was used to say, 
quite rightly, that we are that kinder, gentler society that others 
might long for. I rarely heard anyone mention the equality of 
women and the second part of the report which made a very 
negative observation about our society.
<P>
	My party supports the motion put forward by the Official 
Opposition. However we would like to see parliamentarians do 
more than simply support it verbally by giving speeches, but by 
what we do and what we undertake to do as individual members 
of Parliament and as political parties.
<P>
	People will recall that during the previous session of 
Parliament some of the recommendations of the Electoral 
Reform Commission were accepted. One section was not and I 
would like to suggest to the government that it show its 
commitment to equality. The Electoral Reform Commission 
recommended that political parties receive a rebate based on the 
number of women they nominated as candidates. That 
acknowledged an acceptance of the fact that we do not have 
sufficient numbers of women in political life.
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	I would also like to see the government restore core funding to 
women's centres that provide many of the services, often sadly 
at a fairly low wage rate, to the communities across the country 
which help to deal in preventive, educative and counselling 
ways with the issues which most people here I am sure will say 
they are concerned about: violence against women in our 
society, poverty, and so on.
<P>
	I would make a plea for the government not just to give a nice 
speech today but to acknowledge the contribution of women: 
women who run transition homes, women's centres, counselling 
centres, and what that means to our society as a whole.
<P>
	In conclusion, in supporting the motion I would like to say 
that International Women's Day is not a day simply for women. 
It is a day when we can recommit with actions, and in this forum 
with legislation, that truly will work toward redressing the 
imbalance between men and women in society.
<P>
	We have seen positive changes over the years. I am pleased 
that many men share the goals that we who have worked in the 
women's movement for equality for many years have promoted. 
Only together and through our role as parliamentarians can we 
show the rest of the country that the leadership, the elected 
members, take the motion seriously, will act on it and not just 
support motions but support legislation when needed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin by saying to the 
leader of the New Democratic Party that I support everything in 
her remarks. I was listening to her speech in my office while 
working on another issue and I came over here because I felt that 
she, as always on this issue, is right on track.
<P>
	I would like to comment on a particular part of the hon. 
member's speech where she talks about women in business. In 
the United States right now women owned or partnered 
businesses employ more people than all the <I>Fortune 500</I> 
companies combined. The emerging force is women as the real 
leaders in entrepreneurship in North  America, not just in words. 
It is reality. The facts and statistics are there. It is one of the 
reasons 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1983"> 1983 </A></B>
<P>
why the Minister of Human Resources Development is going to 
be supporting momentarily the opening of Canada's first women 
in business centre in downtown Toronto. We can see the 
tremendous success that is emerging from women owned or 
partnered businesses.
<P>
	We are finding that one of the most difficult issues facing 
women who are either starting a home based business or moving 
from a home business into a larger business is that the financial 
institutions, the banks, do not get it or cannot seem to read the 
statistics of success. Canadian bankers will say that women 
repay loans better than men. This is all statistically recorded. 
Still we hear that women owned or partnered businesses have a 
very difficult time in accessing capital.
<P>
<B>(1310) </B>
<P>
	In the member's opinion or because of her experience, could 
she give us some reasons why financial institutions are so 
restrictive in their attitudes when they are loaning money to 
women who want to start or expand their businesses?
<P>
	<B>Ms. McLaughlin:</B> Mr. Speaker, I guess I could give a 
psychological analysis as well as a financial one.
<P>
	Part of it comes back to the fact that historically as well as to 
some extent now, women's work is not valued. Some decision 
makers in financial institutions, men or women, are having a bit 
of trouble making the link that women can actually be successful 
in a variety of areas. As my friend says, we know the statistics 
about the success of women in business.
<P>
	I have heard this from my constituents and had the experience 
myself perhaps seven or eight years ago where I could not get a 
credit card unless my spouse signed to say that I was a good 
person, a good financial risk or something. The fact that I was 
divorced seemed to be not understood by the people who were 
asking.
<P>
	It is attitudinal in our society. It is one of the attitudes we have 
to address. I speak to may women across the country, 
professional women, women who are moving from home base to 
larger enterprises. They have a terrible time getting funding. It 
is a very real problem.
<P>
	I would say to my friend that there are many analyses I could 
make but the best would be for the government which according 
to the budget is going to be sitting down with financial 
institutions to make sure that it raises this very important issue 
for funding for women entrepreneurs. I am sure if my friend is 
there he will do that. I ask that the government make this a 
priority as well.
<P>
	I was struck, and I mentioned it briefly in my comments, that 
at the end of last year the <I>Financial Post</I> put out a magazine that 
had 200 of Canada's top executives. We have to remember that 
the most influential chief executive officers of the country  
probably carry some political clout as well as business clout. 
Two of them were women.
<P>
	This is also illustrative of the business community as a whole, 
not just the financial community. It has to recognize two things, 
not just the value of women but the reorganization of the work 
place that values-it would be of advantage to men as 
well-family roles.
<P>
	That would go equally for the House. We might think about 
how schedules are arranged and those with family 
responsibilities, men and women, can be assured that there is 
more time to carry out family responsibilities by the very 
schedule we set here ourselves.
<P>
	I have spoken to many women who are concerned, 
particularly in business and in politics, about taking senior 
positions because of the kind of humanless work environment 
that tends to be constructed in our society. That is a real issue for 
the future which all of us might want to give some attention to if 
we truly believe in involving more women in both of those 
arenas.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
address the opposition's motion encouraging the government to 
recognize equality between men and women and to implement 
necessary measures to ensure this in the area of federal 
jurisdiction.
<P>
<B>(1315 ) </B>
<P>
	On this International Women's Day it is truly a privilege for 
me to address such an important issue here in the House. 
However before I begin I would like to thank my mother, Irene 
Lemak, for deciding to have me, raising me, putting up with me, 
looking after me and loving me. Thanks, Mom.
<P>
	Back to the motion, it is our duty as members of Parliament to 
address the problems of equality that women face in the 
workforce, encourage co-operation and protect the rights of all 
Canadians.
<P>
	Economic equality can only exist between men and women 
when employment in the country is truly based on individual 
qualifications, experience, motivation and not gender. In this 
system the individual who is best qualified for a job, male or 
female, would get the job.
<P>
	However the fact of the matter is that true equality in this form 
remains an ideal in Canada and not a reality. It is time for women 
in the country to be given the respect, the pay and the 
opportunities they deserve. This means that as a government, 
members of all parties should work to review the problems 
associated with sexual harassment and discrimination in the 
workplace and correct any wrongs that surface as they are 
discovered.
<P>
	We must explore the problems associated with maternity 
leave and the difficulty that many women face in re-entering the 
workforce. It must be a balanced approach with the needs of the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1984"> 1984 </A></B>
<P>
employer also factored in. Currently the system that exists 
seems to recognize the problems and it seems to work.
<P>
	Before I became a member of Parliament I ran businesses for 
25 years. A lot of times this problem surfaced and by allowing 
the women to have maternity leave, have their baby and holding 
their job open to them for a period time of three to five months to 
make a decision as to whether they wanted to come back, this 
seemed to work. Out of six such pregnancies I had four female 
employees who decided to stay at home and two who came back. 
Perhaps a system like this has improved.
<P>
	We must examine the discriminatory problems associated 
with child care and the rights of stay at home parents who are not 
entitled to the same rights as those who pay for child care 
outside the home. We must acknowledge the fact that there is a 
social stigma attached to stay at home mothers which implies 
that they are not on the same level as those who work outside the 
home. We must recognize the value of the contribution of those 
women who work at home and give them the opportunity to 
pursue any direction they choose.
<P>
	Having a child should not be directly influenced by the 
government with various incentives through legislation. For 
instance, Calgarians Jim and Laurie Boland were recently told 
in Federal Court by a judge who had to make the decision that a 
parent who chooses to be at home with their child is not entitled 
to the same privileges as those who pay for child care.
<P>
	The Income Tax Act admittedly denies the Bolands equal 
benefit under the law, but because stay at home parents are not a 
``a discrete and insular minority'', as used by the judge they are 
not protected by the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
<P>
	This is legal discrimination and this must stop. If the motion 
today is intended to address problems like these, I would 
encourage the government to get on it right away and introduce 
legislation to make a judge's ruling unnecessary in situations 
like this one.
<P>
	Parents should be free to choose the form of child care which 
best suits their situation as opposed to having government 
reward one choice over another.
<P>
	In this International Year of the Family it is my intention 
before the year is over to introduce a private member's bill on 
the topic of equal financial assistance to all families regardless 
of the type of child care arrangements that they have made.
<P>
	Let us build a country in which taxation and the options for 
employment are fair, a country in which opportunities flourish 
for individuals and employment is based on qualifications, 
experience and motivation, not gender.
<P>
	If the motion suggests that affirmative action should be 
legislated in the workplace as a fixed percentage then the 
Reform Party opposes it. A lot of speakers earlier today pointed 
this out.
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
	Women are not a special interest group. My caucus colleague 
from Beaver River mentioned this number of times. She said it 
twice and so I will follow her leadership and mention it twice as 
well. Women are not a special interest group. Affirmative action 
leads to reverse discrimination and not equality. Women are 
people just like men and should be respected as such.
<P>
	It is time that extremes, the extreme males who are called 
male chauvinists and the extreme females who are called 
feminists, come together and eliminate that hardness and that 
extremism from both ends and come together and recognize 
each other as human beings. Respect and understanding are key.
<P>
	In conclusion, I believe that women in the home, in the 
workplace and in general deserve more respect, not quotas. 
Perhaps a good beginning would be, especially in this year of the 
family, a definition of family in which we subscribe to some of 
those values in an ever changing world that existed in prior years 
when we had commitment and we had a sense of direction.
<P>
	Perhaps a family could be defined as two people who are 
related by blood or through marriage or through adoption. This 
would cover a lot of the situations for single parents, for 
marriages and other situations in which the parents are deceased 
and siblings live together. These are the things I feel we should 
address this year.
<P>
	As my final words, I do not think we should gloss over the 
problems that exist between men and women. I believe we 
should recognize them, face them head on and try to resolve 
them through respect and understanding, rather than through 
legislation and affirmative action.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Before resuming debate I 
wish to inform the House that, pursuant to Standing Order 
33(2)(b), because of the ministerial statement Government 
Orders will be extended by 18 minutes later this day.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod):</B> Mr. Speaker, the motion in front 
of the House today is one that someone may wonder about, 
specifically why a male would stand on this issue at all, thinking 
that it might be an issue only for women. I would like to state 
initially that as a Reformer I believe in equality of opportunity 
for every single Canadian but not equality of outcome.
<P>
	I would like to comment on what qualifies me to speak on this 
issue. First, I was raised by a wonderful mother. Second, I have a 
sister whose love and affection I value. Third, I am a husband of 
28 years, very happily married. Fourth, I am a father of seven 
children, only one a daughter. I have six sons, an imbalance 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1985"> 1985 </A></B>
<P>
maybe in my life. Finally I have professional qualifications 
which have  allowed me to be close to women and their problems 
for all my adult working life.
<P>
	I would like to make some observations. One observation is 
that women live seven years longer on average than men. I have 
wondered in one sense why women would want to be equal to 
men in that regard. We have a shorter lifespan than women.
<P>
	The second thing I would like to comment on is an 
observation that I have made from my time as a student in 
university. In my initial class there were 106 of us, but 14 of my 
classmates were women. I graduated back in 1968. I have 
watched the enrolment in university in my faculty very 
carefully. Today I find that the enrolment in the faculty is 
virtually equal.
<P>
<B>(1325 ) </B>
<P>
	I have asked myself what the change has been since 1964 
when I entered college and today. Has it been a legislative 
change? Has there been a change in legislation that would 
require the university to have men and women treated as equal? 
There has not been such a legislative change at all. There has 
been what I call an educative change, a change that has allowed 
us to recognize that women's qualifications in the faculty that I 
graduated from are absolutely equal.
<P>
	Another observation I would like to make is in a sense a bit of 
a myth exploder. I have heard figures bandied about that women 
are paid much lower than men on average and that for equivalent 
work they do not do as well as men. One thing that is missing 
from this equation, however, is if we compare men who were 
never married with women who were never married, the results 
are virtually equal for pay and have been in that regard equal for 
a long time. Those observations I would like to leave with the 
House at the start of my comments today.
<P>
	I would like to address what marriage does to the equation. I 
look back to the days when my grandparents were raising their 
family. It was a traditional, old time Canadian family. My 
grandfather worked on a dairy farm, outside. My grandmother 
was the housekeeper and worked inside. She did the gardening, 
the housework, the cooking, the sewing, the yard chores, the 
house renovations, gave piano lessons, prepared for church. 
There are some who say that those duties were not at all equal. 
There are some who say there was an equality there. I asked my 
grandmother whether she felt there was any inequality there. 
She said there was an inequality, my poor grandad had all the 
hard work and she had all the enjoyable work.
<P>
	In the modern family today things have changed dramatically. 
There are often two working parents who have to leave the 
home, go outside the household, and it is very difficult for a 
mother to nurture the children and do that only. With those 
working parents when they get married the most natural thing 
that happens is that they decide to have children. When the 
children come along there are certain negatives that relate to the 
mother as far as the job situation is concerned. When she is 
pregnant  often morning sickness comes along and she has 
difficulty even getting to work during that period of time. She 
goes through childbirth and there is a period of time, some six 
weeks plus, in which she is incapable of working. In many cases 
there are mothers who decide that they will stay home and 
nurture the baby, breast feed, care for in a way that only a mother 
can care for the newborn baby.
<P>
	There are cases in which there are medical problems that crop 
up. High blood pressure can be a problem with the post-partum 
period. There are other issues, problems with the placenta, 
problems that require the mother to be out of the workforce for a 
fairly long period of time.
<P>
	When these issues ensue the mother automatically takes a 
drop in income. The father generally goes out and may even find 
extra work. The statistics I hear which say that men and women 
are not equally treated in our society in some cases are 
aberrations. I would rather have the statistics of never married 
men and women compared to see if we have equality.
<P>
	I hear from both the Liberals and the Bloc members a desire to 
engineer socially, to move toward what I think are very well 
meaning principles. I do not agree with the final result but I 
know that the motives are good.
<P>
	I want to bring up an example of a type of social engineering 
that I came across which I think is wrong headed social 
engineering.
<P>
<B>(1330 ) </B>
<P>
	With regard to social engineering, in the early 1900s there was 
a small community in Alberta called Brule. This community was 
based on coal mining and coal mining alone. It was a thriving 
community. In fact when the first world war came along the 
community boomed. People moved in, built homes, and had a 
real solid community. They had enough access to humanity. 
There was a theatre and a bowling alley.
<P>
	The future of Brule looked very bright. However the coal 
reserve ran out. The very fine seam of coal they had literally ran 
out. It took six months until the community of Brule was 
non-existent. Everyone had moved away. They sought 
employment where employment was.
<P>
	I wonder what would happen to Brule today if exactly the 
same thing occurred. I imagine that Brule would have had an 
influx of social workers who would come in to take care of the 
problems of alcoholism that would ensue from unemployed 
miners who wanted to stay exactly where they were because they 
had nice homes and all the amenities. I am quite convinced we 
would have a department of all kinds of things looking after the 
social needs and concerns and worries of the people of Brule. We 
would need somebody there for economic displacement, 
somebody to make sure the post office was looked after and 
some-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1986"> 1986 </A></B>
<P>
body to make sure that the school had all the advantages of the 
schools in the larger communities.
<P>
	The social engineering that would keep Brule there today did 
not keep Brule there when it died. The community of Brule 
today is non-existent. Even the homes were taken down, 
disassembled, and taken to a community fairly close by. Brule 
was literally gone.
<P>
	I think in our haste and great desire to do well that we 
sometimes socially engineer ourselves into the corner.
<P>
	I would conclude my comments by saying as I said at the start, 
that I heartily support the equality of opportunity for everyone 
in Canada. I do not support the equality of outcome. My desire is 
to make sure that we do everything we can to prevent the 
impediments that will prevent the equality of opportunity. That 
goes for every single Canadian, man or woman.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
with great interest to the member's comments. I thought I would 
suggest one initiative that Canadians might consider to see the 
member's reaction.
<P>
	Very typically when we have two spouses working and there 
are dependent children which require day care the net income to 
the second spouse entering the workplace after day care costs is 
very nominal.
<P>
	Given that the value of the net pay to that second spouse does 
not generally reflect the value of the work provided in the 
workplace, I wonder if the member would consider the merits of 
an arrangement whereby a working spouse could either transfer 
income or pay a salary to a spouse in the home who is managing 
the family home and caring for dependent children. In that way 
there would be earned income in the hands of that second 
spouse, allowing them to have economic independence and the 
ability to purchase RRSPs, et cetera. Also it would free up a job, 
free up a day care spot and maybe recognize for the first time in 
our Canadian society the value of a spouse in the home.
<P>
	I wonder if the member might comment on the general merits 
of recognizing the value of the woman in the home.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Macleod):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would prefer, rather than 
recognize the woman in the home or even in fact the man in the 
home by paying or doing something of that nature, making sure 
that the income tax system did not downplay the contribution of 
the spouse in the home.
<P>
<B>(1335 ) </B>
<P>
	The Income Tax Act is discriminatory for those who have a 
spouse at home. My preference would be to do this the least 
legislative way as possible. In my mind the use of the Income 
Tax Act in that way would be more appropriate. I thank the 
member for the question.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Eugène Bellemare (Carleton-Gloucester):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the hon. member of the Reform 
Party. Did he actually say that men and women who never got 
married and do the same job have equal pay?
<P>
	Does the hon. member believe that male and female nurses get 
the same wages, that female lawyers are paid just as much as 
male lawyers in some firms, that female and male physicians 
earn the same income, that female and male employees doing 
the same clerical work are paid the same salary, that female and 
male partners in a firm reap the same benefits? In short, does he 
think male and female employees doing the same job have equal 
pay throughout Canada?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Macleod):</B> Mr. Speaker, never-married men and 
never-married women statistically have exactly the same 
earnings Canada-wide. The member is correct and that is what I 
said.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am happy to have the opportunity 
to participate in this opposition day debate on a motion that we 
all support.
<P>
	There is no question about the fact that we in this House are 
constantly working at initiatives that bring knowledge and 
sensitivity to providing economic equality between men and 
women.
<P>
	To begin with, I would like to talk about a personal experience 
that I had in my riding about a year ago. A group of women from 
the riding came to see me on a Saturday morning. Most of them 
were on social assistance at that time. They were telling me, first 
of all, that they were all educated but were victims of a rather 
rough economy in the last few years. They had their own 
strengths in terms of entrepreneurship and felt with a little bit of 
assistance they could start their own business. They asked 
whether our office could give them some help in starting their 
own business.
<P>
	I was not really equipped at that moment in time but said that I 
would look into what the Federal Business Development Bank 
did in terms of supporting women who wanted to start in 
business. Within a month we set up a little conference, women in 
business, on how to start one's own business.
<P>
	We expected that at the first meeting perhaps 40 or 50 women 
would show up, women who would be interested in starting their 
own home based business, a corner store or a specific craft that 
they wanted to market or sell.
<P>
	About three days before the event we started getting letters, 
applications and requests to come to this meeting. Over 500 
women showed up for this women in business conference on 
how to start a business. During the question and answer period I 
listened to the frustration that women have in starting their own 
business. Our educational system is not geared toward being 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1987"> 1987 </A></B>
<P>
sensitive  on how to help women get into business. Our financial 
institutions are not geared toward helping women who want to 
start their own business.
<P>
<B>(1340) </B>
<P>
	In the statistics in terms of women who are either leaders or at 
the board level of our major businesses in Canada, as a country 
we have really not supported women in senior positions in this 
country.
<P>
	This first meeting led to subsequent meetings where we 
brought in executives from among the few women around our 
city who were experienced in business. We asked them if they 
would be mentors for others who wanted to start, who wanted to 
learn, who wanted to advance or who wanted to upgrade their 
skills. We developed a series. After about four or five of these 
meetings, and I do not think we had a meeting with less than 300 
women, we discovered that this need for a business centre for 
women was absolutely essential if we were going to really give 
this area of women's entrepreneurship a real solid footing.
<P>
	The Minister of Human Resources Development in the last 
couple of weeks has given us some tentative support for getting 
this going. It is an example of a concrete initiative.
<P>
	Right now women owned or partnered businesses employ 
more people in the United States than all the <I>Fortune 500</I> 
companies put together. When we are facing a period of deep 
unemployment in our country I believe that by making sure that 
the resources that will support women getting into business are 
there will go a long way in getting people back to work.
<P>
	We talked in the last budget about all the initiatives related to 
small business. We have to be very specific when we go into 
these various areas that we are sensitive to making sure that 
whether it be in the banking area or whether it be in special 
education or retraining that the whole area of women in business 
is looked at.
<P>
	As the leader of the New Democratic Party said earlier today, 
this is an area where all of us are going to have to work at with a 
little bit more focus. I do not think that there is any way that we 
can be proud of the record in this area right now.
<P>
	My remarks are going to be very short today. The message is 
that we are going to do our best in our industry committee, 
especially in the area with banks. We will make sure that all of 
these issues that are related to small business have very special 
focus, especially on the needs that women require in order to get 
into the area of entrepreneurship.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened with 
interest, as I always do, to my hon. friend's comments. I find 
myself once again agreeing with much of what he had to say. I 
know that he is concerned, dedicated and very committed to the 
points that he makes.
<P>
	I wonder if I could make a suggestion. Part of the mandate of 
the new government and perhaps the new Parliament is to review 
the Federal Business Development Bank's operations and to ask 
questions about the kind of job that it is doing, the kind of 
emphasis that it places in terms of its lending portfolios. I think 
a lot of us have concerns about the role that it is presently 
playing and would like to see it in a whole new mandate.
<P>
<B>(1345 ) </B>
<P>
	I think one of the more positive initiatives is the CASE 
program, the counsellor assistance program, where experienced 
entrepreneurs, experienced business people, assist and lend 
their expertise and talents to those starting up new ventures and 
new businesses and the like.
<P>
	Does the hon. member see a role for the FBDB to play in 
providing support, particularly for women entering the world of 
business and entrepreneurship, and could this be a leadership 
role that that bank could take on that would then encourage the 
other lending institutions of Canada to follow suit in one way or 
another?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the member for his question. He raises a good point.
<P>
	The Federal Business Development Bank right now is doing 
some work in the area of assisting women in business. I cited the 
example that we had in the riding. They provide this service for 
any member of Parliament who would like to have a town hall 
meeting to assist women who want to start their own business. 
The Federal Business Development Bank will assist any 
member of Parliament who wants to take on that initiative.
<P>
	Their counsellor assistance for small enterprise is a good 
program, but the problem is that it has limited resources. Even 
though the counsellor assistance for small enterprise charges the 
business approximately $40 an hour to operate, it costs 
approximately $80 an hour to manage this particular section of 
the Federal Business Development Bank. With the budget 
constraints, that program which is so vital is really restricted in 
terms of its ability to serve the needs of small enterprise.
<P>
	I believe, and I think this deals directly with the member's 
question, that the Federal Business Development Bank's role 
has been too restricted. I know that there are many members of 
that bank who would like to be full-fledged competitors of the 
major financial institutions in he country. We are certainly 
going to listen to them in the industry committee over the next 
60 days.
<P>
	Whether it be the Federal Business Development Bank, 
mutual funds, pension funds, le Fonds de solidarité, any funds 
that can assist women in business, small business in general, any 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1988"> 1988 </A></B>
<P>
funds that can compete with the traditional financial institutions 
in this country, I would support amending the legislation in a 
way that would allow them to compete with the banks.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert):</B> Mr. Speaker, all 
judges of superior courts and courts of appeal in all Canadian 
provinces and territories are appointed on the recommendation 
of Cabinet. The Cabinet also designates the judges of the 
Supreme Court, the Federal Court and the Tax Court of Canada. 
The government therefore has the political responsibility for 
appointments to courts of superior jurisdiction across the 
country.
<P>
	Today, there are 951 federally-appointed judges. Of that 
number, 123, or less than 13 per cent, are women. Statistics 
obtained from the Office of the Commissioner for Federal 
Judicial Affairs reflect the level of egalitarian concern shown by 
successive governments during the past 30 years. In the 
Supreme Court of Canada, which rules on issues of national 
importance, only two of the nine justices are women. In the 
Federal Court of Canada, which was established to judge cases 
involving federal legislation and federal responsibility, both in 
first instance and on appeal, only five out of a grand total of 35 
judges are women.
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
	In the Tax Court of Canada, which may be asked, for instance, 
to rule whether a woman employed by her spouse is eligible for 
unemployment insurance, only three of the 25 judges are 
women. In the country's ten appeal courts, out of a total of 126 
judges, the government appointed only 23 women.
<P>
	In the case of the Quebec Superior Court, the Courts of 
Queen's Bench of Alberta, Manitoba, New Brunswick and 
Saskatchewan, the Supreme Courts of British Columbia, the 
Northwest Territories and Yukon, and the trial divisions in 
Newfoundland, Prince Edward Island and Ontario, the figures 
are even more telling: out of 756 judges, only 90 are women.
<P>
	There are no women on the New Brunswick and Prince 
Edward Island Courts of Appeal. The five judges of the Superior 
Courts of Yukon and the Northwest Territories are all men. In 
New Brunswick again, only two out of the 32 judges on the 
Court of Queen's Bench and the Appeal Court are women.
<P>
	Even in Ontario, which has more than 25,000 lawyers, Liberal 
and Conservative governments appointed only 34 women out of 
a total of 277 judges of both courts.
<P>
	One could say that judges are lawyers and that far more men 
than women belong to the provincial bar associations. This was 
indeed true in the fifties and sixties, but in any case I would say, 
first of all, that male/female ratios among lawyers are not 
relevant when appointments are supposed to reflect society as a 
whole.
<P>
	I would also say that this particular argument is becoming less 
and less factual. The Barreau du Québec has 17,000 lawyers, of 
whom 35 per cent are women, while the Ontario Bar Association 
has more than 25,000 members, 20 per cent of whom are women, 
the ratio increasing to more than 45 per cent among lawyers who 
have practised law for less than 10 years.
<P>
	In future, we could assume that the government should have 
no trouble finding 100 women among the 42,000 lawyers in both 
provinces for the positions that become available.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, the present profile of Canada's judiciary reflects 
the intolerable discrimination suffered by women in the law 
profession in this country. One wonders whether this 
discrimination arises from a political will to keep women out of 
the judiciary or simply from a mistaken conviction in our 
society that women had no place in the courts.
<P>
	In any case, the result is the same, and it is high time we 
corrected this imbalance by systematically appointing women to 
the positions that become available in the future.
<P>
	Ontario was the first Canadian province to admit women to 
the bar, when it passed special legislation for the benefit of Clara 
Brett Martin on February 2, 1897.
<P>
	Quebec was the last province to amend its statutes to admit 
women to the bar in 1941. It is hard to imagine in 1994 that in 
1940, it was perfectly normal and natural to exclude women 
from social life. It was a time when discrimination was 
institutionalized. Most women themselves felt it was necessary, 
and the fact that they were excluded from important positions 
was accepted as a matter of course.
<P>
	We cannot explain the imbalance in the ratio of men and 
women in the judiciary on the basis of their actual numbers 
within the provincial bar associations. This argument is 
irrelevant, because there are so few positions to fill that the 
government can easily find suitable women among the 
thousands of female lawyers.
<P>
<B>(1355) </B>
<P>
	Who could argue that it would be impossible for the 
government to find the right persons among the 6,500 female 
lawyers in Ontario and the 5,000 in Quebec?
<P>
	The role of higher Canadian courts is to sanction the laws, to 
interpret the fundamental texts and very often to decide on 
controversial issues in our society.
<P>
	It is totally inconceivable and unacceptable that women 
should be almost systematically excluded. I urge this House and 
the government to recognize that time has come to correct this 
historical aberration.
<P>
	I urge the government to select and appoint at least 80 per cent 
women to the positions which will become vacant in the 
magistrature under federal jurisdiction over the next few years. I 
am asking for a policy and a law that would facilitate access of 
<P>

<B><A NAME="1989"> 1989 </A></B>
<P>
women to the bench, in  order to correct the imbalance that has 
existed since Confederation.
<P>
	I am only repeating a principle of our law: That justice be 
rendered and that it appear to be rendered in the eyes of both men 
and women of Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Eugène Bellemare (Carleton-Gloucester):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise with pleasure to congratulate the member for 
Saint-Hubert on a speech for which she did a lot of research, a 
speech which dealt with the number of judges in Ontario, 
Quebec and throughout Canada. I commend her for her research 
and I support her when she says that the federal government 
should appoint more and more women judges so that justice is 
done for everyone, women as well as men.
<P>
	I congratulate the hon. member for Saint-Hubert.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Venne:</B> Mr. Speaker, after so much praise, I must tell 
you that I do not know what to say to my colleague. Of course, I 
thank him. I think that he got the message.
<P>
	Earlier, behind me, someone was whispering to me that I did 
not talk about notaries, although I am a notary, quite simply 
because now lawyers are appointed judges, but I could also ask 
the Minister of Justice to appoint notaries-that would not 
embarrass me at all.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the member for the comments. They were most interesting. In 
my experience I have heard what can best be described as blatant 
discrimination in terms of appointees with regard to the old boys 
networks such as the legal profession and the appointment of 
judges.
<P>
	Would the member please comment on the realities of our 
society? When I go into a bank the majority of tellers are 
women. When I go into a corporation and look at the secretaries, 
the majority are women. When I go into a supermarket and look 
at who the clerks are, the majority are women. I suppose the 
examples go on and on, classical stereotype positions that seem 
to be prevalent in our society.
<P>
	I wonder if the member feels that equity for women in our 
society is something to be legislated or mandated on the basis of 
a quota system or whether it should take into account primarily 
the ability to do the job. Perhaps the member would comment on 
that.
<P>
<B>(1400) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Venne:</B> Mr. Speaker, in some cases, like the one I 
mentioned about judges, yes, I propose that in future at least 80 
per cent of the judgeships that become open be filled by women. 
You can call that a quota, although I hate the term, but it can 
certainly be used.
<P>
	In other cases, of course, if the same number of people apply 
for a position, the qualifications of each applicant can certainly 
be evaluated, as one should always do.
<P>
	We have always been given the following objection: ``Oh, you 
want to favour women, but you do not want them to be as 
competent as men''. Unfortunately, I am often inclined to say 
``as competent as males'', because I find using that kind of 
argument very sexist. Of course women are as competent as 
men, in all fields.

	<B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John):</B> Madam Speaker, on this 
International Women's Day I appreciate the opportunity to 
recognize women from my riding who have contributed to the 
success of their community.
<P>
	Dr. Eileen Travis was the first president of the Saint John 
Board of Trade; the Hon. Shirley Dysart, the first woman 
Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick; Mrs. 
Mary Munford, the first female Common Clerk of the first 
incorporated city in Canada, Saint John, New Brunswick; and 
Mrs. Anna Boyle, a woman with 12 children who works 
tirelessly to improve the quality of life for persons with 
disabilities. The Sisters of Charity of the Immaculate 
Conception provides vital outreach and support for social 
services.
<P>
	As 1994 is the International Year of the Family it is important 
that I mention the work of the Saint John Council of Women. 
The council is constantly striving to improve the health and 
well-being of families in Saint John.

<P>
	The lack of day care spaces and the cost often prohibitive of 
this essential service is causing a prejudice to women. In many 
cases, they cannot work outside the home. Not only are they 
deprived of their right to work, but also, for those who are single

	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I would like to address an issue of concern to 
all of society.
<P>
	In British Columbia three recent murder trials have produced 
a very disturbing trend. In each instance those accused were 
acquitted or convicted of a lesser charge of manslaughter 
because they had been under the influence of drugs or alcohol. In 
at least one current murder trial this defence will likely be used.
<P>
	Unfortunately, not only is the substance abuse defence in 
vogue for current trials, but individuals already convicted of 
murder are now appealing their conviction, citing this defence. 
If this trend continues it will be difficult to get a murder 
conviction in Canada.
<P>
	While the legal profession may defend this trend as being in 
step with the current law and legal precedence, the general 
public is outraged.
<P>
	If the government were serious about its promise to protect 
women and children from violence it would change the law to 
make people responsible for their actions.

	<B>Mrs. Bonnie Hickey (St. John's East):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
want to take this opportunity today, International Women's Day, 
to speak on the future of young women in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1405 ) </B>
<P>
	Young women face the same pressures as their male 
counterparts when they consider their future. They are 
concerned about obtaining a quality education and about having 
employment opportunities. However they face the added 
pressures of being women in a society that is not always 
receptive to their needs and is often hostile.
<P>
	I urge the government to take into account the unique needs of 
young Canadian women as it addresses the overall social and 
economic needs for our society.
<P>
	If we are ever to obtain full equality we must first obtain 
economic independence. We must improve our education and 
training opportunities for women and we must provide them 
with employment opportunities.
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="INTERNATIONALWOMEN'SDAY">INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY</A></H3>
	<B>Mrs. Beryl Gaffney (Nepean):</B> Madam Speaker, today is 
International Women's Day. I would like my colleagues to join 
with me in giving special prominence to the dedicated work 
carried out by stay at home mothers.
<P>
	Women at home with children must deal not only with the 
isolation and stress of 24-hour a day child care responsibility, 
but also with the invisibility of their work.
<P>
	Stay at home mothers are dismissed by employment experts 
as persons with no employment record, no history of promotion 
and no record of job skills. They have no set hours, no holidays, 
no sick leave, no pensions, no safety regulations and no rights to 
negotiation.
<P>
	Census statistics provide the data used by all levels of 
government to develop policies and programs for society. Yet 
unpaid work in the home and in the community is not included in 
the national census.
<P>
	As a result few community resources have been available for 
women caring for children because such caring is neither 
recognized nor understood as work.
<P>
	Mothers at home clearly have rights and these rights must be 
recognized.

	I want to mention the presence in our gallery of my daughter, 
Andrée-Julie, who, even at her young age, sees the future from a 
different perspective than I or my mother did.
<P>
	In 1994, we will be celebrating the 75th anniversary of the 
right to vote for women in New Brunswick, a right they acquired 
on April 17, 1919. Forty-eight years later, a woman was elected 
for the first time in our province and 68 years later, two 
francophone women were elected members of the New 
Brunswick legislature.

rise on the occasion of International Women's Day to express 
my personal appreciation for the opportunity to live and work in 
Canada, a country in which citizens have the freedom to pursue 
personal and professional goals with few systemic barriers 
based on distinctions such as gender or racial and linguistic 
background.
<P>
	Where our laws and the actions of our governments 
discriminate against anyone today, let us change those laws and 
actions and pursue the goal of equal treatment for all Canadians.
<P>
	Our pursuit of fairness and open opportunities for all 
Canadians should command our strong support and 
commitment, not because we are women or men or happen to 
have any other identifying characteristic, but because we are 
Canadians.

	<B>Hon. Audrey McLaughlin (Yukon):</B> Madam Speaker, today 
on International Women's Day I ask the House whether women 
are truly advancing in our society.
<P>
	I use three key measures through which we might decide the 
answer to that question. The first one is with regard to poverty 
and women. Latest statistics demonstrate that over 58 per cent 
of female led single parent families live in poverty and over 45 
per cent of unattached elderly women continue to live in 
poverty.
<P>
	The second measurement is violence against women. Every 
17 minutes there is a sexual assault committed in Canada, 90 per 
cent of those victims are women, the rest are children. That 
means three assaults during the time of question period.
<P>
	Finally turning to employment and women, women in full 
time work still earn less than 70 per cent per hour of what men 
earn. We must have, and I challenge the government to bring in, 
a full national child care program to assist women and men in 
our society and to put special emphasis on visible minority, 
aboriginal and immigrant women who suffer double 
discrimination in our society.

important to renew our commitment to bring about this

reconcile their many roles.

	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata):</B> 
Madam Speaker, my question is directed to the Deputy Prime 
Minister.
<P>
	Liberal unemployment insurance reforms will set us back 20 
years, because to establish benefit levels, public servants will 
have to determine the number of dependent children. This 
means that women on low incomes will be the first to suffer as a 
result of these reforms.
<P>
	Would the Deputy Prime Minister agree that these changes 
aggravate the injustice to women by putting the onus on them to 
prove they have dependent children?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment): </B>Madam Speaker, the reason why we are 
increasing unemployment insurance benefits by 3 per cent for 
low-income individuals is that many women who are single 
parents should be getting more unemployment insurance 
benefits. That is why the Minister of Human Resources has 
increased disposable income for women, and especially for 
single parents whose responsibilities are considerable.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata):</B> 
Madam Speaker, does the Deputy Prime Minister realize that her 
reforms will reduce to 55 per cent, not raise to 60 per cent, the 
level of benefits for unemployed women, since their incomes 
are often the family's second income?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment): </B>Madam Speaker, most women who are 
single parents have only one income. That is why they are single 
parents. And these women will receive 60 per cent.
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	Before the election, they were getting only 57 per cent. 
However, thanks to the Liberal Party's reforms, people on low 
incomes will get an increase, and this is being done to help 
women who are single parents and carry a considerable financial 
burden because they are raising their children on their own.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata):</B> 
Madam Speaker, the Deputy Prime Minister will agree there are 
women in Canadian society who are not single parents. There 
are also women on low incomes, or who are unemployed, in 
households where the man is the sole bread winner. With this 
reform, the government perpetuates the myth that a woman is 
financially dependent on her spouse. Will the Deputy Prime 
Minister admit it and say so, once and for all: yes or no?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment): </B>Madam Speaker, the hon. member seems 
to be talking out of both sides of her mouth. We have introduced 
reforms that will increase amounts paid to people on low 
incomes. People who have a second family income will get 55 
per cent. But all individuals who are below the average, in other 
words, most women now receiving unemployment insurance 
benefits, will get an increase, thanks to Liberal reforms that 
reflect the recognition that those who are less well off should get 
more.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec):</B> Madam Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	Not only does his budget attack the Unemployment Insurance 
Program, but it is completely insensitive to unemployment and 
job instability affecting women in particular. In March of 1993, 
the actual rate of unemployment among women was over 20 per 
cent.
<P>
	Does the Minister of Finance not agree that his budget not 
only reduces UI benefits to women but also contains no job 
creation strategy to give them a glimmer of hope?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Québec): </B>I want to take this opportunity, on 
International Women's Day, to congratulate you, Madam 
Speaker.
<P>
	First of all, this budget does foresee job creation, and women 
are certainly included. When you look at all the funds going to 
training, the pilot projects often referred to by the minister and 
the rollback of UI premium rate, which will foster job creation, 
you can really see this budget truly creating employment, and 
employment for women, Madam Speaker.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec):</B> Madam Speaker, will 
the minister stop burying his head in the sand and admit that his 
infrastructure program, which is creating mostly temporary 
employment, gives absolutely no hope to women seeking 
employment?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Québec): </B>On the contrary, Madam Speaker. 
First of all, many women do find work in so-called conventional 
infrastructure. And within the broader definition given by the 
President of Treasury Board, if you think of the much broader 
definition of

<HR>
<B><A NAME="1994"> 1994 </A></B>
<P>
infrastructure used with regard to Atlantic Canada for example, 
there are many jobs open to women, in tourism for instance.
<P>
	On the other hand, we must not forget that the majority of 
businesses starting up, the small and medium-sized businesses, 
are run by women and that they are more successful. So, 
basically, in our budget, the emphasis is on small business 
creating jobs for women.

	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River):</B> Madam Speaker, my 
question is for the Deputy Prime Minister.
<P>
	Yesterday my colleague from Calgary Centre asked the Prime 
Minister about the gold-plated pension plans for MPs. In his 
response when the Prime Minister talked about salaries for MPs 
and NHL hockey players, he failed to mention one important 
difference: NHL hockey players do not have five-year no-cut 
contracts.
<P>
<B>(1425 ) </B>
<P>
	The question was about pensions, not salaries. Does the 
Deputy Prime Minister believe that after just six years of service 
MPs deserve a pension for life?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment):</B> Madam Speaker, I am really happy to 
receive the question, in particular on International Women's 
Day.
<P>
	One of the things that makes the presence of women in the 
House so unique this time is that we can use lots of analogies. 
Hockey may be one we want to stay away from because many 
hockey players get no-cut contracts.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River):</B> Madam Speaker, we 
have noticed that pension payments for members of Parliament 
who served in the last Parliament have increased dramatically. 
We need to come to terms with this regardless of how amusing it 
may seem.
<P>
	The Prime Minister often boasts of the swift action he took on 
the EH-101 helicopters and the Pearson airport deal.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> When may we on this side of the House applaud 
just as uproariously when the government acts swiftly on the 
outrageous cash-for-life pension plan for MPs?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment):</B> Madam Speaker, the public is rightly 
concerned about the compensation of members of Parliament 
and I in no way intend to diminish that debate. That is why the 
very first action of the President of the Treasury Board was to set 
up a parliamentary committee so all members could have input 
into this most important issue.
<P>
	However the member and the new members who are getting a 
handle on the workload of this place do a disservice to the 
Canadian public when they leave the impression that somehow 
we are here because of a cash-for-life lottery.
<P>
	If I wanted to make money, I would take my talents and brains 
and apply them in lots of other places where I would not be 
dependent on a pension but would be remunerated far more per 
hour for the work than I do in this place.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River):</B> A further 
supplementary question, Madam Speaker. We are talking about 
fairness of pension plans in the public sector as well as fairness 
for members of Parliament. There is a huge difference.
<P>
	Statistics Canada reports that a 30-year old working Canadian 
may reach retirement and find there is no money left in the 
Canada pension plan to offer him or her a secure retirement. Is 
the Deputy Prime Minister prepared to stand in the House and 
tell that 30-year old Canadian that untold millions of dollars 
will be made available to MPs for gold-plated pensions but 
there will not be enough for people who worked far more than 
six years in other professions?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment):</B> Madam Speaker, I have a six-year old 
Canadian who I fully expect to be working outside the home for 
most of her adult life. Obviously I and every other member of 
Parliament want to make sure that she has the security she needs 
and deserves. That is why we have promised to take a look at the 
issue.
<P>
	The hon. member is throwing around these figures about the 
way we are making ourselves rich in Parliament. Obviously her 
colleague right behind her is in receipt of two pensions and we 
want to make sure that when we do parliamentary reform it is 
fair. We want to involve all members in the discussion to ensure 
that issues like double dipping are dealt with and make sure that 
pension reform is fair. It is important to restore the public's faith 
in the system.
<P>
	We are not in this place to make a buck. I wish the Reform 
Party members would start to understand that.

decreasing the size of the armed forces. In fact in the recent 
budgetary statement the size of the armed forces will go from 
about 76,000 at present to 66,700. It goes without saying there 
will be a reduction in the number of officers required.
<P>

and was inspired by a large group of women and men, the Armed 
Forces Pensioners Association of Canada.
<P>
	The issue facing them has been festering since October 1992. 
That issue is the stonewalling of their many attempts to gain 
approval from Treasury Board for a group dental plan paid for 
by payroll deductions. This will not cost taxpayers one cent but 
simply will allow these pensioners to have a better and more 
efficient system.
<P>
	In the 50th anniversary year of D-Day, is the President of the 
Treasury Board prepared to implement this plan on behalf of 
those who have served our country so well in the Canadian 
Armed Forces?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board 
and Minister responsible for Infrastructure):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I thank the hon. member for advance notice of the 
question.
<P>
	Over the years in addition to statutory deductions made from 
the payroll there have been numerous requests with respect to 
charitable organizations, social recreation associations, credit 
unions, et cetera, for deductions to be made at source. It is to the 
point where it has stretched the limit of our personnel resources 
to be able to cope with them.
<P>
	My officials have undertaken a comprehensive review of 
these deductions requested by third parties. That review is just 
about complete and will be coming shortly to my attention. We 
will certainly take into consideration the concerns of the 
pensioners from the armed forces group and others who have 
very worthwhile causes and terrific needs to be met on behalf of 
former employees.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sharon Hayes (Port Moody-Coquitlam):</B> Madam 
Speaker, just as a reminder, the hon. minister's own colleague, 
the Minister of Finance, stated in a letter dated January 25, 1994 
that he too recognized the association's desire for a prompt 
resolution and decision.

act of violence against women is unacceptable in Canadian 
society. We are committed to put an end to this form of 
discrimination and violence against women. I assure you that we 
read the report that was released and that we will educate women 
in those communities through the Department of Health so that 
they know what practices are acceptable and what practices are 
not here in Canada. I hope that they will understand that it is not 
acceptable, here in Canada or anywhere else in the world.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond):</B> Madam Speaker, does

<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney

present sections of the code are sufficient to prohibit the conduct 
described and to render it criminal activity.
<P>
	I agree with the hon. Secretary of State for Multiculturalism 
and the Status of Women that our focus should perhaps be on 
education and proactive steps to alert health care professionals 
and others who see evidence of this conduct so that it is brought 
to light, investigated, punished and thereby prevented.
<P>
	May I say that in view of the statistics presented by the

<P>
	In view of the fact we are in the year of the family and the 
roots of families who now have small children have begun with 
grandparents, would the minister consider bringing in an 
amendment to the Divorce Act which would require judges to 
consider the access rights of grandparents to children in a

<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada):</B> Madam Speaker, let me first express my 
gratitude to the hon. member for Mission-Coquitlam for her 
consideration in furnishing advance notice of the question.
<P>
	I acknowledge the importance of the subject matter. Sadly, 
given the incidence of dysfunctional families in this country 
today it is often the grandparents who are the principal source of 
stable and continuous guidance and care for children. That must 
be recognized.
<P>
	Last year the Department of Justice initiated a broad process 
of consultation concerning the custody and access provisions in 
the Divorce Act. That process ended on December 31 by which 
time we had received hundreds of submissions. Among them 
were submissions that went directly to the point raised by the 
hon. member. We are now in the process of examining those 
submissions.
<P>
	There will be a federal-provincial-territorial meeting with

women is that of equal pay for work recognized to be of equal 
value. There is even an act forbidding any discrimination of this 
type in Canada. As an employer though, the federal government

ensure that women in fact all people are paid in a fair and 
equitable fashion according to the duties and responsibilities 
they carry out. We are a pay equity employer.
<P>
	There is a dispute on the extent of some of the back pay 
required to bring some of the classifications up to date. That 
matter is before a tribunal and also is the subject of some

	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier):</B> Madam Speaker, given 
these conditions, does the minister recognize that in freezing all

it is thereby confirming imbalances that already exist within its 
own compensation structure?

	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board

<P>
	We are anxious to bring that to an end sooner if at all possible 
by finding efficiencies in the delivery of programs and services, 
and to examine roles and responsibilities as my colleague to my 
right is doing. Hopefully we will be joined in that exercise by 
our employees and their bargaining agents so that we can at the 
earliest possible time restore the opportunity for all of our 
employees to enjoy salary increases.
<P>
	I might add that over the last few years even though there has 
been a salary freeze in three of the four years, because of the 
incremental increases on average increases of about 3 per cent 
have been going to our employees.

advance notice of the question.
<P>
	During the 1980s almost $1 billion in accumulated farm debt 
in the Farm Credit Corporation was effectively written off by the 
Government of Canada. This was followed by a policy review 
beginning in 1989 which resulted in a new mandate for the Farm 
Credit Corporation which was accepted I am told with broad 
support in the House of Commons at that time and brought into 
effect in the spring of 1993. That new mandate includes the

<P>
enhancement of rural Canada by  providing specialized financial 
services that are related to farming.
<P>
	In our election platform last fall, we proposed three new 
financial instruments to assist farmers: an agricultural equity 
development program, a vendor loan guarantee program and a 
long term mortgage program, including certain protections 
against interest rate fluctuations.
<P>
	I am pleased to tell the hon. member that the Farm Credit 
Corporation is now making substantial progress in devising the 
details of these new instruments, as we had undertaken to do in 
the fall of last year. I hope to be in a position to make some 
specific announcements this spring.

This is quite a specific issue.
<P>
	Today in New Liskeard, Ontario, a family is living a 
nightmare as they await eviction from their family farm on 
Thursday, two days from now, March 10. This business 
enterprise represents a perfect example of a system gone wrong 
when 117 per cent of the farm's value has been offered but has 
been refused by the Farm Credit Corporation and no reason has 
been given for such a refusal.
<P>
	Will the minister agree to an immediate cessation of any 
further action on this particular eviction until a full review with 
all of the parties present is held?
<P>

to impose a salary freeze to federal civil servants, including 
women who are at the bottom of the wage scale.
<P>
	Our job is certainly not an easy one but we have to do it. If

has been defending the rights of women in this House it is

women have their place everywhere, including in the House of

Madam Speaker, recently a 35-year veteran of the RCMP 
described to me that this policy is the greatest attack on the 
morale of the RCMP members that he has seen in his career.
<P>
	Is the minister prepared to accept the inevitable drop in the 
morale of Canada's police force as a result of this effort to save 
money on the backs of those members who can least afford it?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I again reject the premise of the hon. member's 
question. The budget is not an attack on RCMP constables or any 
group of public servants.
<P>
	However, I will be happy to review this matter with the 
President of the Treasury Board. I have greater confidence in the 
morale of the RCMP than the member. I am sure that is the case 
for all members on this side of the House.

	<B>Mrs. Sue Barnes (London West):</B> Madam Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Health.
<P>
	During the fall election campaign many members of the 
Liberal Party campaigned on the creation of a network of centres 
of excellence on women's health. We need to develop a women's 
health curriculum, promote and conduct research on women's 
health issues, develop health policies and recommend health 
programs.
<P>
<B>(1455 ) </B>
<P>
	On behalf of the men and women of Canada I would like to ask 
the Minister of Health what steps has she taken to date to 
implement this very important agenda.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health):</B> Madam Speaker, 
we are proceeding with the centre of excellence for women's 
health as outlined in the red book.
<P>
	Right now we are in the process of outlining specific criteria 
and an application process. We expect to issue the call for 
application by June and to select a successful applicant in the 
fall. We would like the first centre to commence its work early in 
1995.
<P>
	One of the centre's initial tasks will be to determine the most 
important health issues for women and then to undertake further 
work on these issues. The ultimate objective of the centre is to 
increase the responsiveness of the Canadian health system to the 
health needs of women.
<P>
	It is a known fact that only a small percentage of medical 
research funding in Canada has been directed toward women's 
health research. While the centre will address this problem, we 
also want to work more closely with other research funding 
bodies in order to encourage them to send money in the direction 
of research as well in women's health.

	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert):</B> Madam Speaker, 
according to the Office of the Commissioner for Federal Judicial 
Affairs, as of March 1, 1994, the federal government had 
appointed 951 judges to Superior Courts and Courts of Appeal. 
Of these 951 judges, only 123, less than 13 per cent, were 
women. This situation shows a total lack of foresight within the 
process used until now to select and appoint judges to the bench.

been raised is important.
<P>
	We are not going to preserve and maintain the confidence of 
the public in the system of justice and the judiciary unless we 
have a bench that is representative of Canada not only with 
respect to gender but also with respect to the diversity of 
Canada's society.
<P>
	As the minister in this government responsible primarily for 
bringing forward recommendations to cabinet for judicial 
appointment, I shall make it my business to ensure that we bear 
in mind the need for gender balance as well as the reflection of 
diversity on the bench in Canada.
<P>
	It is true to say that there are not enough women judges in the 
federal courts today and that perhaps reflects the appointment 
practices in the past. So far as this government is concerned we 
are going to bear in mind the need for gender equality as well as 
representativeness generally in appointing judges to the federal 
bench.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert):</B> Madam Speaker, the 
gap is so significant that to fill it we would need to award all new 
appointments to women, but I am not asking for that much.
<P>
	Will the minister recommend that, for the next several years, 
at least 80 per cent of all positions becoming vacant be filled by 
women?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada):</B> Madam Speaker, I do not think the answer 
lies in attaching specific numerical or mathematical quotas in 
terms of the appointment of judges and I do not propose to 
approach it from that perspective.
<P>
<B>(1500 ) </B>
<P>
	I give the House my assurance that gender equality and 
representativeness are important considerations that will be 
brought to bear every time we make recommendations to 
cabinet. May I invite the hon. member's attention to the 
appointments made by the government to date. May I ask her to 
observe that fully half of those appointed since we took office 
are women.

<P>
want to propose to the Deputy Prime Minister that her 
government undertake two very simple things that could be done 
right now.
<P>
	They concern two actions of the previous government. First, 
would the government agree to withdraw the appeal of the 
previous government on the ruling of the Canadian Human 
Rights Commission that the federal government be ordered to 
institute the pay equity settlement to female public sector 
workers. Second, the previous government denied the right of 
employees of members of Parliament to collectively bargain. A 
large majority of those employees are women. Would the 
government act on that issue as well?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment):</B> Madam Speaker, first I would like to 
congratulate the member who is the first woman leader of a 
national political party. She has been a role model for all women 
in Canada.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Copps:</B> Second, on the issue of the specifics of the court 
challenge we are exploring the possibility of discontinuing that 
challenge. The matter is now before the President of the 
Treasury Board.
<P>
	On the issue of employee bargaining I can assure the hon. 
member that each member of Parliament is free to address this 
matter in his or her own way. In fact in the last Parliament the 
assistant in my office was one of those who was very active in 
the organizing process.
<P>
	The member would agree that on the issue of freedom of a 
member of Parliament's office I do not think it is the 
responsibility of the government or a particular political party to 
decide for the whole House but rather individual members of 
Parliament have the right as any Canadian does for their 
employees to seek to organize.

the red book, the Liberal Party of Canada committed itself to 
extending refugee status to women persecuted on gender 
grounds. Previously, women refugees victims of violence and 
abuse in their country of origin were deported and forced to 
return to this dangerous environment.
<P>

thank my colleague for Saint-Denis for her question and her 
interest in immigration and refugee matters.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	First, I am very proud that Canada is the only country with 
guidelines in its refugee determination system that permit 
women to make claims based on gender persecution. One 
hundred and fifty women have made such claims. Over 70 per 
cent have been accepted.
<P>
	Second, since 1988 we have had a women at risk program that 
allows us to select those women who are most at risk and most 
vulnerable in their societies in our overseas selection of 
refugees. The international community has much more work to 
do because the majority of international refugees are women and 
young children, while the majority of refugees selected by 
countries are male. We have miles to go before we sleep.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion and the 
amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval-Centre):</B> 
Madam Speaker, it is on March 8, 1911, that for the first time 
ever, many countries decided to pay tribute to the courage and 
tenacity of women.
<P>
	This acknowledgement of women's role in our society did not 
happen by chance; it was due to the relentless efforts of female 
pioneers who had decided to fight the poverty, inequity, and 
violence their sisters were faced with every day of their lives.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2002"> 2002 </A></B>
<P>
	I want to salute the relentless efforts of these women who 
have been and are still fighting so that equality among human 
beings, men and women alike, may one day be a reality.
<P>
	I want to wish all Quebec and Canadian women, and 
especially the women in my riding of Laval-Centre, a very 
happy day. They can count on my unfailing commitment to 
promote and fight for their rights. We still have a long way to go.
<P>
	Women's economic situation, in Canada as well as in Quebec, 
is tragic. They are the first ones to be affected by the ravages of 
poverty, this scourge which has become rampant in our 
so-called developed society.
<P>
<B>(1510) </B>
<P>
	The situation is even more tragic for women who are single 
parents. More than anybody else, they bear the brunt of the 
present economic crisis.
<P>
	We can only paint a rather dismal picture of the situation. 
Statistics and columns of figures show the extent of the 
problem. However, figures do not reflect the increasingly 
desperate situation of these families, these women who are 
fighting for their survival and their children's. Spurred on by the 
economic crisis, the government goes to war, but instead of 
targeting poverty, it targets the poor.
<P>
	The latest budget speech and the planned reform of social 
programs are blatant examples of this. The government seems to 
remain insensitive to the plight of the hundreds of thousands of 
women who are the sole support of their family and who do not 
have a hope to make it without the government's help.
<P>
	Very often, if they work outside their homes it is because 
financially they have to. It is to be able to survive that these 
women, who support their families, have to rely on the 
government's assistance. According to the latest figures-
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Wayne:</B> Madam Speaker, I am sorry to interrupt the hon. 
member, but I would ask a question of Madam Speaker.
<P>
	All through question period I waited to ask a question. I have 
not been afforded an opportunity to ask a question in the House 
since I was elected. You had said-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sorry, I do not find 
this to be a point of order. I remind the hon. member that she was 
on statements. She was eighth on the list for questioners and we 
did not get to number eight. I tried everything I could to get as 
many people on as I could today. We went over the time for 
question period by almost five minutes. I am sorry but I did 
everything I could. I do not think we should interrupt debate. 
That could have waited until after the hon. member had finished.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dalphond-Guiral:</B> Madam Speaker, according to the 
most recent statistics available, in 1991, there were 1,883,140 
families in Quebec. Of that total, 268,000 were single parent 
families and, of those, 82 per cent were headed, as you have 
guessed, by women.
<P>
	In Canada, the situation is similar; Statistics Canada data 
indicate that one family out of seven is a single-parent one. 
Women who are heads of single-parent families are more likely 
to be poor than men or women living in any other types of 
families: nearly 62 per cent of them live below the poverty line. 
In 1990, female single parent families had the lowest income, on 
average $26,906-gross income of course-compared to 
$42,953 for single parent families headed by men. The 
incidence of poverty in single parent families headed by women 
is clear. Within a mere two years, the income of these families 
has dropped by about $3,000.
<P>
	Single mothers must often take on complete responsibility for 
the physical, material and psychological well-being of their 
children. Such a reality explains why the recent trend reveals 
that some important changes have occurred in the social fabric 
of Canada and Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1515) </B>
<P>
	According to Statistics Canada, being a single parent usually 
results from the failure of a marriage and from child care being 
entrusted to the mother. These mothers are often younger and 
their education level lower than that of fathers who head 
single-parent families. These young mothers must work to 
support their children and therefore, have to leave school. They 
cannot acquire the necessary skills to get good quality jobs and 
consequently, cannot hope for a better income. They find 
themselves limited to low quality types of jobs.
<P>
	According to the National Action Committee on the Status of 
Women, a staggering number of unemployed single mothers 
were living on a gross annual income of barely more than 
$12,000. These are 1991 figures. Everyone will agree that this is 
well below the poverty level.
<P>
	Almost all the available income of these women came from 
the state, in the form of family allowances, unemployment 
insurance benefits, social assistance, retirement pensions and 
other types of benefits.
<P>
	Poverty is a vicious circle which is very difficult to break 
without outside help, particularly if you are a woman who is a 
single parent and who must work to ensure her survival and that 
of her children. Yet these women are most likely to find 
underpaid jobs. They are classic victims of the precariousness of 
employment and the division of work, a modern calamity for a 
society in constant evolution which strikes young workers and 
women.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2003"> 2003 </A></B>
<P>
	Another economic burden supported by single mothers is the 
excessive cost of housing. According to Statistics Canada, 54 
per cent of single parent families were renting the dwelling in 
which they lived. The rate is much lower for men who are heads 
of single parent families, since it is around 37 per cent. What is 
alarming is the fact that 56 per cent of single parents who are 
women spend more than 30 per cent of their income on housing, 
while, and so much the better, only 32 per cent of single parents 
who are men spend the same proportion of their income on 
housing.
<P>
	Today, on March 8, we must acknowledge that the situation of 
women is tragic. The era of collective impoverishment has very 
much arrived and the question is how long it will last. In the 
meantime, Canadian women are paying the price. Everyone in 
this House agrees that poverty is a problem which must be 
solved. We must go to the root of that problem right now. The 
government has not only a political and administrative 
responsibility, but also a moral responsibility towards 
Canadians. Wishful thinking, white books, sham policies and 
political programs which turn from red to blue with every 
possible nuance no longer have their place in 1994.
<P>
	This government can, if it wants and especially if it so 
believes, show the way by facilitating access to education and 
employment for single mothers, and that includes, among other 
initiatives, the setting up of a national day care network which 
would be primarily available to those families who need it the 
most. And, Madam Speaker, as you know, these families are the 
ones headed by women.
<P>
<B>(1520) </B>
<P>
	Another measure could be taken to improve the financial 
situation of single mothers. An increasing number of women are 
being economically discriminated against because of a 
provision of the Federal Income Tax Act concerning the taxation 
of support payments made to the parents who are given custody 
of the children and who are women for the most part, as we well 
know. We will not have to mention it anymore, since it is 
becoming so obvious. Right now, the tax reform undertaken by 
the government does not address the issue.
<P>
	The principle according to which any deductible amount for 
the payer, that is the ex-husband, is added to the income of the 
recipient, that is the single mother who has custody of the 
children, dates back to the 1940s. At that time, Madam Speaker, 
we were both quite young.
<P>
	Everyone will agree that our society has changed significantly 
during the last 50 years. The government must accept its 
responsibilities and reconsider this principle which greatly 
affects the financial security of single mothers. Those are only a 
few of the measures which could improve the financial situation 
of women, of their family and of all members of our society.
<P>
	The wealth and the vitality of a society largely depends on its 
concern for the young. Healthy kids make for healthy families. 
The basic needs of an individual must be fulfilled for him or her 
to grow. Our young people need to be well-fed, to be 
well-housed, to have some place warm to go, and to be loved in 
order to grow and become reliable and happy adults.
<P>
	During the Year of the Family, I think it is the responsibility of 
members of this House and of this government to do whatever 
they can to ensure all families in Quebec and in Canada enjoy 
the best health possible. I am convinced that on this day, March 
8, our leaders have listened a bit more carefully to the needs of 
our society.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, what I should have told you earlier is that, 
starting with my speech, our interventions will last ten minutes.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Marlene Catterall (Parliamentary Secretary to 
President of the Treasury Board):</B> Madam Speaker, I am very 
pleased today to join my colleagues in saluting International 
Women's Day.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I am very pleased to join you today to celebrate the 
International Women's Day, which gives us the opportunity to 
acknowledge all the progress made by women as well as the 
improvements yet to come. We are lucky to live in such a 
prosperous country as Canada, but Canadian women still have a 
long way to go to live in all the comfort enjoyed by Canadian 
men.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	While we celebrate the achievements of women and generate 
new energy and co-operation for continued progress and 
growth, our commitment to a goal of economic equality for 
Canada and everywhere in the world must remain strong. We 
want Canada to continue to be a world leader in the pursuit of 
this goal.
<P>
	Canada will continue to set an example for the world in its 
defence and respect of the rights and freedoms of individuals. 
The right of women to be treated equally with men without 
discrimination is enshrined in the Canadian Charter of Rights 
and Freedoms and specified in the Canadian Human Rights Act.
<P>
<B>(1525 ) </B>
<P>
	As we speak about equality, we speak often about social 
equality and we speak often about political equality. 
Increasingly however we as policy makers and we as women 
realize that political and social equality will remain elusive 
goals until we have economic equality.
<P>
	In recent years, the pursuit of economic equality for women 
has been linked to a simple but important concept, equal pay for 
work of equal value. This concept goes beyond the notion that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2004"> 2004 </A></B>
<P>
men and women should be paid the same when they are 
performing the same work.
<P>
	The reality is that men and women tend to do different kinds 
of work, for whatever traditional reasons that has happened, that 
is the reality. Whether they are performing the same or different 
work, they deserve to be paid fairly. We need to find ways to 
measure and compare the value of work that is significantly 
different.
<P>
	I have to ask a question. Why is a dog catcher paid twice as 
much as a child care worker? How does the work performed by a 
secretary compare to that performed by an electrician? Is it 
worth more or is it worth less? We now have the tools required to 
make that assessment and to ensure that when jobs are found to 
be of equal value appropriate wages, equal wages, are provided.
<P>
	The federal government is the largest employer of women in 
this country. For that reason this government wants to show 
employers across the country that it is simply good business to 
pay men and women fairly and to pay them equally if they are 
performing work of equal value.
<P>
	After all, a fair wage will allow employers to recruit and 
retain qualified workers who will contribute to the quality of 
their service or product into their competitive edge. More 
important perhaps, a fair wage will enable women to become 
full partners in the economic growth of our country.
<P>
	Women expect to receive fair wages for the work they 
perform. They deserve to receive fair wages for that work and 
this government is working toward that goal.
<P>
	Since the proclamation of the Canadian Human Rights Act in 
1978 that enacted and enshrined the principle of equal pay for 
work of equal value or pay equity, the government, the Canadian 
Human Rights Commission, unions and employees have worked 
toward making it a reality.
<P>
	Many complaints have been resolved co-operatively. Many 
others and far too many others have been the subject of long and 
bitter battles. This has been a period of learning, a period of trial 
and error. This government wants to build on these experiences 
and ensure that equal pay for work of equal value is achieved 
through the joint efforts of all interested parties.
<P>
	In 1985 in the public service a joint union-management study 
on equal pay for work of equal value was undertaken in the 
federal public service. Today the results of the study are being 
contested in front of the Human Rights Tribunal. I do not need to 
tell anybody who is familiar with the whole progress of that case 
that it has indeed been long and contentious and that we sitting 
on the other side of the House objected to the strategies and 
tactics of the previous government in what we felt was delaying 
the work of that tribunal.
<P>
	However the Human Rights Commission does have the 
responsibility to investigate all complaints of violations of the 
Canadian Human Rights Act and to order corrective actions 
where it concludes that violations have occurred.
<P>
	This Liberal government fully endorses the important role of 
the Human Rights Commission and of human rights tribunals in 
protecting Canadians from discrimination and eliminating 
discriminatory practices.
<P>
	In spite of the continuing debate, a lot of good came from the 
joint union-management initiative on equal pay. It was the first 
time that a joint endeavour had been undertaken to implement 
section 11 of the Canadian Human Rights Act.
<P>
	A great deal was learned. Until now 70,000 employees in 
predominantly female occupational groups received 
approximately $317 million in retroactive equal pay 
adjustments. Approximately $81 million is paid in ongoing 
annual adjustments.
<P>
<B>(1530) </B>
<P>
	Overall since the enactment of the federal equal pay 
legislation over $500 million has been paid in equal pay 
adjustments in the resolution of various complaints. Much has 
been achieved and much has been learned. We as a government 
continue to work toward a full resolution of the issue.
<P>
	The achievement of equal pay for work of equal value 
requires the use of a common tool to evaluate all jobs whether 
they are performed predominantly by men or by women. That 
tool must be gender neutral. It must not be based on the 
traditional differences in what roles women have assumed and 
what roles men have assumed. It must recognize the value of all 
aspects of the work performed whether traditionally by men or 
by women.
<P>
	This is why this government will pursue efforts undertaking 
to develop a universal classification standard in the federal 
public service that is gender neutral. Many dedicated persons 
have already committed their time and effort to this project. It is 
not an easy task to revamp the whole job evaluation system of an 
organization the size and complexity of the Public Service of 
Canada.
<P>
	We want to ensure that the universal classification standard is 
the right tool to achieve our goals of simplicity, transparency 
and fairness. When we are satisfied that it is, we will implement 
it to ensure we have a durable basis for the resolution of pay 
equity issues.
<P>
	After the Canadian Human Rights Act was passed in 1978 
many provinces followed suit and enacted legislation on equal 
pay for work of equal value. The more recent provincial models 
are more prescriptive and specific than the model we adopted 
early on at the federal level.
<P>
	As a result of the growing interest across the country in the 
achievement of pay equity, there is a growing library of ideas, 
experiences and jurisprudence in this field in Canada today. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2005"> 2005 </A></B>
<P>
However, equal pay for work of  equal value remains a field rife 
with controversy. Parties in every part of the country debate 
over the right evaluation tool or plan, the right job data, the right 
wage comparison methodology.
<P>
	I can assure hon. members today that this government is 
interested in results. Government is looking for real, realistic 
and realizable means of achieving this important goal for the 
economic equality of Canadian women. We are continuing to 
address equal pay for work of equal value complaints and issues 
as they arise. We will use whatever creative means are necessary 
to ensure that fairness and equity are achieved.
<P>
	Already the President of Treasury Board has engaged in 
dialogue with public service unions. We welcome their 
suggestions on any matter that may enable us to reach a 
definitive and co-operative solution to pay equity complaints.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Indeed, this government wants to establish ties of 
co-operation and trust with union representatives in the federal 
Public Service. We are going through hard economic times and 
we must co-operate to minimize the impact on employees, 
while continuing to provide quality service to all Canadians.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Some hon. members know the Canadian Human Rights Act 
applies to employees of the federal government, crown 
corporations and private companies under federal jurisdiction 
such as banks and telephone companies. It covers approximately 
300,000 women workers. I am confident the implementation of 
equal pay for work of equal value in the federal public sector 
will set a precedent for similar progress in industries across the 
country. That is why it is so important we get it right.
<P>
	On this important day I am pleased to play a part in the 
resolution of the economic concerns of Canadian women. I am 
determined to help make progress toward the economic equality 
of women with their male co-workers. Equal pay for work of 
equal value is only one step, albeit an important one in achieving 
this economic equality.
<P>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
	I have long been appalled by the wage gap reported in an 
industrialized country as prosperous as ours. Full 
implementation of equal pay for work of equal value will not 
fully close that wage gap, but it will go a long way. Unequal 
wages do not fully explain the wage gap.
<P>
	One of the major problems is the concentration of women in 
certain occupations which are usually low paying. Women 
remain concentrated in traditionally female jobs. In 1991 over 
50 per cent of women in Canada were concentrated in clerical, 
sales and service jobs whereas just over 20 per cent of men were 
in those occupations. Coincidentally these happen to be among 
the lowest paid jobs in our society.
<P>
	To achieve economic equality equal pay for work of equal 
value programs need to be coupled with diversification in the 
work choices available to women. Just as important is the need 
to eliminate all types of employment discrimination so that 
women have equal opportunities based on their ability to move 
into management, to move into any kind of job that is suited to 
their talents, their abilities and their interests.
<P>
	We often hear and there have been comments to this effect in 
this House today that employment equity is discriminatory. 
Employment equity eliminates discrimination. Employment 
equity ensures that only one's ability matters in whether one 
gets hired or promoted or advances in employment.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Economic equality for women in Canada and elsewhere can 
only be achieved with a combination of programs such as pay 
equity and employment equity. I personally intend to play an 
important role in these fields and to challenge all employers in 
Canada to be models for the whole world of employers who treat 
their female employees equally.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I thank you for your attention. I compliment all my colleagues 
who participated in this debate today.

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I listened carefully to the hon. member's speech and I 
was particularly interested in the whole issue of employment 
equity for women because I have two daughters who will be in 
the work force in a few years and, after the question period we 
just had, I was wondering what message we were sending to 
young people growing up when we say that the fight against the 
deficit is preventing us from correcting pay inequities.
<P>
	A moment ago, the deficit was given as a reason for not acting 
and not correcting an unacceptable situation. Fifteen years ago, 
other reasons were given and in ten years, still other reasons will 
be given if we do not correct the situation immediately. So for 
the sake of young women now in the education system who will 
be on the labour market in the 21st century, could you not tell us 
publicly that your government's present position should be 
changed and corrected to put equity ahead of the deficit?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Catterall:</B> Madam Speaker, I have the pleasure to 
inform the hon. member that I too have two daughters who work 
in professional jobs and I hope that their future will be a little 
more comfortable than what the previous generation had to put 
up with. So we share an interest in women's future prosperity. I 
think that the President of the Treasury Board clearly indicated 
in this House that pay equity is not an option. There is no choice 
between pay equity and fighting the deficit. The two are 
separate. We are looking for ways to correct that. As I just said, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2006"> 2006 </A></B>
<P>
we invited the unions to talk with us about  finding a solution for 
pay equity. I hope that they will come and meet with us to pursue 
these discussions in order to come up with a solution finally. We 
did not use the deficit as an excuse for not solving the problem.
<P>
<B>(1540 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I listened with great interest to the hon. member's 
comments. For the most part I appreciate what she had to say.
<P>
	I do have a concern in one area. It is when the hon. member 
talks about pay equity for jobs of equal value. The government is 
embarking on a formidable task. As I understand the proposal 
the government is intending to defy decades upon decades of 
experience where the marketplace has established the level of 
wages to be paid in any particular occupation.
<P>
	To give an example of this, my wife works part time in a ladies 
fashion store in my home town of Prince George. She works very 
hard and puts in long hours. In my opinion she gets paid about 
one-third of what she is worth. Nevertheless she likes the work 
so she does it. I believe she works every bit as hard as an 
electrician for example who earns $25 an hour plus benefits.
<P>
	The question is: Could that retail store afford to pay her $25 
an hour if my opinion stands that she works as hard as an 
electrician? The answer of course is no.
<P>
	This idea of trying to equate the wages a tradesperson makes 
with the wages of someone in a totally different job category 
where the wages have been determined by years of market 
experience is almost an impossible task. One cannot say a 
secretary should make the same as a painter because they are 
two different occupations and the level of the painter's wages 
has been set by the market.
<P>
	Another interesting point is it seems to me when all these 
commissions come up with their findings they never ever say the 
wages in a particular category are too high and should be 
lowered. It is always the other way around. It is remarkable there 
has never been an instance in my understanding where the pay 
scale has been overvalued in a job and that pay scale should have 
been brought down to match a job of equal value. It is always the 
other way around and wages are raised.
<P>
	I am not saying people should not earn as much as they 
possibly can. As a matter of fact because of our tremendous 
deficit and debt which has been incurred with the help of this 
government and the previous government people have to earn 
more money. The taxation levels are so darn high that the 
disposable income is now hardly enough to get by.
<P>
<B>(1545 ) </B>
<P>
	It is not a question of high wages. We are talking about job 
valuation. I believe the government is attempting to defy years 
upon years of market driven levels. It is embarking on a 
formidable task. I believe that it is going to be almost 
impossible to come up with a plausible conclusion to this study.
<P>
	I would like to ask the hon. member if her government intends 
to try to defy all this history and come up with this new formula, 
reinventing the wheel, so to speak.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Catterall:</B> Madam Speaker, perhaps I can give the hon. 
member some specifics on this history that I think we intend to 
defy. Since 1978, over a decade and a half, equal pay for work of 
equal value has been the law in this country but it is still far from 
the reality.
<P>
	We intend to defy history. Why should this government be 
exempt from legislation that applies to every other employer in 
the country?
<P>
	We intend to defy the tradition that has ensured that women 
are poorer than men throughout the country; that has ensured 
that women are concentrated in the lowest paying jobs in this 
country; that has ensured that the largest percentage of single 
parents, women, live in poverty as well as their children. We 
intend to defy those traditions.
<P>
	The member has commented that the market has determined 
these things. He mentioned a personal example. It may be fine 
for his wife, if he wants to bring her into the debate this 
afternoon, to work for less than a living wage. It is not fine for a 
woman who has to support her children.
<P>
	Perhaps the member can tell me why a dogcatcher gets paid 
more than somebody who looks after the welfare of children, 
twice as much I might say. He might have a reasonable 
explanation for that.
<P>
	The fact is that we have traditionally had a society in which 
men have done most of the money making work and in which 
women have traditionally done most of the unpaid work. That 
unfortunately has carried over into the labour market in which 
the work most often performed by women is seen as less 
valuable; in which the salaries of women have been seen as 
peripheral to the economic well-being of the family. For many 
families that is no longer the case. The exploitation of women 
doing work of equal value for less pay is no longer acceptable. It 
is not.
<P>
	The market does not always establish fairness. It is up to a 
society to take some leadership in establishing fairness.

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides):</B> On this International 
Women's Day, it is with great pride that I take the floor in this 
House. This day set aside for us is, in my opinion, essential and 
it has the added advantage of providing an opportunity to reflect 
on the situation of women in our society.
<P>
	Those 24 hours devoted exclusively to women increase the 
awareness of people and make us more aware of our 
problems-those very real and numerous problems we are faced 
with every day.
<P>
	In a letter dated February 8 to the Prime Minister, the 
Advisory Council on the Status of Women provides a list of 17 
priorities requiring analyses and policies at all levels of 
government in order to set up a framework based on equality. 
Equality is the operative word that we should always keep in 
mind when we are called upon to take a position, to make a 
choice, to set policies or to initiate action.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	These 17 points proposed by the Council deal with well 
known areas. However, when you group them in some ways or 
when you try to relate them one to another, you realize that being 
a woman in our society is a major handicap. Job creation, safety 
at home and in the community, status of native women, women's 
health and health care, income security, wage parity, daycare 
services are areas where we suffer unfairness, iniquities and 
indifference.
<P>
	As a woman member, I consider myself privileged to have the 
tools which allow me to protest on behalf of my sisters. Every 
opportunity I get, I consider it my duty to draw the attention to 
the situation of women. I believe all women members should do 
the same. Moreover, our actions within our caucuses should 
always be aimed at improving the condition of women.
<P>
	Despite our demands and our actions, despite the efforts of 
women's groups, the situation is not improving very fast. The 
slow pace of reform and the lack of strong and specific measures 
to deal with urgent problems clearly demonstrate that 
decision-makers are very reluctant to promote women's causes.
<P>
	What bothers me most with this passive and indifferent 
position towards women is that we are failing to respond to the 
legitimate expectations of 52 per cent of the population. Women 
are a majority in our society. Given this 4 per cent majority over 
men, I feel that we have an obligation to meet women's needs. 
Alas, in actual fact, the reality is something else entirely.
<P>
	This situation brings us to question the role of women in the 
system. Power and representation, particularly at the political 
level. Our presence in legislative bodies.
<P>
	First finding: 53 out of 295 members of this Parliament are 
women. Since 1980, our numbers have increased. We went from 
17 female members of  Parliament to 27 in 1984, 39 in 1988, and 
53 today. It is an interesting increase but one that is clearly 
insufficient.
<P>
	While women make up 52 per cent of the population, we only 
constitute 18 per cent of members in this House. On the other 
hand, while 48 per cent of the population is composed of men, 
our male colleagues account for 82 per cent of members in this 
House. These figures show that the current Parliament and those 
of the past-when numbers were even more 
disproportionate-do not reflect at all the male-female ratio in 
the population.
<P>
	This underrepresentation clearly puts women at a 
disadvantage. It also raises the whole issue of women's political 
representation. Before going any further on this, I want to point 
out that this imbalance also exists in the Cabinet. Only 6 out of 
31 ministers and secretaries of state are women. This 
underrepresentation also prevails in every major sector of 
activity. Power is certainly not in the hands of women.
<P>
	Faced with this statistical evidence, this Parliament is 
certainly not a microcosm or miniature version of our society. 
This numerical imbalance, combined with long-standing male 
dominance, affects all women's issues. It has become 
imperative for us women to show our feminist beliefs and to 
politically represent women if we want our lot to improve.
<P>
	Our male colleagues are rather reluctant to embrace the idea 
of representing the female population.
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	For the purposes of a study conducted in 1993 by Manon 
Tremblay and Réjean Pelletier, 24 elected female 
representatives and 24 elected male representatives were 
interviewed. Sixteen of the 24 women, or 66.7 per cent, agreed 
that they had a special or additional duty toward the female 
population. As for the men, more than three in five, or 60.9 per 
cent, felt that women representatives had no obligation to 
maintain closer ties with women voters.
<P>
	Since the majority of male representatives believe that we, 
women elected representatives, should not give greater 
consideration to women, we can only imagine how they must 
view women in general. The status of women is surely not at the 
top of their priority list. Far from it.
<P>
	I also read with interest in the 1993 annual report of the 
Lobbyists Registration Act that women's issues rank 42 out of 
52 in terms of the number of times raised by lobbyists. In other 
words, this issue is not very important to them. Women's issues 
do not, therefore, benefit from this important access to the 
government. While it may be true that women's groups do not 
have vast financial resources, it is equally true that lobbying is a 
predominantly male field.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2008"> 2008 </A></B>
<P>
	I will say no more about the ability and willingness of men to 
espouse women's causes. I know that some of my colleagues are 
not part of the statistics quoted here and are staunch supporters 
of our cause. However, the fact remains that on a daily basis, 
women are confronted with serious problems to which no 
solutions are being advanced.
<P>
	I have no doubt that if women held 52 per cent of the seats in 
this House, things would be quite different. Some studies 
indicate that women show more humanism and develop ethics of 
responsibility in the performance of their duties. This concern 
for the person is evident from the remarks of this female 
member of Parliament who was quoted in the Tremblay and 
Pelletier report as saying that: ``Our management of political 
power relies much more on understanding and feeling for the 
human element, the people, I would say, and we are more aware 
of the consequences of our actions-We see things differently. 
Our femininity comes into play and gives a much more humane 
quality to politics''.
<P>
	There should be more women in politics. It is becoming 
imperative, if we are to see more humanism and feminism in 
politics, with humanism setting the human being and human 
values above everything else and feminism seeking 
improvement of the condition of women in our societies.
<P>
	When they look at the situation in their ridings, all the hon. 
members of this House can see that the country is in dire need of 
humanism and feminism. Poverty, misery, violence and 
isolation affect an increasing number of people. They are 
becoming pervasive and, if nothing is done, the process will 
soon be irreversible. Soup kitchens, shelters for battered 
women, child abuse centers, housing problems facing families, 
street children as well as lonely and less and less cared for older 
people speak loudly of unfeeling governments and their lack of 
regard for human values.
<P>
	These serious problems did not crop up overnight. They have 
been around for far too long already. Lawmakers are aware of 
them, yet they do not act on these inhuman conditions often, 
actually very often, affecting the status of women. One day, it is 
all going to blow up in our faces. And governments will reap 
what they have sown.
<P>
	Let us face it, and studies back up this statement, we would be 
facing a very different situation if more women were and had 
been in power. Let us have more women in power, by all means. 
Imagine a Parliament, the make-up of which would be the 
opposite of this one, a Parliament with 82 per cent women and 
18 per cent men. Why not?
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	The truth of the matter is that women continue to face 
gender-based obstacles. That is why the Canadian Advisory 
Council on the Status of Women recommended the reactivation 
of the Royal Commission on Electoral Reform and Party 
Financing, with a mandate to review  and report on matters 
raised by women groups in their briefs to the Commission.
<P>
	In closing, here lies a colossal challenge that we must take on. 
Fundamental changes are required, and what better place than 
Parliament to act upon society as a whole! It is up to us, men and 
women who are not blinkered, to make it happen.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke):</B> Madam 
Speaker, the hon. member who just spoke has obviously spoken 
with a lot of personal passion as to her feelings on this matter.
<P>
	Although there have been many inequities in the past and no 
doubt some forms of discrimination, one cannot make that right 
overnight. It has been suggested that 52 per cent of the 
constituents in this country are women. Why do they need 
special concessions in order to have the amount of elected 
representatives proportionate to the number of people who are 
out there if they have 52 per cent of the vote?
<P>
	It seems that women get to make these choices as well. There 
should be no obstacles placed in front of a candidate seeking 
election, male or female. However, given that 52 per cent, the 
majority of all the voters, are women why then do we have to 
provide special incentives and special clauses for women in 
order that they get elected?
<P>
	There were some suggestions made that I heard a number of 
times that one has to have more women as members of 
Parliament since one cannot have representation for women 
with men since men are not able to properly represent women's 
issues. Does that suggest that wherever we have a riding with a 
woman representative the men's issues are not looked after? I 
think not and I would not agree with that any more than I agree 
with the latter.
<P>
	It was suggested that lobbying is a male occupation. Lobbying 
is also something that is kind of looked down upon now and we 
are trying to cut down on the number of people who are 
lobbyists. Why would women want to get into a profession that 
we have been trying to squeeze out and put down because it is 
simply not one that is appropriate for this day and age of 
Parliament?
<P>
	I would suggest that the right way for us to go is to end 
inequities, to give the same opportunity for all people. By all 
means, women should have every right to reach whatever their 
potential is. There is absolutely nothing that says in a free 
society in which there is absolutely no discrimination that there 
will be equal numbers of men and women in every occupation. 
That is absolutely absurd.
<P>
	There are things that women do better than men in some areas 
and there are things that men do better than women in other areas 
because of physical attributes or because of many other different 
things in their make-up. I would suggest that what we have to do 
is be equal, give  them the same opportunities. Whatever is the 
<P>
<HR>

<P>
proper proportion will evolve. We cannot change the system 
overnight.

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Guay:</B> I have full proof that a lot remains to be done

<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
International Women's Day, I want to offer my best wishes to all 
women in Quebec and Canada, and also to the millions of 
women throughout the world, and particularly in Latin America.
<P>
	I especially want to pay tribute to women who are union 
activists, who are immigrant in Quebec, and to the women in my 
riding of Bourassa, in the north of Montreal, who are very 
involved at all levels of the political, economic, cultural and 
community fields.
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	Last week, I visited several community organizations headed 
by women, including the Centre d'action bénévole de 
Montréal-Nord, which just celebrated its tenth anniversary. I 
feel honoured to have been asked to preside the ceremonies as 
honourary president and I want to congratulate the director of 
that centre, Mrs. Josée Aubertin, for her excellent work.
<P>
	I also met Mrs. Lise St-Jean and other officials representing 
Halte-femmes in the north of Montreal, an organization helping 
women who have been or who are victims of domestic violence. 
Halte-femmes offers these women various activities and 
services such as a hot line and meetings to discuss issues, 
escorts to court or to visit professionals, awareness workshops 
on violence against women, information meetings, a 
documentation centre, outings, special activities for immigrant 
women, etc.
<P>
	I also want to salute the members of the Montréal-Nord 
chamber of commerce who had the wisdom to elect Mrs. 
Micheline Gervais as their president, thus benefitting from her 
initiative and great skills.
<P>
	Allow me to mention two more organizations which are doing 
a remarkable job in my riding: first the Association 
Entre-Parents, a support group for parents in the north of 
Montreal, which has set up a day care centre and a community 
kitchen, under the co-ordination of Mrs. Louise Cossette, and 
second, the Impulsion-Travail Group, which under the direction 
of Mrs. Johanne Joly, tries to help women with work-related 
problems to find a job or return to the labour market.
<P>
	I would also like to acknowledge the contribution of the FTQ, 
its labour councils and affiliated unions, as well as its status of 
women service. Last December, the FTQ held its biannual 
convention in Montreal, where I had the opportunity to speak to 
more than a thousand delegates.
<P>
	During this convention, the FTQ approved a policy statement 
on violence against women, in which it mentions that, as the 
central labour body in Quebec, it is very concerned about the 
increase of violence in today's society. More and more 
tragedies, like the one which occured at the University of 
Montreal's École Polytechnique, have forced us to realize that 
we have to take action.
<P>
	As opposition critic for citizenship and immigration, I would 
like to mention the significant contribution of immigrant 
women to the Quebec and the Canadian societies, especially 
those women faced with three times the challenge since they are 
women, workers and immigrants.
<P>
	It is a well-known fact that, on average, women earn much 
less than men. What is not so well known is that immigrant 
women earn 80 per cent of the average wages paid to women in 
our society.
<P>
	There are about 20 millions refugees in the world and 80 per 
cent of them are women and children. Recently, the whole world 
was horrified to learn that rape had become a general practice in 
Bosnia.
<P>
	I want to take this opportunity to send a message of solidarity 
and, inasmuch as I can, a message of hope to those women. 
Today, I ask the Canadian government to be more compassionate 
towards the women of Bosnia who are persecuted and create 
special assistance programs in order to help them.
<P>
	More specifically I ask the Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration to accept a greater number of refugees from the 
former Yugoslavia and to give special consideration to women 
who were raped.
<P>
	I would also like to bring to your attention the special problem 
of women who request refugee status because they fear 
persecution based on their gender. Unfortunately, in the Geneva 
convention of 1951, gender is not mentioned as a specific reason 
for fear of persecution justifying the granting of refugee status. 
But in certain countries, women are in fact being harassed 
simply because they transgressed some rule, regulation or 
religious custom which is discriminatory towards women.

<P>
	The religious precepts, social traditions or cultural standards 
women are accused of not respecting vary greatly.
<P>
	Canada must do more to guarantee better protection and 
hospitality to those women, particularly women from countries 
where such dramatic situations occur. I want to emphasize that 
this effort should be inspired by the fact that the UN declared 
1994 the International Year of the Family.
<P>
	Finally, I would like to raise a very serious question 
concerning the mutilation of women's genital organs. I strongly 
support the request of the Canadian Advisory Council on the 
Status of Women urging the federal government to show 
leadership in ensuring that female genital mutilation does not 
happen in Canada and to ensure assistance is available here to 
women who suffer the long-term health effects of such a 
practice.
<P>
	Such violence against young girls and women must be 
vigorously denounced. It is clearly a violation of their 
fundamental right to physical integrity.
<P>
	Several countries, including Sweden, Norway, Belgium, 
Great Britain and certain American States, have already taken 
steps to that effect, adopting policies to stop female genital 
mutilation and passing legislation banning the practice on their 
territory.
<P>
	Between 1986 and 1991, nearly 40,000 people from East and 
West Africa settled in Canada. In view of the fact that female 
genital mutilation is widespread in these areas, the risk that this 
cultural practice is being brought into Canada is very high.
<P>
	On this issue, the Canadian Advisory Council on the Status of 
Women made several recommendations which I want to repeat 
here, the most important of which is that the federal government 
introduce a specific law banning female genital mutilation in 
Canada.
<P>
	As you can see, a lot remains to be done to redress injustices 
against women. Therefore, I salute the courage and tenacity of 
the women who are fighting this battle in Quebec and Canada 
and I assure them of my support and solidarity.

<P>
	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to 
take part in this debate today. I want to begin by complimenting 
the movers of this motion from Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition. 
I want to say, however, that there are a few home truths that need 
to be reiterated on the whole question of gender equality and the 
topics that we are debating here today.
<P>
	First of all, I want to say that in this party on this side of the 
House there is a history of feminism. I speak that word proudly 
and loudly, again and again. I think of members of this House 
such as the Deputy Prime Minister, such as the Secretary of State 
for the Status of Women, such as the Minister of Natural 
Resources.
<P>
	I think of members such as the hon. member for Ottawa West, 
the member for Nepean, former members such as the member 
for South West Nova who was here today. I think of the former 
member for St. Paul, Aideen Nicholson, who was here visiting 
with us today on International Women's Day. I think back to the 
first woman Liberal to sit around the cabinet table, the Hon. 
Judy LaMarsh, who gives her name to a fund that raises money 
for women who run for public office in our party.
<P>
	I am proud of the tradition of feminism in the Liberal Party. I 
am proud of the women I have been fortunate enough to sit with 
in the House for nearly the last six years. I am proud of the new 
female members who have joined us this time. I am also proud of 
my male colleagues, but today is a day to celebrate women and I 
want to celebrate women. Women have not had a whole lot to 
celebrate. The fact that we are making some small 
breakthroughs should not, for even the shortest period of time, 
allow anyone to stand in the House and suggest that the status of 
women in this country has achieved equality because it has not.
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	There are a number of us fortunate enough to be here today 
who because of accidents at birth, hard work and education have 
managed to make it here. There are thousands, millions of 
women in the country who suffer every single day from abuse, 
from poverty, from fear, from cold, from hunger, from things 
that we should not accept. Every one of us, of whatever political 
stripe, bears a responsibility for the fact that in a country like 
Canada in the last decade of the 20th century, that is still 
happening.
<P>
	Equality will not exist until women can be free from fear; in 
their own homes, in their neighbourhoods, in parking garages, in 
the streets and in malls. Women are dying in those places. 
Women are being abused, and beaten, and hurt, and left for dead. 
There is an epidemic of violence against women that is beyond 
the level of tolerance in a civilized country.
<P>
	I heard the hon. member across the way-I am sorry I forget 
her riding, but I know her spirit on this-speak eloquently about 
Bosnia earlier today. Women in Bosnia are being raped and 
beaten and degraded on a daily basis, but so are women in 
Canada, so are women in the United States, so are women in 
Britain and the European countries. It is a world-wide epidemic 
and we are not immune.
<P>
	It is a number of years-and thank God it will probably never 
happen again-since men in this Chamber laughed when an hon. 
member brought up the question of violence against women. 
They laughed. I remember that. I suspect you remember it too, 
Mr. Speaker. I was not here at the time but I think that perhaps 
some of the reason for that laughter may have been nervous 
tension. It may have been, I hope, a total misunderstanding of 
the situation. That is what I as a feminist and as a member of 
Parliament and as a woman  think is at the root of the problem; a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2011"> 2011 </A></B>
<P>
lack of comprehension by some men and some women. It is a 
lack of comprehension.
<P>
	For many good people of both sexes the idea of the abuse of 
women, violence against women, sexual harassment, sexual 
discrimination, all of the things that women deal with, if it does 
not come up and face you, or your wife, or your daughter or your 
sister on a daily basis, then perhaps it is hard to understand. It is 
hard to know that it takes place.
<P>
	Let each and every one of us who are women in this House tell 
you that you must begin to understand it because it is there. It is 
your responsibility, each and every one of you, through you, Mr. 
Speaker, to do something about it, not to merely mouth 
platitudes, not to merely say something like: ``Well, it can't be 
true that we should have more women because men can't 
represent women or women can't represent men'', or some such 
balderdash which begs the question.
<P>
	Until we have a significant, and by significant I means upward 
of 50 per cent of women in all the legislatures in the country, we 
do not have true representation. It does not mean that a man 
cannot represent a woman or a woman cannot represent a man. It 
means that the way our society reacts is that if women are not 
there in sufficient numbers, then what is essentially a male 
patriarchal society decides they are not to be listened to in any 
louder a tone than their proportional representation allows.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	That is not happening by accident. That is not happening 
because the women who sit in the House in all three parties want 
it to happen. It is happening because of the way all of us have 
been brought up. It is happening because of the way life has 
evolved to this point in the latter part of the 20th century.
<P>
	It does not mean that we put up with it, and it does not mean 
that we accept it as the kind of situation that Canadians and those 
people who we all represent feel is correct.
<P>
	Men can represent women and do on both sides of the House. 
Women can represent men and do on both sides of the House. 
But until all of us take very seriously the whole question of 
gender inequality, then those who do not take the question 
seriously, those who do not comprehend it viscerally, are not 
representing their constituents, male and female, to the very 
best of their knowledge and ability. That is what every one of us 
wants to do. We want to represent the people who put us here and 
even the people who voted against us.
<P>
	The question of pay equity, the question of employment 
equity, the question of equality before the law, the question of 
freedom from fear, freedom from violence, are so basic that 
when I hear them discussed as debatable issues, if you will, I 
become very angry. That may have shown itself from time to 
time both in the House and outside once or twice.
<P>
	The other day I was having lunch in my riding with a woman 
activist who happens to be black. We were discussing an article 
in a national magazine about racism and sexism. I said to her 
that a young black woman activist in the United States said that 
sexism made her angry but that racism enraged her. My friend 
said that put it about as well as she had ever heard it. She said 
that is how she felt. As a feminist, as a black woman, sexism 
makes her angry but racism enrages her. I understand that too 
but you take your battles and I guess you apportion your 
passions where best you can fit your own beliefs.
<P>
	We can all understand to some degree another person's pain 
but I cannot truly understand, or truly experience, 
anti-Semitism or racism, at least in the context in which we 
know it in this country. I can and have and continue to 
experience sexism.
<P>
	The other <I>isms</I>, if you will, make me very angry but I guess for 
me the most visceral is still sexism and sexism enrages me. It 
enrages me because I know the abilities, the hard work, the 
dedication of so many women who are voiceless; the women 
who raise their children, run the volunteer organizations, the 
churches, the PTAs, the home and school associations, the 
United Way, the volunteer groups all across the country. Yet all 
of them to some degree walk out of those volunteer offices and 
suffer from discrimination in the workplace. Almost all of them 
will suffer from discrimination in the workplace of one kind or 
another. Over 50 per cent of them will experience some form of 
violence, and 25 per cent of them will experience significant 
violent behaviour, usually more than once in their lifetimes.
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	We have a culture in this country of blaming the victim. We 
have a culture in this country of wanting to sweep it under the 
rug. We have a culture in this country of saying it is not as 
serious, it did not happen, it could have been avoided if she had 
behaved in a different way.
<P>
	As with almost every evil under the sun, it is rooted in fear. 
For some it is a fear of sharing power, for others it is a fear of job 
loss, for a third group it is a fear of seeming to lose face, if you 
will, in the power structure that is the family, as wonderful an 
institution as it may be. In some the power structure becomes the 
answer as opposed to the loving family that all of us believe in so 
strongly.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2012"> 2012 </A></B>
<P>
	Essentially what we are discussing today is an issue of 
fairness. What makes me so angry, what enrages me so much, is 
that sexism, discrimination against women, is unfair and a 
waste. It is a waste of talent, a waste of ability, and a waste of 
women power that could be put to work to make this country so 
much more than it is today.
<P>
	I have been talking about this a lot in the last couple of weeks 
to journalists, student groups and young people across my riding 
and in other parts of the country. I have talked about the fact that 
the increase in the number of women in this House has made it a 
different Parliament. It is a different Parliament for a whole 
variety of reasons and I have talked about a certain joie de vivre 
among the women, certainly in my caucus, but I feel it across the 
way as well. We have reached the numbers if you will, not 
sufficient by any means, but we have reached at least a level 
where I believe, Madam Speaker-and may I compliment you 
on your first Question Period-that we have passed at least the 
level of tokenism. It is still not enough, we still are not 
representative, but we have passed the level of tokenism.
<P>
	It was particularly edifying today to see you in the chair, to 
see all women at the table, with no disrespect to the gentlemen 
who occupy those seats right now, and to note that our pages in 
front of the Speaker's chair were for the most part all female 
during Question Period. It was interesting to note that with the 
exception of one token gentleman on the government side, the 
questioners on the opposition side and on our side were female.
<P>
	Some people will say that is not necessary, or why do you 
want to do that, or why do you only do that on International 
Women's Day. I say, Madam Speaker, that we do that kind of 
thing because symbols are very important. It is important 
symbolically that women stand up on this day and speak for each 
other in support of those things that matter to us. We know they 
matter to men as well. But it is also important that we stand and 
speak in our own voices without the necessity of speaking 
through our male colleagues. It is important that young 
people-and there were a number of little sisters in the House of 
Commons today who were shadowing many of the women 
MPs-see women use their voices on a whole variety of issues, 
economic and social, today. Each one of us bears the 
responsibility of communicating to the young women of this 
country that this Chamber is their place too.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	Someone once told me that she did not get involved in politics 
because it was not a very ladylike occupation. I agree that it is 
not very ladylike. I guess I am fairly glad it is not.
<P>
	I heard a laugh over there. Thank you. I am not quite sure what 
it means but I can hazard a guess.
<P>
	<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I support you, Mary.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> Thank you. We were born on the same day. That 
is why he does that.
<P>
	The importance of politics not being ladylike is that it must be 
shown, however, that it is not unwomanly. This House is the 
place for women. It is the place for as many women who have the 
desire, the nerve and the ability to get here.
<P>
	It is also important to note that it is the place for women who 
hold a diversity of views. That is right also. Just as every man in 
this House does not believe the same way as every other on a 
variety of issues, neither does every woman and neither should 
every woman.
<P>
	There are members on the opposite side with whom I disagree 
most vociferously on a variety of issues. There are members on 
the opposite side with whom I might agree just as vociferously 
on certain other issues. The point is that this is the House of our 
nation's debate and the voices of women must be heard here and 
they must be heard as strongly and as passionately and as 
frequently as the voices of men.
<P>
	If we do not pay more than lip service to this, if we do not 
ensure that the pathways are open for women to get to this 
House, then we are equally not making sure that the pathways 
for women are open in all occupations and professions in this 
country. The bottom line is that is what the resolution we are 
speaking to is about.
<P>
	I opened my remarks by saying that I was very proud of 
women I have served with and continue to serve with in this 
House. I am proud of my party's record on the status of women. 
Most of all, I am proud of what we are going to do in a whole 
variety of areas. I am proud of the blueprints in the speech from 
the throne and in the budget. I am proud that my colleagues were 
tough enough to make the hard decisions so that this country will 
continue but it will also thrive and flourish because of policies.
<P>
	I am most proud because I know that on this side of the House 
with the wealth of support for women we will continue to ensure 
that women are full partners because anything less is simply 
unacceptable.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I appreciate the comments of the hon. member 
opposite. I was interested in her comments regarding the 
involvement of more women in the House and the feeling of our 
population, especially the female side, that they could 
effectively operate within the atmosphere of this House.
<P>
	I was involved with my party in the nomination process and in 
the election process perhaps more than some others. I am happy 
to report that the Reform Party was more successful in electing 
their women candidates than they were their men candidates, if 
one looks at the proportion nominated and the proportion 
elected.
<P>
	I was also involved with the recruitment of candidates. We 
certainly encouraged women to seek a nomination in our party.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2013"> 2013 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1635 ) </B>
<P>
	I found that one of the factors that made women most hesitant 
in seeking nominations for election to Parliament was the 
dignity and decorum of the House itself. The member alluded to 
the fact that perhaps the atmosphere was unladylike but that one 
could be womanly in the House.
<P>
	I found that many outstanding women candidates were very 
reluctant to place themselves in a position where they would be 
heckled, cat-called and the like in this Chamber. They felt that 
they would rather assist and work for their country in other 
avenues.
<P>
	I wonder what the hon. member opposite would give me by 
way of suggestion as to how we could improve the decorum of 
the House so that we could reduce the number of cat calls. I 
understand it is much better in this Parliament than it was the 
last Parliament.
<P>
	I know sitting on the opposition side we have been subjected 
on occasions to a lot of hoots and hollering that even as a man I 
find objectionable. I have heard from many women who also 
find that atmosphere to be very objectionable. It has been a 
hindrance to their involvement in politics.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
question.
<P>
	Actually and this is only half in jest, wholly in earnest one of 
the best things that we did for improving the tenor and behaviour 
in the House was electing a new government
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> Okay, a little response here from these benches. 
Obviously the hon. member for Kingston and the Islands is not 
paying attention.
<P>
	Very seriously, there were some very serious breaches in the 
last House, no question. I will not demean the honour of this 
House by repeating them but most of the members know the 
incidents that I refer to.
<P>
	There were numerous sexist slurs and at least one very totally 
unacceptable racial slur. It gave rise to a committee that sat in 
the last Parliament and dealt with the questions of racism and 
sexism. I am extremely hopeful that the recommendations of 
that committee will be coming forward as part of a reform 
package in the House of Commons.
<P>
	I would like to make another point because I am a very strong 
believer in the value of debate, of reasonable but not necessarily 
totally cool debate. There is a place for passion in the 
deliberations of a nation. If a member on the opposite side 
makes me angry, I should display that anger, always within the 
bounds of the decorum that this House deserves and needs.
<P>
	I recall my good friend and colleague, the hon. Parliamentary 
Secretary to the President of the Treasury Board, saying at one 
point in the last House that he would take any insult as long as it 
was gender and race neutral. There is a tradition coming down to 
us from the Mother of Parliaments and the tradition in this 
House of salient debate, of back and forth between members that 
can add to the whole tenor of the debate if you will. I agree with 
the hon. member that cat calls and what I can only call dumb 
stuff is not part of that.
<P>
	However I would not for an instant want to see us so bland that 
we would not respond with fairly strong language, not insulting, 
never racist, never sexist, never pejorative, but there is a place 
for saying that one thinks that is a pretty dumb thing to say and 
that that member is going to therefore say it is a pretty dumb 
thing to say. Maybe the word dumb is unparliamentary. I am not 
certain.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> No, it is not.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> Thank you. Pious windbag-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Oh no. That's not good.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> That is not good. I am just using these as 
examples.
<P>
	I would not want us to totally iron out our debate if you would. 
There is a place for the proper use of the English and the French 
languages in all their majesty in this House with their use of 
insult as well. I think there is a place for that.
<P>
<B>(1640 ) </B>
<P>
	With regard to recruiting women, I was very involved in that 
process in my party. I am delighted that we were so successful. I 
think that the language was certainly part of what would have 
precluded many women from thinking that they would run. 
However, there is more to it than that. There is more to this being 
user friendly for women than just the language in the House of 
Commons.
<P>
	Sometimes a devastating personal attack can take place in this 
Chamber with language that one could use in the pulpit of any 
church in this land. It is not merely what is said. It is how it is 
said, who is saying it and how it is delivered. I guess I would say 
that the women who sit in this House, be they Liberal, Bloc, 
Reform or independent, are probably not frail flowers in the 
long run. I would suggest to members that any one of us on either 
side of the House could take anything thrown at us and probably 
lob it back with pretty good response.
<P>
	That is not what we should be about here. However, women 
have to understand that it is incumbent upon them to be here to 
ensure that the level of debate stays high and does not pander to 
the kind of thing that we are talking about. If they do not come at 
all it is never going to happen.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
appreciate this opportunity to speak on International Women's 
Day to a motion by my hon. colleague to the right which reflects 
the decidedly left wing politics of Her Majesty's Official 
Opposition. Despite the good wording of this motion and the 
good intentions of my colleague, the implications of this 
statement in public policy are not entirely positive.
<P>
	For too long in this country debates over equal rights have 
been confused with demands for special treatment. We have 
seen emerge a special language of rights, a language which uses 
the vocabulary of rights along with the good intentions of those 
who began Canada's tradition of human rights, to further narrow 
political interests.
<P>
	While the intentions of people like my hon. colleague may be 
good, the road to hell is paved with good intentions. The words 
rights and equality have been stripped of their old meanings. 
Whereas one used to know that a right had been violated when, 
for example, one was put in jail without cause, now many feel 
that a right has been violated when two people with different 
resumés, different lifestyles or different biologies do not earn 
exactly the same income. Whereas the right of equality used to 
mean the right to be subject to the same laws as, for example, 
members of Parliament, now the right of equal treatment is 
taken to mean that each Canadian should receive exactly the 
same amount of government subsidizing.
<P>
<B>(1645 ) </B>
<P>
	While intentions of the social planners and the lobbyists who 
push for changes in our political vocabulary and the alteration of 
our political traditions do on the surface display a genuine 
commitment to the common good, the net effect of their 
political actions are limiting of freedom, the strangling of 
private initiative and an attack on the very diversity that is 
cherished and demanded by the left.
<P>
	A first broad reading of this motion reveals only a vague 
purpose. What one needs to do is look at each demand that this 
motion makes and examine what the real impact of these 
demands would be. First, the motion demands that this 
government recognize the principle of economic equality. If we 
accept that men and women must achieve perfect economic 
parity, then we have moved beyond equality of opportunity and 
into equality of result. This motion goes beyond equality of 
opportunity since equality of opportunity and equality under the 
law is guaranteed by the charter and by Canada's common law 
tradition.
<P>
	That is not good enough for some. For some equality of 
opportunity really means that minorities, including women, 
despite the fact that women account for more than 50 per cent of 
the population, are being systematically singled out and are 
being restricted from achieving their fullest potentials.
<P>
	Who is perpetrating this oppression? As usual white males are 
the culprits of choice. It is said that white males are 
institutionally advantaged and are maintaining their advantage 
in the market by excluding others. It is claimed that government 
programs are being unfair to minorities by not adequately 
dividing up the pie of federal revenues in a way that ensures the 
maximum equality of as many people as possible, especially 
women and visible minorities.
<P>
	Do these all boy networks exist? Perhaps, but so do female 
networks and minority networks. Is there a failure of social 
programs to redistribute wealth in a manner that creates total 
equality of condition? Yes, and that is as it should be. Social 
programs were created to act as social safety nets and nothing 
more. When government makes a decision to change the mission 
of its programs from safety nets to tools of social change then we 
have moved away from democracy, given up freedom and 
sacrificed liberty for the sake of pie in the sky equality.
<P>
	Is this the price we want to pay for economic equality? I do not 
think so and I am confident that the vast majority of Canadians 
do not think so. I am just as sure that there is a contingent of very 
active, very vocal and very misguided lobbyists and politicians 
for whom equality of opportunity is not enough. Those people 
have had their perceptions of reality so clouded by ideology that 
they cannot see beyond the trees of good sounding intentions 
and into the forest of an authoritarian welfare state.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2015"> 2015 </A></B>
<P>
	Next, this motion asks government to ensure equality of 
employment, salary and living conditions. How exactly can 
government achieve such noble sounding goals? I am sure the 
sponsor of this motion has a plan of action in mind and this 
plan of action undoubtedly includes a redistribution of wealth, 
hiring practices that discriminate against one group to make up 
for the alleged discrimination of another.
<P>
	Government could legislate pay scales. Government could 
pass a law requiring free housing to be made available for all 
women. Would these measures work? Would they achieve 
equality? Yes, in a way. For if government were to engage in this 
kind of social and economic engineering the result would be a 
form of equality. We would be equally burdened by poverty as 
government saps the initiative of entrepreneurs and the capital 
of business. We would be equally deprived of liberty as 
government regulates more and more into our lives. We would 
be free from having to make moral and responsible decisions for 
ourselves as government in its wisdom takes that decision 
making power away from us.
<P>
<B>(1650 ) </B>
<P>
	While it may not be apparent to my colleague in Her 
Majesty's Loyal Opposition, there is an alternative to the 
equality that comes from massive intervention in all areas of 
human endeavour. The alternative is equality under the law, 
equality that comes from equal protection by government from 
true threats to personal achievement and success.
<P>
	Canada used to be committed to this vision of equality. 
Canada used to be a nation in which all individuals were free to 
participate in the workforce, to succeed economically, to start 
and develop a strong family unit and enjoy the security, 
freedoms and equality that come from a good job that can 
support a strong and intact family.
<P>
	That vision became unacceptable to the intellectual and 
political elite in Canada. For the last 20-odd years our elite have 
been more interested in pushing an agenda of radical change 
than an agenda for preservation of what works.
<P>
	An example of what works is creating equality under the law 
by ensuring that the criminal justice system is able to effectively 
protect all people. What use is it to demand the right to equal pay 
when women are afraid to walk the streets alone? What good is it 
to try to create equality in housing when women often live in 
fear of abusive partners?
<P>
	It seems to me that our priorities have become very confused 
indeed. Further, Canadians are increasingly becoming aware of 
the inability of government to take over the roles that have been 
traditionally played by the family. Government, as a result of the 
very initiatives that are proposed in this motion, has tried to 
adopt the role of primary parent, primary guardian of children 
and even principal breadwinner for many families.
<P>
	What has come of this?-an over burdened and bloated 
government, children who are neglected in government 
subsidized day care rather than being taken care of by parents.
<P>
	Parents today often have to leave their children with 
caretakers because taxes take so large a bite out of salaries that 
one pay cheque is no longer enough to support the in home care 
of children by a parent.
<P>
	Again, there is a degree of equality being forced upon us here, 
an equality of mediocrity, an equality of fear that our justice-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am afraid the 
member's time has expired.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration):</B> Madam Speaker, I have a 
reality check that I would like to bring in. It may well be that a 
lot of women, and I have said it myself and I could not agree 
with the hon. member more, are unsafe in their houses.
<P>
	That does not mean they should live in houses that are unsafe 
in and of themselves. It does not mean that we should merely fix 
one problem to the exclusion of another. It does not mean that if 
we solve crime in the streets we go on to solving the problems of 
poor housing.
<P>
	One of the difficulties of governance is trying to solve more 
than one problem at a time, lest as we throw out the bath water 
we are also throwing out the baby.
<P>
	Those of us on this side of the House, those of us who call 
ourselves feminists, are also proud to call ourselves people who 
believe in families. I have a family. Most of us have. I love my 
family and I believe deeply and passionately in the family.
<P>
	I have another reality check. This may come as an 
overwhelming surprise to some people. Women work because 
they want to. They work because they like to, because it gives 
them personal satisfaction. They work because they often need a 
second pay cheque but one can be a working woman and be a 
good mother.
<P>
	My father had the bad grace to die when I was seven years old 
and my mother went out to work to support the family which 
would probably be acceptable in certain circumstances. Let me 
say very strongly that my mother, who was a very good mother, 
loved her job. She enjoyed going out and working. God knows 
her only child grew up to be a member of Parliament which in 
some cases may be tantamount to ending up in jail but she 
thought it was a fairly successful resolution to the bringing up of 
her only child.
<P>
	Most of my friends, practically all of my closest friends, 
classmates, women I went to school with, both work and have 
children. Their children, contrary to the opinion of some people, 
are not on crack cocaine or robbing stores or doing any of these 
things. One of them is taking a course in western civilization at 
the Sorbonne. Another one is in first year medical school and is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2016"> 2016 </A></B>
<P>
also holding down one of the first SSHRC grants ever to be  
given to a young student. His mother worked from the time he 
was an infant.
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
	Their name is legion, the mothers and children in this country.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, I believe you raised four sons. My God, I 
believe you also went out to work.
<P>
	It is time we rid the myth that working mothers are 
responsible for the social problems in this country. Right now 
the vast majority of women, mothers of families, work because 
they have to to maintain a certain standard. That is true. They do 
not work for the colour televisions and the trips to Hawaii, they 
work to make sure that their families have the standard of living 
they deserve.
<P>
	Every woman has the right to self-fulfillment. She has the 
right to go out and earn a living. She has a responsibility and it is 
usually shared with the father of those children, if he happened 
to stick around. In most cases they do stick around and go to 
work as well and they do good jobs.
<P>
	I am told my time is up and I hope that this will be the last paid 
political announcement from this side.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hanger:</B> Madam Speaker, I believe that mothers should 
have a choice. I never said that they should not. They should 
have a choice to work. I also believe they should have a choice to 
remain in the home. I believe that opportunity is rapidly 
diminishing. I think this is where the government comes in. Its 
intended expenditure over the next years is going to put greater 
demands on the family, on mothers and on fathers. It is here that 
I believe the choice is going to be lost.
<P>
	In reply to this equality balance, I believe that it is 
diminishing whether we like it or not. Governments should 
quickly do something about it and can do something about it in 
this Parliament.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North):</B> Madam Speaker, 
this is a very interesting debate and I congratulate the members 
of the Official Opposition for raising these issues. They are very 
important to society and should be properly examined. 
Sometimes they generate more heat than light, but I believe the 
quality of the debate today was very good.
<P>
	I think the principle we are talking about today is important, 
one of equity and equality. It is something clearly that many 
members of this House, probably all members of this House, 
believe in very passionately and very fundamentally. I think it is 
sometimes in the interpretation of how this can be delivered that 
we have different ideas and legitimately so.
<P>
	The Reform Party has proposed an amendment or an addition 
to the motion before us. Measures to support the desired 
outcomes that are set forth in this motion will be provided, will 
be delivered through providing equality of opportunity without 
resorting to gender discrimination. I believe that is an issue 
worth thinking about and worth debating.
<P>
	The Reform Party does advocate equality of all Canadians 
regardless of gender. It also supports equality of opportunity 
without demanding equality of outcome. These are difficult 
concepts sometimes because they might seem mutually 
exclusive.
<P>
	As Canadians we need to decide what kinds of personal 
choices and freedoms will play a role in what decisions and 
policies we put in place.
<P>
<B>(1700 ) </B>
<P>
	Individuals have the right to make choices for themselves. It 
enhances their dignity. It is sad that many men, women and 
children in our society who do not have the same freedom of 
choice live in very disadvantaged conditions. When these 
disadvantaged conditions are predicated solely on gender, age or 
ethnic and linguistic background, it is something we ought not to 
tolerate. Those kinds of distinctions should not determine the 
choices or opportunities we have.
<P>
	Sometimes we simply do not make good choices. It has 
nothing to do with gender or any other kind of background. Our 
own involvement in life if you will has brought about those 
results. I sometimes wonder whether those choices should be 
corrected and compensated by the hard work and money of other 
people simply because those making the choices might happen 
to be women or in some other category seen to be disadvantaged.
<P>
	We should help those people who need it, those who are truly 
unable to help themselves or have suffered misfortune. That has 
been a product of civilized society for centuries. However we 
must be careful in asking for special protection or special 
consideration based on things like gender. It could amount to an 
admission of inability to succeed on a level playing field with 
other members of society, to make good choices, to advance 
through competence, diligence and hard work, experience, 
learning and correcting our mistakes.
<P>
	It is unfair to women to say they somehow cannot compete on 
that level. It is unfair to say that because of that they must be 
provided with extra money because someone has decided what 
they are doing is just as valuable as what a higher paid individual 
is doing, or someone has decided they must be given a particular 
level of housing through public contributions. It is untrue that 
women in this society through their own competence, ability and 
hard work are unable to provide these things for themselves and 
their families.
<P>
	There may be issues that society needs to work on to make 
sure that women are not unfairly disadvantaged. One example is 
a woman being left with child care responsibilities when the 
other parent sails off into the  wild blue yonder without carrying 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2017"> 2017 </A></B>
<P>
those responsibilities. However, that is far different from setting 
artificial standards and saying that no matter what you do, no 
matter what your level of effort, no matter what your level of 
input, no matter what choices you make, other people are 
responsible for giving you those things. That is unfair and 
unwise in our society.
<P>
	Others have mentioned Agnes Macphail, the first woman ever 
elected to Parliament. I have been reading some of her speeches. 
Like many women in this Chamber today, she certainly was no 
shrinking violet. She summed up her attitude toward the subject 
of today's debate with these words: ``I want for myself what I 
want for other women, absolute equality''. That to me says it all. 
Equality is not other people suggesting that women cannot make 
it on their own and therefore they have to be given a lift or a leg 
up any more than we would do for any other member of society. 
Yes, we should do that for people but not because they are 
women or because they are from a particular linguistic or 
cultural background but simply because we help each other as 
members of society.
<P>
<B>(1705) </B>
<P>
	When we look at today's amendment and our support for it, it 
is very important to establish a decision and a deliberate policy 
of not making gender discrimination. When we help members of 
society and when we decide the level of support we give to 
people, that decision must be based on need and not on other 
identifiable characteristics.
<P>
	We ought not to compartmentalize society into different 
groups and marginalize people based on physical 
characteristics. We should deal with the issues that affect and 
hurt us all, that cause us pain and dislocation and that have broad 
implications for everyone in society. We need to treat them as 
people issues, as issues that are important to us all.
<P>
	I urge this House to support the amendment we put forward.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Julian Reed (Halton-Peel):</B> Madam Speaker, I have 
listened to the last three debates with great interest.
<P>
	I heard the passionate debate by the hon. member for Halifax 
pointing out that the struggle for equality and the struggle for 
the ability of women to freely make their decisions are not 
finished yet. I listened to the hon. member for Calgary Northeast 
whose vision of this motion seems to be that the socialist hordes 
are waiting outside the door ready to trample a civilized society. 
Of course, the most recent speaker tried to inject some fairness 
into the whole debate.
<P>
	I would like to tell a little story which exemplifies how slow 
this process has been over the years. I had the privilege of 
growing up in a household with a mother for whom equality was 
taken for granted. She was a modern language teacher educated 
in Paris during the 1920s when that was not supposed to happen. 
Her sister, my  aunt with whom I talked about an hour and a half 
ago is a retired anaesthetist.
<P>
	There was no question of income equality or gender 
discrimination. They were both at the top of their fields. They 
did what they did and were the very best at it. They were 
pioneers. The reason they achieved what they did was because 
their mother understood the importance of seeing they got an 
education to the utmost extent of their ability. They had the 
ability to make their own decisions freely and clearly then 
without being shackled by the things which are presently 
holding women back. That process has been very slow. If we do 
not make some kind of change or some kind of move we may be 
looking at the same kind of evolution 50 years from now.
<P>
	A motion like this does not develop a gathering of the socialist 
hordes. Rather it recognizes that women who are on the move 
need to have the freedom to make those decisions on their own. 
Hon. members will be able to relate to many situations right now 
of women who are precluded from deciding their futures on their 
own terms.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	Does the hon. member not agree with the necessity of being 
free to make decisions? Does she not agree that all women do not 
yet have that capability and that perhaps we in this House have 
some opportunity to advance their cause?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ablonczy:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
his comments. I believe we think in the same way. I would fight 
to the death for freedom of opportunity and to have equal respect 
with anybody in this House, in business, in the professions and 
in society. That is a fundamental entitlement to any individual.
<P>
	It is probably not true to say we all have complete freedom to 
make decisions. There are a lot of limits on the decisions we can 
make as individuals in this society. We have to recognize that 
and live with it. Gender or physical characteristics should not 
limit our freedom to make decisions.
<P>
	More than any other country Canada has tremendous 
freedoms and we should be proud of that. As women we have 
demonstrated we can contribute significantly in all levels of 
society on a level playing field. Abraham Lincoln said that if 
you have what it takes, people will take what you have. It is 
pretty clear in Canadian society we have a tremendous 
opportunity no matter what our gender is to bear the truth of that 
out.
<P>
	We must give people those chances and the results will speak 
for themselves.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Pat O'Brien (London-Middlesex):</B> Madam Speaker, 
first may I join the other members in congratulating you for 
presiding over Question Period for the first time today.
<P>
	On this International Women's Day it is my pleasure to stand 
proudly as a Canadian man and member of this House of 
Commons to support the opposition motion. After a couple of 
the recent speeches I hardly recognize the motion as was said 
earlier by one of my colleagues. What we are actually speaking 
to is:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House urge the government to recognize the principle of economic 
equality between women and men and to implement measures, in areas of federal 
jurisdiction, to guarantee women equity in employment, wages  and  living  
conditions.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The hon. member for Calgary North quoted a famous 
Canadian woman. The key word was equality and that is the key 
word in the motion. Yet we hear fears from members opposite 
particularly I am sad to say from certain members of the Reform 
Party.
<P>
	We hear fears about quotas and these artificial numbers that 
are going to be set up to guarantee women these opportunities. I 
do not read the word quota anywhere in the motion in front of us 
and I do not read it in the amendment proposed by the Reform 
Party.
<P>
	I share the view that frankly it seems some members opposite 
do not understand the motion before us. I do and I am going to be 
very pleased to support the motion when the opportunity comes.
<P>
	The hon. member for Calgary North mentioned that certain 
issues may have to be dealt with concerning equal opportunity 
for women. I would suggest the word to use is not ``may''. A 
number of problems still exist in our society that need to be 
addressed. I would like to take a few minutes to give an 
overview, as I see it, of the barriers that women face in 1994.
<P>
<B>(1715) </B>
<P>
	The biggest barrier is an attitudinal one. We can see this in the 
history of this country. During the Olympics we all very proudly 
recognized and applauded the efforts of Canadian women and 
men in winning a number of medals and in conducting 
themselves so wonderfully on the international athletic stage. 
We need look no further than the sport which attracts us so 
much, ice hockey, and the fact that for a long time it was seen as 
strictly a sport for men.
<P>
	I come from something of an athletic background. I cannot 
help but make that reference. Hockey was not for girls. It was 
thought to be too rough and too fast, which is nonsense. The 
fastest growing amateur sport today is ice hockey for women; 
for girls, young women, and women of all ages. I am sure that 
Madam Speaker is probably very adept on skates out on the 
canal, as I would like to try to experience myself. One needs go 
no further than that particular sport to know a myth has been 
debunked very effectively by Canadian women who have won 
world championships in hockey the past several years.
<P>
	Another major problem is that of behavioural discrimination. 
We have been taught too often that boys must be aggressive, 
tough and outgoing but girls must be passive, docile, ``ladylike'' 
and not get themselves dirty and be involved in aggressive 
activities, athletic or non-athletic. That is a very destructive 
attitude and it is one that as a parent I have done everything 
possible not to inculcate in my own three children, and my wife 
has been very supportive in that.
<P>
	The right to vote is worth reconsidering. It was not until 1918 
that women got the right to vote in federal elections. We heard 
earlier some members of the Bloc castigating the government 
for the fact that it is not doing enough to assist women. Sadly I 
have to recall for all members of the House that the last province 
to give women the right to vote was the province of Quebec. I 
know that province has come way since that time, as we all have, 
but I do not think there are a lot of lessons for the government to 
learn from members opposite, some of whom unfortunately 
appear to be a little ignorant of their history around women's 
issues and the right to vote.
<P>
	Before I was honoured with election to this House I was in the 
field of education. It is a historical fact, unfortunately, in 
Canada and in many countries that there has been significantly 
less encouragement of girls and women to pursue their 
education. All too often that has been sad reality.
<P>
	There has been the myth that young women could only pursue 
certain fields of study, that somehow they were not equipped to 
go into particular areas that were somehow reserved for men. It 
has been a very negative attitude and one that has been very 
limiting to women in Canadian history. Thank goodness it is fast 
finding its place in the reality ash heap where it belongs. It 
simply bears no semblance to truth.
<P>
	I would like to talk about employment opportunities for 
women. I recall there have been and still are unfortunately some 
very real barriers. We all know about the language referring to 
policeman and fireman. We are making very important strides in 
changing this kind of sexist language. As a city councillor I well 
remember in London, Ontario, just a few years ago supporting a 
motion to do away with the historic term ``alderman'' and to go 
with the more neutral term of ``councillor''. We heard the wails 
and the cries from some people that we could not change the 
historic term ``alderman'' and that somehow the heavens would 
fall down on us. That was silly. Now it is very commonly 
accepted and the more appropriate term is in place.
<P>
<B>(1720) </B>
<P>
	My municipality of London, Ontario very recently hired its 
first female firefighter. This is the appropriate term for such 
persons. We can see that firsts are being made every day in our 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2019"> 2019 </A></B>
<P>
society and they are a long time overdue. There are, not may be, 
real employment limitations still on women in our society today.
<P>
	What we need is a revolution in our attitudes as a Canadian 
society about what is the proper place of women. I am very 
pleased to have seen and heard reference to the statement that 
the proper place for women is in the House. I am sure everyone 
has seen that. It is under a picture of this Chamber. I applaud that 
and got a great kick out of it, as I am sure most men have. We 
know that women should have every opportunity and certainly 
have every ability to represent Canadians just as well as any 
other person. It should not be a factor of gender, race, religion, et 
cetera. Very slowly we are coming around to some of the 
attitudinal changes that are needed.
<P>
	It is a sad reality that women are too often working only in 
clerical, sales and service jobs. In 1991 over 50 per cent of 
working women were in these jobs, whereas for men that figure 
was only 30 per cent.
<P>
	Again I say it is not that there may be limitations on equal 
opportunity employment for women. Anyone who looks at the 
reality knows there are limitations that have to be addressed and 
finally are being addressed. The government intends to move 
forward very aggressively in that regard.
<P>
	I am sure we all accept that by and large women bear much 
more the responsibility for the Canadian family. I well recall my 
own mother being the backbone of our family. I pay tribute to 
her for her love, courage and support of our family over the 
years. My wife shoulders more responsibility for our family 
than I do. She is making a sacrifice as many of the spouses of 
people in this House today are, male and female spouses both.
<P>
	In my case, my wife is making a significant sacrifice and is 
taking on greater responsibility so I can have the opportunity 
and the privilege of serving the people of London-Middlesex 
in the House of Commons. I thank her for that and I appreciate 
the sacrifice. This is normally the role that women find 
themselves in. The sacrifices in the interests of the family far 
more often come from women than men. That ought not be made 
light of. It ought to be acknowledged as a reality and ought to be 
appreciated for what it is.
<P>
	My wife and I have two sons and one daughter and it is very 
important to us that they be treated equally and encouraged to 
live their lives fully with no restraints based on gender for any of 
them. I heard hon. members earlier today express that was their 
experience and I applaud that. It is certainly the experience that 
we were trying to make sure our children live. However, all too 
often it is not the Canadian experience and we have to do more in 
that regard.
<P>
	I come also from a municipal councillor background, as I 
mentioned earlier, and it is a sad fact that single parent families, 
by and large, are led by women. In 1991, 62 per cent of 
women-led families were below the poverty line. That is an 
incredible number, an unacceptable number and it has to change.
<P>
	One need only look at the media to recognize that they fall far 
short of the mark in trying to make an attitudinal shift toward 
this issue. There is little interest shown in the activities of 
women in the media. I well remember many times, women's 
athletic teams complaining that they were not getting equal 
coverage. All too often I recall women councillors on city 
council feeling that they were somehow not receiving fair 
treatment. These were not exaggerations; you really had to 
support what they were saying because the reality was there for 
all to see.
<P>
<B>(1725) </B>
<P>
	On the issue of pay equity, women receive on average 72 per 
cent of what men earn. I would think that anyone who is fixated 
on financial matters, as my colleagues from the Reform Party 
are, and that is not necessarily a bad thing, how can they then not 
realize there is a pay equity problem is beyond me. From some 
of the comments I heard earlier it seems to be getting by some of 
the members, and I just do not understand how it can.
<P>
	The issue of violence against women is a huge problem in the 
country today. The issues of family violence and sadistic 
pornography need to be addressed now.
<P>
	When Canadian women cannot feel as safe as men on the 
streets, then obviously there is a problem. When your feeling of 
safety and your real safety is different because you are a woman, 
it is a national problem that needs to be recognized as such and 
should be addressed.
<P>
	The question of political leadership has been raised several 
times by previous speakers. I fully support the fact that we will 
see more women as members of Parliament over the next few 
years. It is a very positive step that we have record numbers of 
women in the House right now. Our party has done everything it 
possibly can to ensure it takes place.
<P>
	Only by aggressive action are we going to address these 
issues. I am proud, as a Liberal member of Parliament, to be a 
member of a party that appointed the first woman Speaker to the 
very seat that you occupy now, Madam Speaker. The first 
woman Governor General, the same woman, the Right Hon. Jean 
Sauvé was appointed to that position by a Liberal government. 
The same Right Hon. Madam Sauvé is being honoured today, as 
we all know, by the issuing of a Canadian stamp in her honour.
<P>
	Many, if not most, of the first actions taken by governments in 
Canada to advance the cause of women I am proud to say were 
taken by Liberal governments. On our side of the House today 
we see the Deputy Prime Minister several cabinet ministers who 
are women.
<P>
	Strides have been made, but further change will only be made 
by aggressive action by political parties and all Canadians who 
sincerely believe that this issue has to be addressed, that it is not 
going to go away and solve itself. As was mentioned earlier, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2020"> 2020 </A></B>
<P>
fully 50 per cent of appointments by the Liberal government 
since the election to various positions have been appointments 
of women.
<P>
	It is important we encourage women of all ages to reject limits 
on their full and equal participation in our society, including 
governments, maybe especially governments. Canadians of all 
races have found out that the way to stop discrimination is by 
getting hold of the levers of power. My background is Irish 
Canadian and Irish immigrants to Canada found that out. 
Immigrant groups throughout our history have learned that 
lesson: You stop discrimination by becoming those who make 
the laws. Women are learning that lesson and I applaud that. I 
hope to see far more than 18 per cent of members of Parliament 
as women MPs some time in the near future.
<P>
	I am pleased that one of the members of Parliament is part of 
the London, Ontario Liberal MP team, the member for London 
West. It is important that a full co-operative effort be made by 
men and women members on all sides of the House to work 
together to improve the decorum of the House, which I think is 
better but certainly could still be improved. In the various 
committees and in all the responsibilities of a member of 
Parliament it is very important that a teamwork approach be 
taken and that women members be fully included as equal 
partners because they are. They have been equally elected, they 
are equally talented and able, and it is very important we 
conduct ourselves in that way.
<P>
	I can only relate to my own experience in 13 years of 
municipal government. Some of my best supporters and workers 
in campaigns were women. It has been my pleasure to encourage 
and help several women to run for office in London and I intend 
to do that again this fall when our municipal elections are held in 
Ontario.
<P>
<B>(1730) </B>
<P>
	It is important that we realize that politics and government is 
not a profession somehow limited to men. No profession should 
somehow be reserved for men. Unfortunately, that still is the 
case in the minds of many Canadians.
<P>
	Our Liberal red book has made important commitments and 
our government has started to see these through already; the 
need to ensure equal opportunity for women, a strenghthening of 
the employment equity act, the need to do more in the area of 
research for women's health care. It is a fact that women's health 
care has been short-changed in funding. The red book addresses 
that need and the government will see that commitment through. 
There is a need to do more in the area of child care, a need to do 
more in the area of small business where women are twice as 
successful as men. That is very important. These are all red book 
commitments that I am proud to say this government will 
certainly see through to fruition.
<P>
	In closing, I say that we need some changes and we need them 
now. We need changes in societal attitudes. We need changes in 
law. We need changes in government. There are problems and 
we must find the solutions. I want my daughter and all Canadian 
young women to have every opportunity just the same as my two 
sons, the same opportunity to pursue whatever career they want 
in this country with no restrictions, no limitations. Only then 
will we really fully realize our potential as a nation.

	<B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval-Centre):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I listened carefully to my hon. colleague who 
provided a detailed presentation of the many problems faced by 
women. I was surprised to hear him say, in reference to some of 
my colleagues' remarks, that this government did not have to 
take any advice from the Official Opposition, if I understood 
correctly, since Quebec was the last province to enfranchise 
women. I want to remind my hon. colleague that the right to 
vote, both in Canada and in Quebec, was won by women who 
valiantly fought for it and that it was men who granted that right.
<P>
	Of course, in those days, Quebec was going through what 
historians called the dark ages, but I want to point out that since 
1960, since the quiet revolution, Quebec has progressed by leaps 
and bounds, to the extent that impartial, and often enlightened, 
observers recognize in Quebec a leader in many areas.
<P>
	Since today is International Women's Day, let me highlight a 
few measures in favour of women, such as the lump sum 
payment at birth, the preventive withdrawal of pregnant women 
from the workplace, and the right for these women to receive 
their salary in the meantime. There are many more measures I 
could tell my colleagues about, but I am sure that other members 
have comments to make. So, in conclusion, I would add that the 
day Quebec holds the reins of its destiny, women there will 
receive their faire share in accordance with their contribution to 
society.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Madam Speaker, I did not hear a question but I 
still appreciate the hon. member's comments. I am glad that I 
was correct and I am sure I was in relating the fact that 
unfortunately Quebec gave the provincial vote last to women. I 
did not say that as any kind of a condemnation of Quebec. I am 
very fond of visiting Quebec. I have many Quebecers as friends 
and I hope to always be able to go to Quebec. It is a very lovely 
part of this great country we call Canada.
<P>
	I am pleased that there have been strides made in Quebec as 
there have been in other provinces.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2021"> 2021 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1735 ) </B>
<P>
	My point is that when one points a finger, as unfortunately a 
member of the Bloc did a little earlier in the debate, that is not 
being careful to regard the whole scope of our history. We 
should be a little more sensitive to the fact that all parts of 
Canada have been negligent in this regard. All parts of Canada 
are moving forward. I am pleased that Quebec is as well.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> Madam Speaker, this 
indeed has been a very long day. I have sat here for many hours 
listening to this debate. I have been quite impressed on all 
counts and the hon. member's comments are well received by 
myself.
<P>
	I wish to ask the hon. member a specific question regarding 
pay equity. I stand here proudly as a humanist. I am not a 
feminist. In that view I present this question to the hon. member.
<P>
	The whole pay equity issue is tied to the fundamental debate 
behind equal opportunity of employment. I cannot understand 
how we can separate the pay equity issue from several things, 
and I am going to mention these to the hon. member. Then I am 
going to ask how the hon. member can exclude these 
expectations from the whole concept of pay equity.
<P>
	Our party, the Reform Party, believes that the improvement of 
education is a key to accessing an employment opportunity. One 
does this by giving greater priority to the development of skills, 
particularly those that provide for future job flexibility. That is 
my first point.
<P>
	My second point is on the emphasis of individual 
achievement. Employers must treat people, that is men and 
women, as individuals in all phases of the recruitment process 
based on their merit, skills, capacities, and experience in order 
to fulfil a job function. It cannot be on the basis of one's gender.
<P>
	I will leave with that and I ask the hon. member to respond.
<P>
	<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Madam Speaker, the hon. member is making 
the point that there ought not to be artificial quotas imposed in 
order to level the playing field, if you will. I can support that.
<P>
	We can achieve equity in opportunity without doing that. I 
fully agree and support several women MPs whom I have heard 
in the House that they want to be treated and regarded as an 
equal and that in getting to their spot in this place they sought 
support on the fact that they were the best candidate, not that 
they were a woman. I fully support that.
<P>
	The issue of quotas and pay equity are separable, and I can 
address it this way. There have been a number of surveys done 
that would show that a man and a woman doing the exact job, 
even in some cases in the same firm in the private sector, with 
the same qualifications were getting a difference in pay. I can let 
members imagine who was making the lower pay.
<P>
	My background is education. A woman as qualified as I was 
when I was teaching with the same years of experience was 
guaranteed the exact salary. I would not have it any other way. 
Unfortunately it is not that way in many cases still in this 
country.
<P>
	I would share with the hon. member at another time if she 
wishes some of the studies that prove that sad fact.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I listened to the comments of the hon. member.
<P>
	It appears perhaps that a little earlier he missed the point of 
some of the things that some members of the Reform Party were 
saying. So that the point is clear, I would like to state again that 
the Reform Party members have continually today applauded 
the achievements of not only the women MPs in this House, but 
the achievements of women throughout history, not because of 
the fact that they are women but because of their achievement in 
the same ways that we would applaud the achievements of men.
<P>
<B>(1740) </B>
<P>
	I want to make that very clear. We do not distinguish by 
gender the magnitude of the achievement but rather the 
achievement itself.
<P>
	I would like to go back to some comments that the member 
made earlier in regard to some of the names we give to people in 
the workplace, such as policemen. He made a comment on that. 
He indicated that he found that term objectionable. I would like 
to ask him and maybe he could reply if he finds the term 
policewoman objectionable as well or should we be calling the 
person a policeperson. We could get carried away with this in the 
same way there is a suggestion that we begin to call manhole 
covers personhole covers. Where does it end?
<P>
	Even in this House we differentiate between the terms Mr. 
Speaker and Madam Speaker. Does the member find these terms 
objectionable?
<P>
	I talked about quotas earlier and certainly the government has 
not made mention of quotas. Let me say that the affirmative 
action groups in the U.S. began in the same manner. They did not 
mention quotas. They used terms like pay equity and job equity. 
In fact they were talking about quotas. That was their hidden 
agenda. That agenda would not fly in the early days so they 
chose to use softer, gentler terms.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> The time has expired, 
but the member for London-Middlesex may want to give a 
brief response.
<P>
	<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Madam Speaker, I would because the hon. 
member has raised some very important points. I will try to be 
brief. It is tough to do. He has raised several points.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2022"> 2022 </A></B>
<P>
	It seems to me in listening to the debate, with all due respect, 
that the Reform Party's premise is that there has not been 
discrimination in Canada against women. That seems to be its 
premise. That is absolutely and totally incorrect. I do not know 
how any reading of Canadian history can deny that fact.
<P>
	Therefore when there has been discrimination there is an onus 
on society to be proactive in trying to address that 
discrimination. That is why this party has been very proactive in 
trying to find women candidates and help them raise funds to do 
the nitty-gritty things that you have to do to become a member 
of Parliament.
<P>
	The hon. member does not know me well or he would not 
suggest that I am an extremist on language. Far from it. I would 
find ridiculous personhole covers and so on. I do not find 
ridiculous the fact that some of my former colleagues on London 
city council, female colleagues, were uncomfortable with the 
name ``alderman''. I was at groups with them. There was no 
problem in introducing me as an alderman but the person 
introducing the female alderman and the woman being 
introduced were both uncomfortable. Hence the better name 
councillor.
<P>
	I would say to the hon. member that perhaps firefighter is a far 
better term that fireman. It can in some case give a wrong signal 
to women that somehow this is not a profession for them. That is 
absolutely and totally the wrong message that we want to send in 
my view.
<P>
	I thank the hon. member for his comments.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> I rise in the House 
today to reflect as a man on the various emotions and feelings 
that are set off by this kind of debate. There is joy and pride but 
also a sense of urgency when we reflect on the injustice suffered 
by women and their long struggle which is not over yet and must 
be taken up again every day.
<P>
	I want to share this realization with my colleagues, with the 
women in the Bloc Quebecois, and I also want to salute all 
women and show my solidarity with their cause. I particulary 
want to salute our differences as men and women, our different 
ways of seeing, of feeling, of looking at problems, of 
approaching life and the joys it offers us. And I especially want 
to salute the women of the Eastern Townships whom I have met 
on many occasions in various organizations, and also the women 
in my riding who are very active in all areas as they usually are 
in our society. I want to salute all the women who were elected to 
the House of Commons, and especially my colleagues in the 
Bloc Quebecois. And I also want to say a special word to my 
women friends, whose friendship and understanding I have 
valued for so many years. Finally, I want to salute the love and 
understanding of the woman I cherish, and the birth of a child 
conceived in love.
<P>
<B>(1745) </B>
<P>
	In today's debate which is about women and women's rights 
on International Women's Day, I believe that men can bring to 
this debate an element of solidarity with all women.
<P>
	In the course of my speech I would like to mention a few key 
moments in the history of women. I would like to start by saying 
that we have come a long way since March 8, 1875, when for the 
first time in North America, women rose up against male 
capitalism and went on strike, and I am referring to the garment 
workers strike in New York.
<P>
	Since then, a series of laws have been passed, especially 
during the past 30 years, to promote women's equality in the 
home and in the economic, political and public spheres of our 
society.
<P>
	In 1893, the first feminist association in Quebec was 
established: The Montreal Local Council of Women. After 14 
years of struggle on the part of suffragettes, women obtained the 
right to vote in Quebec in 1940. The Fédération des femmes du 
Québec and the Women's Association for Education and Social 
Action arrived on the scene in 1966. International Women's Day 
was celebrated for the first time in Quebec on March 8, 1972. 
The following year, Quebec's Conseil du statut de la femme and 
the Canadian Advisory Council on the Status of Women were 
created. During the 1980s, Quebec women moved confidently 
into various fields of endeavour. Buoyed by the experience of 
the women who came before them, they demanded that they be 
given a place in all sectors of activity traditionally reserved for 
men.
<P>
	For example, not so long ago, it would have been unthinkable 
to have women practising certain trades or professions. Sexism 
was so prevalent that women were literally prevented from 
holding certain jobs which, more often than not, also happened 
to pay more. The fact that women today work in fields which 
were once the traditional domain of men is undoubtedly a major 
victory in the struggle for the recognition of women's equality. 
This victory shows that women are capable of performing jobs 
from which they were unfairly barred from generation to 
generation. If we were to take as an example the Eastern 
Townships, throughout the 1980s and in the early 1990s, we 
have seen women take their place within the labour force as 
scientific researchers, well-known authors, business leaders, 
bus drivers, police officers, surgeons, lawyers, engineers and so 
on.
<P>
	We are approaching the next century and, at a time when a 
woman's right to vote, her right to an education and her right to 
obtain an abortion are recognized, and at a time when various 
charters of rights and freedoms prohibiting all forms of 
discrimination based on gender confirm that mores have indeed 
changed, we must ask ourselves the following questions: Have 
we achieved true equality between the sexes? Has society, in 
Quebec and Canada, achieved a gender balance which confirms 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2023"> 2023 </A></B>
<P>
its  emergence as mature, harmonious society? Unfortunately, 
the answer is no.
<P>
<B>(1750) </B>
<P>
	In the very brief history of women's liberation I just made, a 
very dark day stands out, a day on which hatred for women was 
expressed in a very violent way. In 1989, as everyone will 
remember, we were stunned by the massacre at the École 
Polytechnique in Montreal.
<P>
	In spite of all the progress made, of the unanimous 
recognition of the right of women to decide for themselves, 
which was again and again reaffirmed, another message 
emerged. The game of life is played according to strictly male 
rules. As professor Maria de Konninck said, while she held the 
Chaire d'étude de la condition des femmes at Laval University, 
and I quote: ``The progress made by women is based purely on 
deep structural changes which significantly affect the place 
women hold as a social group''.
<P>
	The truth is, even if women represent 52 per cent of voters, 
they still hold 66 per cent of part-time jobs, earn less than 70 per 
cent of wages paid to men and have only 15 per cent of the 
action-oriented jobs. According to a press release of the 
Canadian Department on the Status of Women, in 1993, less than 
5 per cent of heads of state, CEO's of major corporations and 
leaders of international organizations were women. According 
to this same press release, women are poorly represented in 
executive positions and at the policy-making and 
decision-making levels.
<P>
	Many polls conducted in the United States show that women 
keep saying that equality at work and at home is still one of their 
major concerns. Statisticians at the Roper Organization, an 
American statistical body, indicate that men's opposition to the 
equality of women is a major source of ill feelings, stress and 
irritation for most of women today. Also in the United States, 
towards the end of the last decade, the proportion of women who 
believed they were not getting equal career opportunities or 
equal pay reached 80 to 95 per cent.
<P>
	Again in the States, during the same ten-year period, 
complaints of sexual harassment at work more than doubled. 
This situation is without any doubt alarming and harmful, since 
sexual harassments can affect the physical and psychological 
well-being of the victims. Earlier in today's debate, we heard an 
absolutely horrifying description of violence against women 
and, as a man, I feel-and I think that all hon. members will 
agree with me-that we must show zero tolerance for violence. 
This abuse of power is demoralizing and counter-productive 
and undermines the equality of the people affected, and 
eventually leads to the loss of competent workers and to a 
decrease in work productivity and efficiency.
<P>
	In North America, the number of battered women taking 
refuge in special shelters jumped by 100 per cent between 1983 
and 1987. Declared rapes have doubled since the early 1970s, 
are twice as common as other types of assault, and are increasing 
four times faster than the overall crime rate in the United States. 
While the homicide rate is down, sex murders have jumped by 
160 per cent. In 1978, women were victims of violence in 10 per 
cent of Canadian homes; in 1993, there was a 25 per cent 
increase in that number.
<P>
	This government's lack of family policy-I am almost 
finished-shows the electoral opportunism of its party platform 
and its lack of a long-term vision that could foster a real 
equality between men and women. These serious shortcomings 
bring into question the progress of women in Quebec and in 
Canada. As we have seen from the position taken by the minister 
today, we must wait another two years for wage equity in the 
public service; the men responsible for finance, for human 
resources, and for employment and immigration say that we 
must wait another two years. Where are the women in the party 
who will support the fact that action on pay equity is urgently 
needed in the public service?
<P>
<B>(1755) </B>
<P>
	In conclusion, Madam Speaker, to ensure a continued 
evolution towards role equality, freedom from all aggression, be 
it physical or psychological, and a balance crucial to the 
stability of Quebec society, and acknowledging that to be fair is 
to recognize our differences, the Bloc Quebecois, within its own 
perspective, which is Quebec's political autonomy, suggests we 
recognize and implement employment and pay equity, and 
concrete measures to redress and correct the distressing 
situation of women.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Order, please. I am 
sorry to interrupt the hon. member, but his time has now expired.
<P>
	The hon. member for Mississauga-South.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South):</B> Madam Speaker, after 
several hours of debate many hon. members have raised the 
issue of women in the context of violence. I feel compelled to 
comment on the incompleteness of the thought. Having spent 
five years on the board of the shelter for battered women in my 
riding, I can say that violence against women is really only one 
part of it. Really the aspect is abuse. I want to share this with 
members.
<P>
	Abuse against women includes violence but it also includes 
non-violent abuses, the economic abuses in which the financial 
purse strings are controlled by one spouse to the detriment of the 
other, taking away that financial independence. The second 
aspect of it is psychological abuse. There exists that authority 
and that power as a result of the position of the man in the 
household, an abusive man. A woman does not have the  dignity 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2024"> 2024 </A></B>
<P>
and respect she has earned by being a partner within that 
marriage.
<P>
	I want this to lead into a point that I raised earlier in the day 
because I feel so strongly about it. It has to do with one of the 
most honourable professions that anyone could aspire to that is 
available only to women, a mother; flowing from which is the 
ability to be the manager of the family home and providing that 
care.
<P>
	There is a tremendous inequity in our society today. In this 
House throughout the day people have talked about women 
leaving the house and going to work. Who in this House honestly 
believes that being a spouse in the home is not a job, is not work, 
is not an honourable profession to be recognized and to be 
compensated?
<P>
	That is one of the reasons I presently have a private member's 
bill in the works. I would like to see one day Canadians 
recognizing the value of a spouse in the home, managing the 
home and providing parental care and being compensated. That 
private member's bill will propose amendments to the tax act 
which would allow one spouse to pay or to transfer income to a 
spouse working in the home and taking care of the family home 
and the children.
<P>
	I think we have to open up to the fundamentals within our 
society and realize that there is a very important role for women 
to play in certain aspects and that being in the home is a job to be 
respected.
<P>
	Possibly the member has some comments.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> Madam Speaker, in 
support of my colleague's comments, I would like to quote from 
a report published in 1992 by Statistics Canada which says that 
in 1986, women's activity in the homes was equivalent to about 
a third of business activity as expressed by the Gross Domestic 
Product. Such housework was then valued at $199 billion. So, 
you are quite right.
<P>
	To remedy the problem of economic violence, the Liberal 
government should start implementing pay equity in the public 
service without any further delay.
<P>
<B>(1800 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Bruce-Grey):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
would like to respond to the member from Richmond and say to 
him that as the member for Bruce-Grey I came from the place 
of the historic women mentioned previously, Agnes Macphail 
and Nellie McClung.
<P>
	In 1994 women are still suffering from the trauma of abuse in 
the home, not being able to walk the streets and of stalking. They 
are still not receiving their child support payments.
<P>
	I welcome this motion from the members of the opposition. I 
think it is fitting that today, International Women's Day, we 
discuss this.
<P>
	However, I am not here to talk about the history of what 
happened. I think today we should act.
<P>
	I was mayor of the city of Owen Sound. I made proposals then 
and we should make similar proposals now. There are costs. Part 
of the problem that we get as we try to move women into 
positions they should be in where they are not disadvantaged is 
that every time we want to make a move with this pay equity 
there is a lot of pressure. In my force, for instance, there were 35 
males and we had to try to make it equitable. The last five people 
we hired on that force were women.
<P>
	However, I received a lot of pressure within my community 
about that. At that time I advocated that perhaps what we should 
do right there and then was split the thing in half so that we 
would retire those people who were older and probably looking 
at retirement anyway and make it right, rather than every year 
when a vacancy came up going through this whole process 
again.
<P>
	I would like to ask the hon. member from Richmond what he 
thinks of that proposal. It is great to talk about that kind of stuff 
in this House but nothing will occur because of the pressure of 
the wage situation we have.
<P>
	There is also pressure within society with males. Men are still 
quite macho and all that. A lot of us in this House get up and talk 
about this but in the end nothing happens. Therefore, I would 
like to ask the member if when we try to look for this equity 
whether we do not split the thing right down the middle and get 
on with it rather than every time we come to this pressure point 
we talk about it and then it goes away.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> Madam Speaker, if the 
hon. members from the Liberal Party confirm their intention to 
act, as a female member was saying earlier, we now have a 
definite point that was raised today: wage equity for women in 
the public service. Do we want to prevent those responsible from 
imposing a two-year wait and force them to take action right 
away? I urge you to do it within your own party and to exert 
pressure on the ministers involved to resolve immediately the 
issue of wage equity for women in the public service.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf):</B> Madam Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to address the House today on such an important issue. 
It is important as this issue, the status of women, affects 50 per 
cent of our population.
<P>
	In the last few weeks, I had the opportunity to address this 
House many times on various issues I was not very familiar 
with, on which I had to do extensive research in order to talk 
about them in an appropriate fashion. Today, I am dealing with a 
subject I have been familiar with since I was born because, just 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2025"> 2025 </A></B>
<P>
like the other gentlemen in this House, I live with the other 50 
per cent of society, the fair sex.
<P>
	I have known various eras. I experienced Quebec's dark ages 
before 1960, when we had an extremely limited vision of the 
role of women in society. I went through the period from 1960 to 
1970, when these values were first challenged, of course by 
women but also by men.
<P>
<B>(1805) </B>
<P>
	In the seventies, I had the pleasure and the privilege of 
teaching with colleagues from both sexes. That gave me the 
opportunity, and it was indeed an opportunity, to be put in my 
place on several occasions and to eventually learn that our 
society is equally made up, from an intellectual, moral and 
physical point of view, of men and women.
<P>
	At this point, I would like to share some of my experiences, as 
well the conclusions I have drawn from them. In the next few 
minutes, I will address male Canadians and Quebecers, but 
female Canadians and Quebecers are certainly welcome to 
listen.
<P>
	I believe that the real challenge lies not so much in major 
pieces of legislation or great principles but, rather, in every day 
life. The real challenge has to do with our individual behaviour 
every minute and every hour of the day. It is somewhat like the 
environment, in the sense that you have to start respecting it at 
home. The same is true in the case of women: it is in our daily 
activities that we must begin to respect them as he should.
<P>
	How many times have I seen people, including myself, use the 
masculine form to refer to doctors, lawyers or musicians. How 
many times have I heard teachers, including myself, use the 
masculine form to discuss a whole range of issues. Thank 
goodness, I was lucky enough to have female colleagues to bring 
me back to that marvellous reality that the world is indeed made 
up of both the masculine and the feminine genders.
<P>
	I learned, and it was not easy, to use both the masculine and 
the feminine, and to say in French ``il'' and ``elle'', ``celui'' and 
``celle'', and in English ``he'' and ``she'', and ``his'' or ``hers''. 
But that did not come naturally. I had to work at it. One must 
especially be careful not to fall in a trap and decide that, in order 
to make a text simpler, only the masculine form will be used, 
being understood that it also includes the feminine gender.
<P>
	This is real streamlining since it is tantamount to eliminating 
50 per cent of the population. I am sorry, but it is a rather poor 
argument.
<P>
	I am relating my personal experience. I have made it my duty, 
when I write, to go the long way and say in French, ``le musicien 
et la musicienne'', and not ``le musicien-ne''. It is quite long to 
write ``le musicien et la musicienne''. It requires a greater 
effort, but I think it shows a greater respect of our reality. After 
all, if we do not start at that level, where will we start?
<P>
	If collective agreements had been written using both the 
masculine and the feminine genders, we would not have to now 
talk about pay equity and equal pay: it would be implicit. But it 
is not, and this brings me to the issue of labour market 
experience.
<P>
<B>(1810) </B>
<P>
	Men, in groups or individually, commonly use stereotypes to 
put down what a member of the opposite sex is saying, to lend 
weight to the so-called male stand. It is not easy, Madam 
Speaker, to refrain from doing this. Why not? Because that is the 
way we were brought up. Because the way we, modern men, 
have been raised reflects values that I was about to describe as 
from another century but, goodness me, it was only a few 
decades ago that we started off down the road of change in terms 
of respect for women. We were raised in a way which was 
appropriate for our fathers and ancestors, but is now 
inappropriate. So, we have to change our ways. We must do so, if 
we are to achieve our goal, that is to say equity with regard to 
persons of the female gender.
<P>
	I would like to point something out to this House, and the 
public watching us at home, especially mayors and municipal 
aldermen and women, may understand what this is about. We are 
presently receiving applications under section 25 and DEP, 
asking for certain types of jobs to be subsidized. Interestingly, 
when you go over some of these applications, you realize that 
there is gender-based inequity in wages.
<P>
	One of the actions I intend to suggest to my employment 
center is to start refusing applications that do not reflect wage 
equality or returning them, asking that appropriate changes be 
made. I think that it is through everyday actions like this-and I 
will close on this-that little by little, in time, we will fill the 
gender gap.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I appreciated the remarks of my hon. colleague across 
the way. I wonder if he could answer a question that I must admit 
deeply troubles me. I think members from all sides of the House 
would agree that there should be fairness and equity among the 
sexes as there should be among all Canadians.
<P>
	One thing that troubles me is the cost of undoing the wrongs 
of the past. I put it very simply to the hon. member. If it were a 
matter of redressing the wrongs of the past in the civil service 
with respect to women, would he be prepared to add a billion 
dollars to the deficit in this next year or so?
<P>
	<B>Mr. de Savoye:</B> Madam Speaker, that is an interesting 
question indeed. The bulk of my speech was not on that subject 
as the member will realize. I mentioned that people should start 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2026"> 2026 </A></B>
<P>
addressing this issue at their own door steps, every day in 
whatever they are doing, the way they talk, the way they address 
women.
<P>
	On the specific issue, if men would accept lower salaries by a 
global amount equal to the one that is needed to raise women's 
salaries until we reach it mid way, would the member accept 
that? I would.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew (Secretary of State (Training 
and Youth)):</B> Madam Speaker, I rise today to respond to the 
opposition motion urging the government to recognize among 
other matters the principle of economic equality between 
women and men and to implement measures to guarantee 
women equity in employment, wages and living conditions.
<P>
<B>(1815) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	To begin, I wish to commend the opposition for raising these 
issues in the House on International Women's Day. This 
inspiring day is a time for celebration but also for reflection. We 
are inspired by the significant progress made recently by women 
in all areas of life. We celebrate their successes and their 
substantial contributions to our economy and our quality of life. 
But we also reflect on the inequities that still exist.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This government welcomes a debate on issues which affect 
women, a very important debate. This government is prepared to 
build meaningfully on past accomplishments. In that context it 
is committed to expedite the process of full and lasting equality 
for women in every avenue of human endeavour.
<P>
	We must grasp the socioeconomic realities of the global 
marketplace. It places increasingly competitive pressures on 
successful industrialized nations. It also dictates that we forge 
ahead in eradicating inequality, not only for the inherent essence 
of fairness but also because Canada needs to promote full 
development of all its human resources. Only then can it 
continue to provide its citizens with the prosperity and promise 
to which they have become accustomed.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	On the threshold of the 21st century, our nation must face 
many challenges. One of the most difficult is to ensure equal 
participation of women in all aspects of Canadian society. 
Although our government is proud that it has always contributed 
to the betterment of women in our country, we are the first to 
admit that much still remains to be done.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	For example the feminization of poverty is a disturbing issue. 
Single parent families headed by women are the most afflicted. 
Close to 60 per cent of such families live below the poverty line. 
The poverty rate for elderly women is double that of elderly 
men.
<P>
	Women also suffer from discrimination in the workplace. For 
example in the Northwest Territories 43 per cent of all workers 
were women in 1992. However the average income of women 
was 63 per cent of the average income of men. Women are 
overrepresented in low paying part time jobs and are often 
denied promotions, job security and standard employee 
benefits. This is not only unfair, it is unacceptable.
<P>
	The achievement of equality in the workplace is an absolute 
necessity and cannot be compromised by dated arguments and 
head in the sand thinking. Equality is one of the core values of 
Canadian society and we cannot tolerate exceptions under any 
circumstances.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Our government is committed to ensuring employment equity 
and will strive to offer all Canadians better social and economic 
conditions. Women are entitled to their fair share of economic 
power and equitable participation in political decision-making.
<P>
	We cannot have an egalitarian society if we are indifferent to 
some segments of our population. We quite simply cannot allow 
the disadvantaged to be left to their fate while the privileged 
prosper.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	More than 10 years ago a Liberal government, in fact the 
current minister appointed the Royal Commission on Equality 
in Employment, the Abella commission. In response to that 
report the previous government brought in the Employment 
Equity Act. We were critical of the act in 1986 and we have not 
changed our minds since.
<P>
<B>(1820) </B>
<P>
	When the act was first proclaimed its stated purpose was to 
eliminate systemic barriers to employment faced by women, 
aboriginal people, persons with disabilities and visible 
minorities. While there have been success stories and individual 
employers who have set exemplary precedents, progress for 
women has not met expectations.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The law now applies to about 350 employers with over 
600,000 employees in banking, transportation and 
communications. Since 1987, the proportion of women has 
grown by nearly 4 per cent and is now the same as their 
representation in the Canadian labour force. Nevertheless, 
women's employment is still highly concentrated in office 
work, sales and services.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Under the circumstances I am sure hon. members will 
understand this government's commitment to strengthen the 
employment equity legislation. It flows directly from our pledge 
to improve the laws and social programs which form the basis 
for 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2027"> 2027 </A></B>
<P>
fundamental fairness and decency within which Canadians must 
be able to pursue their individual goals.
<P>
	We are concerned about the existing act which has done little 
to improve the lot of women along with visible minorities, 
aboriginal people and persons with disabilities. We want to 
ensure that opportunity is distributed more evenly so that a 
broader spectrum of our society can aspire to earn a decent wage 
and live with dignity and respect.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In the red book, our government made three specific 
commitments on employment equity. First, the principles of 
employment equity must apply in the federal public service and 
federal government agencies and commissions. Second, we 
want to give the Canadian Human Rights Commission authority 
to investigate issues related to employment equity. Third, 
federal contractors should be required to comply with the 
established principles.
<P>
	The Minister of Human Resources Development has indicated 
on several occasions that our government would see to it that 
specific action was taken over the coming year to strengthen 
employment equity legislation. Indeed, our government intends 
to establish a broader and more solid legislative base for 
employment equity, which will provide for better representation 
of designated groups in the labour force.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Employment equity means more than simply hiring women, 
aboriginal people, persons with disabilities and members of 
visible minorities. It means developing creative strategies to 
ensure that scarce jobs are filled according to the principles of 
sound human resource and equity planning. The focus must be 
on developing training and retention programs that allow longer 
term internal changes to take place in the workforce.
<P>
	Employers can be expected to make more progress toward an 
equitable workforce during periods of economic growth than 
during periods of restraint. Under bullish economic conditions 
employers have more opportunities to hire and promote 
members of designated groups such as women. Therefore they 
may achieve good results without actually extending much 
effort. In times of restraint however the best efforts of 
employers may go unrewarded. Low proportions of designated 
groups hired and promoted in the workforce may reflect difficult 
economic times rather than a lack of effort on the part of 
employers.
<P>
<B>(1825) </B>
<P>
	In assessing the results we must take economic conditions 
into account. These variables require all partners; business, 
unions, designated groups and governments to collaborate to 
meet workforce equality objectives.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I think it would be remiss on my part if I did not let hon. 
members know about the excellent record of the federal Public 
Service on employment equity. The Department of Human 
Resources Development, which employs about 27,000 persons 
since its recent reorganization, is a good example.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Despite the anticipated challenges associated with 
restructuring and downsizing and the potential impact on 
employment equity, no group has been disproportionately 
affected. While concern over the possible negative impact in 
these hard times is quite legitimate, much of the progress 
achieved to date in employment equity has occurred under 
trying conditions as well.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Human Resources Development Canada now administers the 
programs and services of originating departments, including 
Employment and Immigration, Health and Welfare, Labour, 
Multiculturalism and Citizenship and the Department of the 
Secretary of State.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The consolidation of these programs and services can only 
have a positive impact on the future of employment equity. In 
Human Resources Development Canada the department's role 
will be greatly strengthened in this domain since it has already 
gained much in-house expertise with the addition of new 
programs and services.
<P>
	Human Resources Development now offers a wide variety of 
activities and instruments which can be brought to bear to 
accelerate employment equity in the workplace. As a large 
employer in this nation and with a corresponding budget to 
generate social progress, the department will have 
unprecedented opportunities to induce a ripple effect in both the 
federal and private sectors. This holds true particularly with 
regard to employment equity.
<P>
	Rather than get mired in complex details and statistics I 
believe it will suffice to say that there is a significant 
representation of women in senior positions of Human 
Resources Development Canada. The government is committed 
to ensuring that women and other designated groups will not be 
disadvantaged by downsizing and restructuring.
<P>
	The department will be in a strong position to react promptly 
to any negative plans and could well serve as a barometer for 
excellence in the rest of the public service and beyond.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2028"> 2028 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I would now like to address the issue of pay equity. The 
Canadian Human Rights Act considers that not giving men and 
women equal pay for work of equal value is a discriminatory 
practice.
<P>
	The Canada Labour Code authorizes officials of the 
Department of Human Resources Development to audit the pay 
equity practices of companies. These officials may also submit 
cases of alleged discrimination relating to wage parity between 
men and women to the Canadian Human Rights Commission.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Audits are conducted to verify that pay equity implementation 
by employers has taken place. Refusal to act results in referral to 
the Human Rights Commission for further investigation and 
resolution. This inspection program has resulted in three cases 
being referred to the Human Rights Commission since 1989. 
Two of these cases have been resolved with wage adjustments of 
some $125,000. Two additional inspections have been initiated 
and should be completed this summer. These decisive, no 
nonsense responses demonstrate very clearly that pay equity 
legislation cannot be flouted or ignored.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Most employers are anxious to comply with pay equity 
guidelines, and under a new program it will be possible to 
examine an employer's implementation program, find any 
problems that may exist and deal with them quickly, without 
having to submit the case to the Canadian Human Rights 
Commission.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	There have been some positive results emanating from pay 
equity compliance measures. Between 1971 and 1992 the wage 
gap between men and women has narrowed about 20 per cent. In 
addition, in 1992 women working full time earned an average of 
some 72 per cent of what was earned by full time working men. 
This represents an improvement of about 3 per cent over the 
previous year.
<P>
	While these figures do not represent satisfactory levels of 
change, they do indicate some tangible movement. They also 
illustrate that equal pay compliance programs have resulted in 
industry-wide pay equity initiatives in the federal jurisdiction. 
These steps have often been promoted and sponsored by 
employer associations which set a standard for less 
sophisticated and less aware employers.
<P>
	With the recent advent of labour-management partnerships 
directed at involvement in the pay equity implementation 
process, there is evidence that greater strides than ever before 
will be taken in this area.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Finally, Madam Speaker, considering the symbolic 
importance of International Women's Day, I would like to take 
these last few minutes to recall the recent advances which have 
been made by women. Their employment situation has 
developed spectacularly during the past decades, while the 
significance and diversity of their roles have also increased 
considerably.
<P>
	We all know, unfortunately, that women who succeed still 
have trouble being accepted by many of their male colleagues.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	For a long time women were rarely encountered in other than 
support positions. There was also tokenism of the most blatant 
kind. In the 1970s a disproportionately large number of women 
were concentrated in secretarial and clerical positions. Since 
then some of these imbalances have been corrected and many 
women have increased their career opportunities and some have 
advanced to executive levels.
<P>
	It must be recognized that many women workers had to 
sacrifice personal lives for the workplace. Secretaries followed 
their bosses up the corporate ladder and became more trusted 
than senior advisers, yet were never given pay and positions 
commensurate with their worth.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Women who aspired to management positions either hit a 
glass ceiling or were removed from the decision making 
process. Many talented women found themselves excluded from 
the ``old boys' network'' in their job environment and were 
never really accepted, even on a purely professional level, as 
women doctors, lawyers or engineers.
<P>
	However, Madam Speaker, there is a bright side: the position 
of women on the labour market has changed dramatically. 
According to 1991 census figures, women represented 45 per 
cent of wage earners in Canada, compared with 35 per cent 30 
years ago.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In addition, as noted earlier, there has been significant 
improvement in the representation of women in management. 
We in this House are becoming increasingly aware of the impact 
women are having in all parts of the workplace.
<P>
	Coincidentally 1994 is the 40th anniversary of the women's 
bureau. The women's bureau has much to be proud of. Since its 
inception in 1954 it has contributed significantly to the 
increased awareness of issues related to women in the workplace 
as to the removal of remaining barriers. The bureau interacts 
closely with key partners to change workplace policies and 
practices. It has helped considerably to move Canada forward as 
a country which promotes the advancement and well-being of 
all its workers.

you will find unanimous consent to apply the vote just 
completed on the amendment but in reverse to the main motion.
