</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Ref.)</B> moved that 
Bill C-212, an act to amend the Criminal Code and the Young 
Offenders Act (capital punishment), be read the second time and 
referred to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Madam Speaker, last week Gallup released the results 
of its most recent survey on Canadian support for the death 
penalty.  According to that poll, if a national referendum were 
to be held today a full 63% of the Canadian public would vote in 
favour of reinstating capital punishment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party believes that on moral and contentious issues 
such as capital punishment Canadians should grapple with their 
own consciences and vote according to their personal convictions 
in a binding national referendum.  We have called for a binding 
referendum on the death penalty but the government has said no. 
The government has told the people that it knows what is best for 
them and that they do not have the choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I have introduced the bill.  If the government will 
not hold a binding referendum at the time of the next federal 
election, I believe we should hold a true free vote in the House 
of Commons where all MPs can vote the views of their constituents 
rather than those of their political bosses or their own personal 
beliefs.  That would be democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill imposes a sentence of capital punishment on all adults 
found guilty of first degree murder.  First degree murder occurs 
when a murder is planned and deliberate, when death occurs during 
a sexual assault or kidnapping, or when the victim is a police 
officer or a correctional officer.  First degree murder is not an 
accident.  It is cold, calculated and brutal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To address the concerns people have about the finality of the 
death penalty important safeguards have been built into the 
legislation.  There is an automatic right of appeal at the first 
level.  Even if convicted people themselves do not appeal they 
are deemed to have appealed and the court will review the case on 
all questions of fact and law to determine if the conviction is 
valid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All appeals are to be conducted in a timely fashion.  If the 
jury and court are satisfied that overwhelming evidence shows 
someone is guilty beyond doubt there is no reason he or she 
should languish on death row for years.  The sentence, if upheld, 
is to be carried out within a reasonable period of time.  The 
death penalty is to be carried out by lethal injection.  This is 
a more humane method of execution than hanging or electrocution. 
It ensures a quick and painless end and does not turn the 
culmination of a tragic chain of events begun by a brutal murder 
into a media and public circus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People might ask why the bill is necessary.  The death penalty 
should be reinstated for many reasons.  First and foremost is 
that the state must protect society.  In this debate we cannot 
forget the inevitable release of murderers.  Between 1986 and 
1995, 133 convicts released from prison for first and second 
degree murder returned to our communities and committed crimes 
again.  These included 87 violent crimes and sex offences. 
They also included 10 murders.  It is clear that our so-called 
rehabilitation programs are not working.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two convicted murderers also escaped, only to murder again.  How 
does one explain to the families of those victims that 12 
murderers were given the opportunity to strike again?  How could 
anyone possibly defend our justice system to the family of just 
one of these victims? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While there are 12 examples that I could use, I draw the 
attention of the House to one in particular.  Four murders were 
committed in 1989 by Allan Legere who escaped from prison while 
serving a life sentence for the bloody beating death of an 
elderly shopkeeper in 1986.  He escaped, only to murder four more 
law-abiding innocent Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am certain that someone here today will raise the cases of 
Donald Marshall, Guy Paul Morin and David Milgaard.  All three of 
these men spent years of their lives behind bars, convicted of 
crimes they did not commit.  This is not something any Canadian 
is proud of.  My hope is that their years of needless suffering 
and incarceration have taught us a grave lesson about how easily 
justice can be subverted.  Their hard won battles have exposed 
problems in our system that we must be ever vigilant to avoid 
repeating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When local police departments are under enormous public pressure 
to produce a guilty party, that is when we must scrutinize the 
evidence presented with an even more critical eye. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one should be convicted of first degree murder and put to 
death based on circumstantial evidence.  We now have much 
improved DNA technology.  These high profile cases have alerted 
the public and the justice system to the possibility of 
overzealous police forces seeking speedy convictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>David Milgaard was convicted of second degree murder so he never 
would have faced the death penalty in any case.  Under the bill 
all evidence and facts would have been carefully re-examined in 
the convictions of Guy Paul Morin and Donald Marshall.  They were 
recently exonerated on the basis of DNA evidence.  If their 
trials had been held today they would have never been convicted. 
The DNA tests that proved them innocent could just as easily 
prove, beyond a shadow of a doubt, someone else's guilt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are entering the 21st century and our justice system should 
use the latest technology to determine the guilt or innocence of 
those charged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many people like to quote statistics, telling us that the murder 
rate has gone down since 1975.  That was the peak year, at three 
murders per 100,000 Canadians.  Why do they not take it from 1966 
when the rate was less than half that, at 1.25 per 100,000?  In 
1996 the homicide rate was 2.11 per 100,000.  Whether we measure 
it from 1966 or 1975 it is still far too many. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another statistic is much more relevant to the debate today.  I 
quote from a recent Canadian Centre for Justice Statistics 
publication known as <I>Juristat</I>.  With respect to homicide it 
states that first degree murder as a proportion of all homicides 
rose steadily from 36% in 1978 to 57% in 1996. That means that in 
1978, 238 people were charged with first degree murder.  However, 
in 1996, 361 people were charged with first degree murder even 
though there were 28 fewer murders committed in 1996 than in 
1978.  Obviously something has changed if the proportion of 
planned and deliberate murders has increased by over 50% since 
capital punishment was abolished in 1976. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should not consider the use of the death penalty out of 
hunger for vengeance but out of desire for justice.  No act of 
vengeance can undo the harm done.  No punishment can erase a 
victim's scars or bring back those who were murdered.  The death 
penalty is not about vengeance.  It is not the business of the 
state to exact punishment motivated by vengeance.  It is the role 
of the state to mete out justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Capital punishment is about public safety.  The only certain way 
to keep extremely dangerous individuals from harming again and 
again is to take away their opportunity to do so.  Why is it 
wrong for society to take the life of someone who has knowingly 
violated our most fundamental laws and brutally slain a fellow 
human being?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1982 one-third of the 300 convicted murderers in Canada said 
they would prefer the death penalty over life in prison.  In 
fact, in 1983 a convicted murdered in Saskatchewan formally 
requested the death penalty by lethal injection on the basis that 
his life sentence was cruel and unusual punishment.  His request 
was denied by the court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people believe we should just lock up murderers capable of 
the most heinous crimes for a few decades.  Some of these people 
object to the death penalty strictly on moral grounds.  That is 
their right and I believe they should be given the opportunity to 
voice that view in a referendum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take issue with those who object to the death penalty because 
they fear our justice system may have convicted an innocent 
person.  What they are pointing out is not a problem with the 
death sentence, but a more fundamental problem with the ability 
of our justice system to determine the truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If you believe innocent people are being convicted, do not just 
object to the death penalty.  It is equally wrong to keep an 
innocent person in jail for 10 or 20 years.  Those who believe 
our justice system does not work have a moral obligation to 
reform it, to protect all innocent people, not just those facing 
a possible death penalty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question there are problems with our justice system. 
According to our laws, taking a human life is wrong.  Somehow our 
system is seriously out of balance, and I refer specifically to 
the Latimer case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe people believe the second degree conviction of Tracy 
Latimer's father was warranted, but others believe it points to 
the need for different charges in the Criminal Code.  I do not 
know whether the Minister of Justice is considering something 
like a mercy killing category, but if she is I strongly urge her 
to include a significant range of sentencing options to reflect 
all Canadians' moral convictions on this highly contentious 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the current system the sentencing judge has little 
latitude in sentencing Latimer.  Some Canadians agree with this 
while others do not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me bring another murder case to the attention of the House 
today.  On Vancouver Island a man was murdered and his murderer 
walked.  There was no public hue and cry to jail the perpetrator 
because the victim was apparently an undesirable person.  Because 
people did not seem to generally like the victim, they demanded 
little or no punishment for the criminal.  That is not right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Somehow I believe our justice system forgot that its role is to 
protect all citizens, even those we do not like.  As a society we 
cannot let individuals take the law into their own hands.  We 
must prevent vigilantism and have room for compassion for those 
who act out of mercy, not malice.  The state should have the 
option of imposing the severest of penalties for the most heinous 
of crimes to protect the citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no way to bring the victim back.  The death penalty 
would not do that.  But it will prevent the murderer from 
murdering again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Paul Bernardo may not be getting out for a long time, but his 
accomplice will be getting out very soon.  Clifford Olson may 
have failed in his bid for parole this summer, but eventually he 
too may be released into our streets, into the neighbourhoods 
where our children are at play. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do you want people capable of rape, torture and murder living 
next to you?  Do you want to take the chance with your children 
and grandchildren?  When they get out, not if, do not count on 
them moving to someone else's neighbourhood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The death penalty may not act as a deterrent for sick 
individuals bent on the destruction of other human beings, but if 
the death penalty does not deter them, neither does the prospect 
of imprisonment for 15, 20 or 25 years.  Deterrence is not the 
issue.  Seventy percent of Canadians who supported the death 
penalty in 1996 said they would still support it even if it was 
proven not to be a deterrent.  Instead, the majority of Canadians 
believe that capital punishment is for the protection of society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, I believe the death penalty should be reinstated for 
those guilty of heinous first degree murders.  This bill provides 
ample opportunity for appeals on the basis of fact and law with 
the option of commuting the sentence to life imprisonment. 
Capital punishment should be available to society to protect the 
citizens from those who have shown no remorse, no guilt and no 
possibility of redemption.  The appeals process and the sentence 
are to be carried out in a timely fashion.  Administering a 
lethal injection is more humane than hanging or electrocution and 
does not reduce the death sentence to a media spectacle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I and the Reform Party believe that Canadian people should 
decide on whether they want to reinstate capital punishment in a 
binding national referendum, as I said earlier.  Because the 
government has said no, as I also said earlier, the next best 
thing is a free vote in the House of Commons.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Sue Barnes (London West, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
feel compelled to participate in this debate on Bill C-212 which 
was introduced by the hon. member for Prince George—Peace River. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-212 would reinstate the death penalty for first degree 
murder committed by a person 18 years of age or over.  This bill 
would also provide for an increase in prison terms for first and 
second degree murder which can be imposed upon persons under the 
age of 18. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like first to address the issue of reinstatement of the 
death penalty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Capital punishment was debated extensively in this House prior 
to the 1976 vote that abolished it more than 20 years ago. 
Capital punishment has been debated a few times since it was 
abolished, not only in Parliament, but elsewhere.  The most 
extensive debate since the abolition of capital punishment took 
place in this House in 1987.  I clearly remember that debate 
because, as a private citizen, it was the first time that I 
actually wrote to my MP to encourage him to vote against capital 
punishment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1987 debate was on the then government of the day motion and 
that motion called upon the House of Commons to support in 
principle the reinstatement of capital punishment and to 
establish a special committee to provide recommendations on the 
offences which should carry the death penalty, and on the method 
or methods which should be used to carry out the sentence of 
death. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question as I said earlier was debated at length.  There was 
a free vote in this House.  It seems that some people cannot 
understand that a free vote democratically given in Canada has 
been done and it was refused.  Some people push the agenda all 
the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A majority of the members then voted against the motion and thus 
against the reinstatement of capital punishment in the Criminal 
Code.  Since that vote, capital punishment has not been an issue 
of great national prominence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are we asked to debate the reinstatement of capital 
punishment at this time?  It is private members hour and a Reform 
member has brought it forward. Are there any new circumstances 
that require or seriously say that Parliament should re-examine 
this issue?  Perhaps I would understand if there was a trend 
showing a significant increase in the homicide rate.  This could 
institute a requirement that we should again debate this issue 
and would justify reopening this debate on the death penalty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely the hon. member from Prince George—Peace River is not 
motivated by an increase in the homicide rate.  In fact the rate 
for 1996 is the third lowest rate since 1975.  The homicide rate 
was three per hundred thousand of population in 1975, the last 
year when capital punishment was in force for murder.  In 1987 
when this House held an extensive debate on a government motion 
for the reinstatement of capital punishment, the homicide rate 
was down to 2.4 per hundred thousand, which means a 20% decrease 
compared to 1975. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995 the homicide rate had decreased further to 1.99. This 
represents a 33% reduction since 1975, the last year the death 
penalty was in force in this country.  For 1996 the rate is 2.1. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to be clear.  I do not underestimate, nor does anybody in 
this House, the crime of murder.  Today we are all aware of yet 
another tragedy in Canada over the weekend. 
Every homicide is a tragedy and it raises questions about our 
society and raises questions for our society.  Every homicide or 
murder must be punished with the most serious penalties and it 
is.

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, statistics do show us that the homicide rate was three 
per one hundred thousand of population when capital punishment 
was in force and it is down to around two per one hundred 
thousand now that capital punishment is no longer in our system, 
having been abolished, as I said, for over 20 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This decrease hardly supports the deterrent element of capital 
punishment.  Not only has the homicide rate not increased with 
the abolition of the death penalty, it has actually decreased by 
one-third. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What these statistics mean is that there is no evidence that the 
death penalty is a useful tool to fight murders.  If the death 
penalty is not an effective tool against homicides and murders, 
we should ask ourselves what useful purpose would be served by 
reinstating it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I personally believe that the death penalty is an excessive 
means of achieving the objectives of sentencing.  In recent years 
at least three well publicized cases have come to light which 
would cause one to pause and should cause this society to pause 
when considering the reinstatement of the death penalty:  the 
wrongful murder convictions of Donald Marshall, Jr., Guy-Paul 
Morin and David Milgaard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If capital punishment had been in effect, they may not have had 
a second chance at life.  Capital punishment is final.  There is 
no chance to correct the mistakes of the state, however well 
intentioned, however strongly we feel and however many inches of 
press can be generated.  This type of error is also tragic and it 
is totally preventable when we do not have capital punishment as 
part of our recourse in our justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On practical grounds, these are reasons I personally oppose the 
death penalty.  The onus is on those who would want to change the 
law in such a fundamental way to make a compelling case.  For 
myself, I am not persuaded by the arguments I have just heard and 
those being made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not only on practical grounds that I oppose the death 
penalty, but I also oppose it on moral grounds.  The issue of 
capital punishment raises the question of how we see ourselves as 
a country and a people.  The trend in the world, at least among 
western nations, is to abolish the death penalty.  To return to 
capital punishment in Canada would be contrary to the 
international trend and I personally believe that supporting a 
return to the death penalty for murder would be a very regressive 
step, one that my hon. colleagues in the Reform Party seem to 
wish to embrace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do Canadians really believe that they would feel safer living in 
a society where capital punishment is meted out?  In fact to be 
very crass, do they even believe that this would save tax 
dollars?  Please look to what is going on with our neighbours to 
the south.  Canadians will find some of those answers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member's bill would also increase prison terms for 
murder for persons under the age of 18 years.  I found it 
surprising that he did not address that, seeing as that is part 
of the bill, but I am going to comment. I would like to remind 
the hon. member that parole eligibility periods for youth 
convicted of murder were significantly increased as of December 
1, 1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to outline for the House the provisions that 
currently apply to young offenders who are found guilty of 
murder.  A youth who is 14 years of age or over at the time of 
the commission of the offence of first degree murder or second 
degree murder may be transferred to adult court.  If convicted of 
murder in adult court, the minimum sentence is life imprisonment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before December 1, 1995 a youth convicted of either first or 
second degree murder in adult court was subject to a prison term 
set by the court at between five and ten years inclusive.  Since 
our government changed this law after December 1, 1995, the 
following provisions apply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, a 16 or 17 year old youth convicted of first degree 
murder must serve a term of at least 10 years in custody.  A 16 
or 17 year old youth convicted of second degree murder must serve 
a term of at least seven years in custody and a youth 14 or 15 
years of age who is convicted of either first or second degree 
murder in adult court must serve a custody term of between five 
and seven years inclusive as set by the court. 
If not specified by the judge, then the person must serve a term 
of five years.

<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to go back to before December 1, 1995 when youths of any 
age convicted of first or second degree murder in youth court 
were subject to a maximum sentence of five years less a day which 
was composed of two parts. The maximum custodial period was three 
years and the maximum period for conditional supervision in the 
community was two years less a day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unfortunate that I am out of time because I do have the 
facts that could be presented.  Maybe one of my colleagues will 
finish this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now I need to make the point that all youth convicted of 
first degree murder in youth court are subject to a maximum 
sentence of ten years which is comprised of a maximum of six 
years in custody and a maximum length of conditional supervision 
of four years.  Youths convicted of second degree murder in youth 
court are subject to a maximum sentence of seven years which is 
composed of a maximum period of four years in custody and a 
period of conditional supervision which may not exceed three 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has only been two years since we have changed these rules. We 
have a justice committee looking at it.  I am going to suggest 
that we let the Minister of Justice, who knows this is an 
important issue, deal with this as we have been doing all along. 
We take this seriously.  In my submission, capital punishment 
plays no part in our just society. 
<P><A NAME="LINK6"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney—Victoria, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I would first like to commend the mover of this piece of 
legislation for the work that has gone into it.  I read his 
private member's bill today and it is clear that a considerable 
amount of effort has gone into drafting the legislation.  I 
commend him for that but, and I am sure this will come as no 
surprise to him, I disagree with the contents of the legislation 
and the thrust of the private member's bill to reinstate capital 
punishment in this country and, as my hon. colleague just 
mentioned, to require life imprisonment for certain young 
offenders charged and convicted of first degree murder. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the introduction and debate of this piece of legislation, I 
find it interesting that the hon. member said that this is not 
about vengeance.  He indicated that vengeance plays no part in 
seeking the death penalty.  He went on to say that it was not 
about deterrence.  My hon. colleague, who spoke prior to me, 
indicated that the statistics are there and there is no evidence 
that capital punishment acts as a deterrent to murderers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, if it is not about vengeance or deterrence, what is 
the purpose of the legislation?  The mover says it is about 
safety.  I presume what he means is that if we take a person who 
is convicted of first degree murder and execute them they are not 
going to commit murder a second time.  The reality is that in 
this country we have life imprisonment.  The reality is that the 
Paul Bernardos and Clifford Olsons, who are talked about by the 
mover of this bill, will not be released from prison.  The 
purpose of prison is safety.  If we can achieve the purpose of 
safety through prison then what is the point of execution?  If we 
can achieve safety in a more humane and civilized way then surely 
the hon. member will agree, if vengeance is not part of the 
issue, and if safety can be achieved in another way, that is the 
way we should proceed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Don't count on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini:</B>  I am not.  That being said, 
consequently there is no necessary rationale for the legislation 
that has been brought into the House today.  I submit we can 
achieve safety in a better way and as a better society.  If we 
went to Canadians and said that the people who are convicted of 
first degree murder in the most heinous circumstances will not be 
released from prison unless they avail themselves of Canadians' 
will to release them through an application under the faint hope 
clause, Canadians would say fine, if safety is the issue and we 
know we are safe.

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have indicated, I think the rationale is then gone for the 
piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon colleague, the mover of this bill, and I think there were 
some members of his party who heckled the member from the Liberal 
Party who spoke, said the reason we are having this debate is 
public opinion, the reason that we are reintroducing this whole 
issue, even though it has been debated not once but twice in this 
House, is that 63% according to Gallup want us to talk about this 
issue and want capital punishment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask him, then, if public opinion is the rationale, will he put 
a caveat into his legislation and say we want the death penalty 
but we are going to review it as public opinion shifts?  Perhaps 
in three years if 55% of the Canadian population according to 
some poll says we do not want capital punishment, we will 
reintroduce the legislation— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  It never happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini:</B>  The hon. mover says that it has never 
happened.  I guess what we are going to do is leave this to a 
public relations campaign between the victims rights groups 
perhaps on one hand and the council of churches on the other, the 
victims rights groups perhaps saying they want the death penalty 
and the council of churches saying it does not. Who can ever 
engage Canadians and win their support for the day, we will 
change the law accordingly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Public opinion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini:</B>  Exactly.  Let us change each piece of 
legislation every year, depending on whether or not certain 
groups can present their case on television and in the media and 
gain the most public opinion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those people who were put to death between let us say 1997 and 
the year 2000 when the legislation might come up for review, 
well, they were on the wrong side of public opinion for three 
years. We will change it again in 2000 and we will not have the 
death penalty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe in 2010 we will change it again and those people between 
2000 and 2010, good for them, they won the lottery.  They did all 
right.  Those after will suffer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are allowing the Gallup poll to determine legislation in 
Parliament where I believe we have been elected to represent our 
constituents' interests but also to lead this country into the 
next millennium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is our purpose and I think that is what we have to do.  We 
now know there is no rationale for the piece of legislation.  We 
now know it is being led by public opinion and that is the 
purpose of it, I suppose, to gain some points in another Gallup 
poll. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be Reform justice, I suppose. We know that jurors can 
err but I raise another point and I think it is an important 
point.  In many states in America, our neighbours to the south, 
there is capital punishment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality of what happens in study after study is that juries 
are reluctant to convict if they know the death penalty is what 
awaits the accused. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mover of this legislation has talked about the Latimer case 
and it is interesting to note that jurors who convicted Mr. 
Latimer interviewed later on, and this is no secret, it was used 
by his defence council, indicated that had they known that the 
minimum sentence was 10 years, they would have entered a verdict 
of not guilty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we accept the statistics of my hon. friend, and I am not sure 
I do, let us suppose that 40% of Canadians on moral grounds 
opposed the death penalty, if they sit on the jury and cannot 
morally accede to the death penalty if it is law, they are left 
with no choice but to acquit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the mover of this legislation to think about that very 
carefully because it is a very real consequence in states where 
there is a death penalty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other side of this in reality is the frustration in the 
legal system.  The bill makes provision for a mandatory appeal. 
It is a very American piece of legislation.  I think we have to 
say that what we are doing here is free trade on certain kinds of 
justice issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are importing American legislation into this country, into a 
judicial system and a court structured system that is British in 
nature.  Let us be clear.  We are trying to put a round peg into 
a square hole here and it is not going to fit.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we do look to the American states where this type of 
legislation is in place, we see case after case where the appeals 
are dragged out for years.  It is a fight for someone's life. 
Make no mistake, there are organizations in this country that 
would find funding to continue appeal after appeal, to look for 
clemency to move on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we have to look at the reality of this.  It is nice and 
easy to say this solves the problem, we are going to have an 
execution after we seek leave to appeal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since I have one minute left, I will try to wrap up.  Like my 
colleague, there is so much to say on this issue that I could 
speak for a fairly long period of time. However, let me say that 
I find it absolutely contradictory and somewhat upsetting that 
the mover of this legislation would say that we are in favour of 
this and that we are going to do it nice and clean, in a way that 
nobody is really bothered, it will not be a public spectacle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To those in favour of capital punishment, I say bring the 
accused into this Chamber, execute him here, watch him foul 
himself in this House, eye to eye, and then let them tell me that 
they are in favour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have not touched on the young offender areas of the bill, nor 
have I touched on an interesting little section that requires the 
body of the person who has been executed to be buried within the 
prison. And my friend says that this is not couched in vengeance. 
So much for Christian mercy.

his facts straight. Reform policy is not quite the same as what

committed serious crimes.  The crime is no less serious, but people 
under 18 years of age who have committed first degree murder, for 
example, would serve a life sentence.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of the Criminal Code, all of us in this House know 
that there was a big debate on the subject in 1975-76, when Canada 
still had capital punishment.  They wanted to amend it.  There was 
a moral debate, with the church involved, a political and a social 
debate.  I think there was a very important debate in 1975-76 on 
that.  A compromise was reached, because they abolished capital 
punishment.  The compromise was life imprisonment, with the 
possibility of parole after 25 years.  It was perhaps not the best 
formula, but it was the most accurate representation of the will of 
the people at the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You have to understand that people, that a society, that a 
country can change. Maybe not the Reform Party, but everyone else. 
Today we do not think exactly the same way we did 25, 30 or 40 years 
ago. I think it is normal in a free and democratic society to deal with 
this, especially since with the help of experts and the people 
involved, we can review much more objectively the whole situation, which 
is rather unpleasant, I must admit. There is nothing pleasant about 
first degree murder. When we read the newspapers, there is nothing 
pleasant there neither, but I believe that in a society like ours, we 
had to get to the bottom of this. That is what we did during those years 
and we arrived at a rather satisfactory formula. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we improved it over the years. Recently, I think we solved 
still other problems by amending the Criminal Code so an individual can 
be declared a dangerous offender and denied the possibility of parole. 
Perhaps there will be further improvements over the years, but it surely 
will not be by going to extremes, as the Reform member wants to do this 
morning with Bill C-212, and by imposing capital punishment for first 
degree murder. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to read to you some of the objectives we have here. 
Why did we go from capital punishment to the system we have today? 
France and other European countries had the same social debate we had 
here and finally adopted legislation resembling Canada's. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The judge should base his sentence on the objective and subjective 
seriousness of the offense so that the sentence is fair and in line with 
the offense and the offender. 
He should think about the objectives to be achieved by imposing a 
sentence. The sentence should be a deterrent for the accused and set an 
example for the people in the community, the region and even, in some 
cases, the province. But the sentence should also consider the actual or 
potential rehabilitation of the offender. The objectives that the judge 
has to consider are the following: the protection of society, 
retribution, deterrence, example, and the social rehabilitation of the 
offender and his protection against other sanctions. Considering all 
this, I believe that the present system strikes a balance and, as I was 
saying earlier, further improvements can always be made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another reason to oppose this bill—and I am saying this on a 
personal basis today, but also, knowing rather well my colleagues from 
the Bloc Quebecois, I believe there are a number of them that agree with 
me—is the possibility of an error in the judicial system. This is an 
extremely important reason and I think that even though our judicial 
system has proven itself, it is not infallible. 
No one in this House is infallible either. No judge is infallible, 
and I think there may be cases where individuals are found guilty who 
are not really guilty.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada, we have seen people spend 5, 10 or 15 years in jail who 
were later found to have been unfairly convicted and who were released 
after their files were reopened and a new investigation was conducted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that with the progress made in the medical field and in 
other fields, we can make the judicial system better or try to reduce 
the risk of mistakes being made, and I am referring here to 
deoxyribonucleic acid analysis, better known as DNA analysis. 
Such analyses may be used to link a given individual to a murder based 
on evidence found on the scene of the crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But even the best techniques will not prevent mistakes from being 
made and individuals from being convicted of murder in the first degree. 
If this House passed the hon. member's bill, these people would be 
executed, when it may be found ten years down the road that they were 
not guilty of the crimes they were accused of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, before taking a stand on this bill, I did what I had done 
before taking a stand on the bill introduced by my Reform colleague 
during the 35th Parliament: I read what had been written about it and 
checked what the experts had said. 
Criminal lawyers are not unanimous, but the vast majority of them, 
including Gisèle Côté-Harper, Antoine Manganas and Jean Turgeon, say 
that capital punishment does not have a deterrent effect in the case of 
first degree murder. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To conclude, as far as young offenders are concerned, the proposed 
amendment to the Young Offenders Act would completely upset the balance 
of this legislation. For these additional reasons, I am opposed to the 
hon. member's bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
have listened with interest to the debate this morning.  During 
the last Parliament, as I mentioned earlier, I put forward a bill 
which requested, consistent with Reform policy, a binding 
referendum on this issue.  It requested a binding referendum of 
the public, which has in polls, as other members have mentioned, 
consistently voted 65% or higher for the past 30 years in favour 
of the death penalty being reinstated. That is one thing which 
has not changed with time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An hon. member mentioned how times have changed and how issues 
have changed but the fact is that public opinion on this issue 
has not changed. What that tells us is that this place, where 
members have free votes and vote opposite the will of the people, 
is out of step with the people, or the people are out of step 
with Parliament. It is one of the two.  We have to do something 
to bring those two positions more closely together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One obvious way to do it is to involve the public in a 
referendum.  There would be extensive public debate.  Everybody 
would have the opportunity to put forward their point of view. In 
the end the community would make the decision about how it wants 
the country to run. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An hon. member grossly exaggerated about the way referenda work, 
saying we would be into referenda every year, that every five 
minutes there would be a referendum.  That is a lot of rubbish. I 
would challenge that member to point to a place anywhere in the 
world where referenda are common and where that happens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even Switzerland which has numerous referenda per month in the 
cantons simply does not get into the silly nonsense which the 
member mentioned of constantly revisiting issues.  Certainly they 
revisit issues but the timeframe tends to be a lot longer. 
Several years is not uncommon for a change in attitudes to alter 
something which needs to be brought forward in a referendum. 
The fact is that a referendum is a very good tool for getting 
public opinion.  There is a decent length of time to discuss the 
issue.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the moment it certainly looks as if the public would vote for 
the return of capital punishment. In discussions with my own 
constituents, because the majority of people in my riding favour 
its return, I have asked them what sort of checks and balances 
they would put in place if they were to vote to have capital 
punishment returned. What checks and balances would they have to 
avoid accidentally giving the death penalty to somebody who was 
innocent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most common suggestion I had is a good one.  It is that the 
jury which listens to the murder case has the opportunity to 
weigh all the evidence, to hear all of the circumstances behind 
the murder.  If the death penalty were to be returned the 
suggestion would be that the jury have the power to recommend to 
the judge the death penalty.  It would not be automatic.  It 
would be a recommendation of the jury. That overcomes one of the 
problems which was identified by one of the members where juries 
are afraid to convict people on that basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This suggestion was given to me by one of my constituents.  If 
we are ever faced with this situation we may get into that 
dialogue. If a jury was to have the power to recommend that sort 
of thing, then the judge is the final check and balance in 
accepting or rejecting the recommendation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I realize the bill before us today does not make provision for 
that.  If we were into a referendum type situation a lot of these 
suggestions would come forward.  It is important to remember 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another member mentioned that the trend was away from capital 
punishment.  In the United States, which is our closest 
neighbour, more and more states have been reintroducing capital 
punishment.  There is a growing desire for zero tolerance on 
crime in many of the United States.  Crime authorities are coming 
down harder and harder on crime and it is working. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, in New York City the police commissioner, who is an 
elected official in the United States, some years ago decided he 
would take a zero tolerance policy with respect to youth crime 
and general crime in the subways.  He ordered the police to 
arrest people even if they so much as spit on the sidewalk or put 
up a bit of graffiti.  Within a very few months that zero 
tolerance sent a message to the drug dealers, the murderers, the 
rapists that crime would not be tolerated and crime dropped 
dramatically on the New York subways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result that police commissioner was elected to become the 
mayor of the city.  He introduced much tougher crime control and 
the murder rate dropped something like 35% in about six months. 
There was a program on television about this recently. A woman 
who lived in one of the black ghettos said that in her entire 
lifetime of 30 years she had never had a day when there were not 
gunshots fired until that mayor was elected and had a zero 
tolerance on crime and started to clean up the way society was 
operating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a desire in society to get control of these criminal 
elements.  I look at youth crime in my area where graffiti is 
rampant.  I have been in Canada since 1979.  In Vancouver 
graffiti was almost unknown then.  When I came to Ottawa in 1993 
there was hardly any graffiti.  Now this whole town is covered in 
it.  My riding is covered in it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we had the same zero tolerance approach to things like youth 
crime, we would be in a much better situation today than we are. 
This bill represents a desire by the public to see their 
government, which is us, recognize their concerns and get back to 
zero tolerance of these crimes.  If we do not step down hard on 
things like graffiti, then we will naturally have to accept all 
sorts of serious crimes.  We saw on the weekend in Victoria where 
a 14 year old girl was murdered by a group of her peers.  We have 
to get the message across that we are not prepared to accept this 
type of crime.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite what some members have claimed there has been very 
consistent public opinion on the issue.  They want to see us 
return capital punishment to the law books.  The fact remains 
that this place is out of step with those people and that members 
who stand and arrogantly say they will defy the will of their 
constituents are doing them no service whatsoever. 
<P><A NAME="LINK11"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, as always, even if it was somewhat abbreviated the issue 
does end up producing quite a lively debate, as I am sure the 
people at home have noticed with some of the heckling back and 
forth across the Chamber during the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the short five minutes that I am given by the process to sum 
up, I would like to try to make as many points as possible to 
rebut some of what was said by the other representatives of the 
parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, it is key to note that the hon. member for London West, 
as well as others, denied the ability to put this very important 
issue to a vote.  In other words justice denied has been justice 
denied once more in the House.  It is my position and the 
position of a lot of people in the Reform Party of Canada that 
all Private Members' Business should be put to a vote whether it 
is a private member's bill or motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, I call the attention of the viewing public, or anyone 
who wants to follow the debate and do a little research on it, to 
the fact that the comments made by the hon. member for London 
West almost followed word by word the comments made by one of her 
former colleagues, Mr. Gordon Kirkby, who at the time was the 
parliamentary secretary to the minister of justice, as reported 
in <I>Hansard</I> of May 14, 1996, for anyone who would care to 
look up the speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  What happened to him? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill:</B>  What happened to him?  Exactly.  He was not 
re-elected in Prince Albert.  I am not saying that his position 
on capital punishment had anything to do with it, but it may have 
had a lot to do with the fact that he was viewed by the majority 
of constituents as not representing their wishes in parliament. 
That might have had a lot to do with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In reply to the hon. member for the NDP, he made some statement 
to the effect that if we could achieve public safety without 
capital punishment then why put in capital punishment.  I would 
ask him to ask those 12 families who lost loved ones between the 
years 1986 and 1995 because murderers were released, and in one 
case escaped, and murdered again.  That is not public safety.  I 
would like the hon. member to remember that when he says that 
some of these animals—and that is what I call them—will never 
ever be released from prison.  Obviously some of them are 
released because they are repeat offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In reply to the hon. member of the Bloc Quebecois, it is 
unfortunate that one of my colleagues and I found it necessary to 
rise on points of order during his intervention.  I do not like 
to see that happen during debate on Private Members' Business, 
but his comments clearly indicate that the Bloc Quebecois has no 
clue as to what Private Members' Business is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quite simply Private Members' Business, whether a motion or a 
bill, is for the private member.  That is why those that are 
deemed votable are put to a supposed free vote in the House of 
Commons.  It is not supposed to be along party lines. Therefore 
the member's comments about the fact that we wanted to dissociate 
ourselves from the Reform Party is simply not true. I am trying 
to represent my constituents, and even though it is not Reform 
Party policy I am bringing it forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I notice that I have but one minute left.  It is such a short 
period of time to debate such an important issue.  Speakers from 
all parties said likewise.  It is unfortunate that we did not 
have more time, more than just one short hour, to debate an issue 
supported by such a great number of Canadians.  As was clearly 
said the actual support for reinstatement of capital punishment 
is increasing after it dipped. 
In reply to the statement made by the NDP, it has never fallen 
below 50% that the Canadian people speak consistently in favour 
of reinstating capital punishment.

</I></B></P><P align=left>My final point is that if the majority of the members of 
Parliament do not have the courage to represent their 
constituents and reinstate the death penalty for first degree 
murder, I would certainly support the position recently 
articulated by Stockwell Day of Alberta.  Let us release these 
animals into the prison population and let them take care of the 
justice.

<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, I wish to thank all members of the House for 
co-operating in the speedy passage of this bill.  I would like to 
emphasize that all political parties are prepared to work 
together to pass this bill today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This, to me, says much about the Parliament of Canada.  Each 
day, our views on taxes, the environment, the Constitution and so 
forth may differ widely, but when it comes to debating a bill to 
save children and help innocent victims, we can work together. 
This is an important message to Canadians and an appeal to 
parliamentarians the world over to move swiftly to eliminate 
anti-personnel mines. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debate today is a very important one, as we understand it, 
that unites all parties and through uniting all parties brings

work quite literally, without exception, save the lives of 
thousands of people on an annual basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the last several years members on both sides have expressed 
themselves very eloquently and very forcefully on the matter.  I

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that we act together as a parliament to 
demonstrate that we are in a good position when countries come to 
Ottawa next week to sign the treaty.  The Prime Minister can be 
the first to turn over to the UN secretary general a ratification 
and begin the second part of the process.  It will not just be 
the signature but the actual ratification.  Within a matter of a 
few short months a basic minimum of 40 countries will have 
ratified the treaty, at which point it will become a binding 
international law requiring signatory countries to live up to its 
conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This movement has an interesting history.  It began with the 
enormous expression of will among thousands of individuals around 
the world.  It is a prime example of the new face and fact of 
international politics.  It is no longer just governments that 
make decisions.  It is what I have called the global commons, the 
new democracy of the international arena where NGOs, civil 
organizations and individuals are united together through the 
power of the new systems of telecommunications and information 
banded together over the years to draw to the attention of 
governments what a scourge this weapon is and how malicious it is 
in its application. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have seen nothing in my personal experience that more aptly 
demonstrates the evil that works in the minds of men than what I 
saw in Lebanon a week ago.  I visited young children in a 
hospital in southern Lebanon who had been maimed and handicapped 
by mines that were shaped in the form of toys.  The mines were 
not designed for military purposes but clearly to entice young 
children to pick them up.  The mere heat of their hands would 
detonate them and they would lose a limb such as an arm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are in a position today to take a stand against that kind of 
human malevolence.  We called together for a meeting 13 months 
ago in Ottawa like-minded countries and NGOs to see what we could 
do to take advantage of the mobilization of public opinion around 
the world and to take advantage of the extraordinary effort of 
NGOs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It became clear the conventional pathways would not work.  The 
normal corridors of disarmament discussion were becoming 
cul-de-sacs.  They were closed off to any meaningful approval. At 
that point we challenged the countries of the world to come to 
Ottawa a year later to sign a treaty.  In the first instance, if 
one had gauged the reaction, it was more scepticism and sometimes 
outright scoffing that any such thing could happen.  It was just 
not the way things were done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proof is that next week we expect over 100 countries to be 
in Ottawa to sign the treaty.  It shows a new sense of public 
participation in developing significant initiative in the 
international arena.  It is now one of the most powerful, 
important and significant developments of our time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a great commentary and tribute to members of Parliament 
and their work in various parliamentary associations around the 
world.  I recall resolutions being passed by groups like the IPU, 
the NATO assembly, and others.  Members have also played their 
own part in mobilizing that effort.  In some cases the onus has 
clearly moved on to parliamentary systems around the world.  It 
is now clearly within parliaments that ratification must take 
place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to point out that what was dubbed the Ottawa 
process is not simply a signature on a piece of paper.  It is not 
simply the fact of the treaty.  It is the fact that countries 
will be coming here not only to indicate their adherence to the 
new convention but to become actively involved in discussing how 
we can make it work. What we can now call the Ottawa process II 
is designed to bring countries together, to mobilize resources 
for de-mining and to use the effort that went into placing mines 
to now removing them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are 110 million land mines around the world, 600 to 800 
casualties a month, and 80% of the victims are civilian, children 
and other innocents.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, if I can just use a personal moment of when I was in the 
Golan Heights last week.  Our own peacekeepers, Canadians, along 
with Austrians and Japanese were required to undertake their 
duties in an unmarked area land mass so that each step was a 
potential disaster. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only about a week before I arrived, a young Austrian soldier 
lost his leg.  Here was a prime example of how the weapons 
themselves are not just a threat to fire up lands but in fact 
pose a danger to our own Canadian peacekeepers around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why our own army and our armed forces have taken such an 
active role in places like Cambodia and Bosnia to try to 
eliminate the land mines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think members of the foreign affairs committee who have just 
returned from Bosnia can speak for the fact themselves that that 
country, as real as it is with land mines, its ability to 
redevelop, to recreate some economic life and substance is 
substantially hindered because of the threat and fear that the 
next step may be one's last.  Who will go and plant a new crop 
when the plough may hit a land mine and end forever the life or 
certainly maim the individual? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The two purposes of the Ottawa meeting are to bring countries to 
sign the treaty and also to mobilize money, skill, commitment and 
engagement so that around the world they can engage in the 
massive test of taking mines out of the ground, of helping to 
rehabilitate the victims, not just to replace their limbs but 
also to help them restore a healthier view of life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nothing can be more traumatic for a young child who has been 
maimed by a land mine, to restore a sense of some confidence that 
the world is still a humane place and that the adult world still 
believes in them, and also to help the countries which have been 
marred and scarred by land mines to begin the slow process of 
redevelopment.  That will not happen overnight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That will take years but we can use the meetings in Ottawa next 
week to be the catalyst, to start that process and to begin to 
engage the commitment and the resources of countries around the 
world to begin the massive task of taking out land mines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some have said, and there are always comments and critics, that 
the land mine treaty does not include some of the big players, 
the United States, China, India, but it is important to note that 
it is already having its impact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>China has declared a moratorium on exports as has the United 
States.  The Prime Minister, in his talks with President Yeltsin 
in Russia, confirmed that they would continue to provide a 
moratorium and may be prepared to come to sign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting that even countries that are still in some 
ways in a state of conflict, Syria and Israel, have committed to 
come to the conference itself to begin exploring how they can 
become part of the broad movement to eliminate the world from 
land mines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not expecting miracles.  I do not expect conversions on the 
road to Damascus, but they will be here.  They will be part of 
the conversation.  They will be part of the discussions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, I would encourage colleagues in the House who will have 
opportunities to meet with these delegates and talk to them, to 
begin to look and to explore how we can work together with many 
of these countries to undertake projects in which we can help 
de-mine the Golan Heights or to eliminate the sources of conflict 
in Cyprus or wherever the case may be, where the mines themselves 
have become part of the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also true to say that a lot of work will have to be done 
in the area of developing more effective technologies to get rid 
of land mines.  Nothing is more primitive to me than watching a 
de-mining activity where trained people are literally out on the 
fields with a steel rod probing the ground in the hope that that 
prod will not hit the trigger and detonate the mine and then have 
to go through the painstaking exercise of slowly clearing the 
mines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do believe that there is, in the sense of our own technical 
excellence in countries around the world, the capacity and the 
will to develop new needs by which we can begin to eliminate 
these mines and to begin to help the countries affected by them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give one example that struck me as absolutely astounding. 
I think it is probably a well known fact that there is a new book 
out called <I>Aftermath</I> that talks about the consequences of 
war and what happens to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>France, one of the most sophisticated, civilized countries in 
the world, 75 years after the first world war, is still engaged 
in an active campaign of de-mining 16 million hectares of some of 
the most fertile land in France that is still polluted by the 
munitions left over after the first world war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lives are lost every year in de-mining activities 75 years 
later.  Think of what it must mean if that is the problem that 
France has.  What does it mean in Angola or Cambodia or Nicaragua 
where there are not nearly the resources or the capacity to make 
that kind of effort? 
We have an opportunity at the meetings that will take place in 
Ottawa next week to remind countries that a treaty is really the 
first step.  The next step is to make the treaty come to life, to 
give it meaning, to give it the tools and the resources needed to 
make it work.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before members today is a way of ensuring that under 
the laws of Canada we are in a position to fully implement the 
treaty.  Bill C-22 does several important things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, it bans the production, use, storage and transfer of 
anti-personnel mines in Canada.  It requires the destruction of 
all anti-personnel mines, except for training purposes.  It 
outlines provisions for the verification measures that the 
convention provides to ensure compliance with the provisions of 
the convention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-22 also criminalizes in Canadian law activities 
prohibited under the convention.  We have appended a text of the 
convention to the bill.  It demonstrates the integral 
relationship between Bill C-22 and the treaty that we are 
sponsoring next week in Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation proposed was prepared in a short timeframe.  In 
reviewing it further we thought it important to address some 
charter concerns.  In this context, we will be introducing an 
amendment to subsection 11.2 which provides charter safeguards to 
persons who are requested to provide information to the 
government concerning the acquisition or possession of land 
mines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this respect, the bill addresses potential charter concerns 
where appropriate warrants must be secured if fact finding 
missions wish to gain access to private facilities or residences. 
That way, once again we can use the protection of our courts as 
prescribed under our Criminal Code to ensure that there will be 
no abuse under the human rights provision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill and the convention differ slightly in some respects. 
The definition of mine and anti-personnel mine have been altered 
to make it more precise under Canadian law, not in any way to 
weaken it, but in fact to strengthen it so that any 
interpretation by the courts would be more clear and more 
effective.  In fact, these definitions are even stronger than 
those that are contained in the convention itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also includes provisions exempting properly 
de-activated mines that might used, for example, museum displays 
or kept as souvenirs.  It also exempts Canadian force members or 
peace officers, or appropriate officials who may need to 
temporarily possess anti-personnel mines in the context of their 
duties, for example, when delivering them for destruction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At home the legislation gives us the legal basis for ensuring 
that Canada can remain mine free for all time.  By legislating 
this bill into law, we formalize our commitment to stay out of 
the anti-personnel mine business forever. It means that we can 
send a message to all other countries of the same kind.  We can 
set a real example by being the first to ratify.  This will speed 
the process of getting the other 39 countries that are needed to 
bring the convention into binding force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The clock can start counting down today as we pass the bill 
which sets a measure and standard for all other countries to 
follow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The process can begin here in this Chamber.  I do not use the 
words lightly, but I do think this is a defining moment for this 
country, for the House of Commons and for the Parliament of 
Canada that we can once again take a major step of leadership. 
We have an opportunity to demonstrate our dedication to peace and 
to the elimination of suffering and to the welfare of children in 
mine affected countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call on all members of the House to join me in supporting Bill 
C-22, as they have in the past, as all members of Parliament of 
all parties have given their co-operation, involvement and in 
many cases their passion and engagement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting that the most effective and eloquent way of 
explaining the purpose and what we are doing comes not from long 
experienced parliamentarians, but oftentimes from the mouths of 
children.  In Toronto on Thursday I participated in a UNICEF 
event where a number of young children from Ancaster school had 
come together to launch a new videotape that is being sent to 
schools across Canada and, in fact, to schools in Cambodia to 
talk about the problems of land mines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These young grade four students of their own volition undertook 
to write their own treaty.  I thought a fitting end to my opening 
speech would be just to recount to the members of the treaty what 
they had to say as they presented this treaty to me. 
This is a bill of rights for children who live in countries where 
there are land mines.  These are the words they used: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>children have the right to know what land mines look like, and to 
learn about them 
</I></B></P><P align=left>children have the right to know where land mines are located 
</I></B></P><P align=left>children have the right to be in a land mine free area 
</I></B></P><P align=left>children have the right not to be teased when they are hurt by 
land mines 
</I></B></P><P align=left>children have the right to have the best possible medical 
treatment at no cost to the family 
</I></B></P><P align=left>children have the right to be supervised 
</I></B></P><P align=left>children have the right to have fun and respect, even when they 
are hurt 
</I></B></P><P align=left>children have the right to play and not get hurt 
</I></B></P><P align=left>c.  Children have the right to go to school, even if they are 
hurt

</I></B></P><P align=left>The children of Ancaster asked me to bring this children's 
treaty on land mines to the House of Commons to share it with my 
colleagues.  It demonstrates that this generation believes that 
Canada can make a difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recommend Bill C-22 to members of the House.  I ask members to 
make speedy passage possible and to say to the rest of the world 
that Canada will continue to take the lead to ensure that the 
world is land mine free for the children who wrote this treaty 
and who speak for children around the world.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am proud to speak on behalf of the Reform Party in 
supporting Bill C-22.  This bill is an example of what the House 
can do when members co-operate on an issue which is important to 
Canadians.  It is something which we stand for as a nation.  It 
goes to the very root of being Canadian.  Canada is a country for 
peace, it is a country for fairness and it is a country which 
looks to building a better world for all people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-22 is an example of what this House can do in the future. 
Reform has supported this process from the word “go”.  I hope 
this bill will be an example of what the government and the House 
can do in the future with respect to foreign policy as land mines 
are but a small part of the larger picture of conflict and 
conflict prevention in the late 20th century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that the minister and members of the Department of 
Foreign Affairs are interested in moving beyond this bill in 
developing foreign policy which deals not with the management of 
conflict but with the prevention of conflict.  We are approaching 
an era in foreign policy when Canada can use its moral suasive 
power to lead other like-minded nations in developing a more 
peaceful world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are not just words.  Rooted in them are pragmatic 
solutions which we can apply in the area of foreign policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to reflect on when I joined this process.  I was 
working in southern Africa on the Mozambique border in the 
mid-1980s and early 1990s.  At that time Mozambique was one of 
the worst countries in the world.  It was a nation racked by 
civil war and it was heavily mined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hospital was 20 kilometres from the border. Fifty thousand 
refugees had crossed the border looking for a better life.  They 
were looking for a safe haven.  Tragically, some of them had 
their legs blown off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My last experience was in 1992 when I went to visit my old boss 
in the hospital.  I was there on a social visit.  After being 
there for 15 minutes the call went out that someone had stepped 
on a land mine.  We rushed to the emergency department and then 
went directly to the operating room.  I remember this very 
vividly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we went through the operating room there, wide awake, sitting 
up, was a young 18 year old Mozambiquan lad.  He was looking 
toward the lower half of his body.  His leg was torn to pieces. 
His foot was turned the other way around.  Most of the muscle, 
tissue and sinew had been torn off his lower leg.  He had 
shrapnel injuries in his groin and lower abdomen.  He was very 
conscious of what was going on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was leaving Mozambique for South Africa for a better future 
for a safe future.  He wanted to get a job and live in peace. 
Instead, that day he stepped and heard a click that would change 
his life forever.

<A HREF="#LINKT17"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That young man is but an example of over 30,000 individuals from 
around the world who silently step on these devices and are blown 
to pieces.  Some die but many actually survive and they go on to 
live a life of poverty, a life of insecurity and a life that is 
only a shadow of what it could have been. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To give an indication of what this young man's life will be 
like, the leg was blown off.  We took three hours to amputate his 
leg above the knee.  He will probably require other surgeries in 
the future because he will be faced with infection, further 
revisions of his amputation.  He was lucky that the injury did 
not go further up or that the anti-personnel mine was not larger. 
Many people have their legs blown off at the hip. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the minister mentioned, some of these devices, if you can 
imagine, are actually designed like toys.  Some are designed like 
butterflies.  The children would pick them up naturally as they 
would and have their arms blown off; not to kill but to maim. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The perverse logic behind these devices is not that they are 
meant to kill, because that would be too simple.  They are meant 
to maim.  They are meant to maim because the person who is maimed 
is a constant reminder in that society of what mines can do and 
what the opposition, their enemy, can do to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are a constant economic drain to society.  They are a 
constant reminder, a constant example of fear that exists within 
the community to the people there.  These people are not 
belligerents.  They are not warriors. They are not soldiers. They 
are generally the public.  Land mines are not designed to affect 
soldiers primarily, contrary to popular belief.  Land mines are 
primarily designed to address and terrorize innocent civilians. 
They are a weapon of terror.  They are not, generally speaking, a 
weapon used by military. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was in Mozambique, to give an indication of what they 
were used for, mines were used to put around people's fields. 
They were used to place around people's watering holes. They were 
used to put around people's fields so that those individuals 
would have to pay money or allegiance to the opposing 
belligerents.  Otherwise they would be blown up and they could 
not feed themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mines also were used by guerrillas.  When areas such as dams 
were mined, guerrillas would go in, pick up the mines and use 
those mines to blow up the dam or the watering area. They do not 
have an appropriate military use in the 1990s, contrary to 
popular belief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The international committee of the Red Cross demonstrated this 
very conclusively and we are indebted to the hard work it did to 
give us the information, to diffuse the comments that land mines 
were actually a useful tool in war in the late 20th century. 
They are not.  That was the primary argument that was used 
against this process, that mines are useful.  They are supposed 
to be used for military purposes.  They are not. They are a 
weapon of terror, a weapon against the public, and that is why 
this bill is being put forward, to ban. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be remiss if I did not mention the very important 
contribution that was made by members of the public from Canada, 
members of the international community and especially Mines 
Action Canada who have done an outstanding job of pursuing and 
pushing this agenda for the last four years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform has been on it right from the beginning, because we put 
forward private members' bills starting at the beginning of 1995 
and when Mr. Ouellet came on board to support it, we were very 
happy, and when the Minister of Foreign Affairs came on board to 
support it and start the Ottawa process, we were also happy to 
support that initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members from the Department of Foreign Affairs such Jill 
Sinclair, Bob Lawson, Ralph Lysyshyn have done an outstanding job 
in pushing this issue within the department and also 
internationally.  I might also say that their work in Oslo was 
something Canadians can be proud of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Americans tried to water this treaty down.  They tried to 
water it down so there were huge loopholes through it that would 
have made it not worth the paper it was written on.  Instead, a 
charge was led by Canadian members of the Department of Foreign 
Affairs who were there who managed to mobilize support from other 
countries to ensure that the bill that was constructed in Oslo 
was going to be a bill we were proud of, a bill with teeth, a 
bill that would actually be effective for once in trying to ban 
these land mines. 
That is something that we as Canadians can be very proud of.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like for a few minutes to illustrate the scope of the 
problem of land mines.  There are over 30,000 seeded all over the 
world.  They inflict damages in various countries that are 
absolutely horrendous.  In Angola 1 in 270 people is a mine 
victim and a similar number in Cambodia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes beyond that.  Land mines sit in the ground for over 50 
years.  As the minister mentioned, France has land mines that are 
blowing up people today.  The most land mined country in the 
world is Egypt.  Those land mines were seeded in the second world 
war and continue to blow up people every day.  Land mines also 
continue to sit in the soil and cause huge economic devastation 
to countries that do not need this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not forget that most of these land mines are seeded in 
countries among the poorest of the world.  The land mines sitting 
there for over 50 years prevent countries from economically 
getting on their feet.  It has become such a serious problem in 
countries such as Angola and Mozambique that innocent civilians 
are prepared to go into mined areas to plough their fields to 
feed themselves.  It now becomes a choice, chancing getting blown 
up or starving to death. Those are the cold hard realities, the 
cold hard choices that some of the poorest people in the world 
have to make every day. We should be ashamed that these devices 
were ever constructed and allowed to be tossed out in the manner 
which they have done for the last 80 plus years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those costs are enormous.  In Croatia over thousands and 
thousands of hectares are mined, costing over a quarter of a 
billion dollars each year in lost productivity.  Countries from 
Angola to Cambodia to Chechnya are so mined that they cannot get 
on their feet economically for decades. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The overall cost of demining is estimated at over $50 billion 
per year.  These devices cost as little as $7 to $30 to make, yet 
each mine costs between $300 and $1,000 to remove.  This cost 
will not be borne by the countries that are mined.  It will be 
borne by the international community.  We as nations do not have 
the money to do this.  That is why this bill is so important. 
That this bill went through in such a rapid motion is something 
that Canadians can be proud of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The process started four years ago and by international 
standards took place at light speed.  There a few interesting 
things we can learn from this.  First, we were not prepared as a 
nation to settle for a treaty that was going to be merely one 
which was developed by consensus.  Usually when you push forth a 
treaty by consensus we get a piece of paper that is pabulum. We 
get a treaty that is not worth the paper it is written on because 
there as so many loopholes it becomes unworkable and 
unmanageable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead we did not settle for second best.  We settled for a 
situation that we knew the majority of the countries of the world 
would support.  We went by a process of majority.  Therefore we 
have a treaty which has teeth for a change.  We also set a 
deadline.  The minister set a deadline a year ago that this 
December would be the month we would settle on a treaty. It is 
something that we as Reformers can heartily support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are sick and tired of treaties taking decades to push forward 
when we know the majority of the international community will 
support them.  While we dither on many of these issues lives are 
lost, countries are laid to waste, economies are destroyed and in 
fact we domestically pay a penalty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When wars take place half a world away they do come to roost 
with us.  Wars create refugees. Because we signed the convention 
on refugees we are obligated to bring refugees on to our soil. 
These tragic souls who would prefer to live in their own nations 
come to us looking for reprieve.  It costs Canadians $75,000 per 
refugee to integrate them, a cost which is put on our already 
burdened social programs.  Our defence budgets also incur great 
costs.

<A HREF="#LINKT19"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result we also put our soldiers in harm's way.  Land mines 
have racked an enormous toll not only on people far away but on 
our own military.  Peacekeepers fear land mines more than they 
fear the sniper's bullet.  If we look at the casualties that we 
have incurred of our peacekeepers the majority are as a result of 
land mines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, we have the tragic case of a peacekeeper whose parents 
live on the northern part of Vancouver Island. Their son was 
tragically blown up in the former Yugoslavia by a land mine. They 
have worked very hard to bring this issue to the forefront. This 
is a cost that we all bear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further, when countries are trying to get back on their feet our 
aid and development budgets come into play in trying to demine 
and reconstruct societies and economies that have been laid to 
waste by war, and land mines contribute to this continual 
destruction within their economies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Ottawa process is important because it heralds a new 
co-operation between NGOs, non-governmental organizations, and 
government.  We must not let this process die. For within this 
process lies hope to use and apply these lessons learned into 
other foreign policy initiatives in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From 1945 to 1985 the international community has lurched from 
one conflict to another. We have watched the precursors to 
conflict exist right in front of our eyes.  From Rwanda to the 
former Soviet Union, Cambodia, Burma, Central America wars have 
littered this globe and internecine conflicts have destroyed many 
economies and cost millions of lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We live in a world where rules are based on what was created 
after 1945.  That world has changed.  Between 1945 and 1985 the 
United Nations put forth six peacekeeping operations which cost 
roughly $3 billion.  Between 1985 and now we have had over 26 
peacekeeping operations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The post-cold war era has set forth a new era, a new set of 
rules and a new set of challenges.  We have not met those 
challenges.  In fact, we have failed abysmally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather than trying to prevent conflict, we have tried to manage 
it with all the costs that are incurred in that.  We have watched 
in front of our eyes as nations have imploded, millions of people 
killed, economies destroyed and the seeds of ethnic hatred and 
discontent laid to bear and sewn for generations to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a penalty we will all pay.  It is high time that we 
started to recognize that conflict management is not acceptable 
in foreign policy any more.  We have to look ahead at preventing 
conflict and move our foreign policies from conflict management 
to conflict prevention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is where the Ottawa process can come into play.  The NGO 
community is usually the first group in the trenches witnessing 
the precursors to conflict and the rapid inappropriate 
militarization, the human rights abuses, the collapse of 
governmental and judicial structures.  All these things are 
witnessed by NGOs.  They often communicate their wishes to 
governmental structures but it hits the usual inertia that exists 
within government and within international governments in 
particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of this inertia, as a result of this inaction, we 
have paid the price.  Those who live far away have paid a far 
greater price.  We have to change this thinking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that we use the NGO community, use the 
conglomeration of NGOs part of this Ottawa process, as an early 
warning system that can identify countries that are ready to 
implode, identify the precursors to conflict and funnel this 
information directly to a central organization, an early warning 
system. 
Perhaps the most logical choice would be the UN crisis centre in 
New York.  For all that can be said about the United Nations with 
all of its inefficiencies, it is perhaps the only choice we have 
today.  Even if the United Nations were to be removed or were to 
fall apart, we would have to create something to take its place. 
Therein lies another challenge which I might get to later on in 
my speech, the restructuring and revamping of the United Nations.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The UN crisis centre could take all the information that is 
presented to it as an early warning organization and feed it 
directly into the United Nations.  We must then have an existing 
group of responses by the international community to respond to 
these precursors.  Such responses could be diplomatic 
initiatives, peace building initiatives and the introduction of 
positive information to dispel propaganda that is often used at 
the start of a conflict. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at conflicts from Rwanda to the former Yugoslavia, 
one of the favoured tools that is used by a small number of 
individuals is to put forth negative propaganda to demonize 
another group.  As Michael Ignatieff said in one of his articles, 
often these groups are very similar but they exist on the 
narcissism of their differences.  They exist on demonizing the 
small differences that exist between different ethnic groups.  In 
doing this, they polarize the ethnic groups which enables them to 
create an engendered fear, hatred, loathing and ultimately war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That cycle must be broken. It can be broken.  Once the 
precursors are identified, positive propaganda can be put in 
there.  In fact the United Nations already has the power to do 
that through shortwave radio and existing communications tools 
that it has. It is exceedingly important that the UN get involved 
through diplomatic initiatives and positive propaganda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore a tool that is not being used often is the tool of 
economics.  Many of these countries rely on international 
financial institutions in order to survive.  They also spend 
moneys given to them by the World Bank, the International 
Monetary Fund and other IFIs on inappropriate militarization and 
to cause conflict. Wars need money.  You cannot run a war without 
money.  Therefore, if this is occurring, choke off the money 
supply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The IFIs can be used not only as a stick but also as a carrot. 
As a stick we can withhold further loans, withhold their ability 
to renegotiate loans, moneys and grants and call back loans if 
necessary.  We can also use them to freeze the assets of rulers 
who are patently engaging in activities that are going to 
compromise their people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could freeze the assets of rulers such as the late Mobutu 
Sese Seko who was one of the richest men in the world. There are 
the assets of Daniel Arap Moi of Kenya, when he engages in 
efforts to try to kill different ethnic groups within his 
country, when he tries to pit Kalenjin against Masai or Masai 
against Kikuyu.  These kinds of activities can be stopped by 
directly addressing the people responsible who are often a small 
cadre of individuals within a nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The IFIs could also be used as a carrot.  By lending money to 
provide peacemaking initiatives between different groups, by 
supporting peace building initiatives, by supporting activities 
that bring both of the groups together, by micro credit for 
minority groups so that they can get on their feet economically, 
by rewarding efforts to build structures of good governance and 
peace within a country, we can help to diffuse the precursors to 
war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a big task.  Again it is going to require organizations 
such as NGOs and governments to do this.  When it comes to nation 
states taking a role in this, I believe that no other nation 
would be better at it than Canada, not alone but as an organizer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the late 20th century going into the 21st century there 
exists a void in foreign policy.  The bipolar world created a 
world where two superpowers glared at each other at the end of a 
nuclear arsenal and under the absurd notion of mutual 
destruction. 
The world has changed.  As that bipolar world collapsed, the 
shackles that held ethnic groups apart and kept ethnic hatreds 
simmering were removed and conflicts existed.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Countries such as the United States and many members of the 
security council cannot be the nation states that will bring 
other countries together.  They are either perceived, rightly or 
wrongly, as having imperialistic tendencies or they have their 
own colonial baggage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The world is looking for a new group of individuals to bring 
nation states together. I believe that responsibility will fall 
on the middle powers such as Austria, Australia, Costa Rica, New 
Zealand, Norway and Canada.  Many of these nations are working in 
isolation on peace building initiatives.  It is more efficient 
for these nations to work together in a multilateral fashion but 
no one is assuming the leadership role that would bring these 
countries together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada can be that country. We have proven through the land 
mines issue that we have the moral suasive power to do this.  We 
have proven through our Nobel peace prize for our peacekeeping 
efforts that we can develop international consensus for peace 
building.  We have the diplomatic skills.  We have the personnel 
in the Department of Foreign Affairs and we have an international 
reputation that is virtually unrivalled.  We also have the 
security aspect and are involved with people from the Pacific Rim 
to Europe and to points south. We are in an enviable position to 
do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we end the 20th century and enter the 21st century, I can 
only ask the minister to work with his colleagues in countries 
such as those I have mentioned.  He could ask them to come to 
Canada to attend a small summit, a summit of the middle powers. 
He could bring these countries together, put the cards on the 
table and determine what everyone is working on in peace 
building. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was in Norway at the Oslo treaty signing on land mines. I 
spoke to members of other countries, such as the Norwegians.  I 
was interested to learn about their work. I found it remarkable 
that their work is very similar to our work.  It is unfortunate 
that we are working in isolation.  Our power to move 
international foreign policy forward can come about more 
expeditiously if we work together.  There will be a lot of 
co-operation and like-mindedness if we pursue that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the foreign minister, the government and other members in 
this House to come together to pursue this course.  Only if we do 
this can we get the required changes to stop the international 
bureaucratic inertia in international foreign policy.  We could 
then address the security issues that affect us all. By security 
challenges and issues I refer not only to military security 
challenges but also to environmental security issues. 
Environmental issues range from our problems at the north pole to 
nuclear issues and to issues of the environment.  All will 
require international co-operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By working with six to ten countries we can develop that 
nucleus.  With that nucleus we can all sing from the same 
songbook and bring other countries together much as we did in the 
Ottawa process.  The Ottawa process did not start with 100 
countries all wanting to ban land mines.  It started with a 
handful of countries, with the leadership of the NGO community 
and with the leadership of Canada and a few other nations. We can 
apply that same principle to pursue larger security issues and 
larger security challenges in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that we as a nation and as a Parliament can look forward 
to a future of addressing these larger security challenges.  If 
we continue to lurch from conflict to conflict and do not try to 
prevent conflict, then we will be set with an unsustainable 
situation in the near future.  We can no longer afford to see the 
implosion of nation states across this globe.  We can no longer 
afford to see the proliferation of this destruction. 
If we want to speak pragmatically and domestically, these issues 
that occur half a world away will sooner or later come to roost 
in our own backyard.  It is imperative that we deal with it now.

use our moral suasive power, use the tools that are at our

all Canadians can be proud.  Reform is very proud to be part of 
the process because we have been pursuing peacekeeping 
initiatives for many, many years and we will continue to do so. 
We look forward to working with the government in pursuing 
pragmatic, effective peacekeeping and peacemaking solutions in 
the future. We hope that we will be able to do this in a way that 
will make Canadians proud. We can build on our history of Pearson 
diplomacy now with the land mines process, and live up to our 
heritage as Canadians and as peacemakers and pursue a course that 
will build a stronger, safer future for nation states around the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois—Salaberry, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
when Alfred Nobel, the inventor of dynamite, decided to establish 
the prizes that would make his name a household word, he said that 
the main dividends of his invention should be used to promote peace 
in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997, the dividends went to the International Campaign to 
Ban Land Mines and its co-ordinator, Jody Williams, in recognition 
of more than six years of intense efforts by more than a thousand 
non-governmental organizations in over 60 countries. 
Thanks to this campaign, described by the former Secretary General 
of the United Nations, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, as the most important 
and effective exercise in civilian society since World War II, 
several countries banned the export of anti-personnel mines, 
destroyed or began to destroy their stocks of mines, banned or 
halted their use, or announced that they were ceasing production of 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These efforts by civilian society, which thus forced all 
governments the world over to react to the scourge of 
anti-personnel mines, would probably never have resulted in the 
convention to ban these mines, but for the initiative and 
determination of Canada's current Minister of Foreign Affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By bringing together representatives of governments, 
international organizations and NGOs in the federal capital in 
October 1996, and by initiating the Ottawa process, the minister 
assumed a leadership role that will culminate in the signing, on 
December 3 and 4, of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, 
Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on 
their Destruction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Ottawa process was marked not only by unprecedented 
co-operation on the part of government and non-government actors 
in the international community, but particularly by its speed of 
execution.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether in Vienna, Bonn or Brussels, these numerous players always 
kept in mind the deadline proposed by the Canadian Minister of Foreign 
Affairs, in October 1996. Less than a year after the challenge issued by 
the minister, on September 18, in Oslo, they approved the text of a 
convention to totally prohibit anti-personnel mines. Bill C-22 seeks to 
implement this convention, and the House is being asked to give speedy 
approval to it today, both at second and third readings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to say that the Bloc Quebecois will support Bill C-22, 
subject to a number of amendments being considered, so as to improve 
this implementing legislation. 
Support for the bill is first and foremost support for a convention to 
work together to maintain international peace and security, as stated in 
the preamble to the UN charter, to which Canada is a signatory, and 
which a sovereign Quebec will fully support when it joins the other 
nations of the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an instrument which primarily seeks to eliminate deadly 
weapons, namely anti-personnel mines, by prohibiting their use, 
stockpiling, production, conservation and transfer. Hopefully, the 
general obligations assumed by the states will put an end to the use of 
anti-personnel mines, which is still a serious problem, given that for 
every mine removed, 20 new ones are installed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This convention will contribute to the destruction of the 110 
million mines distributed throughout more than 70 countries in the 
world, which mutilate in excess of 25,000 people yearly, 80% of 
them civilians.  Anti-personnel mines claim 70 new victims every 
day, or one person every 20 minutes.  During the time I am speaking 
here today, one more person will be killed, or if lucky only maimed 
by this little instrument of death.  This victim is likely to be a 
child, probably a child in Afghanistan, Cambodia or Somalia, since 
many of the deaths and injuries caused by land mines in those 
countries involve children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This convention will also encourage the destruction of 
anti-personnel mines in mined areas and will oblige signatory 
states to ensure that mines are destroyed within ten years of the 
effective date of the convention, at the very latest. These will 
be onerous obligations, very much so, for states such as 
Bosnia-Hercegovina, which alone has more than one million mines 
hidden in its territory as I learned during a recent 
parliamentary mission.  But they will also be onerous for 
developing countries such as Angola, Croatia, Eritrea, Iraq, 
Mozambique, the Sudan and Vietnam. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farm lands remain unworked and large grazing areas unused, and 
will remain so as long as the land remains riddled with 
anti-personnel mines and burden these countries with deaths and 
injuries, and the costs related to victim assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this connection, the convention rightly promises 
international co-operation and assistance, without which the 
objectives of the convention cannot be met. 
The convention gives each state party the right to seek and to 
obtain assistance from other signatory states, if possible and 
insofar as possible.  The state parties that are in a position to 
do so commit, moreover, to provide assistance for the care of mine 
victims, as well as assistance in mine removal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In article 9 of the convention, the state parties also commit 
to “all appropriate legal, administrative and other measures, 
including the imposition of penal sanctions, to prevent and 
suppress any activity prohibited to a State Party under this 
Convention  undertaken by persons or on territory under its 
jurisdiction or control”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-22 seems to be the primary legislative means of 
assuming this obligation, and seeks to give legal effect in Canada 
to the Convention as a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have examined the text of Bill C-22 closely and it seems to 
me to contain the necessary provisions for performance in good 
faith of the anti-personnel mines convention, as required by the 
pacta sunt servanda rule set out in article 26 of the Vienna 
Convention on the Law of Treaties.  There are, however, certain 
amendments that could improve this implementing legislation and I 
will have an opportunity shortly, in committee at report stage, to 
present and explain the amendments the Bloc Quebecois would like to 
see made to Bill C-22. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As with other foreign affairs issues, the Bloc Quebecois is 
motivated by the values and convictions common to the government 
party and to other parties in the House.  In this instance, the 
values of international peace and security are involved, as are the 
values associated with promoting and protecting rights and 
freedoms, particularly the most basic right, the right to life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why the Bloc Quebecois is prepared to support Bill C-22 
and the convention it is intended to implement, as they are both 
the reflection of such values.  In a few moments, the Bloc 
Quebecois will submit to the House suggested amendments to 
improve the bill and to make more democratic the process by which 
possible amendments to it would be passed in future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The passage of Bill C-22 by the House of Commons, its 
subsequent approval by the Senate, and assent will enable the 
Government of Canada to complete phase 1 of the Ottawa process. 
And although phase 1 of the process will have been effective, phase 
2, which will focus on international assistance and co-operation, 
must succeed if we want to see the objectives of the anti-personnel 
mines convention achieved.  Other measures will have to be 
implemented, and the Bloc Quebecois will continue to support those 
that will help attain the convention's objectives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In another moment of insight, and wisdom it should be added, 
the Swede Alfred Nobel said, and I quote: 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<“My factories may make an end of war sooner than your 
congresses.  The day when two army corps can annihilate each 
other in one second, all civilized nations, it is to be hoped, 
will recoil from war and discharge their troops”. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliaments the world over must go on repeating the wishes 
expressed by Alfred Nobel.  They must join forces with civilian 
society and international organizations in promoting peace and 
protecting humankind from the scourge of war so that humanity can 
triumph.

up to the expectations that he has and that we share with him for 
Canada as a country that shows leadership in the building of an 
international regime which leads toward the prevention of war and 
the elimination of the kind of violence that land mines stand 
for.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was interesting listening to the hon. member from Vancouver 
Island.  One got a sense of the revulsion that in this case 
medical personnel who have worked with the consequences of land 
mines bring to this debate. I also had an image of an earlier 
revulsion that people had coming out of the first world war with 
respect to the effect of chemical weapons and the effort that was 
made after that to ensure they would not be used again as a 
matter of course in the exercise of war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is too bad I suppose that we did not learn the lesson about 
land mines 80 years ago.  It was mentioned that France is still 
suffering from the effects of the first world war and I recall 
that when I was part of a parliamentary delegation to Vimy in 
1992 it was reported to me that some 26 farmers in the previous 
year had been killed by land mines still embedded in the earth in 
France, this in the 1990s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see that land mines are in some ways a symbol of what has 
happened in the 20th century.  Civilians as much or more in many 
respects than military personnel have come to be the objects of 
military technology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point I want to emphasize in today's debate is I hope that 
today might be the beginning by example of what I regard to be an 
equally and perhaps ultimately in the planetary sense a more 
important effort and that is to ban another kind of weapon which 
has as its primary target civilians and not military personnel. 
Of course what I am speaking about are nuclear weapons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure the minister shares this hope and I would urge him to 
build on the example of the anti-mine campaign that it would be 
wonderful in the greatest and most full sense of being wonderful 
if we could have a similar campaign with respect to the abolition 
of nuclear weapons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a lot of people of course around the world who are 
working on this but they are a minority.  They need to become a 
majority in government circles and in international circles.  The 
example we need to take from this is not just the successful way 
in which governments, in particular in this case the Canadian 
government, led the way, but governments, international agencies, 
NGOs, interested individuals, political parties and non-partisan 
co-operation. We also need to take the example that this was done 
by Canada without insisting on what we sometimes, it seems to me 
too often, insist on and that is that we have to have the United 
States on board before something can be signed, before there can 
be a consensus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously when it comes to nuclear weapons, if we do not have 
the people with nuclear weapons on board, we do not have much of 
a treaty or an accomplishment.  But there are other things that 
can be done with respect to the testing of nuclear weapons 
technology and the trading of nuclear related products and so on. 
There are a number of ways in which we could begin to build an 
international consensus against those things which contribute to 
the continued existence of nuclear weapons. 
We should take this action on mines as an example of what we can 
do when we are prepared to act without the consent or approval of 
the United States or for that matter other major powers.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not feel we are doing anything less important today 
because the United States has not agreed.  If the United States 
had agreed and if Russia and other larger countries had joined, 
in a practical sense we would feel much more was being 
accomplished.  That does not take away from what is being 
accomplished at the lesser practical level but also at the moral 
and political levels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the minister I am sure hopes and as all of us here hope, it 
may be that the other countries which have not yet done so will 
some day sign on to this treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A couple of years ago I participated in one of the earlier round 
table discussions on this topic.  It was held at the National 
Conference Centre.  It was stressed that we should do whatever we 
could to successfully abolish anti-personnel mines.  At that time 
we were still dreaming of what is now unfolding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will repeat the point I made that day.  I said that this would 
become a prototype for what we could do with respect to other 
problems which needed to be addressed, in particular that of 
nuclear weapons.  We need to abolish them while we have this 
window of opportunity after the cold war and before another 
situation occurs between the nuclear powers which would make the 
abolition of nuclear weapons very remote once again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP has been supportive of the initiative from the 
beginning.  We have presented a number of private members' 
motions on it over the years, as have other parties.  We are very 
glad to see it come to fruition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We extend our congratulations to the NGOs that have been 
involved and organizations such as Mines Action Canada, the Red 
Cross, UNICEF and all others that laid the groundwork for public 
support for a ban on land mines.  A very important thing is 
happening out there which the minister has acknowledged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A tremendous critical mass that developed at the political, the 
NGO, the bureaucratic and the parliamentary levels has made this 
kind of thing possible and has given it the kind of momentum that 
made it irresistible to many other countries.  At a certain point 
people want to become part of a good thing that is happening.  We 
need to make other good things happen that people will want to 
become part of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also want to commemorate the tremendous role Princess Diana 
played in raising awareness of the daunting task of banning land 
mines.  We also want to extend our congratulations to Jodie 
Williams, the American activist who spearheaded the international 
campaign to ban land mines, and all the NGOs involved in that 
campaign around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an example of how Canadian diplomacy can succeed if 
effort and energy are focused on items other than trade 
promotion. It seems to me that one unfortunate aspect of Canadian 
foreign policy over the last several years has been the almost 
exclusive focus on trade promotion.  It has taken away from our 
efforts in other areas. 
I say almost exclusive because obviously it was not exclusive. 
There were other things going on like this.

it freed up some of its energy, mental, fiscal and political; if 
it spent less time on trade promotion and team Canada, and if it 
spent more time trying to develop team world when it comes to 
banning land mines and nuclear weapons and developing a way to 
deal with other global problems of such urgency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has to be very careful to back up the 
treaty with the financial support it will need.  When it does so 
we want to make clear that it will have the support of members 
from this corner of the House.  It will not be cheap in a 
worldwide sense or in any sense to support the kind of de-mining 
that needs to go on and to rehabilitate victims.  We urge the 
minister to find the resources necessary.  We hope that will be 
one way in which the government can make an ongoing commitment to 
the values and the policies to which we are committing ourselves 
today in this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a good day for parliament and a good day for Canada. I 
hope 20 years from now we will be able to look back on this day, 
look back on the Ottawa process and say this became a model, a 
prototype, a paradigm for how we deal with other pressing 
disarmament issues.  In particular I hope we will look back on it 
and say it became a model for eventually bringing the world to 
the point where we were able to abolish, not just land mines and 
small gun trade but nuclear weapons and the threat to creation 
and to the human prospect that continued existence of these 
weapons poses for all humankind.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Sheila Finestone (Mount Royal, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I have listened to the debate today in the House.  It 
has really been a pleasure to hear honest and concerned 
parliamentarians address issues found in a civil society that are 
very disturbing and detrimental to the well-being and health of 
ordinary children, farmers and our peacekeepers.  We see land 
mines of all shapes and forms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the distinct privilege to go with the Minister of Foreign 
Affairs.  His manner is profoundly founded in a belief of the 
importance of ridding the world of land mines. It is not only a 
matter of de-mining but also a matter of education and 
sensitization.  First and foremost it is a matter of having the 
world agree that unacceptable mines which destroy the lives and 
the limbs of young children and others in society do not reflect 
the best interests of anybody. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened to what my hon. colleague had to say.  What role does 
he think each and every one of us could play internationally as 
well as nationally?  In our ridings we have a right and 
responsibility to indicate to people how devilish these 
instruments are as we do to colleagues we have had the privilege 
of meeting around the world through the international 
associations with which we are affiliated.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should encourage our members to be in touch with members in 
other countries to enable legislation, this treaty or this 
declaration, to be put forward in a way that would be expeditious 
and constructive and to ensure the financing is behind it in each 
of country of the world, even countries which at the moment are 
not prepared to sign but have the means to rehabilitate, educate 
and train those who have been affected and those who could be 
affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How would the hon. member look at that issue? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>   Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for her question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all have a responsibility to use every opportunity that 
presents itself and not to be afraid to be intense about it when 
we are in contact with members of Parliament, legislators and 
political people from all parts of the world.  We have plenty of 
those opportunities as individual members of Parliament in the 
various parliamentary associations we belong to and the various 
international fora we participate in as members of a Canadian 
delegation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At these meetings and in life generally there is a tendency for 
people to back off when somebody is intense about something, 
trying to be persuasive and trying to make the case that this is 
something we should do.  It is sort of not cool to be like that. 
We put certain things on the record. They are there and we can 
always say that we said them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to go beyond that whenever we have the chance to 
buttonhole people over dinner, in the corridors or through 
concerted pressure to make sure these items are on the agenda, 
that they are discussed and that decisions are taken.  People 
should be put on the spot and made to think about it.  These are 
the kinds of things Canadians can do in various international 
gatherings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past we have attended many gatherings where we have met 
all kinds of people.  In this case we could be corresponding with 
legislators in countries that have not signed on and trying to 
make the case that their countries should sign on, or at least 
put a little pressure on them to put a little pressure on their 
executive to get with it and follow the Canadian example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Sheila Finestone:</B>  Madam Speaker, I have a 
supplementary question for the hon. member. I am pleased he 
mentioned emotion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Exhibits are being planned for either the railway room or the 
reading room.  I hope the member will invite people he knows to 
come here.  He should even welcome to Canada those 
parliamentarians he does not know.  He should be a host in the 
name of the Minister for Foreign Affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The exhibits will make us heartsick.  We will see dreadful 
little mines in the form toys that attract children so that they 
will pick them up to have them explode in their hands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We saw children with lost hands, lost legs and damaged limbs. It 
is very easy to speak with the emotion the member referred to.  I 
am happy he raised it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a truly international cause.  I believe Canada could do 
an excellent job, certainly our parliamentarians and our 
international parliamentary organizations.  One day I hope the 
Reform Party decides to join to find out what is going on outside 
the boundaries of Canada and to learn about the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the member for that observation.  Would he care to 
respond about the Reform Party in particular? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Madam Speaker, I do not care to respond 
because I do not want to spoil what I think is a co-operative 
non-partisan effort going on here today.  There will be other 
opportunities to reflect on the differences that exist between 
the parties with respect to participation in some parliamentary 
associations and not others.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just want to say that when we think about the mines that are 
constructed to appear to be toys so that children will pick them 
up, it makes us kind of ashamed to be human beings when we think 
that these weapons were devised by the human mind and constructed 
by human hands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is hard to conceive of a world in which this would be 
possible but this is the world we are confronted with and against 
which we set ourselves today as a country alongside so many other 
countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From a theological and biblical point of view, it reminds us of 
what a sinful world we live in.  However, we look to the words of 
Isaiah.  We want to finally beat swords into ploughshares and 
spears into pruning hooks.  By finally getting rid of land mines 
in many countries, as the member from the Reform Party said, we 
actually want to create a world that is safe for ploughshares. So 
many people cannot plough and grow food and cannot economically 
develop because of land mines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The old metaphor about swords into ploughshares and spears into 
pruning hooks seems to be doubly applicable here.  It is not just 
a question of beating swords into ploughshares.  It is a case of 
creating a world in which ploughshares can be employed without 
danger to life and limb.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just want to mention that the member for Mount Royal is 
deliberately misleading this House when she mentions— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  A point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  The whip.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont—Dundas, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
do not think that is a point of order.  It is possibly a matter 
of debate but I certainly do not think we should take the House 
down this path on a day where such an issue is being debated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Would the hon. member 
care to rephrase his comments? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  Yes, Madam Speaker.  The member for 
Mount Royal, perhaps unwittingly, misled this House by saying 
that the Reform Party did not understand what was going on 
outside of its borders.  I did not want to bring this up during 
this debate but I will have her know that it was the Reform Party 
that in this House in 1994 started the process on land mines by 
presenting a private member's bill in this House calling for a 
ban on land mines.  It was the government that refused— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I am afraid you are 
going into debate right now.  We will resume debate with the hon. 
member for Kings—Hants. 
<P><A NAME="LINK24"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
Canadians should feel a great deal of pride in this significant 
accomplishment today.  Canada has regained for a brief moment its 
traditional role as a middle power and has relinked human rights 
and foreign policy which many Canadians have been concerned about 
since 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Foreign Affairs has demonstrated leadership in 
championing the ban on anti-personnel mines and it has paid off. 
On behalf of my party, I congratulate the minister on this 
accomplishment.  I would also like to take the time to 
congratulate Jody Williams as well as all the NGOs and 
individuals, including Princess Diana, who provided an 
international focus and a popular focus on this very important 
issue at a time when it needed that critical mass of support 
internationally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every year more than 20,000 people are injured by land mines. 
These people are not all soldiers trying to take a hill.  Most of 
these people are not even soldiers trying to clear land mines.

<A HREF="#LINKT30"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people that are most vulnerable to these land mines are 
civilians.  Two weeks ago I travelled to Bosnia as part of a 
delegation of MPs from the Defence and Foreign Affairs 
committees.  In Bosnia I witnessed first hand the devastation and 
suffering caused by land mines.  Canadian peacekeepers provide 
mine awareness programs in elementary schools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was surprised and, in fact, disturbed by the level of 
familiarity that children already have with land mines.  Children 
have nicknames for land mines.  Some are called Skoal mines 
because they are shaped like a tobacco can.  Some mines similarly 
are called camera mines because they resemble a camera.  Some are 
called pineapple mines because of the fact that they resemble 
pineapples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that the innocence of childhood cannot coexist 
with an intimate knowledge of and familiarity with land mines. In 
Bosnia, mines are being redeployed around houses to prevent the 
return of refugees and displaced people to their homes. Mines are 
being redeployed around farmers' fields to prevent theft.  In 
some cases, farmers' fields have been rendered useless by land 
mines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>SFOR's mandate does not include clearing farmers' fields.  In 
order for their fields to be cleared by SFOR, some farmers have 
become resourceful and are actually placing mines or relocating 
mines to the sides of roads near their fields to try to draw 
attention to and create a sense of priority with regard to the 
clearing of land mines from their own fields.  Six million mines 
were deployed in Bosnia during the war and to date the UN 
estimates there are still 3 million mines left in Bosnia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem for the peacekeepers is that millions of mines are 
unaccounted for across the country.  Several weeks ago a tractor 
trailer overturned near Banka Luka and the trailer rolled over a 
land mine, causing an explosion.  This was an area that had 
previously been de-mined and thus had been re-mined.  Mines had 
been redeployed to this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Canadians, it is sometimes difficult to imagine the constant 
fear of living in an area that is plagued by the scourge of land 
mines.  For me on a personal level, in Canada something I enjoy 
doing every morning is my morning run.  We were warned when we 
were in Bosnia in the Velika Kladusa area, as well as in other 
areas, not to run in the mornings.  You cannot go off the 
pavement.  If you go off the pavement on to the shoulder of the 
road, you may hit a land mine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I grew up in rural Nova Scotia.  Having returned from Bosnia, I 
no longer take for granted the peacefulness and the tranquility 
and safety of the surroundings that I took for granted as a 
child.  As a child I was able to run through and play in fields 
with no risk and no fear of being maimed or killed by a land 
mine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers, mothers, fathers, children, innocent people, these are 
the people paying for these wars that were fought and, to a 
considerable extent, are now over.  Land mines do not require 
sophisticated technology to manufacture and this is part of the 
problem.  Sometimes the least stable states are producing land 
mines now and people are producing land mines in their basements 
because of the availability of the resources and the tools 
necessary to make land mines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a difficult problem to control and to contain.  As with 
any major humanitarian effort, this ban will require a great deal 
of expertise and resources.  The Minister of Foreign Affairs 
earlier referred to the need for investments in sophisticated 
technology and equipment in the removal of land mines.  This is 
critical as well.  It will take a long time before all the land 
mines are cleared from countries like Cambodia, Bosnia, Rwanda, 
Angola, Afghanistan, Egypt, just to name a few. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have a very important role to play in this effort. Our 
peacekeepers are among the best in the world.  That is something 
I would like to mention.  Upon returning from Bosnia, I came back 
with a tremendous pride in our peacekeepers and also the 
recognition that one of the things that is unique to Canadians is 
our peacekeeping prowess, which is internationally recognized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also remind my colleagues from the Bloc that one of the 
first casualties of a divided Canada would be our ability to 
participate fully and meaningfully in international peacekeeping 
and in other types of international fora. 
Not only do Canadians need a strong united Canada but the world 
needs a strong united Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have contributed over $11 million to the humanitarian efforts 
to clear land mines.  As the minister mentioned, we must continue 
to invest in technology and perhaps create opportunities for 
Canadian companies like Bombardier which may have the ability to 
develop new technologies for this very important task at hand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It can take 10 peacekeepers up to a full day to manually clear a 
minefield the size of a gymnasium.  Mine removal requires 
significant and sustained resources that are very costly.  Over 
the past few years two million to five million more land mines 
have been deployed.  This number, combined with the number 
already in the ground means that at current de-mining rates it 
could take decades to rid the world of the current mines in the 
ground. During that time span, thousands more will be injured or 
killed, even with the signing of this agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why after this week we cannot forget the need for 
continued vigilance in ensuring that the necessary resources are 
provided to ensure that the task that is beginning with the 
signing of this land mine treaty will continue over the next 
several years as part of our international participation in this 
effort. Conditionality must be used and can be used with IMF 
funding to ensure the full co-operation of resources of countries 
that seek IMF funding. By passing this bill Canadians will be 
demonstrating to other countries the need to quickly and 
decisively act in ratifying the treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a further note on my trip to Bosnia.  In one of our 
briefings we were alerted to the fact that an anti-tank mine can 
be converted into an anti-personnel mine.  This can be done with 
a band saw in some cases.  The TMA-3, which looks like a film 
reel, can be cut into thirds by an ordinary band saw.  This 
converts it to three anti-personnel mines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The definition of an anti-personnel mine is found on the first 
page of the bill.  It states: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—“anti-personnel mine” means a mine that is designed, 
altered or intended to be exploded by the presence, proximity or 
contact of a person—. Mines that are designed, altered or 
intended to be detonated by the presence, proximity or contact of 
a vehicle as opposed to a person—are not considered to be 
anti-personnel mines— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must be vigilant in ensuring that the TMA-3 anti-tank mine 
cannot slip through a loophole in this bill.  Canadian companies 
could conceivably still manufacture a TMA-3 model anti-tank mine 
and sell it to another country with the proper export permit. 
Within the other country that mine could be turned into three 
anti-personnel mines. Nothing can stop the buyer from the other 
country from altering the mine if that country is not a signatory 
to this treaty.  Once the mine leaves Canada, the responsibility 
is out of our hands.  Therefore, during this debate I am seeking 
clarification from the government on how the definition will be 
applied to avoid that type of situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a great accomplishment to have 100 countries sign the 
treaty.  However, the major countries that have not signed, with 
the exception of the U.S., are the countries where the greatest 
military uncertainty lies.  We must continue to use every lever 
we have as a middle power through international fora to ensure 
these other countries do sign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I leave the House with the words of the former secretary general 
of the UN, Boutros Boutros-Ghali:  “No nation alone can prevent 
the killing fields full of land mines.  No nation alone can 
prevent inhumane weapons from being deployed, but all nations 
united with a single purpose can make this world more secure for 
generations to come”.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I congratulate my friend from Kings—Hants for a 
wonderful and eloquent speech on this important day and on this 
important issue.  Once again he has demonstrated his commitment 
to foreign policy which he has done since he came to this 
Parliament, and he continues to do so in a very eloquent manner.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wanted to bring to his attention, although he probably already 
knows, that in the maritimes there exist a number of groups very 
active in the processes of demining and have been working all 
across the world as Canadians and as maritimers to pursue 
demining and have done Canadians proud. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By their actions they have saved many lives and are continuing 
to further the important issue of how we get these hundreds of 
millions of land mines out of the ground. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the hon. member will work with these groups and give them 
the help they require for the betterment of Canadians and for the 
betterment of people abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just to refer to the comments by the member for Mount Royal, a 
point of clarification, we as the Reform Party are happy to 
engage in international initiatives but we want to make sure that 
when we go on international trips these trips are work trips, 
that these trips are meant so that we actually gain some 
experience and expertise and that they are a productive use of 
taxpayer money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have not and are not interested in pursuing any course that 
will take us abroad where we will deal with international trips 
that are going to be a waste of taxpayer money, a waste of our 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In these times of difficult financial strain placed on so many 
Canadians and on our budgets, we in the Reform Party are very 
sensitive to this and that is why we continue to assess each trip 
abroad with the potential benefits and merits of that trip.  We 
will only go on these trips where there is a demonstrable need 
and where we are going to gain and have some effective input into 
these trips. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to again congratulate the member for Kings—Hants 
and ask if he can tell us if he has any ideas on any 
opportunities that he can present to this House or any ideas that 
he has on how Canada can continue to engage in the important 
process of demining. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  Madam Speaker, I appreciate the hon. 
member's mention of the many maritimers who are involved as 
peacekeepers.  I met some of them in the SFOR mission.  There are 
organizations in the maritimes and some individuals in my riding 
who have been adamant and constant in their support of this type 
of initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I guess it is part of being a maritimer, humble and 
self-deprecating individuals, that we do not like to toot our 
horn too much.  We appreciate it when we do get this type of 
support from the west. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are proud of all Canadians who have been participating in 
this effort.  It is a gain.  I do consider this a national unity 
issue because I think, frankly, if we do more to inform Canadians 
of the importance of this leadership and do more to inform 
Canadians of the prowess of our peacekeepers internationally, we 
give Canadians more reasons to be proud and more reasons to 
maintain a strong and united Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Price (Compton—Stanstead, PC):</B> Madam Speaker, I am very 
happy to speak today on the bill to ban land mines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not often that I find a reason to congratulate the 
government, especially in the area of foreign affairs, but today I 
salute the minister's efforts. 
Canadians should be proud that it was Canada who played a 
leading role in the negotiation of the land mines treaty.  It is 
in keeping with Canada's proud history of making the world a 
safer place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This will be most widely felt in countries such as Cambodia and 
Angola and Mozambique, where it is civilians earning a living in 
the fields and children playing who suffer as a result of land 
mines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Kings-Hants recently travelled to Bosnia where 
he met farmers who could not plough their fields because they 
were fearful that they would blow themselves up with land mines. 
Others use mines to protect their crops.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This treaty addresses this problem, and I am sure that all 
members in this House and all Canadians are proud that this 
initiative was led by Canada. So again, I offer my warmest 
congratulations to the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do have some concerns, however, and my concerns are both 
domestic and international in nature.  It seems to me that there 
are companies in Canada that manufacture devices that could be 
found in land mines. I am told that these mines do not require 
complicated technology to work.  There are a lot of pieces 
required, however. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My concern is the following: What will happen in the years and 
months ahead, when it is discovered that the triggering device or 
a spring or any part of a land mine being used somewhere else was 
in fact manufactured in Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have in this country many major electronics companies that 
manufacture all sorts of little odds and ends that make up 
components in computer, radios, televisions and telephones.  It 
would prove most embarrassing if it turned out that a product 
from a major Canadian form was inadvertently used as a trigger in 
a land mine.  Are there any measures to prevent this from 
happening? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My concerns that deal with international affairs are perhaps not 
as traightforward.  My first concern has to do with the United 
States. It is my impression that the American gouvernement did 
what it could to be a part of this treaty but in the end, when 
international security considerations were discussed, the United 
States could not take part. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am about to say is very important and cannot be 
orverlooked.  There is a big difference between land mines in a 
field in Angola, which prevent farmers from earning a living, and 
land mines. used to protect the rights and freedoms of South 
Koreans against their dangerous Communist neighbours to the 
North. While the land mines this treaty seeks to ban will harm 
people, the land mines laid by our friends and allies, the 
Americans, are there to protect people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot emphasize this enough, so I will say it again: This 
treaty is useful in that it is an effort to rid the world of 
land mines form wars gone by. 
When a conflict is over and soldiers have returned home, there 
has to be an opportunity to return to normalisation. Part of this 
process means that fields should be deared of mines so innocent 
men, women and children can work and play, build and prosper, 
without fear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not the situation on the 38th parallel, the border 
between South Korea and North Korea. The situation is much 
different. This is not a case of war gone by. This is a clear 
case of a conflict that still exists. The 37,000 U.S. troops are 
there to protect our Pacific ally from invasion. The zone where 
American land mines have been laid is a zone of conflict. It is 
monitored by the South Koreans as well as by the Americans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must not forget that, on November 11, Canadians stop to pay 
Tribute to our veterans who served in World War I and World War II 
and also our veterans who fought for the freedom of South Korea 
during the Korean War. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That freedom is still in jeopardy because of the military threat 
of North Korea. This is not an area where farmers would otherwise 
be tilling the soil. This is not a playground for children. This 
is a military zone. The United States is Canada's close friend and 
ally. It has not signed this treaty. The American government 
studied the matter and concluded that to do so would jeopardize 
its position in Korea and thus jeapardize the lives of its 37,000 
soldiers and the lives of South Koreans and the freedoms that 
exist there and that have been fought for.

enter into peace talks with South Korea, that will include China 
and the United States. We will wait and see, hoping that real 
progress is made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other things that should be widely known about the 
American effort as we approach the day when this treaty is 
signed. The United States is trying to find a replacement for the 
anti-personnel land mines currently being used in the Korean 
peninsula. The United States has said eager to help rid the world 
of land mines by the year 2010 and plans to contribute over $100 
million to the global de-mining effort in the next year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The list of countries that signed this treaty is long. It is, 
however, missing some very important players. Especially Russia, 
China, North Korea, South Korea, India and Pakistan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage the government to continue to put pressure on these 
countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, two countries where land mines have been most harmful 
to civilians in recent years are Afghanistan and Cambodia. These 
mines are left over from the Communist regime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been told that there are mines left over from the Soviet 
invasion of Afghanistan that were made deliberately to look like 
toys. It was a deliberate attempt to kill children and to 
terrorize the Afghans into submission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that Canada lead the way not only to rid the 
world of these lands mines, but to take every opportunity to tell 
Canadians that the countries I just mentioned did not sign this 
treaty for reasons that are quite different from the reasons for 
which Americans did not sign. When the world does become a safer 
place, American protection of our weaker allies will become less 
and less necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My other concern that involves international consideration is 
APEC, the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation meeting that is taking 
place in Vancouver as we speak. 
I understand that the APEC meeting wil not address human rights 
concerns, but only economic issues. 
That is not right, and I know that many Canadians feel the same 
way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that Canada should bring up the issue of the land 
mines fully and publicly and not just at bilateral meetings. If 
the governement is really serious about ridding the world of land 
mines, the APEC summit would be a timely opportunity to challenge 
countries to join. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, I want to congratulate the government, and in particular, 
the Minister of Foreign Affairs for his efforts. 
I sincerely hope that the government will take my comments 
seriously, and take them into consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> My dear colleague, we still have time for

regulation play in the LPGA tour championship.

place was a great achievement for Lorie and for Canadian women's

top money winner and player of the year, Annika Sorenstam, does 
not diminish the pride all islanders feel in her performance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rightly or wrongly, a golfer's success is measured by money 
earned.  By this standard Lorie's earnings of over $425,000 U.S. 
have established her as the best female Canadian golfer in 
history.  To accomplish this as a rookie on the tour makes it all 
the more impressive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lorie is a great ambassador for the sport, for P.E.I. and for 
Canada.  She always remembers those who have helped her along the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, we 
are now in the sixth day of a postal strike that is crippling the 
country from coast to coast.  The cost to businesses and families 
is in the hundreds of millions of dollars.  Thousands of workers 
are being laid off already. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the weekend this government mused about legislating the 
postal workers back to work, but that is all it was.  It seemed 
to be musings and idle chatter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the government how many more days and weeks 
is this postal strike going to go on? When is this government 
going to get these postal workers back to work? 
<P><A NAME="LINK65"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Minister of Labour, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, we are monitoring the situation very closely.  The 
government is very concerned about the situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we want is for the parties to get back to the table and 
come up with a collective agreement. 
<P><A NAME="LINK66"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
will tell you who is monitoring the situation.  It is families 
with businesses like the Lorenzes in northern Alberta and 
thousands of family businesses like them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This family decided to go into the mail order book business and 
to pay for it they mortgaged their own home.  All they had to do 
was work hard and it would pay off for them, or so they thought. 
But then along came the postal strike.  The Lorenzes could now 
lose their business, their dream and even their family home. So 
this kind of answer is not good enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me ask the government, which is monitoring this whole thing 
so clearly, when and what does it have to say to these thousands 
of people whose very lives are affected by this postal strike? 
<P><A NAME="LINK67"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Minister of Labour, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I cannot imagine a party which always pushed for less 
government now pushing for more interference by government. 
This is a process that has worked.  Let the process work and let 
the parties come up with an agreement. 
<P><A NAME="LINK68"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
this official opposition is a party which is pushing for final 
offer arbitration so we do not need to get into these strike 
situations all the time, as this government talks about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The labour minister has been saying day after day in the House 
of Commons that the government is not going to legislate an end 
to the strike, it is simply going to monitor the situation. Yet 
the public works minister mused over the weekend and said to the 
Canadian Direct Marketing Association in August that he would 
legislate this back to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ask simply who is telling the truth here, flip or 
flop? 
<P><A NAME="LINK69"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Minister of Labour, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, final offer selection is a form of arbitration.  Quite 
simply, we are not at that stage yet.  What we want is a 
collective agreement.  Final offer selection is a process that 
works in specific areas only and is not useful in this situation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK70"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Gouk (West Kootenay—Okanagan, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
back to work legislation also includes a strike alternative to 
settle the dispute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is well known the government is in a position of conflict 
of interest due to its plans to have Canada Post reap huge 
profits which it then turns over to a cash hungry Liberal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given this conflict of interest what impartial dispute 
settlement mechanism does the government intend to use when it 
finally gets off its you know what?

from the outside may have more expertise.  An auditor's job is 
not to protect the board of directors but to protect the 
shareholders, Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the auditor general not given access through the 
legislation to the information that will allow him to ensure 
Canadians are protected? 
<P><A NAME="LINK151"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the government has made it very clear that the auditor 
general will be given complete access to all the information he 
requires to complete his audit.  He will be auditing the Canada 
pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If in fact the legislation is not sufficiently clear we have 
indicated that we will make it clear in order to ensure that very 
thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The investment board will have the option of either choosing an 
outside auditor or the auditor general.  The fact is it may well 
decide, because the provinces are also involved, that an outside 
auditor would have far greater expertise in that specific area. 
That is a decision for the board to make.

my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its first mandate the government tackled youth unemployment 
head on by establishing the youth employment strategy.  However 
unemployment continues to be a serious problem for Canada's young 
people.

Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for 
Mississauga West who I know cares very much about youth 
employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed our youth employment strategy was a $350 million strategy 
for three years, helping 110,000 young Canadians to make the 
transition from school to work.  Five thousand Canadians have 
been helped by Youth Service Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Almost 20,000 youngsters have been helped by Youth Internship 
Canada, 60,000 by the student career plan, 60,000 youths who got 
summer jobs, and another 60,000 got jobs related to their actual

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, each year the government opposite takes $5 billion out 
of the motoring public in fuel taxes.  Of that $5 billion it 
returns to the provinces something in the order of 6%.  As a 
result we are finding provinces going out in co-operation and 
tolling roads. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is for the Minister of Transport.  The Canadian 
Automobile Association has stated on numerous occasions that 20% 
of the taxes being returned from that fuel tax would solve our 
problem.  When will the minister return 20%—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the federal government has been involved in 
assisting the provinces with highway construction since 1919 so 
in effect a national highways program has been going on for many 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question is not should we have such a program but what 
conditions should we attach to its continuation and how much 
money is involved.  On the specific question of taxes this is 
something I am sure that other colleagues will deal with, perhaps 
the Minister of Finance, at a later date. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that we have a program.  We have just 
announced the extension of the agreement with New Brunswick.  I 
hope we can continue that over the years.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise 
on a point or order with respect to the main estimates which were 
tabled in the House on Wednesday, October 1, 1997 and which have 
just been returned from committee study and are to be concurred 
in shortly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My point of order concerns irregularities with certain of these 
estimates.  However, I would like to point out that as Madam 
Speaker Sauvé said on June 12, 1981, as recorded in <I>Hansard</I> 
at page 10546, it matters not whether the amount spent is a large 
sum or simply $1. 
It is the parliamentary process to which I am objecting today.

<A HREF="#LINKT48"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this regard I would like to bring to your attention several 
votes which I believe to be out of order and inappropriate for 
inclusion in the subsequent appropriation bill flowing from these 
estimates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Going as far back as 1971, members of this House have repeatedly 
objected to the government's use of the estimates as a vehicle to 
amend legislation and to seek authority to spend money on 
programs that have not received legislative authority.  Your 
distinguished predecessors, Mr. Speaker, have consistently ruled 
in support of these arguments for striking votes from the 
estimates on March 10, 1971, March 22, 1977, December 7, 1977, 
March 25, 1981, June 12, 1981, June 21, 1981, March 21, 1983 and 
March 21, 1984. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker Jerome in a landmark ruling on March 22, 1977, at 
page 4221 of the Debates, stated that the government received 
from Parliament the authority to act through the passage of 
legislation and receives the money to finance such authorized 
action through the passage by Parliament of an Appropriation Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This decision flowed in part from rulings of Mr. Speaker 
Lamoureux who, on February 5, 1973, at pages 94 and 95 of 
Journals, stated that the authorizing bill must become law before 
the authorization of the relevant estimates by the Appropriation 
Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That legislation is a necessary precondition to sanction grants 
of supply is also based upon ancient constitutional usage as 
Erskine May's <I>Parliamentary Practice</I> 25th edition states at 
page 689. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Flowing from early British laws and customs through the 
Constitution Act and on to Standing Order 80(1), it is claimed 
that all aids and supplies granted to the sovereign are the sole 
gift of the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the task of governing belongs to the crown, it cannot 
possibly provide as many services to the people unless the funds 
in the consolidated revenue fund are made available to it.  These 
funds can only be made available to the crown by the House of 
Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House insists that the crown, when requesting funds, must 
specify the particular purposes for which the funds are required. 
It is therefore this claim to the right of control over the purse 
strings of the nation that we must defend vigorously and retain 
for this House alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this defence I now bring to your attention, Mr. Speaker, the 
fact that eight votes in the main estimates are not properly 
before this House.  Five votes in the estimates seek 
parliamentary approval for funds which have not yet received 
legislative authority.  Three votes are attempting to legislate 
through the application of the Appropriation Acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the Department of Agriculture and Agri-food in its vote 
No. 1, operating expenditures, has an activity entitled “Policy 
and Farm Programs” which, among other things, concerns the 
Canadian Wheat Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As outlined in its part III, expenditure plans, the department 
will implement changes which centre on revamping the Canadian 
Wheat Board.  However, no such legislation has been passed to 
permit this action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such changes were introduced in the last Parliament as Bill 
C-72.  The bill only reached report stage before dissolution.  It 
was, however, reintroduced as Bill C-4 on September 25, 1997 and, 
as of this date, has not received royal assent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should note here that the part II book, commonly referred to 
as the blue book, listing the estimates as they will appear in a 
subsequent Appropriation Act, does not give sufficient detail 
concerning each vote.  Thus, it is necessary to refer to the part 
IIIs for details of departmental plans and priorities with 
respect to the funds they are requesting this House to approve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must use the part II book since it mirrors the proposed 
Appropriation Act approving the estimates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As it is difficult to determine precisely the amount of any 
particular item within each respective vote, I therefore ask you, 
Mr. Speaker, to strike vote No. 1 of the Department of 
Agriculture and Agri-food from the estimates since it contains 
funds to finance programs which have yet to receive parliamentary 
approval.

<A HREF="#LINKT49"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the Immigration and Refugee Board under vote 15, program 
expenditures, in its convention refugee determination division 
activity, has indicated that it would begin single member 
hearings in mid-1997 which is in conflict with the Immigration 
Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Legislation that was introduced in the last Parliament, Bill 
C-49 to amend section 69.1 of the Immigration Act, died on the 
Order Paper before receiving second reading.  As a result, the 
board, as indicated in part III and inherently in part II in the 
estimates, is operating outside legislative authority for its 
funds as presented in the estimates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, since we must use the part II book containing the 
estimates and as it is difficult to determine precisely the 
amount of this particular item within the vote, I therefore ask 
you, Mr. Speaker, to remove vote 15 of the Immigration and 
Refugee Board from the estimates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A similar situation is occurring at Environment Canada.  Within 
its vote 1, operating expenditures, the department has activities 
called “healthy environment” and “safety from environmental 
hazards” wherein it has set a key initiative to fully implement 
the new Canadian Environmental Protection Act and the Canada 
Endangered Species Protection Act.  Neither of these two pieces 
of legislation has received royal assent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Environmental Protection Act was introduced in the 
last Parliament as Bill C-74 on December 10, 1996 but did not 
receive second reading.  The Canadian Endangered Species 
Protection Act, Bill C-65 in the previous Parliament, reached 
report stage before Parliament was dissolved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, since we must use the part II book containing the 
estimates and as it is difficult to determine precisely the 
amount of this particular item within the vote, I therefore ask 
you, Mr. Speaker, to strike vote 1 of Environment Canada from the 
estimates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, 
within its Indian and Inuit affairs program at vote 5, operating 
expenditures, under the sub-activity of lands and trusts 
services, is working toward devolution and economic opportunities 
through sustainable development of natural resources with the 
help of various pieces of legislation that were introduced in the 
last Parliament but did not receive royal assent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of these bills have been reintroduced, namely C-6, 
Mackenzie Valley Resource Management Act and C-8, the 
Canada-Yukon Oil and Gas Act.  However, the modifications to the 
Indian Act, formerly Bill C-79, have yet to be presented to this 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, we must use the part II book containing the estimates, 
and since it is difficult to determine precisely the amount of 
this particular item within the vote, I therefore ask you, Mr. 
Speaker, to delete vote 5 of the Department of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development from the estimates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My fifth point concerns Transport Canada.  The department's vote 
1, operating expenditures, under its business lines entitled 
policy and programs and divestitures, is asking the House to 
appropriate funds from the consolidated revenue fund to, among 
other matters, incorporate Canada's major ports, establish a not 
for profit corporation to run the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence Seaway 
system and to permit pilotage authorities to recover all the 
costs of their services in addition to winding down the Canada 
Ports Corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A bill to authorize these undertakings was introduced in the 
last Parliament as Bill C-44, but it only reached the third 
reading stage on April 16, 1997 before dying on the Order Paper. 
Today, Bill C-9, a repeat of the former Bill C-44, is at report 
stage and Bill C-9 includes clause 197 which repeals the Canada 
Ports Corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The departmental estimates show that payments to the Canada 
Ports Corporation have been reduced to zero which indicates that 
the department is in fact implementing C-9, which leads me to 
believe that the other items of Bill C-9 which require the 
expenditure of funds is also contained within the vote.  With the 
corporation's budget being reduced to zero, how else would the 
department be able to operate?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again we must use the part II book that contains the 
estimates.  As it is difficult to determine precisely the amount 
of this item within the vote, I therefore ask Mr. Speaker to 
strike vote 1 of the Department of Transport from the 
estimates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next group of three departments and agencies indicated in 
part III seeks parliamentary approval for funds for operational 
needs but in doing so is amending legislation through the use of 
an appropriation act.  In this regard I refer to Speaker Jerome's 
ruling on March 22, 1977 at page 4220 of <I>Debates</I>  when he 
said that changes in legislation ought to be dealt with by 
legislation and not by supply items. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Colleagues, this point of order could 
have far reaching effects.  I would like to hear what the hon. 
member has to say.  If you have other meetings I would invite you 
please to use the lobbies.  I would very much like to hear this 
point of order and I am being a little distracted.  I return to 
the hon. member for St. Albert. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams:</B>  Mr. Speaker, first is the Canadian 
International Trade Tribunal which through vote 35 on program 
expenditures is extending its mandate with the implementation of 
the agreement on government procurement.  To date there is no 
legislative authority to extend the tribunal's mandate, as set 
out in the Canadian International Trade Tribunal Act, allowing it 
to hear complaints pursuant to this agreement which has yet to be 
brought before Parliament for confirmation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again we must use the part II book containing the estimates. As 
it is difficult to determine precisely the amount of this item 
within the vote, I therefore ask Mr. Speaker to strike vote 35 of 
the Canadian International Trade Tribunal from the estimates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A second irregularity comes from the Department of Public Works 
and Government Services.  Under the supply and services program 
vote 15, program expenditures, is the Canada Communication 
Group's revolving fund, which is a special operating agency.  It 
was established in 1990 in part pursuant to section 29.1 of the 
Financial Administration Act and is responsible for the 
government's printing and publishing operations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In March 1997 the department officially privatized the Canada 
Communications Group.  Parliament is now being asked to increase 
the CCG revolving fund by $21 million due to the sale of the 
printing services and distribution logistics services of CCG 
according to part I book of the estimates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Privatization of the government's printing operation requires 
amendments to the Department of Public Works and Government 
Services Act, section 19.  This section requires that the 
minister appoint an officer of his department as the Queen's 
printer for Canada responsible for printing and publishing 
operations of the Government of Canada.  To date no such 
legislation has been introduced into this House to amend this 
act.  The department is in effect legislating through the use of 
an appropriation act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to note that although the CCG item in the 
estimates is listed as a statutory item, it is not placed there 
just for information, as used to be the case with previous 
legislative items such as salaries for ministers. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1520"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT51"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I draw attention to the fact that since 1991, section 29(1) of 
the Financial Administration Act allowed revolving fund agencies 
to use appropriation acts to change the purposes and draw down 
limits, thereby giving Parliament the right to be involved in 
their affairs.  As a consequence, I ask that this item, as 
indicated at page 1-58 of the part II book of estimates, be 
deleted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, there is an unusual establishment of the Canada 
Information Office and its vote 40, program expenditures.  This 
office was established by order in council on July 9, 1996 under 
the authority of the Financial Administration Act, section 
3(1)(a) by renaming the voluntary action program as the Canada 
Information Office and placing it under schedule I(1) of the 
Financial Administration Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Financial Administration Act permits the governor in council 
to add the name of any division or branch of the public service 
to schedule I(1). However, the voluntary action program was 
neither a division nor a branch of either the department of 
communications or the Department of Canadian Heritage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, it should be noted that the Financial 
Administration Act uses the word add, not the word create, 
thereby justifying my argument. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, I would argue establishing an agency by an order in 
council certainly does not meet the definition of legislative 
authority as expressed by Speaker Jerome who said in part on 
December 7, 1977, as recorded in <I>Hansard</I> at page 1642 that 
the legislative process requires three readings, committee stage 
and, in other words, ample time for members to participate in 
debate and amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada Information Office subsequently sought to obtain 
legislative status through the supplementary estimates in an 
appropriation act.  Nevertheless on March 22, 1977 at page 4220 
of <I>Hansard</I>, Speaker Jerome ruled that supplementary 
estimates ought not to be used as a means to seek funds for new 
programs, as these supplementary estimates are only for short 
duration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This point was reiterated by Madam Speaker Sauvé on June 12, 
1981 at page 10546 of <I>Debates</I> when she said that the 
Appropriation Act is not the place to seek authority to do 
something such as to establish a new program.  Rather, that act 
should only seek authority to spend money for a program that has 
been previously authorized by statute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, as quoted in Beauchesne's sixth edition at citation 938, 
she expanded on this on March 21, 1983 at page 23968 of 
<I>Hansard</I> by declaring that the previous amendment of 
legislation by an appropriation act cannot justify a repeated use 
of an item in the estimates to amend legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, in accordance with these Speaker's rulings, I ask 
that vote 40 of the Canada Information Office be deleted from the 
estimates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must at this time indicate my dismay with the practices of 
this government.  The main estimates for the fiscal year 1997-98 
were tabled in this House on February 20, 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because Parliament was dissolved, the main estimates were not 
approved by June in accordance with the standing orders.  As a 
consequence, the government had to reintroduce in this Parliament 
the estimates but it reintroduced the same old package on October 
1, 1997, even though it was quite aware that not all its 
legislative program on which these estimates were based had been 
completed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my view this action is an expression of this government's 
contempt of this House which requires this House to defend 
vigorously its sole right to grant supply.  I submit that the 
votes I cited, Mr. Speaker, are in fact all out of order.  I 
respectfully ask that you so rule. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, if we are to protect this institution in our role 
as the sole granter of aids and supplies from misuse by the 
crown, then surely it is imperative that we follow the proper 
parliamentary procedures with respect to that supply process and 
within the rule of law which was so often quoted by the Minister 
of Justice in the last Parliament with respect to another issue.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I will not be quite as long as my colleague. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition is bringing this to your attention today 
because we feel it strikes at the very heart of this democratic 
institution we have here.  The government is attempting to usurp 
the authority and responsibility of this House and its members. 
This is far from a routine point of order.  This is and has been 
a study.  It is an analysis and it is a very serious issue of a 
fundamental question.  Does government operate through the 
legislation of the people or does government operate outside of 
the very legislation it expects all citizens to be guided by? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As you are aware, this responsibility of the House represents a 
basic principle of our Constitution.  The fundamental principle 
that the crown has no power to tax except by grant of Parliament 
is to be found even in the Magna Carta.  The bill of rights of 
1689 declares: “Levying money for or to the use of the crown 
by pretence of prerogative without grant of Parliament for longer 
time or in another manner than the same is or shall be granted is 
illegal”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The principle that Parliament approve expenditures for the 
specific purposes for which they were intended began as far back 
as Charles II and was developed under William and Mary.  As a 
result, we are governed today by rules that make it illegal for 
the executive to make expenditures except those expenditures that 
are approved by Parliament in ways approved by Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for St. Albert has argued that certain items in the 
main estimates have breached these rules because they lack the 
sanctioning of necessary legislation.  To support his argument, I 
refer to citation 937 of Beauchesne's sixth edition: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The test which items must meet to be included in the Estimates 
is whether or not the government is putting forward a spending 
estimate under authority it already possesses, or whether it is 
really seeking new legislative authority to do something.  It 
makes no difference whether an item attempts to spend a large sum 
or simply one dollar.  The government may not, by the use of an 
appropriation act, obtain authority it does not have under 
existing legislation. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our extensive research by a number of well qualified people 
finds that no authority exists in the areas we have defined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Citation 935 puts it simply like this: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A supply item ought not to be used to obtain authority which is 
the proper subject of legislation. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would support the member's claim that the amounts objected to 
in vote 35 concerning the Canadian International Trade Tribunal, 
vote 15 of the department of public works, and vote 40 concerning 
the Canada Information Office are without legislative authority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for St. Albert has also objected to the amounts in 
vote 1 of the department of agriculture, vote 15 concerning the 
Immigration and Refugee Board, vote 1 of environment, vote 5 
concerning the department of Indian affairs and vote 1 of the 
Department of Transport.  He argues that these items seek 
spending authority in legislation not yet passed in Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Citation 941 of Beauchesne's sixth edition makes the case: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a vote in the Estimates relates to a bill not yet passed by 
Parliament then the authorizing bill must become law before the 
authorization of the relevant vote in the Estimates by an 
appropriation act. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a mandate, not a request. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Citation 942 points out: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Asking for money in the Estimates before legislation is passed 
to establish programmes “puts the cart before the horse”. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through these items in the main estimates the government is 
attempting to spend the dowry and plan the honeymoon before 
popping the question. 
Our rules are based on tradition, and before the government books 
the honeymoon suite in the Niagara Falls Hilton, it must take us 
out on three successful dates:  second reading, report stage and 
third reading.  It must also court our neighbours next door, not 
to mention the final approval from dad in Rideau Hall.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, I would like to draw to your 
attention a reference from the introduction of the main estimates 
document part II, the very document which introduces these 
estimates. It states: “Proposals included in votes seek 
authority during the 1997-98 fiscal year to make expenditures 
necessary to deliver various mandates which are under the 
administration of a minister and are contained in legislation 
approved by Parliament”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That in fact is not true.  The very document which contains 
breaches of our parliamentary rules ironically sets those rules 
out in its introduction.  To knowingly state the rules and then 
ignore those rules makes a mockery of every member in this House 
and those who elected us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This represents another disturbing attempt by the government to 
erode the influence of the Commons and render its members 
irrelevant.  It has demonstrated this by introducing bills in the 
Senate, advertising the passage of bills before they are passed 
and setting up bodies based on legislation not yet approved by 
Parliament, this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today the government is going too far with this attempt to spend 
money without legislative authority.  We ask that you protect the 
ancient constitutional right of the Commons to insist on 
legislative authority as a precondition to sanction grants of 
supply. 
<P><A NAME="LINK167"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the core argument today is the 
following. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only words that go into the appropriation act are the words 
that appear in part II of the estimates.  As we know, last year 
the part IIIs of the estimates were tabled only later because 
they include information on subsequent years. Nothing in part I 
or part III appears in the appropriation act. Only the precise 
wording in part II appears in the appropriation act and therefore 
has the force of law. Our procedure depends on the wording in 
part II only and in nothing else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, before going too much further in this intervention, 
I would like to point out that the government has shown high 
respect for this House in the way it has handled the estimates 
process and everything else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Before the election was called— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I appeal to you, my colleagues.  I want to 
hear what is being said, so I would ask you please to refrain 
from heckling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Mr. Speaker, before the election was 
called, the government sought interim supply to last through the 
election period.  In so doing, it obtained the consent of this 
House for the functioning of Parliament both during the election 
period and in the subsequent period.  This is something that has 
seldom been done before, if ever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, immediately after the election and contrary to what had 
been done in many previous parliaments, if not all of them, no 
Governor General's warrants were issued although those would have 
been totally appropriate and in conformity with the Financial 
Administration Act.  Out of respect for this House everything was 
done to do things in a timely fashion and in order to avoid the 
use of Governor General's warrants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to add there was co-operation of members on all 
sides of the House, and the House leaders in particular, who saw 
fit to arrive at a formula whereby we could debate supply and 
provide for the number of opposition days and arrive at the day 
at which we will have arrived tomorrow, which is the final day 
for debating supply and the subsequent appropriation bill.  This 
was done with the consent of all parties and I thank all hon. 
members. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1535"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT54"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fundamentally it was the will of the government to adhere not 
only to the rules of the House, but to ensure that certain 
vehicles such as the use of Governor General's warrants were 
avoided in order to show nothing but the highest of respect for 
the institution.  Although as I said, the use of such warrants 
would have been permitted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The part IIIs of course do not form the principal element of 
this issue.  As I indicated previously they are a rather recent 
invention.  As a matter of fact, last year they were not even 
tabled at the same time as the estimates. They were tabled at 
some point later so that additional information could be put in 
the part IIIs in regard to subsequent years and in conformity 
with one of the campaign commitments that we made prior to the 
1993 election.  We believe that this formula has allowed members 
to participate more fully. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to address a few of the issues that have been raised in 
detail by the hon. member.  It has been said that the wheat board 
item should be set aside because appropriation is being sought 
where according to the opposition no government bill setting out 
the details has yet been passed.  A similar argument is being 
made about vote 15 for the Immigration and Refugee Board.  The 
same is alleged with regard to Environment Canada vote I. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to suggest two things. First is that every one of 
these bills that is before the House where necessary has a royal 
recommendation regarding the crown's prerogative to spend money. 
Second is that of course this could not be done without having 
proper supply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To that extent I want to indicate first that this is not an 
expenditure in itself. This is merely an action by these 
estimates providing for the funding for the expenditure. The 
expenditure itself will only come if and when the legislation is 
passed. Of course the money would not be spent either without the 
bill or the attending royal recommendation if such is required 
under a particular act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another thing which I believe is quite important for 
the Chair to consider.  Those very same expenditures were voted 
on in the interim supply last March.  I submit to the Chair that 
if this argument on the part of the opposition is all that valid, 
we have to wonder why it was not valid according to the same 
sources and the same people only a few months ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the House had no problem in voting interim supply on the 
exact same wording as part IIs last March, I submit that the 
House is equally qualified to vote on these same estimates as 
they are when it votes on these estimates presumably late in the 
day tomorrow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It could very well be that the President of the Treasury Board 
might want to add to the comments I have just made.  Nothing I 
have said should be equated with my speaking on his behalf. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the government generally, in terms of how these 
estimates were put together, I do believe that they were 
constructed in a good and appropriate way according to the 
customs of the House and not only that, but according to the way 
the House voted on many of the same items only a few months ago, 
namely in March 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the submission I wish to make to the Chair.  I ask the 
Chair to consider that the point made by hon. members across is 
not valid and that the estimates as they are presently printed 
are in order and should be disposed of at the appropriate time 
which could be tomorrow. 
<P><A NAME="LINK168"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
have two or three points I would like to raise on this same point 
of order.  I can tell that all members of the House realize the 
importance of this point of order not only to the government but 
to the opposition and to Parliament itself. This cuts to the very 
core of why we are here, which is to approve legislation and the 
funding required to carry it out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we follow through on the government's request, to follow the 
logic of the government House leader, he says that just because 
we approve the estimates is no big deal because nothing happens 
until the legislation is passed. 
If that is true, then the entire estimates process is a sham. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1540"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT55"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We approve the estimates in good faith assuming that the 
government will follow through on the spending contained therein. 
To bypass the estimates process, which is to scrutinize it to 
make sure that the money is spent where and when it is authorized 
and so on, is truly putting the cart before the horse.  The 
expenditures are being approved before legislation is in place to 
give the government the authority to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, I would point out that the goodwill arrangement and the 
negotiations that go on between the government and opposition 
parties with respect to supply days is carried out in good faith. 
Again that is irrelevant to this argument today, which is that 
supply cannot be voted on unless the legislation has been 
approved.  We can negotiate in good faith and arrange days for 
debate.  There is a supply day tomorrow but that is irrelevant to 
the point of order which is before you today, Mr. Speaker, which 
again comes down to which comes first, the law or the estimates? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, earlier in this Parliament, Mr. Speaker, you ruled on a 
point of order that I brought forward with respect to the 
creation of an investment board by Bill C-2, which is a bill not 
yet passed.  Although you ruled at that time that because no 
money had been spent the bill was not contradicting my privileges 
as a parliamentarian, you did admonish the government. You said 
words to the effect that you took this very seriously. You 
admonished the finance department and those responsible for 
putting these types of things together.  You said that they were 
pushing the edge, and I realize I am ad libbing here.  They were 
right at the edge and you said that you took it very seriously. 
You said that this was not the first time it had happened and 
that you hoped it would not happen again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tomorrow if you allow the estimates to proceed as tabled, we 
will not only be near the edge, we will be down in the abyss, at 
the bottom looking up at what used to be a very noble procedure 
where laws were put in place and then appropriations were given. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I would urge you to look at the arguments presented 
by members on this side of the House today.  To not do what was 
asked by the hon. member for St. Albert would be to neuter the 
role of parliamentarians in their attempts to bring all the light 
which is necessary to bear on the estimates process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I urge you to realize that the line has been 
crossed.  I urge you to make the proper decision tomorrow, which 
I hope will be that these estimates votes be deleted from 
tomorrow's voting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Is the hon. government House leader rising 
to present new information? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to comment pursuant 
to the last remark that was made and not comment on anything that 
was said previously pursuant to how you instructed us. Commenting 
only on what the hon. member has just said and adding new 
information to that, the reverse of what the hon. member has just 
stated would be totally illogical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If one could ever conceive that this government would pass all 
kinds of legislation and royal recommendations inherent involving 
the spending of money and provide no funding within its estimates 
for the programs it was planning to deliver, this would 
essentially mean that all of us would be legislating and no 
program could ever be put together in the same calendar year. 
You would have to provide funding only for subsequent years 
because you would never be providing funding in order to make it 
happen.  A situation like that would be totally irresponsible and 
unworkable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Conversely, if governments were to plan to spend money in 
legislation and never have anything in the estimates in the same 
year to provide for it and to go ahead with it right away, it 
would be the same people across the way challenging the 
government. 
They would be indicating, and probably quite correctly, that in 
fact the government is undertaking new expenditures for which it 
has received no authority under appropriation.  It cannot be both 
ways.

<A HREF="#LINKT56"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe the last point raised adds to the point made 
before by the hon. member.  What has just been stated now adds to 
the credibility of the government and the way in which the 
estimates were put together. 
<P><A NAME="LINK169"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I rise on the same point of order.  I have just a couple 
of quick points, if you would indulge me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first is that in reply to the statement previously made by 
the hon. House leader of the government, I was under the 
impression that the reasoning behind the practice of 
supplementary estimates, not the main estimates, is to ensure the 
government has a vehicle in which it can bring forward 
legislation and actually get it under way in the same calendar 
year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, just briefly on the issue, it is a longstanding 
tradition that ministers appear before the standing committees. 
Speaking as the chief opposition critic for the minister of 
agriculture, the minister responsible for this first disputed 
item, vote 1, policy and farm programs, has not given the 
opportunity to members of Parliament and me as the critic to 
question him about that expenditure.  Had that happened perhaps 
some of this could have been avoided. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am informed a large number of ministers have not appeared. Now 
with the seventh and last supply day being tomorrow, as was 
indicated by agreement effectively if ministers appear 
subsequently they will not actually be debating the estimates or 
have any effect on whether those estimates can be reduced 
following their cross-examination at committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK170"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have 
one small point again in rebuttal to the government House leader. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Much legislation died on the order paper when parliament was 
dissolved last April and that included the main estimates. The 
main estimates were reintroduced without any changes whatsoever 
on October 1.  However, because the government did not 
reintroduce the legislation that died, it was obvious its agenda 
had changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government's agenda had changed, if its decision about 
what was to be spent and what was not to be spent had changed, 
surely it had an obligation to the House to amend and introduce 
the estimates to reflect its agenda after the election, not the 
one before. 
<P><A NAME="LINK171"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  To say the least an interesting point of 
order has been raised.  I will surely take into consideration the 
information and the opinions of both sides. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will take all the information and I will do my own study of 
it.  I will return to the House not today but hopefully in very 
short order.  I will take all these things into consideration and 
report to the House after I have reviewed everything. 
<P><A NAME="LINK172"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I rise on a point of information.  I presume you are telling us 
that you would report back to the House prior to the vote on the 
estimates tomorrow night. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>   My intention would be to do as much 
research as I can, but I am sure the hon. member would not want 
me to make a decision if I did not have all the information I 
could possibly have in front of me.  I will endeavour to do that 
and hopefully I will be able to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we are saying in effect 
that a vote on the current estimates is quite frankly illegal. It 
would be inappropriate for the House to vote on the estimates as 
they stand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I will take all of this into consideration 
in trying to make my decision.  I will make a decision not based 
upon the pressures of time necessarily, although it is a factor, 
but I will base my decision on the material I can gather to make 
a decision for the House that I will not have to overrule or 
overturn some place down the road.  I want to be sure of my 
grounds.

this House, at first reading, a bill to amend the Access to Information 
Act and the National Archives of Canada Act, particularly as regards the 
destruction and falsification of documents. 
The proposed amendments are very important, given what is regularly 
reported by the media, since they would allow us to have access to 
documents of the Privy Council which are currently confidential. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Access to Information Act does not have enough teeth, as a

reflect in every way the information commissioner's concerns and

to give more visibility, more access and more teeth to the Access to 
Information Act, and particularly to include penalties for those who do 
their utmost to prevent its application.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B>

</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather than simply having the minister declare that information 
must be provided as is required under the convention concerning 
the possession or acquisition of land mines, we are proposing an

originally provided in clause 21.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy:</B>  Mr. Chairman, the reason why we take 
out the reference to 11(2) in 21 is that we do not want to 
presume or pre-empt a judgment by a judge.  I have always been 
very careful in my career never to try to presume what a judge is 
going to do.  It would be very wise in this case to do the same.

he intends to do so?

Mr. Chairman, it is a good question. We would bring in any 
pertaining regulation once it is actually signed and in place. 
That really would apply to the Export-Import Control Act and we 
would apply it but we have to have the treaty actually completed 
first and deposited with the secretary general before we would 
move toward bringing in those regulations. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Daniel Turp:</B> Mr. Chairman, am I to understand that the

<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy:</B>  Mr. Chairman, that is basically the 
intent.  We would have to wait for the actual signing of the 
treaty which will take place next week.  It will then be 
deposited by the prime minister with the secretary general.  We 
would then have to bring in the regulation which pertains 
directly to the Export-Import Control Act.  We will repromulgate 
that regulation at that point in time. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Daniel Turp:</B> Mr. Chairman, if I unerstand correctly, the 
government is not in a position to have the regulations adopted before 
the treaty is signed and ratified because the deadlines do not leave 
enough time. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy:</B>  Mr. Chairman, it does get into 
somewhat of the arcane way these matters work, which I know the 
hon. member is well acquainted with from his academic career. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As it is, we cannot promulgate new regulations until the treaty 
is actually signed.  It then gives the governor in council the 
authority to go ahead and apply the treaty as set out in the 
legislation.  We cannot make that application until we have 
actually signed the treaty.

<P><A NAME="LINK235"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois—Salaberry, BQ):</B> Mr. Chairman, our 
proposed amendment raises an issue which is certainly more fundamental, 
and the debate on the bill provides an opportunity to discuss the 
participation of parliament, especially of the House of Commons, in the 
conclusion and the implementation of treaties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an important issue, since it raises the question of the 
role of elected representatives and of the House of Commons as a whole 
in the conclusion of treaties. The treaty to be implemented was 
negotiated and concluded by the executive branch and it will be signed 
and ratified by the same, without parliamentarians and the House of 
Commons having truly taken part in the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since clause 20 sets out that this convention will be amended, 
and that subsequent to the amendment changes to the legislation can 
be made by order, it seemed worthwhile to debate the role of 
Parliament and to ensure that Parliament is involved in approving 
a treaty which would amend this new convention on anti-personnel 
mines, even before the Government of Canada moves to accept such an 
amending treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would therefore like to see this bill include parliamentary 
participation and a debate in Parliament before the government 
accepts an amendment to the treaty.  We therefore propose that this 
clause be amended.  This would be an amendment which might 
significantly the practice of treaty approval, which in Canada is 
totally inconsistent.

around treaties which the executive plans to sign and ratify on 
behalf of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is therefore an opportunity to stir up debate and to find 
out the Minister of Foreign Affairs' position on this question and 
whether he wants Parliament to be more involved in the treaty 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore move that: 
<A NAME="LINK236">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That Bill C-22, in Clause 20, be amended by

<P><A NAME="LINK237"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Chairman, the point raised by the 
hon. member is an interesting point of general principle and 
theory.  The hon. member has raised it within the standing 
committee on foreign affairs of this Parliament and the standing 
committee has created a task force or a subcommittee which is 
studying the matter of general principle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can say without exaggeration that this is a very strong 
subcommittee in the sense, as has often been said, of very strong 
courts.  Our view would be that the amendment would affect a 
fundamental change, as is clearly intended, in the constitutional 
law of parliament.  We leave open positions on this, but our 
suggestion would be that it is not proper to make it within the 
interstices of an amendment to a technical law before parliament. 
It should be considered as a matter of general principle as has 
already been foreseen by the standing committee on foreign 
affairs in creating the task force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our suggestion to the hon. member, therefore, would be that he 
should withdraw the proposed amendment at this stage.  We would 
undertake that the general principle would be discussed by the 
task force.  It would always be appropriate, if and when the task 
force makes a recommendation, to propose amendments to the 
legislation and others, if and when it is adopted.  That would be 
our position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a technical sense it is constitutionally inelegant to propose 
a fundamental constitutional change in the law of parliament by 
indirection.  Therefore we would suggest to the hon. member that 
he might withdraw the amendment.  We would undertake to give full 
speed to the study by this impressive task force which has a very 
well qualified chairman.  I believe the other members are equally 
well qualified. 
<P><A NAME="LINK238"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Mr. Chairman, the 
amendment is very complex and has far-reaching impacts on this 
type of negotiation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The standing committee of foreign affairs is the appropriate 
forum for discussion of the amendment.  We would not support the 
amendment today.  However we do see the potential for this type 
of discussion in committee and the potential for this type of 
change for future treaty ratification.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not want to create some type of legislation that is easily 
bogged down in the mechanism of parliament that prevents speedy 
ratification for other countries.  It is similar to what happened 
in the U.S., for example, with the fast track negotiating powers 
which had not been granted to the president and are thus 
inhibiting and impeding progress or U.S. ability to participate 
in international trade negotiation to the full extent that it 
would have been able to with fast track.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois—Salaberry, BQ):</B> Mr. Chairman, I 
want to reassure the parliamentary secretary that it was not my 
intention to be inelegant in proposing such an amendment and with 
respect to the Constitution, because these matters are far too 
serious for one not to be elegant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As you noted, the intent was to raise a matter with the 
minister, which, it appears, arouses the interest of both the 
official opposition and the Conservative Party.  This question 
should be debated in full.  Other parliaments have debated it, but 
this parliament has failed to do so sufficiently in recent years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before considering the proposal by the parliamentary 
secretary, I would nevertheless ask the minister if he could give 
us his initial reaction to the question which this amendment raises 
and which other amendments could raise about the role parliament, 
including the House of Commons, in negotiating treaties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask for a very preliminary comment in the light of his 
recent experience with the treaty this legislation is attempting to 
implement and which this House may debate at some time other than 
when the legislation is implemented.  I would appreciate a comment 
from the minister on this question. 
<P><A NAME="LINK241"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr.

I agree with the parliamentary secretary's recommendation that 
there be an interesting exchange of viewpoints in the foreign 
affairs committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As he said, it is a general problem of replacing the 
representatives of the executive in the negotiation and signing of 
the treaty.  Generally speaking, I am interested in looking at all 
the ways parliament is involved in foreign affairs issues 
especially, for example, a government decision to establish 
military intervention under the aegis of the United Nations and so 
on.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Daniel Turp:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the answer. I can see

but it would nevertheless be worthwhile to put this question to a vote 
to know where the various parties stand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Accordingly, I do not intend to withdraw the proposed amendment, 
but I will, of course, submit the question to the Standing Committee on

<P><A NAME="LINK242"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont—Dundas, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is my 
understanding that the purpose of the motion moved by the hon. member 
for Beauharnois—Salaberry is to promote a substantive debate, and it is 
already clear from the somewhat short remarks we have heard how 
committed all the parties are, and the government in particular. The 
minister himself would like to know what would come out of an in-depth 
review by the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International 
Trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am wary and reluctant because, if the question is put and the 
amendment is negatived, then I do not think the government will repeat 
the offer contained in this amendment so that the issue can be looked at 
by the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade, 
whose agenda is already pretty full. But if the matter is of such 
importance that we would like it to be debated by the Standing Committee 
on Foreign Affairs and International Trade, 
I would ask for the consent of the House to withdraw this amendment and

</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 21 indicates that the hybrid offence provides an 
opportunity for enforcement officers to determine, depending on 
the gravity of the offence, whether or not to proceed with a more 
serious instance of indictable process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What criteria will be used to differentiate between a summary 
conviction and an indictable offence within the context of the 
bill? 
<P><A NAME="LINK244"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Chairman, as in most cases it would be up to the prosecutor 
to determine what would be the criteria.  Again I would not want 
to prejudge any able prosecutor in what they would define that to 
be.  I think we would leave it to the normal Criminal Code 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  Mr. Chairman, are there any precedents 
or examples to which the minister can speak that would show how 
the prosecution can decide whether or not in circumstances such 
as these there is a separation between summary convictions and 
indictable offences? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am concerned that the bill can be driven into very punitive 
measures where a great deal of effort is put into convicting 
people of indictable offences.  On the contrary, a great deal of 
effort could be put into making sure that people are charged 
under summary convictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know from the minister and his officials what 
separation exists.  Are there examples that we can examine, or 
examples he can give the House today to show how the process 
would actually work? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy:</B>  Mr. Chairman, it is a little 
difficult to give examples because this is the first time it has 
been done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other international treaties, chemical weapons conventions 
and others, we have not been in a position where we have had to 
actually use the question of principle.  The normal test would 
apply, which is the seriousness or the gravity of the action. 
If under the act someone inadvertently provides information or 
sends one of the munitions abroad, not with deliberate intent to 
get around the legislation but inadvertently, then clearly the 
prosecutor has a judgment call for the lighter sentence. 
However, if it is done deliberately to contravene the act for 
malicious purposes, if someone wants to export land mines for use 
in another country as part of a military arsenal, then clearly 
the heavier weight of that would be applied.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy:</B>  Mr. Chairman, it goes back to the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy:</B>  Mr. Chairman, I have been asked 
about the matter of the French-English translation under the 
clause 11(2) amendment.  In looking at the proper interpretation, 
our officials were able to determine that the reference to the 
federal court trial division is exactly the same as the “section 
de première instance de la Cour fédérale”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Chairman:</B>  That is on clause 11.  Perhaps we could 
complete clause 21 first.  Are there further questions or debate

<P><A NAME="LINK245"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois—Salaberry, BQ):</B> Mr. Chairman, I 
believe it was on Thursday, late in the day, that I had the opportunity 
to meet with lawyers from the justice department. At the time, I was 
told that the bill had been reviewed by the authorities to make sure it 
complied with the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. I am now 
rather surprised to see an amendment to ensure such consistency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also a little curious as to whether the whole bill was 
reviewed to make sure it is consistent with the charter, and I wonder if 
the government could tell us when this review was conducted by the 
authorities? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy:</B>  Mr. Chairman, I thank the hon. 
member for his comments.  Perhaps it shows the value of the ever 
vigilant activity of members of Parliament.  In our opening 
remarks we did beg the indulgence of the House.  This legislation 
was drafted in a two and a half week period which, if you know 
the system around here, is pretty fast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We wanted to take into account all particular references to the 
charter.  The hon. member's examination last week was tough in 
that regard.  Then we asked for a full review again this weekend 
by justice officials who went over with a fine tooth comb all 
particular ways in which the term apply, and that is when we came 
out with the proposed amendment under section 11(2).  It was to 
make sure the courts would be the interpreter, not the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I give the House my assurance that in our best judgment, based 
on the tertiary review that took place this weekend, that was the 
only question.  Even at that, it was just that we did not want to 
leave any question.  We wanted to make sure it was airtight in 
terms of its relevance to the charter.

we do not want to seize the house even though one of the products 
that is prohibited may be within it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To wit, if somebody is in possession of an anti-personnel land 
mine and that piece of property is to be seized as a matter of 
evidence, we do not want to seize the entire house and all the 
things in it as a matter of conviction.  The family may still be 
there and they are not liable.  That is the same kind of 
principle that is now applied in the Criminal Code, say, on drug 
offences.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Chairman, I thank the minister for his answer.  I wonder, though, 
if he could address the second part of my question.  In subclause 
22(1) it states that the minister has the discretion as to how 
the things being seized are to be disposed of.  Should it not be 
the courts that decide how things are to be disposed of and not 
the minister? 
<P><A NAME="LINK249"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Chairman, I should clarify just in case people did not quite 
understand it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we used the designation “minister” in the definition, it 
did not necessarily refer to the Minister of Foreign Affairs. 
Different ministers could apply.  In this case, clearly it would 
be the Attorney General of Canada who is the legal officer for 
the Government of Canada, again comparable to the other offences 
in the Criminal Code where they would act on behalf of it.  The 
Minister of Foreign Affairs I can tell you would have absolutely 
no interest in being the operative agent in this case.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier, the minister read in a very eloquent manner a treaty 
drafted by children, who hope to see included in the declaration their 
rights under the convention. Does the minister intend to publicize the 
text of the convention, on which all parties in this House agree and in 
which they put their hopes that the use of anti-personnel mines will be 
eliminated? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to know what measures the government intends to take to 
publicize the treaty. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy:</B>  Mr Chairman, first, I believe it was 
last week that a kit was distributed to all members of Parliament 
which contained information about the treaty.  I believe a copy 
of the treaty was included. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The treaty has also been on the website and is available for 
everybody to access.  We can give hon. members the website 
number.  I should mention we have also established a separate 
website to cover the conference itself.  We will be, during the 
course of the proceedings next week when the treaty conference is 
being held at the Conference Centre, organizing within the 
parliamentary area a special room in which members of Parliament 
can watch the proceedings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We intend to bring a number of participants, ministers, NGOs and 
some of the children who are involved to meet the members of 
Parliament.  We will have our officials available to share 
information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that portion is scheduled for next Thursday, probably 
after question period.  We would like to involve the the members 
of Parliament as much as possible.  The conference room is small 
in terms of the number of people who can get in.  That is why we 
thought we would open an ante-room here at Parliament so that 
members could participate and have access to the number of 
individuals, officials and participants who come for a special 
session on Thursday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It happens from time to time that staff take our documents to 
read and cherish them.  If this has happened in the case of 
members, we will be more than happy to replace them, perhaps 
through the spokesperson for each party.  If any of the members 
would like further documentation we would be more than happy to 
supply it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, Mr. Chairman, I beg your indulgence not to use 
props.  We just had hand delivered this morning the logo pin for 
the conference.  If any member of Parliament would like to have 
one, I would be more than glad to distribute them when our 
proceedings are completed.

tonight at the time of adjournment is as follows:  the hon.

<P><A NAME="LINK252"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont—Dundas, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
minister has a commitment which will take him away from the 
House.  I wonder if we could seek the unanimous consent of the 
House to allow the minister two to three minutes maximum to say a 
few words without being counted as a spokesperson at third 
reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask for the unanimous consent of the House to allow the 
minister to say a few words. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Is that agreed?

<P><A NAME="LINK253"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the government whip for his intervention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to use this opportunity to express my thanks to members 
of the Chamber for the way in which the proceedings have taken 
place today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there has been anything which has characterized this movement 
on land mines, it has been a sense of partnership. No one has 
ownership of this.  It has been a collective effort of NGOs and 
private citizens, members of the cabinet, the Prime Minister and 
my colleagues who have taken decisions.  I think of my 
predecessor, Mr. Ouellet, who started the first movement with a 
moratorium, and decisions made by the former Minister of National 
Defence to eliminate land mines.  I think of members of the 
opposition who earlier on valiantly presented private members' 
resolutions to move this House along on this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a wide range of people who have been able to rise above 
many of the more immediate questions to something which has a 
larger horizon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been in Parliament a long time as many people know and as 
someone said today, every once in a while we have a fine hour. 
This is one of our finest hours. I would like to thank all 
members for making this a day which Canadians will long remember. 
<P><A NAME="LINK254"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont—Dundas, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
in the same spirit of co-operation, I wonder if the House would 
give its consent for the following. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While in the normal course at third reading the government lead 
spokesperson would have 40 minutes, I propose that the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Foreign Affairs and 
the chair of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and 
International Trade, the hon. member for Toronto 
Centre—Rosedale, would each speak for 10 minutes and then we 
would continue the rotation as is the normal procedure of the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I give my undertaking that both the parliamentary secretary and 
the hon. member for Toronto Centre—Rosedale, the chair of the 
committee, will only speak for 10 minutes each. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Is that agreed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK255"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I will be sharing my 
time as the House has already been advised with the hon. member 
for Toronto Centre—Rosedale. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This treaty is a significant achievement in its own right.  It 
continues the step by step process of building a peaceful world 
which began during the cold war, in its more enlightened moments, 
with the progressive treaties toward nuclear and general 
disarmament and the cessation of nuclear tests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should be noted however that in this treaty there has been a 
significant innovation and that is the involvement of people who 
are not normally involved in the treaty making process. Jeremy 
Bentham once said that the law is not made by judge alone, but by 
judge and company.  The company in this case includes the 
non-governmental organizations, and as has been rightly commented 
by members of the opposition, the late Princess Diana and others. 
It has been a citizens' movement in which the force of public 
opinion has carried the momentum to produce a treaty written off 
as something taking many years, but it has been completed really 
in 12 months with the ceremony that will take place in Ottawa in 
December. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have made history in a certain sense and it will continue. 
The democratization of foreign affairs and treaty making I am 
sure will continue because of this significant first step. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A second point I will make, which has already been commented on 
in this debate, is that this is a short treaty. 
This is a succinct treaty and a treaty that has teeth.  It is 
something that goes to the gamesmanship of making treaties. There 
is a way of getting treaties through a diplomatic conference by 
making them mellow, open ended or vacuous, whatever phrase one 
would like to use.  One can rally an enormous consensus but there 
is nothing in the treaty.

<A HREF="#LINKT72"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a treaty that has teeth in it.  A deliberate decision 
was made by our government and I think by the NGOs and others 
participating that it was better to have a treaty that stated 
something even if it meant that some significant states would be 
absent from the treaty's signature and ratification.  We have 
pushed ahead on that basis.  Some will notice that what started 
with a relatively small number of countries now has reached over 
100 and that is a rather significant achievement in itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada treaty making and treaty ratification are the two 
steps necessary to give international law validity to our 
signature to a treaty and they are executive acts, as has been 
noted already. The parliamentary process is limited to adopting 
the very important implementing legislation but it does not 
affect the validity of the treaty as international law.  However 
that is not true of all countries and that is why in approaching 
our own steps in international law making, the signature which 
will come formally in the next two weeks and the ratification 
which could be the same day, we have felt it necessary and 
desirable to press ahead with the treaty implementing 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to send a message to other countries where the 
legislature is involved, the United States as part of its 
Constitution with the Senate involved, to get their act together. 
If they are going to take part in the law making, then they must 
get their legal adhesion to the treaty completed.  If it means 
the signing, ratification and the legislation, get it done as 
quickly as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I direct attention to what is called the attrition factor in 
treaty making and the law making of treaties. I cite the famous 
law of the sea convention to which Canadian diplomats contributed 
so much.  It was to become law when ratified by 60 countries.  It 
was signed in 1982 by 102 countries but it took 14 years to get 
60 of those 102 to ratify it and make it law.  I could cite the 
first of the big terrorist control conventions, the Tokyo 
convention of 1963 on aerial piracy.  That was to become law when 
ratified by 12 countries.  It took eight years to get 12 
countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our case with this treaty 40 states are necessary to ratify 
it to give it legal effect.  Then it takes effect six months 
after the 40th instrument of ratification. We would like to 
complete the whole process beginning to end in a year.  That is 
why the momentum this Parliament is establishing with the consent 
of all parties is so vital. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another matter on which I should comment because I 
think we are helping consolidate law in the making. That is to 
say, what is the effect?  Some people have said that we have left 
out some of the principal manufacturers and exporters of land 
mines.  Some who might transfer to other countries are not bound. 
Is that not a treaty with gaps in it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me simply say that as a matter of international law going 
back to the dissenting opinion of the greatest of the judges of 
the International Court of the post-war period, Judge Manfred 
Lachs, a treaty even when not ratified by a country may become 
binding on that country simply because of the sheer preponderance 
of other countries who have ratified. That is to say, it ranks 
either as customary international law or it ranks in some cases 
as a superior form of international law, jus cogens. It may be 
binding on non-ratifiers or non-signatories and in the World 
Court case concerned it was West Germany.  I simply cite that 
that was an avant-garde opinion in 1969 when it was uttered in 
the World Court.  It is no longer avant-garde and is acquiring 
an increasing acceptance. We will find that jurists in Canada 
will be making that argument. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we can get 100, 120 or 140 countries to sign and ratify, it 
will be somebody with great temerity who would say we could 
ignore the treaty provisions.

<A HREF="#LINKT73"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us put it this way.  There is an educational value in 
signing and proclaiming acts of this sort and making them law 
even for those who do not sign them.  Countries are very 
concerned about their international law image. We are already 
finding this with countries we have approached to ask if they 
will join the treaty.  They are saying no, but maybe they can 
regard themselves and say that they will be bound by certain 
parts of it even though they do not sign and ratify the treaty as 
a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here I simply say that the International Court of Justice in its 
decision in nuclear tests established a principle of law that 
unilateral declarations of intention to be bound by principle, 
law, treaty or anything else of that sort can become legally 
binding entities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact the French government was held bound by a declaration 
made by its president, Giscard d'Estaing, and its foreign 
minister even though perhaps at the time they did not realize the 
significance that was given to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We think there is an educational value in going ahead.  That is 
one of the reasons we took this risk.  It is better to have a 
treaty with teeth in it even if it leaves out the United States, 
China and Russia.  It is better to have that than a vague, open 
ended treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are relying on the fact that many countries or some countries 
who have said they cannot for national political reasons sign and 
ratify the treaty yet say they believe they can adopt certain 
parts of it. We are going to encourage that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is law in the making.  Therefore in a second sense the 
innovation made by bringing in non-governmental people and 
participatory democracy, we are making new international law.  I 
commend the adoption of this legislation to this House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK256"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Graham (Toronto Centre—Rosedale, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I appreciate the unanimous consent of the House to allow 
me to share my time with the parliamentary secretary.  Although 
my gratitude is somewhat tempered by the enthusiasm with which 
the member for Red Deer insisted that it be restricted to 10 
minutes, I shall certainly do my best to restrain myself in 
accordance with his wishes and those of the other members of the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This treaty and this legislation we are considering today are 
the culmination of years of efforts of NGOs spearheaded by Jody 
Williams and her colleagues in the United States who appeared 
before our committee recently and were so ably seconded by our 
government, by the foreign affairs minister and by the Prime 
Minister. It illustrates as other members of the House have said 
how we can get things done in today's world in spite of the 
complexity of today's world.  With determination, work and above 
all co-operation we can bring in results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of this House and humanity as a whole owe a great debt 
of gratitude to the countless thousands of citizens and NGOs in 
many countries, governments and international organizations that 
have worked together on this great enterprise that will culminate 
here in Ottawa next week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard a great deal about land mines from the minister 
and others.  We have heard there are 110 million of them in the 
ground in countries like Bosnia, Laos, Cambodia, Angola, 
Afghanistan and Kurdistan where their military usefulness may be 
questioned but where their presence years after they have been 
put in is taking a toll from the population, women, children, 
farmers, anyone.  They not only create horrible human tragedies 
of lives lost in ruin but they also inhibit the development of 
the economies of those countries.  Millions of farmers are unable 
to continue their productive work and live in poverty because 
they no longer have access to their fields. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1975 there have been over one million casualties around 
the globe due to anti-personnel mines.  As the minister said, 
last week four members of the foreign affairs committee and four 
members of the defence committee visited Bosnia.  They had the 
opportunity of visiting with our troops and seeing firsthand the 
conditions created by the presence of those small objects which 
are so easy to put in and so costly and dangerous to remove. They 
are so ingenious in their destructiveness.  They are small, some 
no larger than a hockey puck and are placed in the ground. Some 
are attached to trees and can be set off by a trip wire to go off 
at maximum effect at the level of a head or a chest of an 
innocent person passing by.

<A HREF="#LINKT74"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We learned of the difficulty and the danger of removing these 
horribly effective weapons.  We met our troops and talked with 
them, our troops who risk their lives and limbs on a daily basis 
performing the delicate and dangerous task of removing them.  We 
think at this time of Corporal Mark Isfeld who gave his life in 
1994 in this task. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We visited the United Nations Mine Action Centre and learned 
that it takes 1,000 men one year to clear 10 square kilometres of 
mines and that at least 100 square kilometres of mines need to be 
cleared in Bosnia alone at minimum.  As there are only 750 
present practitioners of that art, it is estimated that some 30 
years or more will be required to clear that unfortunate place of 
the ravages of war.  We need only think of the same situation 
being replicated in Angola, Afghanistan, Laos and other 
unfortunate places on this globe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The conditions we saw illustrated the need for other aspects of 
the treaty, not just a ban on these items but the need for an 
effective compliance regime and effective mine clearance 
operations financed on a global scale.  To that must be added the 
need for aid to the victims if humanity's needs are to be served. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can take pride in the fact that Canada is contributing to all 
these important goals in places like Bosnia.  Referring to the 
work of our troops, they are removing mines themselves and 
training others to do the job as well.  They are supporting the 
United Nations de-mining centre.  We are contributing through the 
World Bank and other financial means to the work of that and 
other centres throughout the world as we are contributing both on 
a bilateral and multilateral basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are contributing to the rehabilitation of victims.  When we 
were in Bosnia we had the opportunity of visiting the hospital in 
Sarajevo.  We talked with doctors from Queen's University who 
were training other medical personnel in how to rehabilitate 
unfortunate victims.  We talked to CIDA experts who are doing the 
same.  We talked to our own troops who were in the process of 
helping to repaint and clean up hospitals which were damaged by 
war and which will serve the victims of this terrible tragedy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know this work is being done elsewhere throughout the world 
by CIDA and by other Canadian NGOs that operate courageously in 
far corners of the world under difficult circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation will implement the treaty and ensure its terms 
will be enforced in Canada.  This is the second agreement of this 
kind that the House has had to consider recently, the first 
treaty being the chemical weapons convention.  We saw the need to 
have a universally credible means of ensuring that an agreement 
of this kind is put in place, is effective and is enforceable 
throughout many countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my belief that this is not the last time the House will be 
called upon to enact similar legislation.  It is my belief that 
in the world in which we live today we will be called upon more 
and more to do work of this nature to ensure the world in which 
we live is a safer and a saner place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The treaty represents something in general to me as it should to 
members of the House.  What lessons can we reflect upon in 
relation to the issue as Canadians?  What does it tell us about 
our international role in an increasingly interdependent world? 
Why is Canada, a country with no land mine problem itself, 
spearheading what will always be known as the Ottawa process? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians believe in the need for our country to be an active 
participant in the global community, to make sure our values, in 
particular those of tolerance and compassion which have grown out 
of our bicultural and pluralistic society, are carried out into 
the world.  To this end we need to work productively with others, 
with other countries, international institutions, NGOs and 
individuals to bring people together in a common cause to better 
humanity.  In that sense the treaty and the legislation represent 
the Canadian goal.

<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I would just like to offer a small comment on 
the nature of our work today and on what has been accomplished by 
this treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that this treaty and the role Canada has been 
able to play in its preparation, the diplomatic success it 
represents, is proof yet again of what Canada can achieve as a 
strong and united country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure that most members present will agree with me that 
our strength internationally and our ability to effect change in 
the world for the well-being of humanity as shown by this treaty 
gain from the fact that we are a country united from sea to sea and 
that we bring our collective national experience to the 
international scene. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is therefore another lesson we want to draw from this 
experience, a lesson that will come up increasingly in the future 
in this heavily interdependent world, a lesson that can be of 
benefit to all, to the citizens of Quebec, Ontario, British 
Columbia and other provinces of this magnificent country. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are taking an important step today.  Let us build on it 
together for the benefit not only of all Canadians but of 
humanity as well. 
<P><A NAME="LINK257"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a 
privilege to stand before the House and speak to Bill C-22.  I 
will try to keep my remarks as brief as possible so that as many 
speakers as possible can speak to this important piece of 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just in starting off, as the member for Rosedale said, Canadians 
are pleased to see that parliamentarians can take issues like 
this one and through co-operation come up with a solution and 
move it quickly through the House.  Particularly in the area of 
foreign affairs they want to see that sort of diplomacy being 
demonstrated even in these premises, something we do not have a 
lot of, but certainly this is the opportunity for us to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my pleasure to congratulate the minister on his 
co-operation and on his achievement in pushing the matter through 
and on to the international scene.  All this started off in the 
last House with one of our members putting forward legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate the NGOs, Jody Williams and all the others who 
appeared before committee and had so much to do with the 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It serves us well as Canadians that our legislation, the 
legislation that we are now passing in the House, will be used as 
an example for some of the other 40-odd countries that have 
agreed to sign next week.  It will hopefully provide motivation 
for other countries to come on side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to admit that initially I was not very familiar with what 
mines were all about.  I certainly did not realize the 
significance of them.  We saw the map of Bosnia.  We saw pink all 
over the map.  We saw how the entire country was covered in 
mines.  We saw people in some of the border towns, perhaps half 
of the population, who literally did not have an arm, a hand or a 
leg.  That brought it home for all of us as to just how serious 
the problem was. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We found out that under the bark of trees there could be land 
mines, and that land mines were not something that were sticking 
out so that everybody could see but were hidden. 
They were in bricks with a little hair coming out that could 
trigger an explosion.  They were underneath what appeared to be 
full coke tins sitting on a table with a plastic explosive 
underneath it.  A young child could come along and grab that tin 
of coke and be maimed or killed.  Then one realizes just how 
serious the problem was and how it was something that could not 
be accepted by anyone in the human race.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was pretty easy for us to say we would co-operate on the 
issue and that we were proud Canadians to lead an initiative that 
would have an impact around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are areas of the legislation where the government has been 
given power within our country to encroach on some of our rights. 
However, in looking at it, most of us would agree that is an 
encroachment we can accept. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to be somewhat cautious in being too much of a boy scout 
when it comes to how we appear internationally.  We have to be 
sure that we are not just talking, that we really mean what we 
saying and that we really are committed to helping countries 
de-mine their fields, their riverbeds, their roadways and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is often easy for us to pass legislation.  I think back to 
when we talked about youth prostitution in foreign countries.  I 
cannot imagine how we would ever enforce that kind of 
legislation.  We feel good passing it and we agree with it but 
how would we enforce it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have talked about the Hague convention, something a 
subcommittee is working on, and kidnapped kids.  All of us 
realize how emotional and difficult that is.  It is easy to say 
we are against it but it is difficult to do something about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should have mentioned at the start that I will be sharing my 
time with the member for Calgary East. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  There is a slight 
problem.  The House will have to give its consent to that since 
the hon. member has a 40-minute slot.  Perhaps we could clarify 
that now.  Is there consent for the hon. member to share his 
time? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am sorry for not mentioning 
that at the outset. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to be sure we will put ourselves into the enforcement of 
the legislation and continue to promote it even though it will be 
difficult at times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have to talk about the huge problem of de-mining that 
exists around the world.  We have figures like 200 million or 300 
million mines being out there.  The numbers are huge.  We need to 
help people to help themselves in that area.  Our Canadian troops 
are doing the job by helping children to know where the mines 
are, to alert the authorities and to actually do something about 
it.  Those are the kinds of commitments that do not cost a lot 
but are important if we are to rid the world of this serious 
problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must understand some of the reasons some countries will not 
sign initially.  We heard Mr. Clinton in Vancouver yesterday say 
that the reason they could not give up land mines was for the 
protection of their own soldiers.  We may or may not agree with 
that reason, but we need to encourage them to come up with 
alternatives to the use of regular land mines.  There are 
alternatives.  As science progresses I am sure these alternatives 
will be used by countries like the U.S.

<A HREF="#LINKT77"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have to look at renegade states and their potential use 
of land mines.  I am a firm believer, as I have said in this 
House many times, that in the 21st century terrorism is probably 
going to be one of our biggest threats as citizens of this world. 
Of course we have to be concerned about the presence of land 
mines, the use of land mines and the use of different types of 
explosive devices.  We could talk about plutonium being sent to 
Canada from Russia.  We could talk about that whole area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important for us to put a diplomatic and organizational 
pressure on the world which we are in an excellent position to 
do.  I think of our membership in organizations such as the 
Francophonie, the Commonwealth and APEC.  Through those 
organizations we can bring a lot of pressure to bear on countries 
to consider signing this treaty and getting rid of land mines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point that we need to make in the House is that we are not 
just going to talk about it.  We are not simply going to pass 
this bill, pat ourselves on the back and move on to something 
else.  We have to be sure that this is an ongoing process and one 
which will last a long time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that a number of members of the House have experienced 
firsthand what it means to see people living under the fear of 
land mines.  We in Canada are lucky.  When we come back from 
places like Bosnia, Cambodia or Laos we realize how lucky we are 
to live in this country.  Our children do not have to worry about 
running out and playing in the field because there are no land 
mines.  Let us never let there be land mines in this country and 
let us try to remove them from the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that we broaden this to look at UN reform.  The 
minister made reference to this.  Certainly the streamlining of 
the UN is something that will help us all to achieve what we want 
in the 21st century.  Changes within the UN are desperately 
needed.  We must work with the NGOs and other countries to make 
sure they are not so busy fighting turf wars and fighting over 
what they are going to do that we have this this terrible 
duplication of services and the terrible bureaucracy which ties 
up so much of what they do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should mention the foreign affairs committee.  Many people do 
not know what we do in that committee.  There are several members 
in the Chamber who are a part of that committee, as well as 
others. It is important for us to deal with issues such as this 
and that we deal with current issues that are of concern to the 
Canadian public.  So often we get hung up on writing big reports. 
The big reports basically end up consuming a lot of time and 
expertise.  They cost a lot of money.  Ultimately they end up 
being put on the shelf. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an example of a case where there is an issue that is 
real.  We can put a face on it.  It is something which people 
care about.  It is something that the committee can get involved 
in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of members have urged the government to make committees 
relevant.  We have urged the government to let the committees 
deal directly with the minister.  We want the committees to talk 
about the issues, be they slavery in the Sudan, the terrible 
problems in Nigeria and Iraq, the kidnapping of Canadian children 
or terrorism.  Let us talk about those issues which are real to 
Canadians and real to members of this House for which we can, 
hopefully, have the same sort of conclusion as we have seen 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is something to work toward.  Some of it will be a dream. 
We have seen this sort of presentation before.  We all know about 
the failures which have happened.  However, it is time for us to 
look at what we are doing and try to make things better.

implementation of this piece of legislation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK258"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is my pleasure to speak in support of this bill today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-22 is an important bill and I am happy to have this 
opportunity to share my comments with my colleagues in this 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take a moment to express my appreciation for the 
tireless hours that several individuals have dedicated to this 
very worthwhile cause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Internationally the names of this year's Nobel Peace prize 
recipient, Jody Williams and her organization, and the efforts of 
the late Princess Diana brought international attention to this 
cause.  I applaud the Nobel Prize committee for recognizing the 
efforts of Jody Williams and her organization who rightfully 
deserve the Nobel Peace prize. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here in Canada there are many individuals and groups such as 
Mines Action Canada who have taken the initial momentum to work 
toward an international ban on land mines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On a more personal note, I applaud my colleague for 
Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca who has worked tirelessly over these past 
several years in making this an issue on the Canadian stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In late 1995 he introduced a private member's bill that called 
for an international ban on the anti-personnel mines, a bill 
which was supported by the then Minister of Foreign Affairs. When 
the current minister came into this portfolio, he too supported 
this initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs for his efforts which began the 
Ottawa process.  This is a proud achievement for Canada.  My 
congratulations go out to all Canadians who participated and made 
it possible to bring together over 120 countries which will be 
present in Ottawa next week for the signing of the treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This treaty includes the banning of the use, production, 
stockpiling and the trade of anti-personnel land mines.  It also 
includes assistance for de-mining and for victims of land mines. 
This was intended to be a collective disarmament treaty and has 
several significant humanitarian elements that will not only ban 
the creation of the land mines but also ban countries from using 
and trading them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's exemption will allow it to import, export and possess 
mines for military training, mine clearing and destruction. 
Police officers and the RCMP will also have the authority to 
possess and transfer the mines in the course of their duties to 
defuse them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the event that a country falls under suspicion of violating 
the treaty, fact finders will be sent by the international 
community.  They will have the powers to search and seize them 
with or without warrant.  Dwelling houses can be inspected with a 
warrant.  Warrants are not required to search military bases 
and/or warehouse facilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill comes into effect once given royal assent and also 
takes effect in all provinces.  As I only have 10 minutes on this 
bill, I will leave most of the technical details of this 
legislation to those who have spoken before me as well as those 
who will speak after me, as I agree with most aspects of this 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Land mines are a very serious issue in the international arena. 
The use of anti-personnel mines already violates numerous tenants 
under international law.  Each and every year it is estimated 
that over 250,000 individuals are at the least maimed and all too 
often killed by land mines.  That works out to one person every 
20 minutes.  This is a tragic loss.  To make it even more tragic 
is that these losses are often unnecessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without the removal of land mines in post-war areas, many of the 
land mine victims have died or have been injured unnecessarily. 
These land mines are currently deployed in over 70 countries, 
most of them developing countries.  Countries such as 
Afghanistan, Angola, Bosnia, Cambodia, Croatia, Eritrea, Iraq, 
Mozambique, Somalia, Sudan and Vietnam are all affected. 
There are approximately 100 million mines that are waiting for 
their next victim.  With the variety of land mines in existence, 
there are over 350 different types of land mines.  The severity 
of injury can be quite varied. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1740"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT79"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These losses could have been and, more importantly, should have 
been prevented.  Land mines do not discriminate.  They will 
target any individual who comes into their path.  Our brave 
peacekeepers have paid a heavy price in places like Bosnia. These 
brave soldiers carry on their duties which bring honour and pride 
to our nation and are to be saluted for their courageous work in 
spite of danger to their lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to note that those who manufacture or order 
the deployment of land mines themselves are in no danger of 
losing life or limb to these land mines.  It is instead the 
soldiers that are at risk as well as innocent civilians who 
ultimately are the victims of this senseless carnage.  I often 
wonder how many politicians or high ranking officials face danger 
from these land mines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take a personal interest in this bill.  Coming from Tanzania, 
which is the northern neighbour of Mozambique, a country which 
has been devastated by the use of land mines, which has been the 
result of an internal conflict within that country, from my 
experiences in my native land, I can see how land mines placed 
indiscriminately can cause havoc in the civilian population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In these countries the infrastructure development is 
concentrated in the urban centres.  In the countryside people 
walk on trails and bush paths going from village to village. 
Women use these trails to fetch water from rivers and from wells. 
Children play using these areas, running up and down these trails 
to meet their friends from neighbouring villages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When unchecked, the use of these land mines interferes with a 
society whose primary mode of transportation in the countryside 
is the time honoured use of two feet.  We can, therefore, 
visualize what terrible deeds these land mines can do.  Women, 
children, elderly people, soldiers all pay a heavy price for the 
absurdity of men who pursue political agendas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those who manufacture such items of horror should be held as 
responsible as those who place those land mines.  It is only 
fitting.  Therefore, we can move forward and stop manufacturing 
land mines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are real economic costs to the production and removal of 
land mines is estimated at 2 million land mines being deployed 
every year.  When one considers the cost of production for each 
land mine which runs anywhere from $3 to $70 each, just think 
what this money could be better spent on.  It is estimated that 
approximately 100,000 mines are removed each year at a cost of 
approximately $300 to $1,000 each.  With these figures there is 
an estimated cost of approximately $50 billion.  Although this 
figure is enormous, I would argue that this would not compare to 
the loss of life.  It is believed that for every mine removed 
another 20 are planted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the current rate of de-mining, if more land mines were to be 
placed it would take over 1,000 years to rid the world of these 
dangerous killers.  Getting rid of these mines is not going to be 
easy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Besides the sheer time involved in finding these mines, as most 
mine fields are not mapped out, de-mining is a very dangerous 
job. It is believed that for every 5,000 mines removed, one 
person will be killed and another two will suffer injuries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on and on and read a whole list of statistics and 
figures, but that does not bring the real issue to the forefront. 
This is not a financial issue, but an issue of our core moral 
values. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The contribution that those who were maimed or killed would have 
made to our society would have far outweighed the so-called 
economic loss of getting rid of these land mines.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To put it more simply and bluntly, one cannot put a price tag on 
life.  We all have to move forward to ensure that this senseless 
killing of innocent civilians and soldiers stops. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to note that several key nation states have not yet 
signed this treaty and I hope they overcome their differences and 
sign on as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the most part these countries are citing security reasons 
for using the mines.  Yet often the use of these mines is as 
destructive for the armies that have set up the mines as for the 
enemies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We now live in a global village.  We are members of one gigantic 
family.  Our efforts should be devoted to promoting harmony and 
peaceful coexistence.  All religions of the world espouse 
neighbourly love.  Wars are destructive, causing loss of precious 
human life, breaking up families, causing pain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we have a long way to go before we can peacefully 
coexist.  This treaty is the first step toward achieving that 
goal and it receives my full unconditional support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I would like to say that while I stand proudly in 
supporting this bill, I also feel and share the pain of those who 
were the victims of land mines.  To them I say while we may have 
been late and have let them down, our prayers are that our 
present and future generations will not suffer the same pain that 
they have suffered.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois—Salaberry, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
wish to inform you that I will be sharing my time with my 
colleague, the member for Laval East. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> As I indicated during the speech by the 
hon. member for Red Deer, since the hon. member had 40 minutes at 
his disposal, the consent of the House is required for him to 
divide his time with another member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is there unanimous consent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Daniel Turp:</B> Mr. Speaker, the first time I heard about the 
convention and anti-personnel mines was when I was having discussions 
with colleagues at the Université libre in Brussels. Professors and 
students in international law were calling for the elimination of these 
“instruments of death”, as they were already calling them at the 
beginning of this decade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an issue that I became involved in, as did everyone who was 
calling for disarmament, everyone who was following, in Vienna and 
elsewhere, the conferences organized to bring the international 
community to abandon the instruments of death such as nuclear arms, 
smaller arms, mines of all types and especially anti-personnel mines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I still had not seen personally what these instruments of 
death were until I went with my colleagues in this House to 
Bosnia-Hercegovina several weeks ago, where we were briefed on several 
occasions on these mines, on how they operate, on the way they kill and 
the way they endanger human life. It was a rather moving experience and 
one that showed how important it was to support the international 
community's objective of banning the production and use of these mines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These facts helped me convince the members of our party, the Bloc 
Quebecois, to support the initiative of the Minister of External Affairs 
and to ensure that our party would give its support to the convention as 
it is outlined today in the Canadian legislation.

<A HREF="#LINKT81"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Increased awareness of this in Canada and abroad issue must not, 
however, lead us to forget that this convention is an unfinished 
creation and will undoubtedly remain so. The debate we witnessed today 
in this House reveals how much we live in a system where democracy has 
its failings when it comes to signing such a convention and implementing 
it in domestic law. I would like to take a few minutes to discuss each 
of these issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This convention will most likely be signed by over 100 countries on 
December 3 and 4. Apparently, some 120 countries will be in Ottawa to 
sign this convention. 
But there are 191 countries in the international community and at least 
70 states will not be there, 70 states that have not yet committed to 
eliminating these mines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And also the states who will be signing the convention will have to 
become parties to this convention and to ensure that their legislature 
or their government will ratify or endorse it. Among the states that are 
still hesitating to support this convention, there are three members of 
the Security Council, that is the United States, Russia and China, which 
are some of the most powerful nations in the world and which refuse to 
come to Ottawa or buy into the Ottawa process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, this work is unfinished and it might remain unfinished. 
In that sense, the work accomplished by the Minister of Foreign Affairs 
is only beginning and the work of all those who supported him, including 
the work that is being done in this House, must continue. 
The Bloc Quebecois will support the initiatives taken to ensure that 
this convention will have an increasing impact on the international 
community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the debate today helped illustrate how parliament and 
parliamentarians lack a proper voice, I would say an adequate voice, in 
the process by which treaties are adopted, the process by which treaties 
are developed and create obligations that are very important and that 
often entail legislation, as with this treaty, by which treaty 
obligations can be implemented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We presented this afternoon an amendment which sought to determine 
to what extent the government was willing to commit itself to a 
democratization of the process by which treaties are concluded. 
The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of External Affairs was 
speaking earlier of the democratization of external relations that had 
been witnessed by the international community with the adoption of this 
treaty, which involves not only governments but also non-government 
organizations, which of course work in partnership with international 
bodies. It is time to also democratize the process by which states 
participate in international negotiations and in the conclusion of 
international treaties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois therefore attempted to determine in what frame 
of mind the Minister of External Affairs was operating in this area, and 
it found out that this issue did not create as much interest as it 
should, although it will be raised when the Standing Committee on 
Foreign Affairs and International Trade meets. The Bloc Quebecois hopes 
that, at that time, there will be a real debate leading to important 
changes to the this process.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case, therefore, by the end of the day we will have a 
bill, one we have sought to enrich by constructive proposals aimed 
at improving the implementing legislation.  This will be a bill for 
implementation of a convention with which the Bloc Quebecois is 
basically in agreement, a convention which will bind Canada, when 
it has signed and ratified the convention, and which will one day, 
I am sure, bind the sovereign Quebec so wished for by the Bloc 
Quebecois, in accordance with the requirements of international law 
which will be applicable when the State of Quebec state attains 
sovereignty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, this treaty and this act will be a source of 
pride for the international community next week. It is true that 
the Minister of Foreign Affairs has shared with his colleagues, and 
with those in this House, the glory involved in getting this 
convention signed, but it is the international community that will 
benefit from it.  It is the men, women and children of the world 
who will be the main beneficiaries, for their basic rights, the 
most fundamental one being the right to life, will be better 
protected by this convention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Humanity will be the beneficiary of this convention, a 
humanity composed of the men and women whom states and nations have 
a duty to protect at all times, including when treaties are signed. 
I would like to use the words of a great internationalist, one that 
Professor Jacques-Yvan Morin, an academic colleague of mine and a 
professor of international law known in political circles, having 
been a minister and deputy premier in Quebec, has a predilection 
for quoting. In fact, he quoted him in his 1994 course at the 
academy of international law.  The quotationis from Bartholomé de 
Las Casas, the great internationalist, who said “<I>Todas las naciones 
son hombres</I>”.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):</B> Mr Speaker, I would like to 
say right off that I rise to speak with great interest on Bill 
C-22, which concerns the implementation of the Convention on the 
Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of 
Anti-Personnel Mines and on their Destruction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do so as well with considerable compassion for those, often 
innocent individuals, whom death has claimed or whose quality of 
life has been significantly reduced through the explosion of a 
mine.  There is another important element to this too, that of 
de-mining and the effort expended by the international community 
in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One fact remains, and it represents an important step.  In a 
few days, in Ottawa, we will witness the signing of the convention 
prohibiting anti-personnel mines.  Unfortunately, this treaty will 
not resolve the problem once and for all, because certain major 
countries will not be signatories. 
It will, however, help to limit the terrible effects.  The Bloc 
Quebecois recognizes the leadership of the Government of Canada and 
its Minister of Foreign Affairs in this matter along with the 
efforts of the public and the NGOs.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now give some background on anti-personnel mines. 
These mines are cheap weapons.  Each costs somewhere between US$3 
and US$50 and has as its sole purpose the mutilation of the enemy. 
Despite its low purchase cost, this is a pernicious weapon that 
continues its destruction long beyond the end of wars and 
conflicts, as we will see. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Inexpensive, easily produced and effective, these weapons were 
used in a good many conflicts. 
It will be recalled that the war between India and Pakistan, the war 
between Iraq and Iran, the Gulf War and the domestic conflicts in 
Cambodia and Angola demonstrated the destructive power of anti-personnel 
mines. First used as defensive weapons in international conflicts, they 
formed a protective barrier essentially designed to slow enemy progress. 
That is what mine fields were used for originally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the use of such mines was expanded. Today they are used in 
domestic conflicts and in civil wars, they are used by police forces as 
well as by insurgent, guerrilla and paramilitary groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The saddest thing about all this is that some governments use these 
mines against their own population. In Kurdistan, the Iraqi government 
is said to have mined the fields of several villages, to terrorize the 
villagers into submission. 
Anti-personnel mines thus become tools to control population movements 
and to create fear within the population, the main goal being, sadly, to 
kill and maim civilians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we can see, the use of anti-personnel mines has many very 
serious consequences. And as if the situation were not terrifying enough 
as it is, civilians are now faced with this problem, as anti-personnel 
create war-like conditions in peacetime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anti-personnel mines make no discrimination between men, women and 
children, innocent victims of cruel wars taking place in their country. 
Those mines that are left behind cause human tragedies of untold 
sadness. Most of the time, mine victims who are not killed lose a limb. 
However, let us remember that countries having to deal with 
anti-personnel mines are almost all developing countries, poor 
countries that cannot provide adequate care to the injured 
because of a lack of human and financial resources. These heavily 
handicapped victims are unable to participate in the local 
economy, to work to provide for their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And what about the economic tragedies caused by anti-personnel 
mines? In some countries, farmers are unable to cultivate their lands or 
to put their cattle out to pasture because their fields are mine-ridden. 
We have seen previously self-sufficient farming areas that now depend on 
external food aid. For example, it is estimated that in some areas of 
Angola anti-personnel mines have reduced food production by more than 
25%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, it is quite often impossible to deliver food, because 
truck drivers will not venture out on roads that are strewn with mines. 
At the same time, besides causing terror, mines prevent post-war 
reconstruction by interfering with the work of humanitarian 
organizations and peacekeeping forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, if there is something horrifying and unacceptable when it 
comes to anti-personnel mines, it is the physical and psychological harm 
done to the children who are the victims of these barbaric weapons. The 
images of innocent children horribly burned by napalm caused universal 
consternation. The effects of anti-personnel mines are every bit as 
devastating.

<A HREF="#LINKT84"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For this reason, and it is not the only one, as we have seen, 
governments that have signed this convention must pursue their 
persuasive efforts with non-signatory governments.  As I said 
earlier, however, the problems caused by anti-personnel mines will 
not disappear overnight with the signing of this convention.  Their 
impact will be greatly diminished, it is true.  The issue of mine 
clearing will, however, remain intact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Worse yet, for every mine removed from the ground, 20 new 
mines are being laid at the present time.  At this rate, it is 
estimated that it would take 1,100 years and over $30 billion to 
completely eliminate the anti-personnel mines now scattered 
throughout the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is therefore imperative that mine clearing be approached 
effectively and with tools as modern as those used to lay them.  We 
know, however, that mine clearing is an expensive operation.  In 
1994, the UN spent $70 million US to clear fewer than 100,000 
mines.  As a matter of fact, it costs between $300 and $1,000 to 
remove a single mine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The international community can claim that it does not have 
the resources necessary to remove all mines.  The fact is, however, 
that, in the 1980s, exports of heavy and of light arms to third 
world countries represented 70% of the world trade of rich 
countries.  There is an obvious international responsibility here 
with respect to countries that have become poor to the advantage of 
rich countries and arms lobbies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But, despite a large drop in heavy arms exports to developing 
countries, we have been seeing a worrisome proliferation of light 
arms in the 1990s. 
An analysis reveals, and I quote “From 1980 to 1995, ten African 
nations with a total population of 155 million were torn apart by 
civil wars.  Between 3.8 and 6.9 million people, or 2.5 to 4.5% of 
the population of these ten countries, died, almost all of them 
killed by light weapons.  It seems that the leaders of western 
nations are increasingly preoccupied by arms stockpiling in third 
world trouble spots, in the very areas to which they are being 
called to send ceasefire monitoring groups.  An awareness seems to 
be emerging from this fundamental contradiction:  on the one hand, 
rich nations are trying to end conflicts while, on the other, they 
are continuing to supply arms to belligerent nations”.  History is 
repeating itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here again, action must be taken and solutions do exist. 
This is why the successful implementation of the Anti-Personnel Mines 
Convention is very encouraging and gives us hope that a multilateral 
agreement on light weapons can be reached. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the Bloc Quebecois reaffirms its support to Bill 
C-22. The Ottawa process has become essential. However, as I said 
previously, we still have a long way to go. At first, our purpose was to 
deal with tanks and other armoured vehicles, but now we want to protect 
the civilians whose lives are threatened by these anti-personnel mines, 
the people who have suffered the most from war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The signing of the Anti-Personnel Mines Convention, next 
December 3, will hopefully reduce the number of these human tragedies. 
However, de-mining remains a sensitive issue that the world community 
has yet to address seriously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the price we have to pay to give some meaning to the words 
justice and fairness. 
It is also the price we have to pay for peace and security.

any way, shape or form to deny anyone the opportunity to speak on 
this very important matter.  As can be witnessed by the number of

<A NAME="LINK262">&nbsp;</A>

the House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK264"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is a great honour for me to stand on behalf of the New Democratic 
Party to speak in support of our country's initiative to ban land 
mines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This treaty is a testament to the power that people can have 
when they act together and to the positive power that governments 
can have when they put their minds to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just one year ago most nations of the world decided that even 
though the economic costs were large and the military 
implications larger, this issue is a moral one.  Anti-personnel 
land mines are an evil which has no place in the arsenal of 
modern democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada we are blessed with thousands of kilometres of open 
space.  It is difficult for me to imagine living in a country 
where you risk crossing a unseen border with every step, the 
border between your life today and a life without a leg or a life 
without your child; where the field you and your family have 
tilled for generations is now a dangerous and foreign land full 
of hazards that could in an instant destroy lives and ruin 
futures; where your children cannot play in the streets or in the 
woods; where there is no freedom from fear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps I feel strongly about this treaty because I am the 
mother of a young daughter.  I read about the scores of children 
like her who are killed or maimed every day by mines.  I read 
about mines made with brightly coloured plastic or cloth designed 
to attract children, designed to kill children.  Designs like 
these have no place in the world I want for my daughter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada and other first world countries we spend a lot of time 
talking about rights and duties and codes of acceptable 
behaviour. At the same time we have allowed our governments to 
manufacture and export land mines, weapons whose only purpose is 
to cripple and to maim.  That is the worst sort of hypocrisy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1868 and the St. Petersburg declaration which outlawed 
weapons which uselessly aggravate suffering, through to the 
Geneva convention which banned the use of terror against 
non-combatants, governments have worked long and hard to make 
sure that human lives are spared the painful excesses of modern 
military technology.  But they have worked simultaneously to 
advance that technology, to make it possible to develop devices 
like the gravel mine I talked about a minute ago, a mine that 
includes the following line in its owners manual:  “They are 
especially effective against inquisitive children.  They make 
life difficult for rural communities without endangering troops 
and armoured vehicles”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How about the wide area anti-personnel mine.  These are dropped 
from aircraft and throw out eight fine threads which then act as 
trip wires.  Anyone who steps on any of the trip wires sets off 
the mines and lethal pellets scatter over an area of 60 metres. 
Mines have been filled with flechettes, small and irregularly 
shaped scraps that embed themselves deep in the victim's flesh. 
Some are made of plastic, not because it is cheaper but because 
the plastic will not show up on X-rays.  A surgeon has to gouge 
blindly inside the patient's body. A recent innovation has been 
to tip the pellets with depleted uranium so victims will also 
suffer from radiation poisoning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what the governments of the world have been working on 
in their labs while the leaders preach peace and compassion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This treaty is a huge step forward, a step on to safer ground. 
We are not free from danger yet. 
Until the superpowers have the courage to sign this treaty and 
the United States has the courage to accept the ban 
wholeheartedly, we know that every day for decades to come more 
lives will be shattered by mines.

<A HREF="#LINKT86"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every year in Europe a few mines left over from the second world 
war explode, killing yet more people.  That war ended over 50 
years ago.  Since then more mines have been laid than ever. 
Countries like Afghanistan, Vietnam, Cambodia, Angola and Bosnia 
are carpeted with bombs that will take decades to clear. During 
those decades more families were broken.  This is a fact and one 
we cannot escape, but we can reflect on it and do our best to 
make sure the cycle of violence and death is broken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The United Nations has done excellent work co-ordinating mine 
clearing projects around the world but that work is useless 
unless we, members of the governments of the world, promise to 
ourselves and our children that we will stop adding to the 
stockpile.  Making that promise means more than speeches in the 
House of Commons.  It means applying the full moral weight of our 
nation to those countries that still insist land mines are a 
vital part of their defences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is ironic that today the leaders of the APEC nations are 
gathered in Vancouver hosted by our Prime Minister.  The leaders 
of China and the United States both have refused to sign this 
treaty.  Yesterday U.S. President Bill Clinton at least had the 
courage to congratulate Canada and urged us to move forward with 
the treaty.  Meanwhile the Chinese government, which is 
responsible for a large percentage of the global manufacture and 
export of mines, has refused to sign the treaty and even to 
discuss signing the treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is truly a positive step for this Liberal government to have 
initiated this treaty.  I want to extend sincere thanks from the 
NDP caucus to our Minister of Foreign Affairs for his diligent 
work to make this treaty a reality.  It shows what governments 
can do when they decide to make a positive difference.  My only 
regret is that it often seems the minister is a lone voice in 
this administration pushing for a more moral and humane approach 
to foreign affairs.  While he pressures the Chinese and tries to 
take them to task for their refusal to meet the standards of 
international decency, other government leaders are wining and 
dining the Chinese president in Vancouver. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am just one person whose voice has joined the global chorus 
calling for the abolition of land mines.  There are tens of 
thousands of others, including the winners of this year's Nobel 
peace prize and many other individuals, groups and governments. I 
would also like to mention the efforts made by the British Labour 
government and Prime Minister Tony Blair who have shown what a 
moral government with the courage to use its authority can do. 
For them banning land mines is part of the moral philosophy of 
social democracy just as it is for us in the NDP caucus. It is 
part and parcel of our belief in human dignity and international 
co-operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This issue has to be put in a larger context.  Land mines are an 
obvious and unquestionably evil expression of man's inhumanity to 
man, but there are others just as evil that receive little or no 
attention from the world's leaders.  To be brutal, why ban land 
mines if there are no hospitals to treat children with measles? 
Why replace death from shrapnel wounds with death from malaria, 
with death from cold or hunger? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This treaty must be a first step, but the fact that I can rise 
in this House to discuss the issue that our government has been 
the author of a civilized page in the global book of laws remains 
a credit to this government.  We are creating a new law for the 
civilized countries of the world and that is a worthy thing.  On 
behalf of the people of my riding, of my party and for myself and 
my daughter Kayla, I thank all the people who made this treaty a 
reality. 
<P><A NAME="LINK265"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I remind the hon. member that there were others involved 
in the land mines process.  Mines Action Canada, a conglomeration 
of non-governmental organizations, has done an outstanding job of 
bringing this issue forward.  Other members of Parliament in this 
House have brought the issue forward.  Members of the public have 
been bringing the issue forward for the past four years.  It was 
not just the government that worked on this. I just wanted to 
correct the member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also wanted to correct the member on another point.  Not only 
England was involved in this process and only after Princess 
Diana pushed the government to pursue this course, but other 
countries around the world including Norway and Canada were also 
involved. 
Belgium was one of the first countries in the world to take the 
initiative of unilaterally destroying its mines.  It banned mines 
before the issue ever came to the forefront.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to set the record straight on that point.  If the 
member wants to correct her speech to that effect, I am sure she 
is free to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Michelle Dockrill:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
thank the hon. member for his comments.  As we all know, our time 
for speaking is very limited.  I could have continued on a lot 
longer to mention the things which he just talked about. 
<P><A NAME="LINK266"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, my 
comments will be brief today but extraordinarily meaningful. I 
will be sharing my time with the hon. member for 
Compton—Stanstead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are challenging times for a middle power.  In a post cold 
war environment there has been a sharp decline in the role of the 
nation state in terms of its ability to meaningfully impact 
foreign policy and international policy.  There has been a 
commensurate increase in the power and strength of NGOs, 
multinational corporations and in fact in individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This treaty is an example of how government can recognize the 
changing times and harness the new power of NGOs to create 
meaningful foreign policy amidst the challenges of a new 
environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another trend in a post cold war environment is the entrance of 
a new phrase, a new term, and that is human security.  Human 
security is being used increasingly in place of national security 
in a growing foreign policy circle.  Human security recognizes 
that since the end of the cold war most conflicts have been 
interstate conflicts.  The majority of those interstate conflicts 
have been between governments and their own people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is in that environment we must recognize we need to protect 
the security and the safety of individuals.  Hence human security 
is increasingly becoming as important as national security. This 
land mine treaty recognizes this trend as well and serves to 
strengthen human security for all citizens of the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada must continue to play a vigilant role in utilizing all 
levers at our disposal, including the World Bank and the IMF, to 
pressure non-signatories to come on board and support this 
treaty. We must also ensure that the financial resources are made 
available to assist countries in complying with the conditions of 
this treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's leadership role in the Ottawa process stands as an 
example of what we can achieve.  It also stands as an example of 
what we must continue to do, which is that we must continue to 
play a strong role as a middle power in a post cold war 
environment.  We can and must continue in the tradition of Lester 
Pearson and in the tradition of Joe Clark to play a pivotal role 
in foreign policy, in foreign affairs, and to protect the rights, 
security and safety of all peoples. 
<P><A NAME="LINK267"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Price (Compton—Stanstead, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
will also be very brief.  I have a couple of comments to make 
with respect to the speeches which have been made by hon. members 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Jody Williams was mentioned several times.  I attended a 
breakfast for her a couple of weeks ago, as did many hon. 
members.  When she was questioned on what she would be doing for 
her next project, she was quite clear that she had nowhere near 
finished her project on land mines.  She said that she would be 
continuing with that project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now we have the opportunity to take this issue one step 
further, which is the type of thing she would like to do.  The 
Asia-Pacific economic co-operation meeting is taking place in 
Vancouver.  I understand that the APEC meeting will not address 
human rights concerns, that it will only address economies. That 
is not the right thing to do.  I know that many Canadians and the 
minister feel that this is not the right thing to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The human rights records of our trading partners should be 
mentioned and not just in passing.  Similarly, APEC provides an 
excellent opportunity to discuss security matters.  The Pacific 
Rim is becoming more volatile as communist China grows stronger 
and North Korea becomes more and more unpredictable.  In the 
future APEC will address international security concerns in the 
region. It will soon not be able to ignore the issue.  It would 
be a wonderful start to set an important precedent if Canada led 
this initiative.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my suggestion that Canada bring up the issue of the land 
mines treaty fully and publicly and not just in bilateral 
meetings.  If the government is really serious about ridding the 
world of land mines, the APEC summit would be a timely 
opportunity to challenge countries to join. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, I want to congratulate the government and particularly 
the Minister of Foreign Affairs for his efforts. 
<P><A NAME="LINK268"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Pratt (Nepean—Carleton, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
will be sharing my time with the hon. member for Burlington. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased to be able to speak on this legislation before 
the House today.  It will enable Canada to fulfil its obligations 
under the international convention banning land mines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members of this House know, over 100 countries will come to 
Ottawa on December 3 to participate at the Treaty Signing 
Conference and Mine Action Forum.  This event will bring to a 
close the Ottawa process which was initiated last year by the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs after the United Nations sponsored 
conference on disarmament talks in Geneva bogged down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation, which is entitled the anti-personnel mines 
convention implementation act, is of course necessary in order to 
give the full force of law to Canada's political and diplomatic 
obligations as a signatory to the convention. I certainly hope 
that other signatories to the treaty act with the same speed and 
resolve that we in this Parliament have demonstrated in ratifying 
this treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the residents of my riding of Nepean—Carleton, I 
would also like to once again offer my personal congratulations 
to the Minister of Foreign Affairs for the tremendous personal 
effort he put into this initiative.  He has made all of Canada 
proud. His efforts are very much in keeping with the finest 
traditions of Canadian diplomacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Canadians think of our diplomatic achievements, they think 
about Lester Pearson, the Suez crisis and peacekeeping.  We can 
add to that list the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the land 
mines treaty.  Great credit is of course also due to the hundreds 
of NGOs, international organizations led by American activist 
Jody Williams and supported by others like the late Diana, 
Princess of Wales.  Together a very important humanitarian goal 
has been achieved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have all heard about the statistics on land mines.  There are 
an estimated 100 million mines in the ground in 70 countries 
around the globe.  Every 20 minutes a person is maimed or killed 
by an anti-personnel mine. For every mine taken out of the 
ground, 20 new mines are planted.  Fully 80% of the casualties 
are innocent civilians, a large portion are children and women. 
They live in countries like Afghanistan, Cambodia, Mozambique, 
Somalia and Vietnam.  Long after the wars for which the land 
mines have been sown have ended, the legacy of the land mine 
lives on with random and indiscriminate violence causing death 
and serious injury. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the North American continent we are very fortunate indeed not 
to have to live with the constant threat of land mines as we go 
about our daily lives.  Others are not so lucky. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seven years ago I travelled to Zimbabwe in southern Africa as 
part of a CIDA sponsored delegation.  One aspect of our visit 
involved a trip to a refugee camp on the Mozambique border called 
Tongagora.  What I saw there in three and a half hours left me 
with an unforgettable image of what life is like for many people 
less fortunate than we are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For over 40,000 refugees from the war in Mozambique, many 
attempting to overcome the effects of malnutrition, malaria and 
diarrhoea and other diseases, this camp was their home.  Over 
half the population of the camp were children.  Many showed the 
physical scars of war, including amputated limbs as well as other 
disfiguring wounds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sight of one child in particular seared an image on my brain 
which I will never forget.  Like all the children in the camp, 
this young fellow was clothed in rags.  He was probably about 11 
or 12 years old and walked with a makeshift crutch to support 
himself because one of his legs was amputated at the knee. 
One-half of his jaw on the right side looked as if it had been 
blown away.  When I looked at that child from a comfortable seat 
on a bus as we were leaving the camp, the only thing I could 
think of was the fact that he would never enjoy the life that so 
many of us in this country are blessed with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Starting life as a refugee is bad enough but having to cope with 
amputated limbs and serious disfigurement takes an extremely bad 
situation and makes it dramatically worse.  Whether he suffered 
his injuries from a land mine is something I will never know, but 
it is clear that the land mines were responsible for many of the 
amputated limbs at that camp. 
Every time I see that young boy's face in my mind's eye, I think 
of the land mines and the incalculable damage done to innocents. 
As unfortunate as that boy was, many land mine victims in 
Mozambique never made it to a refugee camp.  Some simply could 
not make the long journey to safety and others bled to death at 
or close to the land mine that they had detonated.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The effect of land mines goes beyond the physical damage that is 
done.  Also of concern is the profound psychological damage that 
accompanies living with land mines.  A series of letters which 
appeared in last Saturday's <I>Globe and Mail</I> from young 
Bosnians about the menace of land mines speaks eloquently of 
their effect on young minds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One young man, Admir Mujkic, a grade 12 student in east Tuzla 
wrote “Spring will come soon.  Warm nights full of temptation to 
go out for a walk.  We have had enough of smoke filled cafes, but 
where to go.  Mines are all around us.  Our fields, meadows, 
forests are probably covered with mines.  That could probably 
ruin my life or somebody else's life, youth, beliefs, love.  I 
want to run through flowery fields with my girlfriend.  I want to 
pick the first violet for her, to climb the trees and forests.  I 
want to lie in the grass and watch the sky for hours.  I want to 
dream”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another student, Melisa Dzanovica, in grade 7 and also from 
Tuzla, wrote “My friend, do not look at the sky, do not count 
the stars, do not look at the yellow moon because in a split 
second it can become bloody.  It takes only one wrong step.  So 
lower your head, my friend.  Your enemy is in the earth.  It has 
surrounded you with a thick wire.  Remember there is something 
worse than a war.  Survive, my friend, the peace”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of challenges we face in connection with this 
treaty.  One is to ensure that ratification by the signatories 
proceeds quickly so that this treaty can become part of 
international law that stems the manufacture, possession, use and 
export of land mines.  As parliamentarians we must work with our 
counterparts in other countries to ensure that this happens 
quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another challenge is to bring those who will not be signing the 
treaty, in particular our friends to the south, on as 
signatories.  This would be a major step forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is indeed unfortunate that the United States has decided not 
to become a signatory to the treaty at this time.  As we know, it 
has cited its defensive situation in South Korea as its rationale 
for not signing, even though at least one of its own generals, 
General Norman Schwarzkopf, has said that the United States does 
not need land mines to defend itself or its allies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To give credit where credit is due, however, the U.S. has 
destroyed 1.5 million land mines and has promised to destroy 
another 1.5 million in the short term.  It has also vowed to 
increase its already sizeable budget for de-mining operations by 
25% next year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This brings me to perhaps the most important challenge that we 
now face as a global community; that is to move beyond the treaty 
signing and ratification to the next phase which should be a 
concerted international effort to get these mines out of the 
ground.  This next phase will make the Ottawa process seem easy 
by comparison.  It will require political will, significant 
resources as well as up to date technology to ensure that more 
lives are not lost and more injuries sustained in the de-mining 
effort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Canada has led the Ottawa process and the anti-personnel land 
mines treaty, so should we lead the process of ridding the world 
of these horrible weapons.  We have some of the best trained 
personnel in land mine removal among the members of our armed 
forces and we have some of the most up to date technology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the first statement I made in this House I drew attention to 
two companies in my riding that I am proud to say are working on 
state of the art land mine removal technologies, Computing 
Devices of Canada as well as Thomson-CSF. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of Computing Devices of Canada, they are working on 
a system which combines a variety of land mine detection 
technologies in one package.  Their particular technology will 
have a system to detect even small amounts of metal.  With ground 
penetrating radar their system will detect the presence of 
foreign objects in the soil.  With an infrared camera it will 
detect heat flow disturbances in the soil associated with buried 
land mines.  Yet another sensor is capable of detecting nitrogen, 
a key component of explosives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Thomson-CSF technology involves a very sophisticated robotic 
system with the capability of digging up, removing and disposing 
of land mines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mention this to indicate that the task of ridding the world of 
over 100 million land mines is a tremendously difficult but not 
an impossible task.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Great strides are being made with technology which will 
significantly reduce injuries and deaths related to de-mining 
activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To conclude, I want to say that all Canadians should be proud of 
this tremendous diplomatic achievement by the minister and the 
many others who are responsible for having this treaty moved 
forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have come a long way in the space of one year toward solving 
a problem that afflicts a large portion of humanity.  We must 
remember that the really tough job lies ahead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am confident that with the political determination, the 
financial resources and the latest technologies Canada can once 
again take the lead in one of the most important humanitarian 
issues of our time. 
<P><A NAME="LINK269"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Paddy Torsney (Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I too 
am pleased and honoured to be able to rise today in support of 
Bill C-22.  I am particularly pleased but not at all surprised 
that this bill has received support from all parties in this 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not agree often, but on this issue we do because we stand 
first as Canadians and stand for peace in the world.  I was 
honoured along with my colleagues from Brossard—LaPrairie and 
from Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca to participate with the minister at 
the Oslo conference in Norway this September as the treaty was 
being negotiated and at the forum for the non-governmental 
organizations with the people who have been driving this issue 
for years and years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian delegation performed admirably.  Their action, 
their commitment, their perseverance in Oslo was second to none 
and as a result, countries from around the world look to Canada 
for leadership on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, with the passing of this bill, we will be in a position 
to be the first country to ratify the treaty to ban land mines. 
This, coupled with our recent destruction of our last operational 
land mine, signifies the level of our commitment to ensuring that 
land mines are destroyed and lives will be saved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During this debate we heard the member for Nepean—Carleton talk 
a great deal about the impact of active land mines and what he 
has witnessed and the important role Canada has played in 
bringing this issue to its present place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all have a vested interest in this House and across the 
nation in ensuring that the world is de-mined.  I thought I would 
focus my comments, therefore, on why Canadians are working so 
hard and at such a speed to impose this world-wide ban.  What are 
the next steps? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a bill about peace and international security.  It is a 
bill about taking steps to protect people's land, allowing people 
to provide safely for their families.  For too long people in a 
number of countries have starved while their rice paddies and 
fields lay empty for fear of the consequences of entering those 
areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most important, this bill is about people.  It is about saving 
lives.  It is about preventing senseless deaths and it is about 
restoring hope to communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is frightening to think that even with the tremendous 
co-operation in this House, in the amount of time that we have 
taken to debate this bill, hundreds of people, civilians, women, 
children and farmers will be maimed or killed by anti-personnel 
land mines, one person every 20 seconds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During this presentation and that of my last colleague, 30 
people were hurt by land mines.  Some will die immediately. 
Others will take weeks to die.  Physically, we have already heard 
it is a tremendous injury on the individuals and medical care is 
not always accessible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard stories in Oslo of having to take six days to reach 
emergency help and even then sometimes it not being adequate, of 
getting help for their immediate injuries and then suffering 
gangrene later, of being fitted with 30-odd prostheses through 
their lives if it is a child who is injured, the cost of that 
alone, the inability for people after being injured to provide 
for their families because in a lot of countries jobs are very 
scarce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They can no longer manoeuvre in the rice paddies, go out and 
work on the farms.  The effect for young women on their 
marriageability is rather drastic.  If they should be so 
fortunate to get married, often there are later complications in 
childbirth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many obstacles along that road.  Of course, as the 
member for Nepean—Carleton has mentioned already, emotionally it 
has a devastating impact on children and adults who are injured. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The social reintegration of the individuals is absolutely 
important.  These are innocent victims.  They are women working 
in their fields supporting their families, children playing 
freely or gathering firewood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On December 4 when delegates return to their respective 
countries and heads of state leave with their official copy of 
the treaty, our work will just be beginning.

<A HREF="#LINKT91"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Colleagues, we must really focus on our work at that point and 
we must work in earnest.  The signing of this treaty is only the 
first step.  We must sustain political and public attention on 
the issue.  We must continue to encourage non-signatory countries 
to sign, otherwise there will still be countries that can buy 
land mines, transfer land mines, stockpile land mines and they 
will wreak havoc on our world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the momentum. There is a lot we can do with this energy. 
We must encourage all countries to move forward.  We must 
universalize the treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This treaty is a fantastic example of diplomacy, of what can be 
achieved when governments listen to the people and then act, and 
of what can be attained when individuals and groups work together 
relentlessly and of what our country, Canada, as a middle power, 
as a peaceful nation, is capable of advancing in this century and 
in the next. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to add my congratulations to those of all members 
of the House of Commons to the individuals who have been involved 
in this historic treaty, especially to the member for Brant for 
her initiative and for helping to focus me several years ago on 
this issue, and to the Minister of Foreign Affairs for his 
insight, perseverance, commitment and energy.  He took a risk 
last year and has followed through and worked doggedly on this. I 
congratulate the Prime Minister for using his political pressure 
to bring people into the fold.  It was critical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On December 2, 3 and 4, the world will be watching as we take 
this important humanitarian step and lead the world into a new 
phase of disarmament. There are more issues that we can tackle in 
this progressive new way to deal with things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On December 4, evil will be defeated, good will triumph and 
people around the world can be joyous that we will finally be on 
the progressive side of dealing with this deadly, indiscriminate 
weapon.  They will know that finally one day we will see that 
end, we will see when mines are removed from our land.  My 
colleague has identified opportunities for Canadians to 
participate in that process.  We can know that without mines 
being used in such a terrible fashion that our peacekeepers, who 
are trying to help in various nations around the world, will have 
a better chance and will be a little safer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has been a terrific debate and I am proud to have been a 
part of it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK270"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
shall be sharing my time with the hon. member for Souris—Moose 
Mountain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The good people of Surrey Central are very happy to have me 
speak on their behalf in support of this legislation to implement 
the convention on the use, stockpiling, production and transfer 
of anti-personnel mines and their destruction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My constituents and I would like to salute and pay special 
tribute to my Reform Party colleague, the hon. member for 
Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, who not only attended the convention at 
Oslo, but who has many years experience working as a medical 
doctor in the mine infested area of Mozambique.  In fact, in 1995 
and 1996 he was the Reform member of Parliament who introduced a 
private members' bill calling for an international ban on 
anti-personnel mines, but the government refused to make the bill 
votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that bill had been declared votable, the treaty could have 
been signed much earlier, perhaps over two years earlier, and we 
could have saved many lives around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On this rare occasion the Liberal Minister of Foreign Affairs 
said he would support the private members' motion.  A Liberal 
minister actually stating his support of an opposition member's 
private members' bill was important because it boosted the spirit 
of the activists and non-government organizations who were 
already concerned and fighting to have these destructive weapons 
eliminated.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new Liberal Minister of Foreign Affairs also supported the 
anti-personnel land mines initiative.  Canada began pursuing the 
matter with other countries in the world, hoping to get a 
consensus on an international ban. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In October 1996 at the International Strategy Conference, Canada 
challenged the international community to sign a treaty to ban 
the production, use, stockpile and export of land mines, and so 
began the Ottawa process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The international non-government organization community has 
always argued that a ban on land mines is necessary because the 
mines actually violate international human rights and 
international law by killing or maiming over 20,000 civilians per 
year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A draft treaty was produced in Oslo, Norway, in September 1997. 
Included in this treaty was the banning of the use, production, 
stockpiling and trade of anti-personnel mines, but it also 
included assistance for de-mining and for the victims.  So far 
over 120 countries have indicated that they will sign the Oslo 
treaty.  Other nations are seriously considering signing the Oslo 
treaty.  Next month there will be a formal signing ceremony in 
Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The treaty is supported by the Canadian Armed Forces. In fact 
there is ample military evidence to support the ban of 
anti-personnel mines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Oslo treaty is intended to be a collective international 
disarmament treaty.  The bill we are debating today is the 
product of the Oslo draft treaty.  Bill C-22 has many significant 
humanitarian elements that will not only ban countries from 
producing land mines but will ban countries from using and 
trading them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's exemptions to this treaty will allow us to import, 
export and possess land mines only for military training, mine 
clearing and destruction.  Peace officers and RCMP officers will 
also have the authority to possess and transport land mines in 
the course of their duties to diffuse them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the event a country falls under the suspicion of violating 
the treaty, fact finders will be sent by the international 
community and will have powers to search and seize with or 
without a warrant.  Private homes can be inspected with a 
warrant.  Warrants are not required to search military bases 
and/or warehousing facilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill has 14 sections.  I would briefly like to describe a 
few of the sections which are important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are prohibitions as we know.  Under the bill it is illegal 
to place a mine under, on or near the ground or any surface area. 
It is also illegal to develop, to produce or to stockpile mines 
directly or indirectly except for training purposes, to 
dismantle, or for display in museums.  It is also illegal to 
import or export anti-personnel mines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a destruction of mines section.  Individuals who are in 
possession of anti-personnel mines must deliver them to specific 
locations for immediate destruction with the exception of the 
military, RCMP or those authorized by the minister to render the 
mines useless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are inspection rules.  In the event that a country is 
accused of violating this treaty, the foreign minister of that 
country must provide to members of the United Nations fact 
finding team a certificate that will allow members of the mission 
to inspect areas where there is suspicion of mines, that is 
military bases or industrial warehouses.  This power is only 
extended to commercial dwellings.  They cannot enter into private 
dwellings unless the owner allows them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally there is an enforcement section.  This allows the 
opportunity for enforcement officers to determine fines and 
convictions.  Summary convictions range from a fine of $5,000, 
jail time of up to 18 months, or both.  Convictions on indictment 
range from a fine of $500,000 or imprisonment for a term no 
longer than five years, or both. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The United States and China have refused to be signatories to 
this treaty. 
However they have both implemented many significant aspects of 
the treaty such as the destruction of their stockpiles of mines. 
Also they have not exported mines for some years.  We hope that 
in times to come China and the United States will sign the 
treaty.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The U.S.A. has done more than any other country in terms of 
committing more money to de-mining.  It has made sure that the 
anti-tank weapons are not anti-personnel any more.  It has 
destroyed a record number of mines already.  The U.S. was the 
first nation to ask the United Nations to call for a ban on 
anti-personnel mines.  The U.S. expects to lead in the role of 
peacekeeper in many parts of the world and expects to be 
accommodated, but in Oslo the nations did not agree.  We know 
that last week the U.S. lost a plane and its crew off the coast 
of Africa while en route to de-mining activities in Africa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Countries in war zones such as Bosnia, Turkey, middle eastern 
countries, India and Pakistan have not signed on either.  Even 
though these nations have not become signatories, the fact that a 
treaty with teeth has been produced is more successful than a 
treaty that is agreed to by everyone but has enough loopholes to 
make it worthless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the bill in its current form one of the issues 
that causes concern is the lack of specifics concerning who will 
be assigned by the minister to be the watch dog over the 
destruction of any mines and the enforcement of the law within 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another issue is the request for assistance.  A commitment for 
assistance with no fixed moneys is stated in the treaty.  This is 
assistance that can be given where appropriate and affordable. 
The government should ensure that whatever aid is given through 
assistance is done in the most cost effective fashion.  This is a 
serious issue.  It is important for the bill to be passed by 
parliament as soon as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us imagine the civilian human aspect for a moment.  History 
shows that mines do not stop armies but stop people's lives 
completely.  In certain villages mines are all around in the 
fields, meadows and forests.  The schools are covered with 
posters asking kids to think mines.  The vocabulary of those 
school children includes war, mines, danger, fear, kill, blood 
and similar words. They ask children not to touch the mines 
because they are toys of war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are being told not to look at the beautiful sky or the 
yellow moon or count stars because in a split second it can 
become bloody.  It takes only one wrong step, so they should 
lower their heads because their enemy is in the earth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is something worse than a war. They have to survive the 
peace.  Families are familiar with crisis and lack of money. Even 
the children have to work to support the families in those 
countries.  The forgotten mines take away their young dreams in a 
split second.  The war is still in their hearts, souls and 
memory.  There are people out there with one leg of their 
trousers hanging empty.  There is no more hissing sound of 
shells or sirens but a sudden sound of detonation.  Nobody knows 
how to handle them.  To conclude— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I regret to inform the hon. member he 
has gone well beyond his time.  I know he is splitting time with 
the hon. member for Souris—Moose Mountain.  I think he would

was an honour to have the opportunity to speak in support of it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, on an evening like this one it is difficult for someone 
to stand and try to say something that has not already been said. 
I am pleased to support the bill.  I am also pleased to know that 
the support in my constituency, which is a large one, would be 
unanimous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we close the House tonight and go home we do not expect to 
hear the blast of a gun.  We do not expect to hear an explosion 
of a land mine.  We live in relative peace and quiet.  However, 
as we pass the bill, and it will be unanimous, there are people 
in Canada tonight who are not as easy as we are about weapons 
that are being concealed within our country.  People know about 
them but apparently there is no legal way or legal effort to stop 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A mine is one of the easiest things to conceal and bring into 
the country.  Nothing could be easier to hide and bring into the 
country than a small plastic mine.  We know from fact that many 
illegal guns are being smuggled into Canada every day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was on the plane with a chap from the city of Cornwall who 
mentioned the illegal smuggling that takes place there.  He 
talked about it being the smuggling capital of Canada.  I asked 
if there were any chance that mines were being smuggled into 
Canada?  He answered:  “Why not?  They are bringing guns in. Why 
wouldn't they be bring mines in?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the bill passes I would like the House of Commons to take a 
moment to think about the build-up of weapons, the arsenal being 
built up in Canada.  Having spoken to police officers in 
Saskatchewan and the man I met on the plane from Cornwall, maybe 
we have a land mine that is ready to explode. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased by the great work that has been done in the House 
by the minister and my colleagues.  I am pleased to support the 
motion.  I hope all Canadians will look around them to ensure 
these weapons of destruction and those who possess them will be 
dealt with expediently and that we in Canada do not relive 
anything that has been experienced by many parts of the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of my constituents I am pleased to say that I most 
assuredly will support the bill. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>]

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased 
to address Bill C-22. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, the Bloc Quebecois fully supports Bill C-22. On my own 
behalf and on behalf of my fellow Bloc members, I want to congratulate 
all the NGOs involved in this issue and the Minister of Foreign Affairs 
for the successful conclusion of the Ottawa treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone is aware of the ravages caused by anti-personnel mines. 
The Bloc Quebecois, which is always at the forefront when it comes to 
world issues, warned the Liberal government a number of times in recent 
years regarding the atrocities caused by anti-personnel mines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As early as December 1995, the hon. member for Laval East rose 
in this House to urge Canada to eliminate these weapons of 
suffering, as she called them. In May 1996, the hon. member 
for Repentigny strongly condemned the agreement reached at the 
international conference on anti-personnel mines, then held in 
Geneva, where the Canadian government signed that treaty. It will 
be recalled that the agreement did not fully prohibit the use of 
mines. On the contrary, it stated that future mines had to be 
detectible or self-destructible. The hon. member for Repentigny 
called the agreement “absurd” and he was absolutely right.

<A HREF="#LINKT95"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>But it is never too late to do the right thing. Everybody must be 
delighted with this convention banning anti-personnel mines. And the 
figures speak for themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At $3 a piece, land mines are a cheap way of terrorizing one's 
enemies. That is why, among other reasons, there are about 110 million 
land mines scattered over more than 70 countries in the world. Five 
million more are sold each year. Land mines create fear in countries 
such as Angola, Cambodia, Mozambique, Somalia, Vietnam and many more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In these developing countries where mines are often forgotten, they 
prevent people from functioning normally. Because of mines, large tracts 
of land become unusable and unworkable. Food supply and development 
assistance are often a perilous enterprise for NGOs working in these 
generally poor countries, which has the direct effect of making entire 
communities even poorer. And this poverty becomes even more appalling 
considering the inability of these countries to pay for wheelchairs or 
even prostheses for the victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And what about children? The most precious gift that life has given 
me is my two very healthy children. It is unthinkable but nonetheless 
true that one quarter of the people treated for land mine injuries in 
Red Cross centres in Afghanistan and Cambodia are children. 
What is more normal for a child than to go to school? In Mozambique, 
every day, at least one child is injured or killed by a land mine on his 
way to school. This slaughter has to stop and fortunately we are on the 
right track. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since I became critic for international cooperation, I have been 
better able to see and appreciate the remarkable work done by 
non-governmental organizations. It is crucial to give credit to 
the work done in this area by Jody Williams, the ICBL 
coordinator. Originally made up of a handful of well-intentioned 
activists and led by a very determined woman, it has become a 
coalition of a thousand members. The work done by Mrs. Williams 
and her associates was even recognized by the Nobel Prize 
Committee, who presented her with the Nobel Peace Prize. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The campaign against land mines was launched at the end of 1991. 
It brought together 11 organizations representing more than a 1,000 NGOs 
from over 60 countries. These organizations shared a common purpose: to 
ban anti-personnel mines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Considered a utopian goal at first, the idea of a ban on 
anti-personnel mines gained ground. With the support of hundreds 
of NGOs, the ICBL was able to change the world agenda and to 
bring many governments on side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following all these successful endeavours, the United Nations 
General Assembly passed in 1996 a resolution asking its members to 
actively pursue a ban on anti-personnel mines as soon as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In October 1996, Canada took it upon itself to call all the 
countries in favour of the ban to a strategic conference, under the 
theme “Towards a Global Ban on Anti-Personnel Mines”, in which 350 
delegates from 75 countries took part. 
As of January 1997, 50 countries had banned the use of 
anti-personnel land mines; 15 countries had destroyed or started 
to destroy their stockpiles; 30 countries had banned mines or at 
least suspended their use; and 20 countries had announced they 
had stopped producing them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the conclusion of what came to be known as the Ottawa 
process, Canada's Minister of Foreign Affairs concluded the 
conference with an invitation to governments to come to Ottawa in 
December 1997 to sign a treaty to ban anti-personnel mines.  That 
is where we are now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Needless to say, Canada has played a significant role in 
bringing about the treaty banning the use of land mines. 
As we have seen, the aim of the Ottawa process is to have an 
international treaty banning the use, production, transfer and 
stockpiling of anti-personnel mines negotiated and signed by 
December 1997 at the latest.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without the initiative of the ICLM and Canada, this convention 
might have been delayed by a few more years, thereby taking a 
further and unacceptable toll in terms of human suffering and 
lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has been an international leader in this area.  But it 
must be watchful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, while the Ottawa process phase 1 is concluding, we must 
now think of the Ottawa process phase 2.  The convention's signing 
in December does not mark the end of the process, quite the 
contrary. 
“Ottawa Round 2” will need to look at the on-site implementation of 
the convention.  Canada will need to ensure that the convention 
becomes implemented universally as soon as possible, and that new 
massive mine removal and victim assistance programs are adopted. 
With “Ottawa Round 1” we were involved in theory, but “Round 
2” 
will be putting the theory into practice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most important work for Canada and the international 
community will start on December 5, as soon as the convention has 
been signed on December 2 through 4.  Then the serious nature of 
the convention will become evident. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a shadow over the event, however.  Certain countries, 
such as China, Russia and the USA, do not intend to sign the 
Convention.  It is not my intention here to pass judgment on these 
non-signatories. 
However, reports like the one by Human Rights Watch entitled “In 
its own Words”, based on archival documents from the Pentagon, and 
the one by Demilitarization for Democracy entitled “Exploding the 
Landmines Myth in Korea” argue convincingly against the marginal 
and often unproductive usefulness of land mines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These reports even indicate that American land mines were one 
of the main causes of American losses in the Vietnam war.  Such 
arguments, however, failed to convince the President of the United 
States to change his mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems fairly clear to me that, under pressure from the 
military lobby, the president decided not to sign the treaty. 
Furthermore, he said he would not sign out of a concern for 
protecting American troops stationed in the Korean peninsula.  Like 
everyone else, I watched the televised reports of the armed 
conflict with Iraq in 1991. 
In view of the high tech arsenal the United States have at their 
disposal, how can the U.S. president claim that they need weapons as 
primitive as land mines to defend American troops? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the countries that have not signed the convention simply 
lack the political will to do so. This is very regrettable. But I think 
that international popular pressure will eventually bring these 
countries around. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To conclude, I would like to remind the House that we may have 
won a battle, but the war is far from over.  We must remain 
vigilant et join forces to make this world a better place, free 
from the scourge of anti-personnel mines.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jacques Saada (Brossard—La Prairie, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, with 
your permission, I will share my time with the hon. parliamentary 
secretary to the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every 22 minutes a person is killed or injured by a mine that goes 
off. In very concrete terms, this means that since this morning—I 
took my seat in this House at 11 a.m. and it is now approximately 7.10 
p.m.—while I was taking part in this debate in this House some 25 
people, mostly civilians and children, were killed or injured by mines. 
Some mines are even specifically designed to attract children. Take 
butterfly mines for instance.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of my colleagues mentioned the social and environmental costs 
of these mines. It is important to note that, in the final analysis, 
there is no proof that the use of mines has ever made a difference in 
any conflict. No conflict has ever been won through the use of mines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to read from a paper written by former US Foreign 
Secretary Cyrus Vance. He wrote this: 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“With international attention focused on negotiations to 
destroy nuclear weapons and prevent a new nuclear arms race on 
the Korean peninsula and in south Asia, some may think that land 
mines, those tiny weapons that can fit in the palm of the hand, 
are hardly a threat to world peace.  In fact, while reducing the 
threat of nuclear war must remain the first priority of 
international arms control efforts, it is small weapons that are 
killing and wounding far more people every day. The U.S. 
Department of State has noted that land mines may be the most 
toxic and widespread pollution facing mankind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“We are convinced that nothing less than a total ban on the 
production, possession, transfer and use of anti-personnel land 
mines will move us closer to the goal of completely eliminating 
this scourge. We believe the United States should take the lead 
to achieve this goal”. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The United States did not take the lead, but Canada did and we must 
be very proud of that. I would like to take a few moments to mention in 
particular the efforts made by the Prime Minister, by the former 
Minister of Foreign Affairs, André Ouellet, by the current Minister of 
the Environment, and by the current Minister of Foreign Affairs who, as 
we all know, strove to pursue the great Canadian tradition of 
maintaining and promoting peace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to tell you briefly about my experience in Oslo. I was 
there when the treaty was negotiated. I was accompanied by the hon. 
member for Burlington and the hon. member for Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca. 
The Canadian negotiators enjoyed a high level of credibility over there. 
These senior public servants from Foreign Affairs and National Defence 
were a credit to Canada. All too often public servants are criticized. 
But everyone should know how well they represented our country in Oslo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the treaty was being negotiated, NGOs held a conference. I 
visited the exhibition set up by these NGOs, across from where the 
negotiations were taking place. I was accompanied by a public servant. 
He introduced me to someone from the Red Cross as a Canadian 
parliamentarian. I do not know where she came from, but a young 
Cambodian woman appeared in a wheelchair. She had lost her legs when she 
stepped on a mine. She looked at me and said: “Well done, 
Canada”. 
That is an experience I am not about to forget.  It is an 
experience that makes one extraordinarily proud of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On September 9, the Minister of Foreign Affairs spoke before 
the conference of NGOs.  I can tell you that the emotion in that 
room when he finished speaking was absolutely remarkable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I would like to say to all Canadians is this:  Be truly 
proud of your political leaders.  Be proud of this House, which is 
going to unanimously support one of the greatest humanitarian 
causes in recent decades. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As has been strongly emphasized, the Ottawa process is a large 
alliance of civilian groups, NGOs, Jody Williams, whom I 
congratulate, of course, and the organization she represents, as 
well as the Red Cross.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to wrap up, if I may—it will take just a few 
seconds—by launching an important appeal to Canadian youth. 
When I took up politics, I was criticized for being idealistic.  I 
would like the young people of Canada to know that, scarcely one 
year ago, everyone was sceptical about the Canadian initiative.  In 
a few days, over 100 countries will be here in Ottawa, either to 
sign or to indicate their moral support for this treaty to prohibit 
anti-personnel mines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I want to tell young people is that there is room for 
idealism in politics.  Today is proof of that. 
And yes, as members of parliament, we can make a difference, but 
only if we understand that a society is made up of elected 
officials, of NGOs, of an entire population deciding to join 
forces.  That is the embodiment of what we are doing this evening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that much remains to be done to bring peace to the 
world, but I am immensely proud today to be taking a large step in 
the right direction, in the company of all my colleagues and, in 
fact, of the entire country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime 
Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, first I thank my colleague from 
Brossard—LaPrairie for sharing the time with me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I rise in the House in support of Bill C-22, an act to implement 
the convention on the prohibition of the use, stockpiling, 
production and transfer of anti-personnel mines and on their 
destruction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Winnipeg North—St. Paul is assured this House 
will rise to the challenge.  Indeed this bill also known as the 
anti-personnel mines convention implementation act is a defining 
moment for the Canadian Parliament and therefore for the Canadian 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill when enacted will implement Canada's obligations under 
the convention.  It will put in place not only domestic laws 
necessary to fulfil our convention obligations but also charter 
of rights safeguards. It will provide Canadian courts with 
greater ease of interpretation to facilitate prosecution of any 
alleged violation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>May I at this juncture salute the government for this historic 
initiative and in particular, the hon. Minister of Foreign 
Affairs for his perseverance and persuasive prowess. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister of course has the full support of the government 
caucus.  In fact, the Prime Minister himself has pursued the 
issue with great will and determination as well. May I remind the 
House that the Prime Minister brought the subject matter to the 
attention of leaders of eastern and western Europe in his recent 
trip there a couple of weeks ago. Just a few days ago on the 
occasion of the APEC forum in Vancouver, he again brought the 
issue to the ears of President Clinton of the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government's commitment is resolute.  Its determination to 
succeed is unwavering and the government sees full success on the 
horizon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Already we see China which has agreed to extend a moratorium on 
exports and will attend in December as an observer, marking 
China's first ever attendance at a land mines conference. We see 
the United States which has extended its moratorium, actively 
seeking ways to replace the mines it now uses and has announced 
new action on demining and victim assistance. We see Russia which 
has committed to signing at the earliest possible date.  These 
are very laudable developments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In two short weeks, Canada by hosting the Treaty Signing 
Conference and Mine Action Forum, dubbed the Ottawa Process 1, 
will show to the world Canada's diligent stance on seeing the 
insanity of anti-personnel land mines is ended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Canadians we have reason to be proud that our country has 
taken a leadership role in an issue that has climaxed to 
international heights because it is an issue that touches the 
soul of humanity.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud to inform the House that in my province of Manitoba, 
NGOs such as the Council for Canadians with Disabilities, the 
Centre for Disability Studies and Disabled People's International 
have assisted other disabled people's organizations in countries 
around the world in acquiring the advocacy skills needed to press 
governments and communities for support of the issue. The efforts 
of a global movement have been made possible as NGOs, experts and 
officials come together to address the vast dimensions of the 
problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Truly we cannot forget the real tragedy of land mine victims, 
the incomprehensible loss of innocent children and youth, the 
victims for whom we are to speak. It is the young people of today 
who will continue the anti-land mine legacy of our present 
generation if they are to see a future without deadly armaments 
of war that inflict harm and kill more civilians than military 
targets, that killed more than lives claimed by nuclear and 
chemical weapons combined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Addressing the Canadian Conference on Humanitarian Demining and 
Landmine Victim Assistance held in Winnipeg on January 31 this 
year, the Minister of Foreign Affairs said: “We are making a 
difference.  We must continue to work together, taking full 
advantage of the momentum we have generated in Canada to help the 
world rid itself of these intolerable weapons”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in Parliament and through us, our constituents can be part of 
that difference. As the Prime Minister said recently: “We have 
worked with others of like-minded beliefs and showed doubters 
that Canada can make a real difference as a force for good in the 
world—.  The job has been well started, but it will not end until 
we persuade even more countries to sign on.  And we will keep 
working until the last moment and then beyond”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Beyond the Ottawa Process 1 so we can gather the necessary 
minimum number of ratifications, 40, that will allow the full 
force of the convention binding in international law. Beyond, so 
that we can help ensure a future if not totally free of war, at 
least free of the unnecessary loss of civilian lives, free of 
amputated limbs, blind eyes, scarred bodies, emotional shock, and 
preventable human sufferings due to anti-personnel land mines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, this bill is a historic one and calls on all of 
us to play a historic role.  I am pleased that we in Parliament 
on behalf of all Canadians can rise to the call with resolute 
confidence.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
a privilege to speak on this very special day on a special bill 
which will produce an act to implement the convention on the 
prohibition of the use, stockpiling, production and transfer of 
anti-personnel mines and on their destruction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill relates to the implementation of Canada's obligations 
under the international treaty on the prohibition of the use, 
stockpiling, production and transfer of anti-personnel mines and 
on their destruction. This binds Canada to co-operate in a number 
of ways so as to facilitate the implementation of the treaty and 
to ensure that persons refrain from engaging in activities 
prohibited under the treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I am going to split my time with the hon. member 
for Kitchener—Waterloo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each nation under the treaty undertakes to destroy or ensure the 
destruction of all stockpiled anti-personnel mines it owns or 
possesses or that are under its jurisdiction or control as soon 
as possible but no later than four years after entry into force 
of the treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the act which is a necessary step to allow us to lead 
the world in signing a treaty which will ban land mines 
worldwide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again in the tradition of Mike Pearson in this House, 
Canada is leading the world in true peacekeeping.  It has been a 
long road to get to this point and there is still a way to go. 
But today I must confess I am much more optimistic than I was 
only a couple of years ago. I am not a pessimistic person by 
nature. 
I know there is a more or less effective world ban on chemical 
and biological weapons but my hopes for a land mines ban were not 
high only a couple of years ago.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As recently as April 1996 as a part of Canada's delegation to 
the Inter-Parliamentary Union which was led by Senator Peter 
Bosa, we were unable to have this issue accepted as the principal 
agenda item, although we were able to speak to it and move it up 
for future agendas of IPU meetings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that same year I recall a meeting on Parliament Hill 
sponsored by Mines Action Canada, the Canadian Red Cross and 
Bruce Coburn, under the auspices of the member for Brant, now 
Minister of Indian and Northern Affairs.  Despite Bruce Coburn's 
presence, attendance was sparse.  In my pessimism I 
underestimated the influence of the grassroots here in Canada and 
around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ever since I was elected, I have received a steady flow of calls 
and letters about land mines. Whenever I visit schools, high 
schools or elementary, I get questions about land mines. Various 
groups in Peterborough have taken a continuing interest in this 
matter. Only yesterday in church, people were discussing the 
massive task of demining which is still ahead of us.  For 
example, one person suggested planting trees as areas are cleared 
of mines.  The grassroots interest has been there and is still 
there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This groundswell of interest was Peterborough's share of what 
our Minister of Foreign Affairs described in his speech in the 
conference in Oslo. He described the worldwide interest among 
ordinary people as “a coalition of civil society and committed 
governments coalescing around the movement to ban anti-personnel 
land mines, a coalition that has had the power to change the 
dynamics and direction of the international agenda”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that same speech our Minister of Foreign Affairs paid special 
attention to the role of non-governmental organizations, NGOs, in 
the process.  I have mentioned Mines Action Canada and our own 
Red Cross.  He mentioned as examples the International Campaign 
to Ban Land Mines and the international committee of the Red 
Cross.  He went on to say, and again I quote from the speech in 
Oslo: “Clearly, now no one can relegate NGOs back to a simple 
advisory or advocacy role in this process. They are now part of 
the way decisions have to be made. They have been the voice 
saying that governments belong to the people and must respond to 
the people's hopes, demands and ideals”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a change in itself, a recognition of the proper 
relationship between people and their governments. The role of 
the people and their NGOs is an ongoing one in this land mines 
ban.  It does not stop here.  Again, I quote the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs in Oslo:  “There is a question of the watch dog 
role for civil society”—that is to say the grassroots—“in 
evaluating the compliance of states to the obligations they have 
signed. Canada, the International Campaign to Ban Land Mines, and 
the international committee of the Red Cross and several of our 
core partners have consistently argued that a humanitarian treaty 
without traditional forms of arms control verification can be an 
effective response to the anti-personnel mines crisis. This 
implies that civil society”—the grassroots—“can and will play 
an effective role in deterring and detecting wilful 
non-compliance”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This change in people to government relationships goes even 
beyond this important anti-mines treaty.  In my view, it gives us 
hope for moving the nations of the world toward lasting peace.

</I></B></P><P align=left>My last quotation from the speech of our Minister of Foreign 
Affairs in Oslo is that we need to ask ourselves whether we can 
maintain and build upon the close and constructive working 
relationship that has developed between governments and civil 
society through the Ottawa process, this process of producing 
this treaty which we are proud to call the Ottawa process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He goes on and asks whether we can maintain and build upon the 
incredible sense of political momentum that this unique 
relationship helped to create, offering hope to millions that an 
integrated and effective international response to the global 
land mines crisis is years and not decades away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can we demonstrate that the Ottawa process offers an effective 
lasting model as a response to the changing nature of 
international conflict? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would say that the only answer to all of those questions is 
yes, we can and must build on this wonderful example of 
grassroots action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, like my colleagues and all members of the House, 
I congratulate and sincerely thank all those who have brought us 
to this day.  I pledge my support for this bill, for the treaty 
and for all the follow-up activity that is required.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Kitchener—Waterloo, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, every once in a while an event transpires in this House 
that galvanizes all the parties and all the members to move in 
one direction.  It is one of those days today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On this issue, we have been united.  The issue is land mines, 
banning land mines, dismantling land mines and trying to make our 
world a bit more sane.  I am very proud to be a member of 
Parliament, to be part of this Chamber at this time.  I think all 
Canadians should be proud for the role that we are playing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Forty years ago on February 28, my family and myself left 
Hungary and went to the Austrian frontier.  As we went across the 
border at night, we were conscious of the fact that we were going 
through land mines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say this because the reality of having to deal with the evil 
of land mines affects many people on this planet.  There are many 
people who are Canadians who have experience with this.  I can 
say that walking through a field which should not be an 
extraordinary exercise can be a very terrifying one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the time I was 10 years old, my brother was 12 and my sister 
was three.  My parents were in their mid-thirties.  Land mines 
were used to keep people out but so often land mines were used in 
Iron Curtain countries to keep people in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The terror of that night is something that has never left me. It 
was a year ago this past September that I had the experience of 
being an observer for the elections in Bosnia-Hercegovina.  In an 
area that had a population of four million people, they had six 
million land mines.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was in Mostar, I was on a bridge over the Neretva River 
which divides East Mostar from West Mostar.  On one side we have 
Muslims and on the other side we have Croatians.  This is a very 
beautiful river.  After seeing it, one wants to walk down to it. 
If you had your fishing rod you would want to try fishing.  It is 
a very beautiful and scenic site.  The reality was that you could 
not walk down to that river because any place you walked in 
Bosnia-Hercegovina you had to be always mindful that there were 
six million unmarked land mines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to ask what kind of experience we have in terms of an 
individual who has to live in those kinds of conditions where the 
simplest pleasure of walking in the woods can be a tragic and 
terrifying event. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I reflect back to all the graveyards that had those fresh 
flowers from people who were victims of that terrible war and to 
know there were six million land mines waiting to go off long 
after the conflict was over, perhaps blowing somebody up as they 
were trying to rebuild their war-torn home or killing a farmer 
who is working in the fields or maybe killing a child playing in 
the fields. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am incredibly proud to be in this Chamber.  It was back in 
1956-57 when Canadians under Lester B. Pearson invented 
peacekeeping in order to deal with the problem of Suez.  We 
certainly are continuing in that tradition with the initiative 
before us today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In lending support to what the previous speaker from 
Peterborough said to a grassroots movement, we are recognizing 
that the insanity of land mines and the insanity of war that 
maims hundreds of thousands, indeed millions of people, is 
something that we must stop and work against. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we reflect upon the demographics in Canada and why we are 
the way we are as a nation, peacekeepers striving to make this 
planet a better place and, in many cases, representing a beacon 
of hope in a troubled world where we can bring people together 
from all corners of the world, we have one-sixth of the people in 
Canada who were not born in Canada, but it helps us to understand 
why we as Canadians so very much want to play a role to make this 
world a better place.  It does not matter where there is a 
conflict on this planet, we have Canadians who came from that 
part of the world with relatives and friends in their homeland 
who are hurting and suffering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, I am incredibly proud as I think we all should be at what 
is taking place here today and the role that we have played in 
making the banning of land mines a reality in the not too distant 
future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can only commend all my colleagues for the kind of unity they 
have shown on this issue.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would certainly single out the Minister of Foreign Affairs and 
the Prime Minister for pushing with such great vigour in the 
political arena on the international front the whole cause of 
banning and ridding this planet of land mines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is only proper that the Nobel Prize recipient, Jody Williams, 
was someone who spearheaded the non governmental organizations in 
the battle against land mines.  I also reflect back to my home 
community where so many people have worked on this issue, 
particularly the Mennonite Central Committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we push this ahead, we know that we have Canadians with us. I 
think we can indeed be proud of the mission which we have 
undertaken and the difference we are going to make. 
<P><A NAME="LINK278"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, before I start to speak on Bill C-22 I want to thank the 
Chair, the Table Officers, the staff and the pages for staying so 
late today on this important debate.  All of us as members 
greatly appreciate your efforts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the perhaps the last speech tonight.  I want to say what 
an honour it has been to spend the day in the House listening to 
all the interventions by members from all party lines and showing 
a degree of co-operation we rarely ever see in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have by-passed the usual entrenched inefficiency of the House 
of Commons for once and managed to co-operate on an issue that 
one would find very difficult to disagree with.  Once again I 
would like to add my name to the work that has been done by so 
many members of the Canadian public, the international community, 
the non governmental organizations and members of Parliament who 
sat in this House in the years gone by, and who sit in this House 
today.  I would particularly like to thank members of the Reform 
Party for supporting this initiative as eloquently as they have 
and as all members from the House have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a shame that it took such an issue to bring us all 
together.  I hope that in the future we will able to perceive 
collectively other foreign policy initiatives which will be for 
the betterment of all people in this country and around the 
world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-22 will save lives.  As has been mentioned before, over 
30,000 people are maimed by land mines, most of whom are innocent 
men, women and children.  In my experience in dealing with land 
mine victims, you only have to look in the eyes of somebody who 
is on the operating room table, a young person who tried to seek 
out and find a better place to live.  Look into their eyes and 
watch the fear they have as they peer down to see the lower part 
of their body blown away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we amputated the legs of individuals who have stepped on land 
mines, I could not help but reflect on the tragic circumstances 
those persons now face, a life which is so different from what 
they had before.  They went in a brief second, in the click and 
the blink of an eye, from being a productive, healthy member of 
society to one that will occupy the lowest socioeconomic rung in 
countries racked by civil war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These devices do not affect rich countries like ours.  They 
affect the poorest nations of the world from Angola to Cambodia, 
from Somalia to Egypt, from Rwanda to the former Yugoslavia. 
These land mines create a terrible toll, not only in human terms 
but also in economies laid to waste.  This bill will go a long 
way to preventing that carnage from occurring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look beyond land mines.  Let us look to life beyond land 
mines and see what the future holds for us.  There is life after 
land mines.  What we can do now is reflect on the Ottawa process 
and use and redirect that unusual co-operation between members of 
the non governmental organizations and governance working 
together for a common goal. 
This cannot be left to wither away.  It must be acted upon, 
nurtured, and redirected to address other security issues facing 
us all.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As we look to the 21st century and the challenges facing us as a 
nation as well as other nations around the world, we cannot help 
but reflect on the fact that we have failed in our foreign 
policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The biggest challenge is conflict.  Land mines are an important 
part of conflict, but in the big picture they are a small part. 
We must look at conflict in a broader context and search for more 
constructive solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can reflect on the Bosnian conflict.  The signs were 
continually there.  We were continually told that the former 
Yugoslavia would tear apart and explode in a level of bloodshed 
that Europe had not seen since World War II.  We the nations of 
the world sat on our hands and wept.  We engaged at best in 
diplomatic initiatives and at worst in hand-wringing inefficiency 
when we did nothing at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The result was the deaths of thousands upon thousands of 
innocent civilians, the rapes of thousands of innocent women and 
the deaths of thousands of children.  It was potentially an 
avoidable tragedy.  Certainly many of those lives could have been 
saved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were repeatedly told for months on end that a massive 
slaughter was imminent in the great lakes region of Africa. 
Major-General Roméo Dallaire repeatedly warned right to the end 
that thousands of people would be slaughtered.  What did we do? 
Virtually nothing.  Today genocide will raise its ugly head once 
again in the great lakes region and again we are doing nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have it within our power to use the Ottawa process to address 
these significant problems.  Canada is a nation state uniquely 
poised to change foreign policy from an era of conflict 
management to an era of conflict prevention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here are some constructive solutions.  There are a number of 
nation states of medium power which are neutral, relatively 
affluent, have extraordinary diplomatic power and, above all 
else, have international respect.  Norway, New Zealand, 
Australia, Austria, South Africa and Canada are some of these 
nations.  The world is looking for a leader to bring these nation 
states together to form a nucleus upon which we can start to 
bring other countries together to change international foreign 
policy.  We have to rethink the way we deal with each other as 
nation states. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The big powers, the security council members such as the United 
States, France, Germany, England, Russia and China, cannot do 
this because they have their own political baggage and are not as 
widely respected as the middle powers.  We then can play an 
unusual role in working with the NGO community to address the 
problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, we must set up an early warning monitoring system to 
address conflict.  That early warning system could be the NGO 
community that would form part of the nucleus of the Ottawa 
process.  NGOs are often the first to witness the precursors to 
conflict, to witness the breakdown of judicial and governmental 
structures, and to witness the persecution of minorities and the 
trampling of basic human rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Their input into a central region, for example the UN crisis 
centre in New York, would be a logical place for this information 
to be gathered.  It could then be dealt with by the United 
Nations as a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are now dealing with UN reform, which involves revamping the 
security council and removing veto powers from its members. Again 
that is something with which we as a nation and the international 
community will have to deal.

<A HREF="#LINKT105"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The solutions involve the setting up of a monitoring system and 
the setting up of an area to receive information, the UN crisis 
centre.  A series of responses could be put forth, responses such 
as diplomatic initiatives, peace building initiatives, the 
introduction of positive propaganda into areas that are breaking 
apart to bring belligerents together, the introduction of more 
punitive measures such as sanctions, where appropriate, and the 
use of international financial institutions as economic tools and 
levers to try to take away the fuel of war, which is money. Money 
drives wars.  The international financial institutions give a 
great deal of money to a number of countries of the world, some 
of which are in conflict. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is exceedingly important to pursue this issue.  These are not 
just words.  If we fail to address it we will see an explosion of 
ethnic conflict. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Between 1945 and 1985 there were roughly six UN peacekeeping 
missions that cost about $2.3 billion or 23% of the UN budget. 
Since 1985 to now the UN spends 77% of its budget on peacekeeping 
initiatives.  That is more than twice as much as it spends on 
everything else added together.  It has driven the United Nations 
into bankruptcy.  This then is not a situation that can be 
sustained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why should Canadians be interested in this issue at all?  It is 
for the simple reason that what happens half a world away comes 
home to roost sooner or later.  When conflict occurs and 
countries explode into an orgy of bloodshed and economies are 
laid to waste, the responsibility for setting that up and dealing 
with that goes to the international community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We incur costs in our defence budgets, our peacekeeping budgets, 
our aid budgets and economic reconstruction, and our social 
programs domestically when refugees, tragic souls, fleeing their 
homelands come to other countries looking for a haven.  They come 
to our country looking for safe haven and because we signed the 
UN charter on refugees we are obliged to take them in, which we 
do.  It costs us roughly $75,000 per refugee to integrate them 
into Canadian society.  This is a lot of money.  It contributes 
to the already weakened system we have in our social programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not blaming refugees by any stretch of the imagination but 
merely illustrating that in these days of economic hardship and 
of governments not having any money we cannot afford having 
increased costs placed upon us, not to mention the danger our 
peacekeepers and our aid workers incur when they go abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of peacekeepers have been killed or maimed by land 
mines and working abroad in danger zones.  Does it not make more 
sense for us to prevent these situations from occurring rather 
than pick up the pieces later on? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore once a war breaks out the seeds of ethnic discontent 
and future conflicts are sewn forever.  One need not look any 
further than at the situation in Bosnia to see that country will 
not remain as it is in the future.  It is artificially maintained 
right now through force.  Unless we are prepared as an 
international community to stay in Bosnia for the next 75 years, 
nothing will change.  Once we move, if we move before that, the 
country will break apart in a violent shudder.  It is important 
for us to realize that and to initiate efforts to ensure these 
situations do not occur again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only can the Ottawa process be applied to international 
military security issues.  It can also be applied to the other 
problems that affect us from environmental issues to economic 
issues.  We already apply many of the principles to our economic 
multilateral initiatives through the NAFTA, FTA, WTO and now the 
MAI.  All these things are examples of the international 
community trying to work together to resolve differences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I would like to say how proud I am to be a Reformer 
today, how proud I am to be a parliamentarian, and how proud I am 
to be a Canadian.  Canadians and Canada have set a new standard 
of co-operation in the House and internationally to pursue 
objectives to help those who are most helpless, to save lives and 
to make our world a better place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I stand before you and thank the House for its 
time.  I hope that this will not be the end of initiatives that 
will involve co-operation between members of the House to pursue 
a better Canadian society for all.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Lac-Saint-Louis, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, last September my wife and I joined with my brothers and 
my sister for a family reunion and holiday in France.  We 
gathered at a farm in Normandy from which we visited the sites 
and beaches that World War II has made part of world history 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two of my brothers served in uniform during the war but the rest 
of us were in school.  Yet the place names, the events of World 
War II which cast such a huge shadow on the world then, were a 
vivid part of our consciousness and of our lives as young people. 
Whether it is through the awesome silence of Utah Beach, Omaha 
Beach or Juno Beach where our own Canadian troops landed or 
whether it is the stunning sight of massive concrete bunkers and 
gun emplacements left by the Germans, the whole historic 
coastline tells a story of the savagery, the utter futility and 
the great sadness of war and armaments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is difficult for anyone to visit Bayeux, Caen, Ste. Mère 
L'Église or Arromanches and not be terribly moved by the huge 
human cost of warfare and armaments.  Each corner echoes the 
screams of human beings fighting in a deadly war.  Thousands upon 
thousands of lives were literally torn apart by weapons of 
destruction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether it be bullets or mortar shells, whether it be ocean 
mines or land mines, weapons of war and destruction know no mercy 
for their only raison d'être is to maim and destroy.  As we 
visited war graves to pay our respects we were terribly struck by 
the immensity of the sacrifice.  Young adults of 20 years or 25 
years of age or sometimes still in their teens had been mowed to 
death because of one man's folly and pride.  Millions of people, 
in fact tens of millions if we count the huge human losses 
suffered by the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany, were sacrificed at 
the altar of war and weapons of destruction. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can easily imagine a young Canadian—maybe he was from Quebec 
of from Manitoba, maybe he was from Vancouver or Toronto or Cape Breton 
—landing on Juno beach under an infernal shower of explosions. What 
courage one must have to advance when each step may be the last, when 
each cannonball, each bullet, each mine becomes an instrument of death 
that is always more lethal and more destructive than the previous one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Have we learned our lesson about the futility of war and weapons? 
Have we learned the lesson taught to us by the thousands of people 
around the world who have made the ultimate sacrifice, we who are so 
lucky not to have suffered the same fate? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, hundreds of thousands or even millions of innocent 
victims continue to pay the price of futile wars and weapons of 
destruction. Whether yesterday in Mozambique or in Angola, whether 
yesterday in Bosnia, whether today in Lebanon or in Algeria, just to 
name these countries, how many innocent people, how many hundreds of 
thousands of innocent people have endured and continue to endure these 
atrocious wars when all they want is to live in peace and tranquillity 
with their family and in their community.

world, that they may behave differently from their elders, 
ourselves, and learn to live in peace, in real and lasting peace 
and harmony.

Speaker, I appreciate the member's sharing his time with me.  I 
know the lateness of the hour but I am really honoured to stand 
and to speak on behalf of my constituents of 
Etobicoke—Lakeshore. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of them have been watching the debate most of the day and I 
have had several calls of support and calls of congratulations to 
the men and women on both sides of this House today who stood 
unified, who stood together to ensure and to speak to the passage 
of Bill C-22, the anti-personnel mines convention implementation 
act, an act to ban the use, stockpiling and transfer of 
anti-personnel mines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also pleased to hear not only the eloquent speeches but 
also the congratulatory notes and the recognition of the work 
that has been done by all.

</I></B></P><P align=left>On December 3 and 4 the world will be watching Canada, not only 
Canada but the 89 or more countries that will be here to sign 
this anti-personnel mines convention.  I too commend the Minister 
of Foreign Affairs, the United Nations Mine Action Centre and 
other non-governmental organizations, Jody Williams and those who 
have received the Nobel prize with her, those who have worked 
tirelessly in making the signing of the land mines convention in 
Ottawa on December 3, 1997 a reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's efforts in ridding the world of these deadly weapons is 
a testament to our humanitarianism as a country, as a nation, and 
of the strong tradition in which Canadian foreign policy is 
modelled. As a nation we are admired for our deep compassion for 
others less fortunate than ourselves and this is amplified in 
this treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was one of the group from the foreign affairs and defence 
standing committees who went to the former Yugoslavia, a country 
that laden with land mines.  I saw firsthand the devastation to 
lives that these weapons can do.  It is estimated that there are 
over 18,000 minefields in Bosnia.  It has been predicted that it 
could take over 70 years to clear the approximately three million 
land mines, land mines left from the recent conflicts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Needless to say, an estimated 25,000 civilians, many of them 
children, are killed worldwide each year by land mines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This convention is long overdue.  I am proud that Canada has 
taken the lead in the global community to rid this planet of 
these horrible weapons.  Bill C-22 is the beginning to global 
awareness of land mines.  Young and old suffer the emotional 
fallout of being injured or have suffered the loss of a loved one 
to land mines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The signing of the convention is a starting point to bringing 
greater awareness to this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Ottawa process provides an opportunity to build a greater 
awareness.  The Ottawa process is to pursue the international 
community to ban the use, stockpiling, production and transfer of 
anti-personnel mines.  We cannot forget that once this treaty is 
signed by co-operating states, Canada's work is not over. Once 
this convention is signed, Canada and the world must continue to 
work together with nations that have not yet endorsed the 
convention to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that key countries such as the United States and China 
have not endorsed the convention.  I am disappointed, as I am 
sure we all are.  Their support could go a long way toward the 
eradication of land mines from the globe.  This is why Canada 
must continue to vehemently work to put pressure on those nations 
that are not signatories to the Ottawa treaty.  It is our 
obligation as a nation to make this world a safer place where 
children will be free from the damages caused by these deadly 
weapons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage young people in Canada today to look at this 
tremendous feat with pride and as an example of the strong 
political will that exists in this House.  To all the victims of 
land mines in the world, you have voiced your opinions about land 
mines.  You who know the hurt and the pain, you who know the 
tragedy, we have heard you.  Canada has heard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I close by saying that I am very proud that we have demonstrated 
leadership on this issue.  Many thanks to our Minister of Foreign 
Affairs, our Prime Minister and our NGOs for bringing the treaty 
on anti-personnel land mines to fruition.
