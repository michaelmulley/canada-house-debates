	<B>Mr. Bob Speller (Haldimand-Norfolk, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I have the honour to present the fifth report of the 
Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food.
<P>
	This interim report on agri-food priorities is intended to 
provide assistance to the Minister of Finance as well as the 
Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food prior to the 1995 budget. 
It is based on input and views from many representatives of the 
agri-food sector who took the time to come to Ottawa to appear 
before the committee between August and December of this 
year.
<P>
	The witnesses represented all sectors. We heard from 
academics, agri-food organization executives and specialists at 
both producer and processor levels. Each came with an 
individual point of view but from among them emerged some 
common threads.
<P>

	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.)</B> moved for 
leave to introduce Bill C-297, an act to amend the Criminal 
Code (summary conviction penalties).
<P>
	He said: Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure to rise in the House 
today to introduce a bill to amend the Criminal Code with 
respect to summary convictions.
<P>
	Earlier this year the Minister of Justice introduced sentencing 
reforms but he did not go far enough. Many charges that should 
not be are all too frequently plea bargained down to summary 
convictions.
<P>
	This bill provides for the maximum imprisonment on 
summary conviction to be increased from six months to two 
years. For minor offences a judge could still hand down a short 
sentence but for more serious crimes he or she could give up to 
two years.
<P>
	Criminals need to be sent a message that the judge has the 
discretion to send them up the river for a two year stay at the 
Crowbar Hotel.

	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
move that the 10th report of the Standing Committee on 
Finance, presented on Thursday, December 8, be concurred in.
<P>
	I appreciate the fact that I have the opportunity this morning 
to discuss the 10th report of the Standing Committee on Finance 
and bring it before the House of Commons for discussion.
<P>
	The motion states that we should concur in the report. I want 
to put on the record this morning the fact that the Reform Party 
agrees with some parts of the report but we do not agree with all 
of it. I want to point out those areas where we do not agree and, 
as well, those areas where we do agree.
<P>
	It is very important that it go on the record at this point in our 
discussion whether or not the government concurs in the report. 
It is a majority report, and represents the Liberal members on 
the finance committee. We would like to know if their position is 
accepted or rejected by the government. If it is then the people of 
Canada, between now and February when the  1995-96 budget is 
presented, will have the opportunity of reacting and giving the 
government advice before it formalizes the next budget. I would 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8964"> 8964 </A></B>
<P>
say it is the most important budget for the government and for 
Canadians at the present time.
<P>
	I have this to say about the process in terms of the report. The 
object of the 10th annual report is to allow Canadians to have 
some input into the budget prior to its being accepted by 
Canadians. That was a good idea. But there were some 
shortcomings that should be explained and should be referenced 
so that in the next fiscal year when we go through this process 
we will improve the process and more Canadians can be 
involved.
<P>
<B>(1010) </B>
<P>
	I have observed that three types of presentations were made to 
the committee. First, presentations were made by those people 
who are very fiscally conservative and believe that the 
government's 3 per cent target is not adequate. They believe we 
should go further and balance the budget within the term of this 
Parliament. I certainly support those presentations.
<P>
	Second, there was a group of people who believe that we 
should not move on the expenditure reduction side but move on 
the tax side, that if we tax the rich, we can balance our budget. 
They believe that if we allow economic growth, eventually we 
will grow out of our fiscal problems. Past governments have 
tried this. Tories over the past 10 years have attempted to do this. 
We have only compounded the problem and made things more 
difficult.
<P>
	The third group of people who made presentations were the 
vested interest groups. They came for one purpose and one 
purpose only. They made presentations that said: Don't take my 
public funding away from me. I am a special interest group and 
you must protect my funding and I would like a little more. How 
they could ever make those presentations in light of today's 
fiscal realities, I cannot understand at all. Listening to those 
groups was very disappointing.
<P>
	Those were the three types of presentations we heard. Where 
are the shortcomings? First of all, we did not hear from a broad 
cross-section of Canadians. What we must do is change and 
update the process to a more contemporary, grassroots, I would 
say Reform process, whereby Canadians have access to tell their 
government what to do and what their priorities should be. That 
was a major shortcoming of the presentations that were made to 
us. The government did not allow for that.
<P>
	The other shortcoming was timing. In November we decided 
we would start hearings. The various groups were given maybe a 
week, at the outside 10 days' notice that they could make 
presentations. People came to the committee saying they had 
done their best in the few days. They did not know we were 
having the hearings and would have liked to have known sooner.
<P>
	There is no reason why we cannot let the Canadian people 
know in July, August or September that hearings are going to 
take place. Then they can prepare to make well thought out 
presentations. Even in light of the short period of time they were 
given some of the presentations were very well thought out.
<P>
	If those two things were corrected it would improve the 
process. Canadians could direct their government and tell it 
what their priorities are. We would have had greater input in 
terms of priorities for expenditure reduction. That is the first 
point I want to make. The process is a good start by the 
government but it has some weaknesses and can be improved.
<P>
	My second point is with regard to the recommendation of this 
report to increase taxes. As Reformers we were most 
disappointed. I know many Canadians are starting to echo the 
sentiment that they do not want an increase in taxes. ``Please do 
not increase my taxes. I cannot afford to deal with the deficit by 
paying more taxes. I have paid enough and I am at the point 
where I am going to react negatively to this whole ongoing 
process''. I do not blame them in the least.
<P>
	As members of Parliament scatter out across the nation 
following adjournment this week, we will hear from our 
constituents that they have major concerns about new taxes 
being imposed on them at this time.
<P>
<b> (1015 ) </B>
<P>
	Businesses are starting to have a growth pattern. Individuals 
are feeling more confident in their jobs. That is a good 
circumstance. If in that environment we as a government impose 
more taxes and start to squeeze them harder so that they do not 
have more flexible income for personal purposes or for 
expanding their businesses, we are doing those people and those 
businesses a major disfavour. We cannot do that.
<P>
	What about the taxes that are proposed in the 10th report by 
the majority of the committee, the Liberal members? First, they 
have said to Canadians and they said to us in committee that 
some type of a tax must be introduced. If expenditures are 
reduced and people are laid off there is a period of time in the 
first year when the expenditure reductions do not take place. 
There is a delay for one or two years before there is a significant 
expenditure reduction. Government members have said that 
some kind of interim tax must be introduced to compensate for 
that period of time.
<P>
	Everyone knows that whenever a government introduces a tax 
it never gets to the point where it is terminated. It is there 
forever after. Since the 10th report was tabled I have heard 
people say over and over again that it is just like the income tax 
brought in for the war and we still have that income tax. It has 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8965"> 8965 </A></B>
<P>
expanded and intervenes in people's lives more and more every 
day. That is what has happened.
<P>
	However the government has said it is going to put that tax in. 
It is going to argue that it needs it on an interim basis to get itself 
through the period before it really reduces the government 
expenditures. I do not think that argument is good enough.
<P>
	Alberta reduced expenditures by some 20 per cent across the 
board in government both in social program areas and 
non-social program areas. That was not the problem there; the 
event projected by this government which is being used as an 
excuse did not happen in Alberta. I do not believe it would 
happen if we had effective expenditure reduction at the federal 
level. I do not think it would happen the very same way.
<P>
	What are those taxes that were introduced by the government? 
First of all it said it wanted to collect about $1 billion by putting 
a tax of one and a half cents on each litre of gas. The government 
said: ``We can do that for all Canadians and it will not hurt 
them''. One of my colleagues said it was a kind of carbon tax. 
We cannot really say it is that because it does not focus 
completely on Alberta. It affects all people right across Canada.
<P>
	Last week I was listening to an Ottawa radio program. They 
were discussing the cost of fuel in Ottawa versus Toronto. The 
people in Ottawa were saying: ``Why do we have to pay so much 
more? We are paying too much for our fuel''. A number of 
people phoned in to say they needed to drive their cars to work. 
Some people think if there is a tax put on fuel that the extra tax 
will be coming from people who are holidaying or driving 
without a specific purpose. One person said: ``Just about all I 
use my car for is to drive from home to work. It is part of my 
costs in my job''.
<P>
	If this extra cost is added, all it does is take away the money 
Canadians need for their personal use, their food, clothing, 
shelter and health care and maybe something extra when they 
want to buy Christmas gifts and so on. That is one part of it. That 
is the individual.
<P>
<b> (1020) </B>
<P>
	What about the business community? What about the trucking 
community out there? People are on the road every day moving 
their merchandise across this nation east and west, north and 
south, trading with the United States and taking advantage of the 
free trade agreement we have set up. All of those people are 
impacted. It takes money away from the business community 
that is needed maybe to hire more people or to invest and create 
more jobs. This tax is a depressing thing. It is not positive 
toward building our economy, it depresses it.
<P>
	I am sure if a poll were taken people when talking to us would 
say very clearly that expenditures must be cut that we must 
reduce expenditures. The 3 per cent target set up by the 
government is not good enough. The $25 billion we will be left 
with in 1996-97 is still going to add $100 billion to our deficit. It 
is going to increase the debt to over $600 billion. It is going to 
increase the interest payments of government from some $40 
billion up to possibly $50 billion.
<P>
	People would say very clearly: ``The cost of government must 
be cut back, but do not increase my taxes. I am struggling to pay 
the current rate. Do not take more away from me if you expect 
me to be the engine of the economy''. I have heard politicians 
say for years that it is the small businesses and individuals that 
will make the economy move. Small businesses are the engine 
of our economy, not the big corporate ones. Here we are hitting 
them right on the chin with an extra gas tax. We are going to take 
$1 billion out of the economy with regard to this gas tax. That is 
unfair when we are trying to build the economy. We are not 
trying to depress the economy, but we are doing it by this tax.
<P>
	I want to ask a question of my colleagues on the finance 
committee. There were nine Liberal members, three Bloc 
members and three Reform members on the committee. I will 
ask the question as well to this assembly: Who asked for the tax? 
I never heard anybody make the presentation that gasoline 
should be taxed, that a one and a half cent tax should be put on 
every litre of gasoline.
<P>
	It was slipped into the committee report that there would not 
be a tax on diesel fuel. The government said that maybe the 
farmers in Ontario, Alberta or B.C. should not be taxed on their 
diesel fuel which was a rather compassionate consideration. 
Maybe some of the truckers who use diesel fuel will consider it 
to be a bit compassionate.
<P>
	Every Canadian is being hit with this tax. I believe the Liberal 
members on the committee were encouraged by the finance 
department to float that as a balloon to see what would happen, 
see the reaction. If over the Christmas season while Canadians 
are trying to enjoy the holiday with their families, they are not 
yelling at Ottawa and creating a ruckus in the media, then it will 
be implemented.
<P>
	It is a terrible time to fly a balloon because we are all trying to 
relax and back off from some of our responsibilities. Who wants 
to sit down and write a letter to their member of Parliament 
about a gas tax? However they might be mad enough to do just 
that and I hope they do.
<P>
	My colleagues say they are already receiving letters of 
concern on this issue. The government should listen before it 
decides to implement a 1.5 cent a litre gas tax across the board 
that will affect every Canadian whether they are working or 
whether they are the poor. Whether they are mothers with 
dependent children who need to drive to day care, whether they 
are small business persons, whether they are trying to expand 
their businesses or trying to invest, every one of them is going to 
be hit by this 1.5 cent per litre gas tax.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8966"> 8966 </A></B>
<P>
<b> (1025 ) </B>
<P>
	We in this House had better stop that today. I would appreciate 
it if government members would get up today and say: ``We 
made a mistake. We are sorry. We think we should withdraw 
that. We were flying a balloon''. That would be a tremendous 
Christmas present for Canadians. That would be true Liberal 
compassion right on top.
<P>
	That is only one tax the government intends to impose on 
Canadians. The next one is a corporate tax. To satisfy the left 
wing socialist element of the Liberal Party it was to introduce 
some kind of corporate tax. It is trying to wriggle it around so 
that it is put on the capital. Rather than being up front and saying 
it is the kind of tax the government is going to impose on 
Canada's corporate sector, it is a way to weasel some money out 
of those in the corporate sector. They will not know what hit 
them until the tax bill is laid on the table before the executive 
director of this country.
<P>
	I know the corporate sector does not have much of a defence. 
There is no political group out there to represent it. Granted the 
committee heard from what I call the left wing presentations 
that we should tax the rich, we should tax the corporations, that 
the corporations are paying fewer taxes now than they did back 
in 1986. There were graphs and presentations to show that the 
corporate sector was slipping out from under the rug again.
<P>
	I am not here to defend the corporate sector. However we have 
to realize the situation of the corporate sector in Canada after 
1984. The real recession and downturn in the economy hit 
Alberta in 1982, but in 1984 real estate values for example 
dropped 25 to 30 per cent in a period of about 18 months. It was 
devastating for those people.
<P>
	That is one reason, and there are others, the corporate sector is 
paying less. It is not because it is dodging or hiding from the tax. 
We should realize that. A number of groups went after the banks 
which is another case in itself. I want to make two more points in 
the two minutes I have remaining.
<P>
	A tax on lotteries is the third tax being proposed by the Liberal 
majority on the finance committee. Who wants to defend 
lotteries? They are a tough thing to defend. Politically we could 
say that sure some lucky guy wins and he should pay the tax.
<P>
	The lotteries are already taxed four times. This would be the 
fifth tax on lotteries. There is not much to squeeze out of the 
lotteries. We could take it if we want but there is not much there. 
Some exchanges with the provinces would have to be made. 
They do have some say about the taxing of lotteries and they are 
going to be very upset when they find the federal government 
trying to propose this kind of a tax.
<P>
	I want to make one more point. The other tax that was going to 
be introduced was called the deficit reduction surtax. It is 
something like the gasoline tax, only worse. It puts a tax on 
every Canadian, no matter who they are.  Whether it is an 
individual or a business, any kind of economic activity or earned 
income will be taxed by this surtax. Every Canadian will have a 
government tax imposed on them for government 
mismanagement. It is the wrong option. Like any other increase 
in tax, it is wrong. We should reduce the government 
expenditures more. That is the approach. We are totally against 
increases in taxes.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> We have a period of 
questions and comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Madam Speaker, on a point of order I move 
that the debate be now adjourned in light of the fact that there 
was no notice of this.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> We will complete the 
period of questions and comments.
<P>
<b> (1030 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
speaking of the deficit reduction surtax, it is referred to 
specifically in the standing committee report as being a single 
tax. Unfortunately, one of the members from the standing 
committee from the Liberal side, the member for Vaudreuil, has 
been, I am sure without any malicious intent, misinforming the 
public by saying that a single tax means 1 per cent.
<P>
	In other words, Canadians right now think the deficit 
reduction surtax being called a single tax is only 1 per cent. A 
single tax simply means that whether it is a single mother of 
three children earning $1,500 a month, or somebody earning 
$100,000, or a large corporation, a single tax will be applied to 
their tax rate. It can be whatever per cent.
<P>
	Canadians have to clearly understand that what the finance 
committee did was turn over to the finance minister a blank 
cheque that all Canadians will have to fill in and sign. Will this 
deficit reduction surtax be 1 per cent, 2 per cent, 10 per cent? 
How much is the surtax going to be? I suggest to Canadians they 
should be aware of the fact that there were balloons being flown 
at nearly every committee meeting asking what is the vision that 
we have of our responsibility to Canadian people.
<P>
	I wonder if the member might wish to comment on the 
reduction or the proposed elimination of the PUITTA, which is 
the public utilities tax that is going to be on private utilities in 
Alberta, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and Labrador where in the 
presentation that was made to us on the finance committee it was 
clearly stated by the people making the presentation on behalf of 
those private utilities that the people of Alberta, Nova Scotia, 
and Newfoundland and Labrador may be looking at as much as a 
10 per cent hike in their hydro rate.
<P>
	I wonder if the member would care to make a comment about 
that.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8967"> 8967 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to 
comment on both issues raised by the hon. member. First, with 
regard to the deficit reduction surtax, it says in the report that a 
single rate levy would be made on all businesses and personal 
income. That means all Canadians regardless of income or 
circumstances would have a single levy. It does not mean 1 per 
cent. It could mean 5 per cent, 4 per cent or 3 per cent.
<P>
	The chairman of our committee, the hon. member for 
Willowdale, indicated that a 1 per cent surtax collected across 
Canada would bring in about 700 million in tax dollars. I would 
think the minimum the government would charge as a surtax 
would be 2 per cent to bring in about $1.4 billion, because that is 
the amount of tax money it has looked at in this report.
<P>
	Regarding the second question of the Public Utilities Income 
Tax Transfer Act, I think it would be very unfortunate if the 
government tried to take $249 million from the private utility 
companies of this country. The problem is that it focuses that 
source of income on two or three provinces and mainly Alberta. 
Alberta has some major private resource electrical companies. 
That is $249 million that would be sucked out of the industry. In 
addition, it would raise the cost of utilities in those respective 
provinces. That would be like a targeted tax. I do not think that is 
fair as a tax principle as well.
<P>
	In Alberta the farmers who now use electricity to pump for 
their irrigation systems would be significantly affected by the 
implementation of this tax, or changing the current 
circumstances with regard to the public utilities income tax 
transfer at the present time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I have a question for the hon. member. He has been 
spouting these scare tactics among Canadians about taxes-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Scare tactics.
<P>
<b> (1035 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Yes, scare tactics. He is spouting scare tactics, 
trying to convince Canadians that somehow the government has 
an evil plan to tax them.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Red Deer):</B> Speaking the truth.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> I want to have the hon. member speak the truth 
all right. I want him to tell Canadians what his party's plans are 
for cutting social programs to balance the budget. They have 
told us they are going to balance the budget, I think in a year or 
two, and are going to take $40 billion out of government 
expenditure.
<P>
	We have had some details on the $10 billion in cuts which they 
have been specific on, but then there is an unspecified amount of 
cuts to Canada's social programs. I wonder if he would come 
clean with Canadians and tell them the facts. Which social 
programs are going to be cut and how much? I would like to hear 
the answer from the hon. member.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Madam Speaker, one of the 
things the Reform Party has done is lay out the details of our 
expenditure reductions. We placed before Canadians a week ago 
Thursday last $10 billion of expenditure reductions. First, we 
went into the details and presented that to the committee.
<P>
	Second, we made this available to the media and anybody else 
who wanted the details. We went into the specifics, beyond the 
presentation of the finance committee, and made those available 
to show that there was credibility to any of the numbers we 
presented. If one reads any of the media reports in the <I>Financial 
Post</I>, <I>Globe and Mail</I> and a long list of others, there is 
tremendous support for the presentation we made.
<P>
	We recognize that after economic growth of some $16 billion 
we still have to eliminate on average about $14 billion over a 
three year period. We see $24 billion of expenditure reduction 
over a three year period. On average that is about $8 billion per 
year.
<P>
	That is approximately 6 per cent to 8 per cent per year which 
was not in the business community when there was a downturn 
after 1982 and a downturn after 1984. Some of those business 
people cut their business costs by anywhere from 15 per cent to 
25 per cent. The expenditure reductions we are talking about 
here are minor and can be accomplished.
<P>
	Where are they? In the social program areas, we will be 
outlining by the first week of February for Canadians specific 
expenditure reductions. The focus of our expenditure reductions 
will take the dollars that are left. There will be some $50 billion 
to $55 billion in what we call the social program area. I could 
define that but it would take a few moments so I will not do it. 
However, in that $50 billion to $55 billion we will be reducing 
the expenditure of that area. We have already reduced it from 
$67 billion because there was $67 billion in that social program 
area that I am talking about.
<P>
	However, we will give specifics to the Canadian people as to 
where we will do it. Nothing will be hidden. The $50 billion to 
$55 billion that is left will be used for positive programs to help 
those people who are in true need in Canada. We will show 
compassion because we care about our responsibility to those 
people in need across this nation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, when I was 
back in the constituency this weekend people were absolutely 
infuriated by just the mention of this increase in tax. We are 
already overtaxed. People are already taking their capital out of 
this country and people are on the brink of a tax revolt. I wonder 
if the government knows exactly what kind of balloons it is 
floating.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Madam Speaker, I know I have 
limited time but I would encourage Canadians to speak out and 
speak against tax increases of any kind. We cannot afford them. 
We are at the maximum level. If it leads to revolt and if that is 
what the government wants, that is the way it will be.
<P>
	I am very disappointed that the government has not stood up 
at this point in time and continued this debate and put its 
position on the table as to why it supports tax increases. If it does 
not, why does it not speak against the report and not concur in it?

<P>
	The citizens request that Parliament not amend the human

honoured once again to rise in the House under Standing Order 
36 on behalf of the hon. member for York South-Weston and 
his constituents.
<P>
	The undersigned residents of Canada draw the attention of the 
House to the fact that individuals convicted of first degree 
murder are sentenced to life in prison without eligibility for 
parole for 25 years. Those convicted of second degree murder 
can be sentenced to life imprisonment without eligibility for 
parole for 15 years or more.
<P>
	Section 745 of the Canadian Criminal Code allows murderers 
to apply for a reduction in the number of years of imprisonment 
notwithstanding having been tried, convicted and sentenced in a 
court of law. Individuals convicted of second degree murder and 
sentenced to life in prison can become eligible for parole after 
serving 15 years by virtue of section 745 of the Canadian 
Criminal Code.
<P>
	Therefore the petitioners request that Parliament pass 
legislation to remove section 745 from the Canadian Criminal 
Code. I agree with the petitioners.

denied access to their grandchildren by their guardians. Several 
provincial jurisdictions including the Quebec civil code contain 
a provision to ensure the right of access of grandparents to their 
grandchildren.
<P>
	The petitioners request that Parliament amend the Divorce 
Act to state that in no case may a father or mother, without 
serious cause, place obstacles between the child and the 
grandparents and failing agreement between the parties the 
modalities of the relations are settled by the court.

On the Order: Government Orders:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>December 12, 1994-The Minister of Human Resources 
Development-Second reading and reference to the Standing Committee on 
Human Rights and the Status of Disabled Persons of Bill C-64, an act respecting 
employment equity.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.)</B> Madam Speaker, I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-64, an act respecting employment equity, be referred forthwith to 
the Standing Committee on Human Rights and the Status of Disabled Persons.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Madam Speaker, first let me address what I think is 
an important parliamentary landmark. In this case we are taking 
a bill after first reading and directing it specifically to a 
committee so that it can assist in the drafting of the legislation. 
It is an indication of the kind of parliamentary reform to which 
our government became committed after the last election. It 
would give an opportunity for members of Parliament to consult 
widely with all groups affected by the proposed bill and to 
ensure it reflects the broad base of concern.
<P>
	I thank the House leaders for the opportunity to try a bit of a 
pilot project in bringing the parliamentary system more into the 
process of legislative development and blueprinting.
<P>
	The bill warrants that kind of attention. It is in many ways a 
very significant piece of legislation because it affects 60 per 
cent of Canadians. It is something that goes to the heart of the 
whole question of equality in our society, ensuring we try to 
eliminate as many barriers as possible to prevent people from 
going to work.
<P>
	Over 10 years ago when I was in the previous Liberal 
government as the minister of employment I had occasion to 
establish a royal commission under Judge Rosalie Abella who 
looked at the whole question of employment equity and made a 
number of recommendations. Unfortunately by the time her 
report was finished the voters had decided to put Liberals in the 
position of a sabbatical for a period of years and the government 
that followed only went forward in a partial way to meet the 
recommendations of the Abella commission.
<P>
	I am very pleased today, having been part of the initial start on 
a new regime for employment equity, to be able now to fulfil the 
recommendations that were originally presented by Judge 
Abella on how we could work toward the elimination of 
systemic discrimination in the workplace. By systemic we mean 
practices, attitudes and developments that have occurred over 
many years. It does not mean that somebody is being outright 
bigoted, but it does mean that over time we have allowed the 
workplace, as we have in many other parts of society, to provide 
a series of barriers to various kinds of people.
<P>
	In this case we have four designated groups: disabled 
Canadians, women, visible minorities and aboriginal people, all 
of whom feel they have not been able to secure fair, open and 
equitable access to the workplace.
<P>
	In the previous legislation the opportunity to enforce and 
provide a strong sense of direction was not there. It was simply a 
reporting information based system.
<P>
<b> (1140 ) </B>
<P>
	We are undertaking in the legislation a series of very 
important further steps to complete and to bring up to date the 
kind of requirements we need to make employment equity really 
work.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I think this bill is fair, reasonable and very progressive. For 
the first time, the federal Public Service will be subject to the 
Employment Equity Act. Also for the first time, the Human 
Rights Commission will have the authority to ensure that 
employers meet their obligations. For instance, the commission 
may conduct audits of all public sector and private sector 
employers covered by this legislation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8972"> 8972 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Basically we are responding to the need to make sure there is 
proper and fair balance among all employers under the federal 
jurisdiction. For the first time the Public Service of Canada, 
involving over 250,000 employees, will be brought under the 
jurisdiction of this act.
<P>
	It will require obligations to be met by the armed forces, the 
RCMP and other areas subject to the final discussions of the 
President of the Treasury Board to work out matters dealing with 
operational efficiency and effectiveness.
<P>
	We have also been giving to the Human Rights Commission, 
an independent agency responsible to Parliament, the right to 
begin to enforce these actions by giving it a power to undertake 
workplace audits. Rather than simply being based on some kind 
of abstract notion, the Human Rights Commission will now have 
the responsibility of examining in a wide variety of workplaces 
exactly in what way they are meeting their requirements under 
the act to ensure that barriers are brought down, hiring practices 
are fair, training is offered and facilities are reconstructed to 
meet the specific requirements to ensure equitable, fair and just 
treatment in the workplace.
<P>
	It is our primary hope that kind of audit will be done in a fully 
co-operative way. Up to this point in time we can say that most 
private employers have co-operated, because they recognize 
that employment equity is not purely a matter of human rights, 
as important as it is. It is also good business. It is good to make 
the best use of human talent and human resources of whatever 
kind and in whatever place.
<P>
	There was an interesting article a month or so ago in the 
American business magazine, <I>Business Week</I>. The title was 
something we do not normally see on the cover of <I>Business 
Week</I>. It was entitled ``Inequality''. The point made in the 
feature article of the magazine was that one of the major 
deterrents to economic growth in the United States was the 
increasing inequality in society.
<P>
	We are moving into an age where the workplace requires more 
and more investment in human capital, resources, talent and 
ability. If we have people on the sidelines, if we marginalize 
people, if we do not draw upon the best talents, we do not have 
the full resources brought to bear to make a productive society. 
There is no question there are barriers in the workplace that 
inhibit and prevent that from happening.
<P>
	A good example in Canada is how some of our major banks 
which come under federal jurisdiction have begun in the last 
couple of years very major programs of minority hiring. I quote 
a vice-president of one of the major banks who recently noted 
the benefits of employment equity practices by saying: ``It 
brings into our business an infusion of new ideas, a broader 
perspective, better decision making and a greater sensitivity to 
all approaches''.
<P>
	They are finding that employment equity has substantially 
added to the productivity and the performance not only of 
designated workers but all workers. By improving the operation 
of human resource planning, management and development 
inside the workplace, designed primarily to ensure fairness and 
openness, it provides avenues and open doorways for all 
workers to achieve.
<P>
	That has met the test of efficiency. We know the ideologues 
will not believe it but people in business understand it. The 
people who understand how things work will believe it, but 
those across the way who scrape their knuckles when they walk 
will not understand it. Those who are in business understand 
how it works. That is why it receives that kind of support.
<P>
<b> (1145 ) </B>
<P>
	We have consulted very widely on this bill. We have talked to 
business, federal employers, aboriginal groups, labour groups 
and disabled Canadians; four million Canadians who have one 
form of disability or another and have been one of the strongest 
and most effective lobbies to bring about these kinds of changes 
in employment equity. They recognize that they have enormous 
talents to give.
<P>
	As I have said in another context when we talked about social 
reform, one of the objectives is to bring down barriers so that 
people for example who are presently disabled now under many 
social programs in the provinces have to declare themselves 
unemployable to get a benefit. At the same time there are also 
barriers in the workplace.
<P>
	As the federal government we are working to eliminate those 
barriers in our own workforce and in all those companies and 
organizations which come under federal jurisdiction.
<P>
	What we are proposing today is a major step forward that will 
really have major benefits. It would clearly signal to over 60 per 
cent of Canadians that we are prepared to move actively on their 
behalf to secure fair, equal treatment in the workplace.
<P>
	That is a message that is long overdue and one that will clearly 
represent a commitment to fairness in society and a more just 
treatment of all those Canadians who have felt that for reasons 
which had nothing to do with their talent or ability, but to open 
up for the first time the real merit principle. There is no merit 
principle if there are false barriers, false discriminations and 
false disincentives in the workplace. The real place we find 
merit is when one is judged on one's merit not by who one is or 
what one is, but what one can do.
<P>
	Finally, I also believe that this will substantially aid and 
enhance the basic economic position of this country. It will 
mean we will be able to utilize and draw upon the full range of 
incredible talent this country has in all its people and not say to 
some they are second class citizens. Everyone is a first class 
citizen and is a first class worker under this legislation.

	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
today we have an opportunity to speak to Bill C-64 respecting 
employment equity. Madam Speaker, I shall, if I may, quote the 
purpose of this legislation as it appears in the text of the bill.
<P>
	The purpose of this Act is to achieve equality in the workplace 
so that no person shall be denied employment opportunities or 
benefits for reasons unrelated to ability.
<P>
	The bill consists of four parts. First, it sets out the obligations 
of an employer and outlines reporting requirements. Part II sets 
out mechanisms for enforcing employer obligations. Part III 
deals with the assessment of monetary penalties, and Part IV 
establishes regulation-making authority and provides for other 
general matters.
<P>
	The House will recall that the federal government's first 
affirmative action programs were set up in 1970, following the 
report of the Royal Commission on the Status of Women in 
Canada. However, the report of the Commission on Equality in 
Employment-the Abella Commission's report tabled in 
1984-was to form the basis for current policies on employment 
equity.
<P>
	Adopted in 1986, the Employment Equity Act currently 
applies to federally regulated employers and Crown 
corporations that employ 100 or more employees. These are 
mainly employers that conduct their operations in the banking, 
transportation and communications sectors which, as you know, 
are under federal jurisdiction.
<P>
	Bill C-64 will completely change the 1986 legislation, by 
making it apply to the federal public service, which was not 
covered before. Considerations to be included in employment 
equity plans are now better defined. The President of the 
Treasury Board is to table an annual report. Finally, the 
Canadian Human Rights Commission will be responsible for the 
enforcement of the obligations imposed on employers by certain 
sections.
<P>
	Of course, this is nothing new.
<P>
<b> (1150) </B>
<P>
	You will recall that, in a report tabled on May 14 1992, a 
special committee recommended that the threshold under which 
the legislation does not apply be lowered from 100 to 75 
employees.
<P>
	The same report recommended as even more important yet 
that a national employment equity strategy be developed, a 
strategy that would include a public education program. And 
this program, in the opinion of the committee and his chairman, 
was the most important part of all.
<P>
	This report was accompanied by a minority report from the 
Liberal Party, presented by the hon. members for York 
South-Weston and Halifax. This minority report states that: 
``Maintaining the current threshold of 100 employees, or even 
reducing the threshold to 75 as recommended by the Special 
committee, results in legislation that, in effect, imposes a 
barrier to designated groups members who prefer to be 
employed in small business settings''. As you can see, the 
minority report even goes further than the special committee 
report.
<P>
	Let me quote again from this minority report, where the hon. 
member for York South-Weston and the hon. member for 
Halifax tell us the following: ``It is our belief that the Federal 
Contractors Program presents the government with an ideal 
opportunity to demonstrate its commitment to the principle of 
employment equity. The message should be clear and 
unequivocal-if you want to do business with the federal 
government, you must implement employment equity in the 
work place''.
<P>
	These two examples go to show that in those days-this was 
1992-employment equity was taken seriously. In fact, this 
special committee report and minority report have laid the 
groundwork, I imagine, for the bill before us today.
<P>
	In this context, the Bloc Quebecois believes it is essential to 
ensure equitable job access to the groups affected by the 
legislation. We therefore endorse the principle of employment 
equity. The Bloc certainly supports the inclusion of the public 
service of Canada within the scope of the act. This was long 
overdue.
<P>
	However, the Bloc Quebecois questions the helpfulness of a 
new governmental measure. As I said earlier, the special 
committee recommended that adequate resources be provided to 
the Human Rights Commission, so that it could carry out 
effectively its new functions. Unfortunately, the Minister of 
Human Resources Development has stated in a press conference 
that the commission would have to do more with less. This 
leaves us somewhat sceptical or at least concerned.
<P>
	Another difficulty we would like to point out is that 
employment equity policies should have been adopted a long 
time ago. They were not. However, the federal government is 
now in a situation where it must reduce its workforce, which 
makes it much more difficult to reach equity goals and will limit 
the impact of this bill to a certain extent.
<P>
	A bill is a statement of good intentions. However, given the 
current downsizing of the federal public service, it would be not 
only desirable but essential for the minister to propose a plan to 
implement this bill within the public service.
<P>
	We also remember-as I read a few moments ago in its 
report-that the special committee had recommended a 
reduction to 75 employees, while the minority report suggested 
an even greater reduction. The bill, however, does not provide 
for such a reduction, even though we think it should.

<P>
	In conclusion, although the Bloc Quebecois supports the 
principle of employment equity, we will introduce major 
amendments in committee in order to help improve the 
effectiveness of this bill.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, today we gather to mourn the death of an old friend. We 
lament the demise of a principle that has guarded the integrity 
and quality of our public service for almost a century.
<P>
	The rule of merit has produced a level of quality and 
impartiality in government that has served Canadians for 
generations. The merit principle directs that jobs and 
promotions go to the best qualified, most competent people.
<P>
	The Liberals began to inch the principle of merit into an early 
grave a decade ago and Bill C-64 will bang the last few nails 
into its coffin.
<P>
	No other principle can withstand the scrutiny of elementary 
justice. Who should the taxpayer hire? Who deserves a 
promotion? It is the best and the brightest of course. All 
Canadians from all groups accept this.
<P>
	If the minister has his way, jobs and promotions will not 
necessarily go to the best and brightest, the ones who 
demonstrate these high qualifications. From the moment this 
bill is passed the public service will pass over many of the best 
qualified in favour of those with personal characteristics wholly 
unrelated to the job.
<P>
	The government will subordinate the principle of merit to the 
politics of race and of gender. This is in a time of public service 
downsizing. The field of opportunity will narrow even further 
for those who stand outside the four designated groups.
<P>
	Morale is already low. Morale will take a further blow in the 
next budget but it will sink through the floor with the passage of 
this act because thousands of civil servants will be denied a 
fulfilling career even if they deserve it more than their 
neighbour.
<P>
	How do we know the members of a designated group? They 
are self-identified. This bill encourages a mentality of 
victimization. It encourages Canadians to view themselves as 
oppressed people who can gain something by viewing 
themselves as such.
<P>
	At present two-thirds of Canada's workforce belong to a 
designated group. The annual report on the Employment Equity 
Act says that in 1991 almost 2.3 million Canadians reported 
having a disability, which would be okay, but it is an increase of 
30 per cent from 1986.
<P>
	This government will only be satisfied when all Canadians 
count themselves in as victims but not all Canadians buy into 
this mentality. I want to applaud the seven hundred and sixty 
some thousand Canadians who refuse to even name their ethnic 
origin in Canada's last census.
<P>
	Even though ``Canadian'' was not given as an ethnic option in 
this census these seven hundred and some thousand refused to be 
part of a designated group and pencilled in the word Canadian. I 
digress.
<P>
	Let us look at the purpose of the bill for a moment. Its purpose 
is to mandate a representative workforce. Exactly what is a 
representative workforce? The government ignores Canada's 
history and its social norms. It arbitrarily demands that the 
public service reflect-the word reflect means like a 
mirror-precisely by occupational group the designated groups 
as they occur in the larger Canadian workforce.
<P>
	This is representation according to the bill. Is the workforce 
so unrepresentative that people are suffering injustice? Are 
Canadian employers so unfair that they would shut whole groups 
of people out of the labour market? Is there really a need for 
employment equity in Canada?
<P>
	There is not when one looks at the numbers. Let me give 
members an example of the 570,000 people now regulated under 
the current Employment Equity Act. Women make up 45.6 per 
cent but the larger workforce is 45.9 per cent female. There is a 
.24 per cent difference there-what an injustice. Bring out the 
legislative hammer. The Liberals are on their high horses, hell 
bent on stamping out this perceived social evil. It is ridiculous. 
How does this mentality come about? The Liberal government is 
driven by special interest groups rather than public interest.
<P>
	Allow me to quote from the Macdonald commission of 1985 
which describes the formulation of section 15(2) of the equality 
rights section of the Constitution. This section empowers the 
government to deny equality to all Canadians and give 
preference to women, visible minorities, aboriginals and the 
disabled.
<P>
	The commission said that the government incorporated 
verbatim the feminist proposal for rewriting the new equality 
rights section. Liberals have always been driven by political 
expediency rather than what is fair and equitable. This is another 
example.
<P>
<b> (1200) </B>
<P>
	Let us look at more numbers. What about the salaries of 
visible minorities? Visible minority males make 93 per cent of 
the salaries of all men in the workforce; visible minority women 
make 96 per cent of what the average woman makes. Ring the 
alarm bells. Roll out the legislative guns. We will blast this 
problem with a massive, coercive, manipulative bureaucracy. 
That is the Liberal way.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8975"> 8975 </A></B>
<P>
	The government is suffering a nauseating attack of 
self-righteousness. It constantly points the finger of blame at 
ordinary Canadians, accusing them of unfairness and 
irresponsibility. What about the three million gun owners for 
example? No matter that they are responsible and law-abiding, 
they deserve tough legislation. The government assumes them 
to be irresponsible, suspicious, maybe even dangerous.
<P>
	If the workplace is not precisely representative down to the 
last decimal point, the government aims its legislative guns. 
According to the Liberal government Canadian employers 
cannot be trusted to be fair to their workers. The government 
must regulate them more with some heavy-handed laws.
<P>
	In fact Canadian employers are fair and the numbers show it. 
When situations of equal choice are compared, when we 
compare apples to apples, there is no discrimination. According 
to Statistics Canada, for example in 1992, single women made 
99 per cent of the salaries of single men. Other salary 
differences can be explained by lifestyle choices and choices 
that prefer family over career. This is not a matter of injustice. It 
is a matter of personal priority and social norms.
<P>
	What is the Reform answer? The market, not the government, 
should regulate the makeup of the workplace. Having a 
representative work force simply makes good business sense. 
Companies which do not hire the most productive people, 
companies that do not hire people that reflect their own markets, 
will be driven out of the market, and so be it. The market will 
impose its own discipline on the workplace in the private sector.
<P>
	What is the role of government in the public sector? The 
government's role is to ensure equality of opportunity for all 
Canadians, to dismantle systemic barriers, help with education 
and make sure that employment information is available, 
reasonably accommodate for disabilities and make employment 
testing fair for everybody.
<P>
	Equality of opportunity ensures that everybody has an equal 
chance. It creates a level playing field, not a field that is tilted in 
favour of special interest groups. No legislation is required, no 
bureaucracy, minimal expense, and no coercive quotas.
<P>
	I want to address quotas in the context of Bill C-64. Quotas 
are requirements for hiring certain numbers of designated 
people within certain time frames. The legislation specifically 
disavows quotas by name in section 31, but on the other hand it 
imposes all the elements of quotas in other sections.
<P>
	The bill sets up quotas in disguise. Let me describe them to 
you. First, the employer must audit the entire workforce, then 
establish a timetable for correcting any unrepresentativeness 
with so-called numerical goals for hiring, both short term and 
long term, then submit a report by June 1 of every year to the 
government. The employer is forced by law to consult with the 
union when it makes its plan.
<P>
	The plan must include steps that will make reasonable 
progress toward these goals, and the word reasonable is of 
course defined by the government body in charge. What is the 
defining enforcement body? None other than the Canadian 
Human Rights Commission, that group of new moral crusaders, 
the witch hunters of political correctness. The act creates a new 
big brother, compliance auditors, to go over the employers' 
plans and reports.
<P>
	If the compliance auditors at the commission do not like the 
plan, the steps, the goals, the auditor can do a compliance audit. 
He can walk into the business at any time and demand any 
confidential documents. The bill even specifies that he can use 
the employer's photocopier to copy them. Then the auditor gives 
a summary order to the employer to change his plans.
<P>
	If numerical goals are not quotas I will eat my hat. If the 
employer does not like it he can go to a new creation of the act, 
another one, an even bigger brother, an employment equity 
review tribunal which can be made up of just one person, a 
tribunal of one person, but possess all the powers of any other 
quasi-judicial body in Canada. Its orders have the power of the 
Federal Court and if the employer does not like what the tribunal 
says he must appeal to the Appeals Court of Canada. This is 
nonsense.
<P>
<b> (1205 ) </B>
<P>
	The fines attached to this bill are absolutely punitive; $10,000 
for the first offence and $50,000 for each one thereafter. All of 
the elements of quotas are there: the plans, the reporting and 
specific timetables, the investigations and the sanctions. Last 
night the human rights commissioner said jokingly: ``We hope 
to be able to get compliance without using handcuffs and billy 
clubs''. That is a nice, perverse joke but Canadians will not find 
it very funny.
<P>
	My last point is this. What is the cost of this boondoggle? In 
the United States where quotas were created in 1970 the cost of 
affirmative action was estimated at 4 per cent of the GDP, $112 
billion U.S. a year. In Canada there are no clear estimates but the 
Ontario Chamber of Commerce estimates that a company with 
500 employees will spend $100,000 just to comply with the 
paperwork.
<P>
	This bill is utterly offensive.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board 
and Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to be associated with my colleagues, the 
Minister of Human Resources Development and the Secretary of 
State for Training and Youth, in bringing to the House a proposal 
for the new employment equity act.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8976"> 8976 </A></B>
<P>
	We are certain the parliamentary committee that will review 
this bill will be very attentive to the views of interested people 
and to various groups on this matter. We are looking forward to 
the discussions in committee and to the debate in the House.
<P>
	The Prime Minister had it right when he addressed the French 
Senate a short time ago. He said that because of the sacrifices 
and efforts of the women and men who have come from the four 
corners of the world, we have succeeded in building in Canada a 
society that is pluralistic and equitable and that is founded on 
open-mindedness, tolerance, generosity and sharing.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	As citizens of this country, we can be proud of the progress 
our society has made. I do not believe that Canadians have 
finished evolving. Although we have made remarkable progress 
towards equity, I do not think that everyone has an equal 
opportunity to contribute fully.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We all know there is room for more open-mindedness, more 
tolerance, more generosity and more sharing. That is what 
employment equity is all about. It is a policy of inclusion, not 
exclusion; of openness, not discrimination; of sharing, not 
restricting. That is what my hon. friend does not seem to get 
through his head.
<P>
	It was in the 1970s that greater attention began to be paid to 
questions of equity and equality. One consequence was the 
adoption of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Even 
before that, Parliament enacted the Canadian Human Rights Act 
and the first steps were taken toward a policy of affirmative 
action that became in due course employment equity.
<P>
	What employment equity seeks to do is to break down barriers 
to equality in the workplace, that is to ensure that no person is 
denied employment opportunities for reasons unrelated to 
ability. At the same time it puts in place measures to assist in 
creating a level playing field for aboriginal peoples, for persons 
with disabilities, for persons in a visible minority and for 
women.
<P>
	On a wall in Ottawa that is otherwise undistinguished 
someone has scrawled: ``Equal treatment does not equal 
equality''. Employment equity recognizes that truth. 
Differences must be recognized and accepted if there is to be 
greater equality. The fact of recognizing these differences and 
doing something to diminish them does not constitute 
discrimination, as some may claim. On the contrary, it 
contributes to the equality of opportunity of all citizens and does 
not diminish any.
<P>
	Some examples concerning the four designated groups may 
explain how employment equity is pursued in the public service 
and indeed often in the private sector as well. Although women 
are entering the public service in greater numbers than in the 
past, they are clustered in large measure in what are called pink 
ghettos. They are heavily represented in fields such as teaching, 
nursing  and clerical work. Women working full time earn less 
than three-quarters of what men make. In the public service 
women constitute about 85 per cent of the administrative 
support category, the clerical workers, but only about 18 per 
cent of the executive group.
<P>
<b> (1210) </B>
<P>
	It was recognized some years ago that if women were to 
become managers in the public service, they would need 
assistance in overcoming the barriers they faced. Among the 
measures put in place was a bureau within the Public Service 
Commission to help women prepare themselves for tasks that 
had for a long time been almost the exclusive preserve of men.
<P>
	Alternative work arrangements were introduced as well. 
These arrangements vary from tele-work to job sharing. 
Managers are encouraged to permit all employees to take 
advantage of these if possible, if it makes sense. Nevertheless, 
women need these alternative arrangements more because they 
still carry the major burden of family responsibilities.
<P>
	Recently the pension provisions were amended so that part 
time employees could contribute. Again both men and women 
are eligible, but we know that 26 per cent of women work part 
time as compared to 10 per cent of men.
<P>
	These are the fruits of a consciousness that includes 
employment equity. The progress that has been made, however, 
still leaves women far from equal. Corporate culture has to 
change too. There has to be a willingness to encourage the 
contributions of women and of all employees. That is also a 
matter of employment equity.
<P>
	The accommodations made for persons with disabilities 
would be applauded by all members of the House. The 
Government of Canada has a policy to make its facilities 
accessible to all Canadians with disabilities, whether they are 
members of the public or employees.
<P>
	A policy encourages departments to provide their employees 
who have disabilities with the technical aids they need to 
accomplish their jobs. That policy is backed up with a fund that 
has been placed at the disposal of the Public Service 
Commission. As an example, if a person who is visually 
impaired needs a computer with a voice synthesizer, then one 
will be provided.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In some departments, people with learning disabilities were 
hired to do work that others might not have found stimulating. 
The results were outstanding. That is employment equity at 
work.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In another government department students with disabilities 
were hired under a special program for two summers in a row. 
The students acquired workplace knowledge and skills that they 
might not otherwise have been able to gain. Perhaps even more 
important, the project has worked to break down the 
psychological barriers that persons with disabilities face. It also 
served  to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8977"> 8977 </A></B>
<P>
prove that persons with disabilities can be as productive as other 
employees. They too have abilities.
<P>
	This was no doubt what the Governor General had in mind 
when he said earlier this month on the International Day of 
Disabled Persons that individuals with a disability are often 
marginalized by discrimination and that their opportunities are 
diminished by ignorance. Employment equity exists to open the 
doors to persons with disabilities so that they too can participate 
fully in the workplace.
<P>
	A recent Statistics Canada study showed that among 
well-educated persons with disabilities, aboriginal peoples and 
persons of visible minority, the earning gap was closing. 
Although 1990 university graduates with disabilities earn some 
7 per cent less than other graduates, the more important gap is in 
employment rates. Among university graduates with disabilities 
the employment rate is 6 percentage points lower than for other 
graduates. The gap is 12 per cent for community college 
graduates. Even those with relatively minor limitations have 
more difficulty in finding jobs than other graduates.
<P>
	The story is about the same for aboriginal people. Aboriginal 
graduates from community colleges in 1990 have an 
unemployment rate that is almost 10 per cent higher than other 
community college graduates. The playing field simply is not 
level. There are a number of tools available to level the playing 
field. One used by the Public Service Commission is to enrich 
the pool of candidates. You will not have any aboriginal 
employees if you do not have any aboriginal candidates. You 
will not have the candidates if you do all the hiring through word 
of mouth. Even then you may not have a good selection of 
aboriginal candidates to consider. They may not come forward 
perhaps because they believe that they would not be selected. 
Therefore, you need a program of outreach not to guarantee a job 
but to provide assurances that they can compete with the 
principle of merit. The principle of merit is paramount in our 
system in the Public Service of Canada.
<P>
<b> (1215) </B>
<P>
	Once an aboriginal employee has been hired the manager may 
find that a certain amount of cultural adaptation is required both 
in his part and on the part of the employee.
<P>
	Persons in visible minorities are also under-represented in 
the public service in comparison with the members in the 
workforce. Like women and persons with disabilities, persons in 
a visible minority are of all backgrounds. Some are recent 
immigrants and some have been here for decades or hundreds of 
years such as the black people from Nova Scotia.
<P>
	One of the problems faced by the public service is that 
although persons in a visible minority are fairly well 
represented in the scientific and professional category they are 
not moving up in proportional numbers into the ranks of senior 
management. A part of the solution was found within the 
framework of employment equity programs in the form of a 
special course that we developed through the Canadian centre 
for management development to help certain people to develop 
their management skills.
<P>
	Finally, whether these candidates succeed will depend on 
their qualifications and ability. The merit principle must govern 
and the person considered to be the most competent-

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
am pleased to respond today to the tabling of Bill C-64, an Act 
respecting employment equity. This bill is important for 
federally regulated work places. It revokes the current 
Employment Equity Act adopted eight years ago.
<P>
	Despite the very laudable intentions behind this first Act, it 
was harshly criticized by informed observers. The present 
government is now trying to correct some deficiencies. We 
certainly intend to help it improve its performance.
<P>
	During the election campaign, the Liberal Party made three 
promises on employment equity. First, it promised to extend the 
scope of the law to federal boards and agencies. It also promised 
to empower the Canadian Human Rights Commission to conduct 
legal inquiries on issues related to employment equity. Finally, 
it promised to require firms that are awarded federal 
government contracts to comply with employment equity 
provisions.
<P>
	So what were we presented with yesterday in this House, 
Madam Speaker? We were presented with a bill that in effect 
extends the law to the federal public service, its boards and 
agencies. It seems that this was the government's first objective. 
Bravo! The Bloc Quebecois applauds any initiative to ensure 
equal access to employment for all, including native people, the 
disabled, women and members of visible minorities.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois also supports the principle of legislation 
forcing employers to comply with the principle of equal 
opportunity. Since in our opinion the government must set an 
example for the private sector, any new legislation had to extend 
the application of employment equity measures to its own 
departments. I might add, Madam Speaker, that it was high time.
<P>
	Bill C-64 also empowers the Canadian Human Rights 
Commission to determine whether the provisions of the 
legislation are being complied with and to investigate the 
enforcement of the law. It also establishes an employment 
equity tribunal when circumstances warrant it. That is all very 
good, Madam Speaker.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8978"> 8978 </A></B>
<P>
	It appears, however, that the government's third promise, 
concerning the application of the law to all government 
contractors, will not be kept. I will return to this point a little 
later in my speech. As you might expect, we appreciate the 
government's effort, but everything is not perfect either.
<P>
	A committee will review the bill, but I would like to raise a 
few points that struck me. First of all, as I just said, I am 
disappointed with the lack of provisions concerning government 
contractors. The bill in no way extends the law to this category 
of employers, and this is regrettable.
<P>
<b> (1220) </B>
<P>
	Indeed, at the very beginning of the act, a ``private sector 
employer'' is defined as ``any person who employs one hundred 
or more employees''. You can understand my disappointment, 
as well as that of many observers. Why does that act not apply to 
other private sector employers who win contracts for which they 
are paid with public money? Should we not ensure that 
taxpayers' money be used in places where employment equity is 
valued and respected? I believe so, but this government seems to 
think otherwise. We will get back to this issue in committee.
<P>
	I also wonder about the delays in tabling these legislative 
amendments. Why did the government wait for more than one 
year after the swearing-in of the new team to amend the act? It is 
certainly not because of the deficit, since this bill, unlike others, 
has virtually no financial impact on public money. This 
legislation is primarily one of a moral nature; it could have been 
introduced early, to emphasize the importance of the social 
justice which we seek to establish.
<P>
	This delay is also unfortunate because, in the current context, 
the new legislation will definitely not help achieve employment 
equity. Just think of the hiring freeze, of the fact that employees 
cannot move on to the next salary step, and the massive 
reductions in the federal public service. This is unfortunate and 
we deplore this situation. In spite of its laudable objectives, the 
new legislative policy will not give results before many years, 
thus once again hurting the same categories of people.
<P>
	Previous employment equity policies have had a very limited 
impact. For example, over a period of six years, the number of 
promotions for full-time employees in all private sectors of 
activity improved a mere three per cent in the case of women, 
0.49 per cent for aboriginal people, 1.11 per cent for 
handicapped people, and 3.82 per cent for members of visible 
minorities. These are, in my opinion, very poor results, 
considering that the act has already been in effect for eight 
years.
<P>
	The figures are not much better when it comes to recruiting. 
Indeed, the situation improved by 2.4 per cent for women, 1.30 
per cent for aboriginal people, 0.98 per cent for handicapped 
people, and 2.91 per cent for members of visible minorities.
<P>
	As for the public service, in 1986, Treasury Board adopted a 
policy reflecting the spirit of this legislation, but as far as 
representation in management positions is concerned, 
aboriginal people still represent only 1.1 per cent of the total 
number of public servants; persons with disabilities, 2.1 per 
cent; members of visible minorities, 2.1 per cent; and women, 
15.8 per cent. The situation is clearly not any better in the 
federal Public Service than it is in the private sector, hence our 
conclusion that the measures that have been in place so far have 
not improved the participation of members of designated 
groups.
<P>
	According to the statistics, very few members of these groups 
are in senior management positions and women still work 
mostly in office jobs, sales and services. So the situation is far 
from ideal, as the minister pointed out earlier.
<P>
	I think we will have to examine the available information very 
carefully to determine why previous policies did not work.
<P>
	In concluding, the Bloc Quebecois welcomes a bill that 
broadens the application of employment equity measures to 
include the entire public service. However, we believe the bill 
could be significantly improved so as to obtain better results and 
meet the objectives of this legislation. We will gladly make 
suggestions to the government during consideration of the bill in 
committee.

<P>
	<B>Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew (Secretary of State (Training 
and Youth), Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I welcome the opportunity 
to talk to the House today about the need for and the many 
benefits of the proposed amendments to the Employment Equity 
Act. Once read, once well understood, if people are familiar 
with the history of how this has all come about, there is no need 
for the fearmongering and the falsification of information going 
on here today.
<P>
	It should be stated clearly that what the employment equity 
legislation does is reinforce the merit principle. It states that 
very clearly. That may be a bit problematic to some because I 
guess some would feel a bit more comfortable knowing that 
there are flaws and gaps. Really what we have done is given 
prominence to the merit principle. Not only that, we also looked 
for a balanced approach of trying to integrate the four target 
groups in a very enforceable way into the whole labour market 
and also to express equity as it should be.
<P>
<b> (1225) </B>
<P>
	I do not think there is any fear with all these people 
fearmongering about their jobs, including the hon. members 
across the way scaring people by saying that what is going to 
happen if we do hire disabled people, women, aboriginals and 
visible minorities is that these people will not be hired 
meritoriously.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8979"> 8979 </A></B>
<P>
	This is erroneous and this is clearly discriminatory. It is an 
assumption, a false assumption. Because those four target 
groups are going to be aided by this legislation, it is perfectly 
acceptable that this happens considering the gross 
under-representation of those groups. It is a wrong that has not 
been corrected.
<P>
	There have been many barriers. There have been many 
obstacles and this is a step forward. It is needless for people to 
put fear in the hearts of those people who have jobs out there, 
particularly those people who are highly placed.
<P>
	Members need not worry because these four target groups are 
so under-represented as of yet. It will take such a long time. It 
will still be such a big struggle. This will make it easy but it is 
not going to be just the legislation that is going to make it 
happen.
<P>
	Unfortunately some of the greatest obstacles we will have are 
attitudes of people. We can put legislation there to help but 
unfortunately we cannot change the minds of all those people 
who are otherwise inclined.
<P>
	The equity is not simply the subject of ideological debate for 
me and many other members of this House. For those of us who 
are women, members of visible minorities, persons with 
disabilities or aboriginal people, employment equity is 
fundamentally about democracy. It is the freedom to exercise 
our rights to participate fully in the political process, to make 
contributions to the economic and cultural fabric of our nation.
<P>
	Employment equity means ensuring that all Canadians have a 
fair chance in the workplace. It ensures that no person is denied 
employment opportunities for reasons unrelated to ability. It 
involves identifying and eliminating barriers, taking special 
measures and making reasonable accommodations.
<P>
	As was stated by the hon. member, there are no quotas. For 
instance, if 25 per cent of the population is aboriginal in a said 
province and there is a thousand-person company and there is 
not one aboriginal person, is it not reasonable to assume that 
company or other companies like it would want to achieve that 
kind of representation of that population? That is not 
unreasonable. That is not discriminatory. That is perfectly 
logical, perfectly acceptable and it is the way things should 
evolve if we are to show the dignity and the respect of one 
another as human beings.
<P>
	It also talks about equality, the opportunity of equality. That 
seems to fail some people. In short, employment equity means 
ensuring that employment opportunities are open to those who 
have historically been arbitrarily excluded. We need not go into 
the figures. We all know what they are. It is a fact that is well 
known to many of us, including hon. members opposite.
<P>
	This bill is a fulfilment of this government's vision of our 
country, one in which each of us has equal access to employment 
opportunities and a chance to fully share in Canada's prosperity. 
Why should some people be on the periphery of prosperity? 
Why should they not be sharing in the wealth of this country in 
terms of jobs, promotions and training? Why not adopt this 
legislation fully? All members of the House should see the 
historical isolation and marginalization of target groups in our 
population and that those who need a helping hand and logical 
reasoning, those who need that acceptance, should be accepted.
<P>
<b> (1230) </B>
<P>
	By strengthening the employment equity act we are 
reconfirming the core values Canadians hold dear: fairness, 
decency, and equality for every citizen in this nation. Canada is 
known around the world for that. We are citizens of the world. 
We are recognized for that. Why would we not enhance that 
within our own country?
<P>
	Equality does not come easily in Canada. It is a source of 
national shame that as recently as the 1950s the first peoples of 
this country were subject to laws which prevented them from 
leaving reserves without a bureaucrat's permission. It is a 
known fact that our people were going to war and fighting for 
this country as First Nations people and they did not have the 
right to vote. Women were not even considered persons in the 
eyes of the law until October 1929 when women won the famous 
Persons case and gained the right to become members of the 
Senate.
<P>
	According to the 1993 annual report on employment equity 
we still have not come close to attaining our goals. According to 
the most recent census aboriginal peoples continue to be 
under-represented in the workforce at just 1.04 per cent 
compared to 3 per cent in the Canadian workforce.
<P>
	Aboriginal people continue to occupy the lowest paying jobs. 
The wage gap between aboriginal men and women working full 
time and other Canadians has actually increased since 1987. 
Mind you it should be noted by all members of this House that 
aboriginal people on average still make an annual income of 
$10,000.
<P>
	Aboriginal participation in the workforce has risen by less 
than .5 per cent since employment equity came into effect. This 
is even though the number of employable aboriginal people rose 
by almost 50 per cent during the years 1986 to 1991.
<P>
	The plight of persons with disabilities is not much better. The 
representation of this group in the workforce has changed very 
slowly. They are equally under-represented in the labour market 
especially given that the number of Canadians with disabilities 
increased from 5.4 to 6.5 per cent of the population over the 
same five year period.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8980"> 8980 </A></B>
<P>
	It is simply unacceptable that today in Canada a woman still 
earns only 70 per cent of her male counterpart's wages, or that a 
person of colour is denied a promotion on the basis of his or her 
skin colour.
<P>
	The litmus test of Canadians' commitment to true equality is 
access to employment. Jobs are the key to social and economic 
integration into the community. They are a source of fulfilment 
and independence for all Canadians. As the Prime Minister 
would say, a job gives you self-respect and dignity. Jobs are part 
of this government's agenda.
<P>
	Employment equity ensures that those jobs will be available 
to everyone without any barriers. By the turn of the century 
two-thirds of the entrants to the workforce will be women, 
aboriginal peoples, members of visible minorities and persons 
with disabilities. This country needs the wealth of their talents.
<P>
	With this bill we want to achieve a better balance that works to 
the advantage of all Canadians. This legislation does not set out 
to redress the difficulties being faced by disadvantaged groups 
by creating new problems for other Canadians. The amendments 
are designed to clarify and strengthen existing laws, not to 
increase the regulatory or financial burdens to employers.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, I know I am out of time so I will skip a great 
deal of what I had to say which I think was also important. I will 
conclude by saying that by assuring equal access to employment 
and fair treatment of all, we can and will build a better nation for 
our children, for our families and for all Canadians.
<P>
	Remember that 60 per cent of the Canadian population is 
constituted by these four target groups but they are not 
adequately represented. It should be noted that we are talking 
about fair representation, not under-representation. We are 
talking about equality of opportunity.
<P>
<b> (1235) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise to address Bill C-64, an act 
respecting employment equity.
<P>
	Reform opposes this type of legislation and I certainly oppose 
it. Affirmative action by any other name is still affirmative 
action. It leads to the creation of special designation groups and 
causes reverse discrimination as the process of merit hiring is 
forced to take a back seat to artificially created criteria.
<P>
	The annual report of employment equity for 1994 clearly 
shows there is no need for this legislation. Visible minorities 
represent 8 per cent of the workforce governed by the current act 
compared to 9 per cent of the entire Canadian workforce. The 
report also states that women represent 45 per cent of the 
workforce covered by the existing act compared to 45 per cent of 
the entire Canadian labour force. These two facts alone show 
that a hiring process unencumbered by government regulations 
is able to adequately address this issue.
<P>
	In our lifetime let us admit it, we have seen terrible inequities. 
Going back to the thirties and forties, there have been gross 
inequities in our social system but they are being corrected over 
the years. Human dignity and human will are creating the 
redress.
<P>
	I find it amazing that this government feels a need to interfere 
with the free job market which is working well when it fails to 
use the same urgency to address real issues like the debt and the 
deficit. Why do I say the government is acting with urgency? 
This bill was tabled in the House yesterday, shortly after 1500 
hours. The ink on that official document could hardly have been 
dry at the time. I did not get to read the bill until this morning. 
Yet here we are less than 24 hours after its introduction being 
asked to debate the bill's merit. That is acting with a sense of 
urgency but I think it might be more accurately described as an 
abuse of the democratic process.
<P>
	I saw the converse in this House this morning when my 
colleague, the member for Lethbridge, was speaking on Motion 
No. 13 and wanted to continue debate on it. Those on the 
government benches said: ``Oh no, we cannot do that. We did not 
have enough notice''. They had 48 hours' notice to continue 
debate but that was not sufficient for them.
<P>
	Why the urgency on this bill? I do not know. Are the Liberals 
afraid to have the complete details of the bill brought to the 
attention of the Canadian public, or are they simply afraid to tell 
Canadians about the bureaucratic maze which has to be created 
by this bill?
<P>
	One thing I do know is that the business people in my 
constituency are fed up to the teeth with government 
bureaucracy, with more and more taxes and more and more 
regulations to adhere to and forms to fill out. Canadian 
employers are already deluged with government imposed 
paperwork.
<P>
	That burden is increased even more through clauses 9 to 18 of 
this bill which call for the collection, analysis and review of 
their workforce leading to the preparation of an employment 
equity plan, complete with long term and short term numerical 
goals. There is also the requirement that an annual report on 
employment equity be filed with the minister. Let us look at the 
bill.
<P>
	Clause 9 states that for the purposes of implementing 
employment equity every employer shall collect information 
and conduct an analysis of the employer's workforce in 
accordance with the regulations in order to determine the degree 
of under-representation, et cetera. It goes on about conducting a 
review of the employer's employment systems, policies and 
practices in accordance with the regulations. It is only those 
employees who identify themselves or agree to be identified by 
employers as aboriginal peoples, et cetera.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8981"> 8981 </A></B>
<P>
<b> (1240) </B>
<P>
	Clause 10 indicates that employers shall prepare an 
employment equity plan that does this, that and the other thing.
<P>
	Let us look a bit more at this bill which will totally discourage 
private enterprise. It will specify the measure to be taken by the 
employer. It will establish a timetable for the implementation. 
Where under-representation has been identified it will establish 
short term goals. It goes on and on and on.
<P>
	Clause 11: Every employer shall ensure that its employment 
equity plan would, if implemented, constitute reasonable 
progress.
<P>
	Clause 12: Every employer shall make reasonable efforts to 
monitor implementation.
<P>
	Clause 13 indicates that every employer shall update 
numerical goals at least once during the period.
<P>
	Clause 14: Every employer shall consult with his employees 
by inviting representatives to provide their views.
<P>
	It goes on and on and on. Thirty pages of bureaucracy imposed 
on employers around this country. Have I said that they are 
already deluged? Well they certainly are. All these measures 
will only serve to undermine the productivity of Canadian 
business as executives are forced to spend even more of their 
already limited time on needless government paperwork.
<P>
	Clause 21 of the bill creates employment equity compliance 
review officers, or to use a less politically correct term, an 
affirmative action army. This army has the authority to enter any 
business which it feels is contravening the act and demand 
documents and the co-operation of the employer and staff. On 
reading part II of this bill I thought George Orwell would be very 
proud as big brother takes yet another step into our lives.
<P>
	Clause 25 creates the headquarters or the command post for 
the affirmative action army with the establishment of an 
employment equity review tribunal. More bureaucracy and 
more tax dollars dropped into the bottomless pit that is the 
national debt. This government continues to talk fiscal restraint 
yet its actions do not match its words.
<P>
	I would go further into the analysis of this bill but the 
government's haste to ram it through prohibits any more 
thorough examination.
<P>
	In my own riding, residents of the city of Nanaimo are well 
aware of the adverse effects of this type of legislation. Several 
years ago the city implemented pay equity which resulted in an 
immediate and significant tax increase. It also has a lasting 
effect on the taxpayer in that the result is that the annual salary 
for an entry level employee will soon reach $30,000.
<P>
	Another example of this type of policy was brought to my 
attention recently by a constituent. This young man is an 
exceptional student in a technical program at Malaspina 
College. His high marks caused the institute to nominate him for 
a federal scholarship. While his marks qualified him for the 
award, his gender did not.
<P>
	The scholarships are handed out on the basis of gender. Since 
Malaspina did not have a female student with appropriate grades 
the qualified student was refused and both scholarships were 
given to another institution. This is the type of reverse 
discrimination this sort of legislation will create.
<P>
	I will wind up if my time is up. Hiring policies should not be 
based upon race, culture or gender. They should be colour blind 
and gender neutral. If ever a bill epitomizes the difference in 
philosophy between the Liberals and I might even say the NDP 
and the Reform Party, this is it.
<P>
	Canadians are hard pressed for programs they want and they 
cannot afford to pay for programs we do not need. In the 
interests of the already overburdened taxpayers, I urge the 
government to abandon this nonsensical legislation.
<P>
<b> (1245 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it is evident that the member who has just spoken is 
rather ill informed because he has just quoted provisions that 
have been in legislation for over seven years, suggesting to the 
public that they are new provisions, some new burden.
<P>
	I think he has also failed to point out to Canadians that the 
minister has taken the unusual step of giving an extra stage of 
debate on this bill, not curtailing debate, by having this 
discussion in the House before referring it to a committee where 
it will be subject to full, open discussion and consultation and 
will come back to the House for at least two more stages of 
debate. I do not know how much more open a process can be.
<P>
	One of my proudest accomplishments during the last 
Parliament as a member was to be able to move in committee 
and have accepted in this Parliament amendments to the 
Financial Administration Act and the Public Service 
Employment Act that required the Public Service of Canada to 
live by the same rules with respect to employment equity that 
the act imposes on private sector employers.
<P>
	It was done in this simple way, by embarrassing the 
government, by saying for over five years now you have had 
regulations imposed on the private sector that you refuse to live 
by. If we want to set an example as government, we have to be 
prepared to say that there is one set of rules for everybody. If it is 
good enough for the private sector it is good enough for the 
public sector.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8982"> 8982 </A></B>
<P>
	The member should applaud what this bill does. It precisely 
says that there is no longer one legislation for the private sector 
and another for the public sector. We are all going to live by the 
same rules with respect to employment equity.
<P>
	The legislation on employment equity has been in place since 
1987.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Despite considerable progress, most aboriginal people, 
women, members of visible minorities and persons with 
disabilities who do have work continue to have low paying jobs. 
More specifically, employers and employees know they are not 
enjoying the many benefits of employment equity. In fact, 
diversity is a way to enhance the work environment and thus 
increase productivity.
<P>
	By expanding the application of this legislation to the federal 
public service, we will provide many opportunities for persons 
with disabilities, members of visible minorities, aboriginal 
people and women.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Notwithstanding the howls from the Reform members who 
wished to hang on to the privileges that people just like them 
have enjoyed for a long time, this legislation is not about 
introducing bias. This legislation is about removing bias in 
hiring and retention of employees and in promotion. This is not 
about abandoning the merit principle. It is about reaffirming and 
fulfilling the merit principle.
<P>
	For 75 years we have had in the Government of Canada the 
principle that you get hired on the basis of your ability and no 
other. Despite that we have a senior management category with 
less than 18 per cent women. There are the lower echelons of the 
lowest paid workers, 80 per cent women. Even within those 
lowest paid categories, guess who rises to the top in those lowest 
paid categories? It is not the 80 per cent of employees in those 
categories who are women, but mostly men.
<P>
	There are numerous examples. We only have to look at the 
statistics of the number of referrals for employment in the 
public service last year; for example, 8.2 per cent referrals for 
positions. These were people who had already been screened as 
qualified. There were 8.1 per cent of a visible minority, but only 
2.5 per cent of hirings were of a visible minority. There is a bias 
operating there and we have to take a great deal more time than 
we have today to look at why that is.
<P>
<b> (1250) </B>
<P>
	Let me touch some highlights. There are perceptions and 
attitudes: ``I have always seen a certain kind of person succeed 
and fit well into management and therefore that is the kind of 
person I want to hire''. These are not deliberately, consciously 
biased attitudes but they are attitudes that clearly influence who 
gets hired, who gets the opportunities to train, to get promoted, 
to get career development opportunities.
<P>
	It affects the other side in terms of who applies. We apply for 
jobs where we see ourselves fitting in and succeeding. 
Unfortunately most women, most aboriginal people, most 
people with disabilities, most people from visible minority 
groups have not seen themselves being hired and progressing to 
the upper echelons in the public service.
<P>
	The working environment creates an atmosphere in which one 
either flourishes or does not. Our working environment has not 
been conducive to people of different backgrounds being hired, 
being promoted, fitting in well and moving up the ranks.
<P>
	We know that in a time of downsizing it is going to be 
extremely difficult to achieve some of our targets in the public 
service, to really move to a public service that is more 
representative of the taxpayers of Canada and of the people we 
serve. We all know that understanding our clients is an 
important part of being able to serve them well.
<P>
	We have to make this effort notwithstanding hiring freezes, 
downsizing and so on. Twenty-five hundred people were hired 
in the public service last year. There were tens of thousands of 
promotions, movements, development appointments, and that is 
where we can certainly make some progress.
<P>
	I mentioned this bill will be going to committee. We are not 
here to debate even approval in principle of the bill. The 
minister has chosen to forego that, to get that whole issue in 
front of a committee for examination of the bill, so it can save 
the time and money of duplicating effort to consider a bill and 
also to conduct a review of the existing act.
<P>
	I want to make some suggestions to the committee as it 
receives this bill and considers it. I really have a hard time 
justifying to myself why the armed forces, the RCMP and CSIS 
are exempted from this legislation unless they are included later 
by order in council. I am sure there are private sector employers 
who have equally valid reasons to feel they should be exempted, 
but we have chosen not to do that. I urge the committee to look at 
that.
<P>
	I urge the committee to look at defining compliance and to 
ensure that compliance is not simply depositing a report. I urge 
the committee to look at contracting, because we are now 
developing a shadow public service through contracting that has 
no obligation to pay attention to the merit principle or to 
employment equity or to a number of other government policies. 
Let me cite one case. I am aware of a man and a woman 
employed through a government agency to do exactly the same 
kind of work with exactly the same kind of qualifications. 
Earning a $100 difference, guess who was earning the lesser 
amount?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8983"> 8983 </A></B>
<P>
	The purpose here is improving, giving everybody the 
opportunity to participate fully in the economic recovery this 
country is heading into. I want to point out that we are talking 
here not about privileges for minorities. We are talking about 
equal treatment. Unless the Reform Party cares to make the 
argument that inherently women, people of colour, people with 
disabilities, aboriginal peoples are less capable, then it can only 
accept the reason they have not progressed in the public service 
or in the private sector is some inherent preference for a 
different kind of candidate.
<P>
	We are talking about the majority of Canadian workers and 
giving that majority who fit in one of these categories equal 
opportunity to succeed and to prosper in the Canada of the 
future.
<P>
<b> (1255) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, it is 
with pleasure that I rise today to speak on Bill C-64. The 
purpose of this bill is to achieve equality in the workplace and to 
correct conditions of disadvantage experienced by certain 
groups, including women, aboriginal peoples, persons with 
disabilities and members of visible minorities.
<P>
	This new act will replace the existing act, which was passed in 
1986. It will apply to federally regulated employers and Crown 
corporations that employ one hundred or more employees.
<P>
	The bill will extend the scope of the legislation to include the 
public service of Canada. It is a good idea to extend the scope of 
such a major piece of legislation. Perhaps it should be extended 
to all employers in the private sector, all employers in the public 
service of Canada and all portions of the public sector that 
employ not 100, but 75 employees, including the Canadian 
Armed Forces, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Parliament 
and every federally regulated agency, commission and board.
<P>
	The legislation requires the employer to implement 
employment equity by either eliminating barriers against 
persons in designated groups or by making such reasonable 
accommodations as will ensure that these persons achieve a 
degree of representation that reflects their representation in the 
Canadian workforce.
<P>
	However, the obligation to implement employment equity 
does not require an employer to take measures that would cause 
him or her undue hardship.
<P>
	This means that the employer is free to comply or not. With 
the help of legal counsel, the employer can easily demonstrate 
that hiring a person with a disability, for example, will cause 
undue hardship. The onus will rest with the employee. Who will 
dare challenge an employer who does not comply with the act?
<P>
	We cannot say that much progress have been made in terms of 
employment equity since 1970, after the Commission of Inquiry 
on the Status of Women in Canada tabled its report. In fact, 
hardly any progress has been made.
<P>
	Later attempts, in 1984 and 1986, were scarcely more 
successful. In 1993, aboriginal people accounted for some 2 per 
cent of the federal public service workforce; persons with 
disabilities, 3 per cent; members of visible minorities, 3 per 
cent, and women, 46 per cent, but were confined in lower-paid 
and precarious jobs.
<P>
	Women account for only 17 per cent of the executive group, 
while the disabled, Natives and visible minorities have not yet 
reached the executive level. Representation is almost nil. The 
majority of them hold office, sales or service jobs.
<P>
	It is too little too late, as the new legislation does not set any 
specific objectives for the department. Everything is left to the 
minister's discretion. This is a government panicked by 
unemployment, an increasingly challenged social program 
reform, phoney pre-budget consultations, casual budget 
preparation, cuts in essential services instead of fat-trimming, a 
caucus divided on several issues, including the Young Offenders 
Act, the firearms registration legislation, the amendment to the 
Canadian Charter prohibiting any form of discrimination based 
on sexual orientation, whether or not Quebec members should 
get involved in Quebec's referendum debate, the next Cabinet 
shuffle where many are called but few are chosen, and an 
anti-scab bill which is not forthcoming. I could go on and on 
about the differences of opinion within the Liberal caucus only a 
year after they came to office.
<P>
<b> (1300) </B>
<P>
	So the government tried to regain its prestige by introducing a 
bill. This employment equity bill, however, still creates 
dissension, the minister aiming for the status quo while other 
members join the Bloc Quebecois in asking the government to 
broaden the scope of the Employment Equity Act.
<P>
	The guiding principle of the bill should be that anyone 
working for, subsidized by or doing business with the federal 
government or one of its boards, agencies or commissions is 
subject to the bill. We must go further. Employment equity 
policies should have been adopted a long time ago.
<P>
	The minister thinks he can meet his objectives while the 
federal government is cutting its workforce. He will have 
trouble carrying out his plans in this era of cutbacks and hiring 
freezes. The minister's pensive expression in this morning's 
newspapers explains everything. In addition to the reform being 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8984"> 8984 </A></B>
<P>
challenged, he is now faced with a bill showing his intention to 
maintain the status quo.
<P>
	A sovereign Quebec will defend vigorously equal 
opportunities for women, disabled, natives, visible minorities 
and men.
<P>
	These groups are still far from occupying their rightful places 
and enjoying the same conditions in most areas of public life. A 
higher proportion of these groups live in poverty. Their income 
remains lower than that of men, in general.
<P>
	A sovereign Quebec will resolutely fight poverty by going to 
the root of the problem. Yes, it is possible to break the vicious 
circle of poverty and dependency, provided we increase 
employability without making distinctions between categories 
of people.
<P>
	Why do we have to implement an act to restore a natural right? 
These people are victims of the current political system, with its 
inconsistent tax measures affecting the groups targeted by this 
bill, and duplication, because two levels of government operate 
in fields such as manpower training and family support.
<P>
	Through sovereignty, Quebec will be able to patriate and 
restructure programs, so as to develop an efficient and 
consistent policy for these groups, namely women, aboriginal 
and disabled people, as well as visible minorities.
<P>
	It goes without saying that the scope of the act must be 
extended. The federal government must really take concrete 
action regarding this depressing climate of discrimination 
experienced by women and the other groups targeted in the 
legislation. This part of our labour force has the right to take its 
place. We must strive to achieve equality and social justice. This 
is why the Bloc will introduce amendments to this bill, when it is 
examined in committee.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Roger Simmons (Burin-St. George's, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I too want an opportunity to elaborate on some features 
of the legislation before us. I say to the minister that I am proud 
the government has tabled such progressive amendments that I 
believe will strengthen the Employment Equity Act.
<P>
<b> (1305) </B>
<P>
	The changes proposed will assure fair and equal treatment for 
millions of disadvantaged Canadians. These amendments offer 
the hope of better times for women, for persons with disabilities, 
for aboriginal peoples and for members of visible minorities.
<P>
	Since the adoption of the Employment Equity Act there has 
been significant progress in making the workplace more 
inclusive of all Canadians. It has been proven that employment 
equity can promote fairness and equal opportunity in the world 
of work. The present legislation was a good beginning but has 
not kept pace with the times, and hence the need for the 
amendments now before us.
<P>
	More and more Canadians are members of designated groups, 
yet the sad fact is that despite the increase in their numbers their 
opportunities have actually decreased. For example, the latest 
annual report on employment equity indicates that in 1993 the 
number of employees covered under the Employment Equity 
Act actually dropped by 4.27 per cent or by 26,000 jobs across 
the country.
<P>
	According to the statistics for 1994, 74 of the 348 companies 
covered under the Employment Equity Act 74 or 20 per cent had 
no aboriginal employees at all. There were 65 of those 
companies with no provision for persons with disabilities on the 
payroll and 28 of those companies had no visible minority 
members working for them. There were still four employers 
with no women on their staffs. This is in a country where 52 per 
cent of the people are women.
<P>
	Can we fathom any company of any significant size not even 
bothering to address that question? Were I malicious-and you 
would know, Madam Speaker, that I could never be 
malicious-I would wonder aloud whether such an exclusion of 
women by those four companies was not deliberate. How could 
they manage in a situation where half the available workforce is 
women to hire everyone but women unless they worked at it? 
Hence the need for the kinds of amendments we are talking 
about today.
<P>
	Obviously much more remains to be done if we are to live up 
to the values of fairness, decency and equality which form the 
foundation of our society, our system of values in the country.
<P>
	We need to bring the act into the nineties to reflect our current 
reality and to prepare us for the century ahead. That is precisely 
the kind of country we as a party promised Canadians when we 
wrote ``Creating Opportunity''.
<P>
	The amendments before us are the fulfilment of our red book 
commitments. We said that we would bring the federal public 
service as well as federal agencies and commissions under the 
Employment Equity Act. We are doing that with this legislation. 
We said that we would empower the Canadian Human Rights 
Commission to initiate investigations and conduct workplace 
audits to ensure enforcement of the legislation. We are doing 
that. We said that we would ensure federal contractors would be 
subject to mandatory compliance with the principles of the act.

	<B>Mr. Simmons:</B> The member for St. Albert is having difficulty 
because he sees quotas. I say to him that he is in the House of 
Commons because of a quota system. We did not just go out to

The act which gives him the right to be here is a quota system as 
such. His constituents in St. Albert get one member of Parlia-

ment,  not one and half, two or three. I say to him that is called 
quota.
<P>
	He is right. He must have been up bright and early this 
morning. He recognizes this business here as a quota system and 
he is absolutely dead right. I assume from his intervention that 
he is so anxious to support the legislation he cannot wait for me 
to finish.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> He must be. I can tell.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simmons:</B> He must be. With the bill we will deliver on 
the promises in the red book. Does that come as any surprise?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Not a bit.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simmons:</B> Once again the authors of the red book are 
delivering on the promises in the red book.
<P>
	We used to sing in the church I am proud to be a member of: 
``Every promise in the book is mine''. We are talking about 
another book here. I do not want to be sacrilegious, but I am sure 
members get the point. We identify with those promises because 
they are promises we fabricated in opposition having listened to 
the people and without any 1-900 lines. We did not have them 
pay to get through to us. We listened and they told us they had 
some concerns about employment equity, our subject today.
<P>
	We heard them and we incorporated those concerns in 
commitments. We ran on that basis. We were elected to a 
majority government on that basis. We are back here this 
afternoon as we have been several other mornings and 
afternoons to say to the people of Canada: ``Here is another 
example of how we want to honour the commitments we made to 
you back in October a year or so ago''.
<P>
	While today we deliver on some promises, we believe we 
must go even further. The Canadian Human Rights Tribunal, 
constituted as the employment equity review tribunal, will hear 
appeals from employers to resolve disputes and to assure 
compliance with the law.
<P>
	Let me remind the House that the changes to the act are in 
direct response to issues raised by both the designated groups 
and by businesses. Disadvantaged Canadians complained to us 
there was not enough compliance with the legislation. 
Accordingly we have given new authority to the Canadian 
Human Rights Commission to conduct audits of employers to 
verify and gain compliance with the act.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Quotas.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simmons:</B> For my friend from St. Albert, let me decode 
that. We have given new authority to the Human Rights 
Commission to enforce those terrible quotas, the very system 
that sent him to the Chamber. We are going to enforce it on 
behalf of some other people, many of whom are his constituents.
<P>
	I venture to say there are some women in his riding who could 
benefit from the legislation, women who have been excluded 
effectively from employment because of some unwitting 
employer. Maybe he has some aboriginal people in his riding. I 
do not know it well but there are probably a few of them who 
could benefit.
<P>
	I see the Chair is getting impatient because I am running the 
clock again. I had all these other wonderful things I wanted to 
say for the edification of members of the House. More to the 
point, I say to all who are watching and listening that the 
legislation is a good piece of legislation. It will take us that extra 
step toward assuring employment equity for the designated 
groups, for the women I have mentioned and for other groups 
that were mentioned during the debate. That is why I appeal to 
my colleagues of whatever party to find it in their hearts and 
minds to give support to this good piece of legislation.
<P>
<b> (1315) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, since this is a very new piece of legislation, for the 
benefit of those Canadians who watch the proceedings of the 
House of Commons and I know there are a number, I would like 
to go over one more time what the legislation is about.
<P>
	This is Bill C-64. It is an act respecting employment equity. 
The summary says that the purpose of this bill is to achieve 
equality in the workplace and to correct conditions of 
disadvantage experienced by certain groups. The bill applies to 
the Public Service of Canada, to federally regulated employers, 
and to such portions of the public sector that employs 100 or 
more employees.
<P>
	The bill talks about employer obligations in clauses 5 to 15; 
records and reports, a rather ominous sound for a lot of 
employers, in clauses 16 to 20; compliance audit in clauses 21 to 
31; assessment of monetary penalties in clauses 31 to 37; and 
regulations in clauses 38 to 41. It then talks about changes to 
other acts that will be necessitated by this legislation should it 
be passed.
<P>
	This is fairly significant legislation with real impact on a 
number of employers in our country.
<P>
	It important to point out that the word equity which is the 
feature of this legislation simply means fairness. Government 
members have been playing the violin a great deal this morning 
about how wonderfully fair this is and how we should all be 
committed to fairness. I am sure that every single Canadian 
would applaud fairness in our country. In fact something that 
Canadians are noted for is a real commitment to fairness.
<P>
	On behalf of the people of Canada whom we represent and 
whose affairs we are supposed to be managing we need to 
analyse whether this legislation delivers on the promise of 
fairness.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8986"> 8986 </A></B>
<P>
	One of the real problems with this legislation is that what it 
does is unfairly and to a large degree increase the interference of 
government in the lives of citizens, particularly in the lives of 
citizens trying to keep businesses going, and trying to deliver 
jobs for Canadians.
<P>
	First of all this legislation interferes with employment 
choices. It suggests that for every sector of employment there 
has to be proportional representation in four designated groups. 
It says to employers that they have to hire certain people from 
certain groups if they are to comply with these government 
legislated proposals. That is a clear interference in fairness for 
employers to be able to hire who they think will do the best job 
for them.
<P>
	Second, it interferes in the principle of equality before the 
law. What it essentially says is that you do not have as equal a 
chance at a job as you would if you belonged to one of four 
designated groups.
<P>
	I had a personal experience in my riding with a young man 
who was trying to be admitted into the RCMP. His applications 
were denied until in discussions with his family he discovered 
that he had some aboriginal background. Because of this 
suddenly he became more qualified to enter the RCMP. In fact 
today he is a member of the RCMP. It is very interesting how 
merit, qualifications and choices depend on certain genetic 
traits rather than merit. That certainly is not consistent with the 
principle of equality before the law.
<P>
<b> (1320) </B>
<P>
	Third, the legislation interferes with the administration of 
business in the country. This legislation and all employers that 
will be affected by it, which is a vastly expanded group, should 
look at this very carefully. I am sure they will be. They will now 
have to produce employment plans to satisfy certain criteria.
<P>
	There will have to be regular reports to bureaucrats who will 
be very anxiously combing them to make sure they are correct 
and fulfil all the obligations. There will be compliance audits on 
a regular basis of these businesses to make sure employers are 
doing the correct thing.
<P>
	There may be some appeals from bureaucratic decisions that 
come out of these reports and audits. There will be an 
ever-expanding group of regulations that will have to be 
complied with. It is no wonder that businesses are fatigued and 
why job creation is lagging behind the demand for it. With all 
this paperwork, regulations, proposals and requirements, how 
can a business get on with business? Some days you wonder.
<P>
	Also this legislation sets out a great deal more bureaucracy. 
This is a time when governments do a great deal of their work 
with borrowed money, by mortgaging our future and here we 
have yet another bureaucracy set up in the furtherance of 
fairness.
<P>
	Nowhere in the legislation are the cost benefits set out. 
Nowhere in the legislation are Canadians told how this is all 
going to be paid for. It is their money that is being  spent. They 
have a right to ask, is the money I am being asked to cough up for 
this proposal justified by the public good that is going to be 
done. That is an issue that needs to be debated.
<P>
	Clearly it is going to be an interference in productivity of 
business. This is another regulatory and governmental burden 
being added to all the other reports that have to be made by 
businesses to government. It is another government regulation, 
another interference into the lives and work of business people.
<P>
	If we want to provide Canadians with jobs, jobs, jobs how are 
we going to do it when we have all of these social engineering 
mechanisms built into our economic sector? Does this make 
sense and does it really benefit Canadians?
<P>
	The last thing I would like to talk about is the social 
consequences of this type of legislation. Unfortunately it says to 
Canadians what is important in the economic sector is not your 
qualifications, it is not your merit, it is not your competence, it 
is not your ability, it is not your drive, it is whether you are a 
victim. It is what group you belong to. It is whether you can 
show somehow that you are disadvantaged. Is this what we want 
people to be thinking about?
<P>
	I understand that Tommy Douglas was not very tall. I have 
always felt really good about him because of that for some 
obvious reasons to people in the House. Sometimes Mr. Douglas 
was teased about the fact that he was not very tall. He had a good 
answer to this. He used to say: ``Where I come from, we measure 
people from here up'', indicating that it is what is in your mind, 
what is in your head, your intelligence, ability and competence 
that is important. It is not your height.
<P>
	I would suggest to members that what is important to us is 
what we have in our hearts and our ability and not what colour 
our skin is, what our gender is or what disability we might 
have-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sorry to interrupt 
the hon. member.
<P>
<b> (1325 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am delighted to speak to this bill before the House, an 
act respecting the Employment Equity Act.
<P>
	I support the bill because the principles for which it stands are 
very sound. Moreover we anticipate that the provisions and the 
regulations that will emanate following the study of this bill will 
be sound in practice as well.
<P>
	In essence, the Employment Equity Act is challenging us to 
put into practice the principles that describe the core values of 
Canada. The values about which we are speaking relate to the 
merit principle, to excellence, to human dignity, to respect, to 
the very core values that Canadians hold dear, to fairness and 
equality.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8987"> 8987 </A></B>
<P>
	I heard earlier there was concern that we would only address 
the victims as though the victims have no talents, as though the 
victims have no competence, as though the victims have no 
excellence. The very essence of the Employment Equity Act is 
to hold very high the principle of excellence and merit above all 
else, irrespective of colour, irrespective of gender, irrespective 
of disability and irrespective of origin as a people.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Not in this bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pagtakhan:</B> Yes it is. It is about equity. It is about the 
equitable representation of those with talents in the workforce 
because for a generation Canada has failed. Therefore, the 
Liberal government of the past and the Liberal government of 
today are again trying to reinforce the fundamental principles 
that govern this bill.
<P>
	In the process of addressing the legislation, I would like to 
reiterate that the bill can be looked on as a legislative 
centrepiece of our core Canadian social values, social equity 
among all of us.
<P>
	I have mentioned the operative principles of the bill. What 
does it achieve, we may ask. I submit that we will achieve 
effective utilization of one's talents and one's skills. It will 
ensure businesses will provide better client service and 
therefore better and good business for the employers. By 
achieving this we will create harmony among all of us. There 
will be no feeling of being a second class citizen because of 
one's disability, colour, gender or aboriginal origin.
<P>
	Who will question, and why should we question, if we can 
enhance the maximum productivity of all peoples with talents, 
that we should not utilize them and get them into the workforce, 
by applying the principle of fairness.
<P>
	I submit that by adopting the principles of this bill we will be 
able to benefit not only the designated groups as defined in the 
bill, not only the visible minorities, not only the people with 
disabilities, not only women, not only aboriginal people. We 
will benefit everyone. Therefore, this is a bill for all Canadians 
to consider.
<P>
	That is why the bill has seen to it that in addition to the private 
sector, the public sector will now be covered so that the 
government is setting a model. To ensure that we give teeth to 
what we believe, to ensure that we give enforcement to what we 
would like to happen, the Canadian Human Rights Commission 
will be mandated to have this authority.
<P>
	However, the work of the Human Rights Commission will not 
be in an adversarial fashion. It will be done within the spirit of 
co-operation and collaboration.
<P>
<b> (1330 ) </B>
<P>
	Therefore when we see our armed forces, the RCMP, our 
security intelligence service agency being covered under the 
act, to me this is a social blessing and the time has come. It will 
ensure that we achieve the purpose for which this act was first 
enacted, to ensure employers achieve a workforce that is 
equitable and representative of the four designated groups.
<P>
	As chair of the Standing Committee on Human Rights and the 
Status of Disabled Persons to which this act will be referred by 
the House, I am delighted to serve on that committee. Our 
committee will ensure that there will be open and inclusive 
discussion and participation of all, that any matter referred to in 
the bill will be addressed, utilizing a wide consultation.
<P>
	We would like to hear from all groups concerned. We would 
like to hear from the minister, from the department officials, 
from departments of government that are involved in the 
delivery of this program. We will invite the opposition to 
articulate its views to us on this issue, so that together we can 
shape a truly equitable Employment Equity Act.
<P>
	In closing, I am delighted to support this bill because it 
reinforces a core Canadian value, the principle of social justice 
for all.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to speak on Bill C-64. It seems to me after having gone 
through the bill the thought police are out in force again. Here 
we have big government which is going to impose its will on 
employers, telling them not what they shall make but who they 
shall hire and in what numbers and so on, rather than allowing 
the free marketplace to decide who shall qualify for the job.
<P>
	Looking at the bill concerning the purpose of the act, this is 
the double speak that the whole act tries to get around. It starts 
off by saying:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The purpose of this act is to achieve equality in the workplace so that no 
person shall be denied employment opportunities or benefits for reasons 
unrelated to ability-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Unrelated to ability, nobody shall be denied. Then it goes on 
after a while to say:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-employment equity means more than treating persons in the same way but 
also requires special measures and the accommodation of differences.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It starts off with the great idea that merit is number one. This 
country did not get to where it is today, apart from being up to its 
eyes in debt, through mediocrity, quotas and minimum 
standards. It got here by trying harder, working harder, reaching 
for better things, hoping for the best for our children, rather than 
settling down for quotas and less than the best that we can offer.
<P>
	When I intervened, one of previous Liberal speakers admitted 
that while this act says nothing about quotas, it is quotas they are 
talking about. He actually admitted right out front and was quite 
candid when he said quotas are what this bill is all about. Merit 
is being compromised.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8988"> 8988 </A></B>
<P>
	When I go through the bill I again find this double speak 
where it tries to be all things to all people. Let us remember that 
it is talking about various groups, women, natives, visible 
minorities and the handicapped. Add all of these together. We 
have women making up 50 per cent of our population. Then add 
on the male handicapped, male visible minorities and male 
aboriginals. We are talking about a significant majority, not a 
minority, covered by this bill. A small minority are going to be 
asked to step aside even though they are the best qualified; step 
aside although they are motivated; step aside even if they have 
family responsibilities so that somebody else who is less 
qualified, less able, less motivated can take over and move 
ahead.
<P>
<b> (1335) </B>
<P>
	Going right back to the beginning where the bill says that no 
person shall be denied employment opportunities for the reasons 
unrelated to ability, that is exactly what we have.
<P>
	We can take a look at the rather ridiculous items in the bill. 
Clause 5 states every employer shall implement employment 
equity by identifying and eliminating employment barriers 
against persons in designated groups that result in employer's 
employment systems, policies and practices that are not 
authorized by law to ensure that we have this spectrum.
<P>
	I think about sports. I think about the Olympics, this huge 
competition recognized around the world where we go out and 
find the best that we can find. There are no quotas there. It does 
not say that there has to be so many of one group or another 
group. We take pride in finding the best that we can find and we 
match these against others around the world. If we find that 
somebody else beats our Canadian competitors we say let us try 
harder so that next time we may win.
<P>
	Surely that is the essence of any type of employment, any type 
of endeavour in this life where we say let me be the best that I 
can be.
<P>
	If this bill had said let us take a look at the education that 
keeps back some people, be they an identifiable minority or not, 
surely we have an obligation to help these people to achieve the 
education and the motivational standards to allow them to 
compete rather than clamping down on those who do have the 
education, who do have the motivation, who do have the will and 
are prepared to work harder. Why are we putting a lid on them to 
elevate the others artificially? Why do we not give those who 
feel that they are disadvantaged a helping hand through 
education and developing that commitment and motivation so 
that when they enter the workforce they can compete on an equal 
basis?
<P>
	Surely that is what it is about. We do not discriminate in 
sports. We go out and find the best we can find. It would be 
ludicrous if we thought that Canada was to apply some kind of 
quota system so that we would always lose. Do not worry, the the 
thought police will be happy  because we ensured that all groups 
were represented at the competition.
<P>
	This is big government wielding a big stick on employers. It is 
as if government thought that employers were incapable of 
doing it themselves. I think about a newsletter that I subscribe to 
out of the United States, not in Canada. We do not find these 
things in Canada. There are employment equity programs in the 
United States that have been forced on federally funded 
organizations, as this bill is trying to do here.
<P>
	There is a small college in Michigan that said it will not 
comply. It may be thought these people are a bunch of bigots 
because they do not want to comply, they do not want to fill out 
the forms, they do not want to ask people which category they fit 
into, are they on the bottom rung so they have to help them, are 
they on the middle rung so they give them a little less helping up, 
are they on the top rung so they keep them down. They said they 
do not want to participate in that type of stuff. The government 
said if they are in receipt of federal funds they must, but they 
said no.
<P>
<b> (1340) </B>
<P>
	They were cut off federal funds. Some may think that serves 
them right. That college was the first to issue a degree to a 
woman in the United States in 1860 and the first college to issue 
a degree to a coloured person in the 1870s. One hundred years 
later when the government gets around to saying they have to in 
order to get employment equity or hiring equity or education 
equity going and have to fill out the forms, they say they have 
been doing that for a hundred years.
<P>
	They do it on merit. They do not care if you are a woman or a 
man or if you are coloured or not coloured, but if you have the 
motivation and the desire to succeed, regardless of who you are 
or what you are they want to help you. They were doing that a 
hundred years ago voluntarily, long before the Department of 
Health, Education and Welfare in the United States used the big 
stick of government to force it down people's throats.
<P>
	It can be done to education. We do not stand here as the 
Reform Party saying we want to keep people down. We do not 
want to keep anybody down but we do not want to classify 
people and ask which group they fit into. If you are here in this 
country as a Canadian then that is all that is required and we say 
let us help these people forward through education and let us not 
impose penalties on the minority to help the majority.

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Eleni Bakopanos (Saint-Denis, Lib.):</B> Madam

and to show my colleagues and all Canadians that we can trust 
the government to keep its promises.

<P>
	The red book mentions a future when all citizens, irrespective 
of race, gender or physical or intellectual capacity, will enjoy an 
equal standard of living and quality of life.
<P>
	The bill before the House today will help ensure this will 
happen. In fact, we will reinforce the Employment Equity Act so 
that it also covers the public service and federal commissions 
and agencies. The Canadian Human Rights Commission will be 
given the power to conduct audits and enforce this legislation. 
Employers who do business with the federal government will be 
required to comply with the principle of the Act. By reinforcing 
the Employment Equity Act, the government is acting to 
promote its concept of Canada according to which all citizens 
must have an equal opportunity to share in Canada's prosperity.
<P>
	The existing Employment Equity Act has been instrumental 
in making Canadians aware of the need to identify and eliminate 
barriers to the employment of designated groups.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	For all the many milestones that have been achieved since its 
inception, however, there are still millions of Canadians who 
have yet to enjoy its benefits. Women, visible minorities, 
aboriginal people and persons with disabilities continue to face 
enormous barriers to employment which prevent them from 
achieving their full potential.
<P>
	As my colleagues pointed out earlier, a substantial number of 
companies covered by the act fail to satisfy the legislation's 
mandate, 171 of 348 firms. Almost half of the companies 
reporting last year did not have women, persons with 
disabilities, aboriginal peoples or visible minorities represented 
in their workforce.
<P>
	Too much of Canadian history has been blemished through 
such inequality among Canadians. It is time to write a new 
chapter in the evolution of employment equity.
<P>
	In rewriting the law we are renewing our faith in the 
fundamental values that shape Canadian society, fairness, 
decency and justice for all. By renewing the legislation we will 
clarify employer obligations and strengthen employee 
opportunities. We are determined to strike a better balance that 
works to the advantage of all Canadians.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	For the first time in Canada, public and private sector 
employers will be on an equal footing. The Public Service will 
be subject to the same rules as the private sector. All employers 
will be required to reflect the diversity of Canada's population 
in their labour force. We will extend the scope of the legislation 
to include the Canadian Armed Forces, the Royal Canadian 
Mounted Police and the Canadian Security Intelligence Service.
<P>
<b> (1345) </B>
<P>
	The legislation will also apply to employers who do business 
with the federal government, which means that from now on 
they will have to comply with the principle of the Employment 
Equity Act. This legislation will also give new responsibilities 
to the Canadian Human Rights Commission. The commission 
will have the authority to conduct audits in the workplace in 
order to force employers to comply with the Act.
<P>
	The commission will also be empowered to take corrective 
action as needed. In cases of non compliance, the commission 
may refer the case to an employment equity review tribunal, 
whose decisions could be mandatory.
<P>
	To balance the commission's regulatory authority, employers 
who wish to challenge its decisions will have a chance to plead 
their case before the tribunal.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The legislation clearly stipulates that tribunal rulings will not 
cause undue hardship for employers or require them to hire or 
promote unqualified individuals.
<P>
	The amendments are also purposely designated not to 
increase the paper burden to employers. They are meant to act as 
an impetus, not an impediment to economic growth and job 
creation.
<P>
	Enlightened Canadian employers are rapidly discovering for 
themselves that employment equity is a bonus in the workplace. 
Diversity is proving to be a competitive advantage in an 
increasingly complex global economy. Given demographic 
trends, employers have every reason to want to capitalize on the 
wealth of untapped talent in the designated groups.
<P>
	By the year 2000, when Canada will experience a skill 
shortage caused by an aging population, two-thirds of 
newcomers to the workforce will be women, visible minorities, 
aboriginal people and persons with disabilities. Canadian 
employers cannot afford to overlook this vast labour pool any 
longer.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	All Canadians will benefit as a result of this legislation, 
because its purpose is to ensure that all Canadians will have 
equal access to employment opportunities and advancement.
<P>
	The bill before the House today states that workers are to be 
hired and promoted on the basis of ability. It provides that 
ability and merit must be taken into account to ensure 
employment equity, which can only improve the quality of our 
labour force.
<P>
	In fact, employment equity is closely linked to social security 
reform. Social and economic progress cannot be dissociated 
from job creation and the integration of disadvantaged persons 
in the community.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8990"> 8990 </A></B>
<P>
	The changes proposed in this bill are necessary, reasonable 
and fair.
<P>
	We are convinced that an improved Employment Equity Act 
will give employers an opportunity to create more efficient and 
more effective workplaces.
<P>
	In fact, these improvements will promote tolerance and 
respect for diversity and encourage a better appreciation of the 
rich diversity of our communities.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I commend the minister for his decision to send this piece of 
legislation to committee. I wish to cite some of my own 
experiences with the public service in Quebec where some 
legislation has been adopted.
<P>
	L'Office des ressources humaines was faced with a target of 
12 per cent hiring for members of the cultural communities 
visible minorities. The public service was unable to attain this 
level. We might ask why it was unable to attain this level, even 
though it was a promise made by the former Liberal government 
of that province.
<P>
	The reason, after years of studies and years of reports, was 
that there was systemic discrimination. In other words, visible 
minorities, members of cultural communities, women and the 
handicapped were barred by a system that did not have the types 
of measures in it that would allow access to promotions or even 
to jobs within that system.
<P>
<b> (1350) </B>
<P>
	Many members opposite said that the merit principle has been 
forgotten and used words like reverse discrimination. My 
experience has led me to believe the proposals we are presenting 
will require that we succeed in removing the deep rooted 
systemic biases that exist in any system, especially in the public 
service.
<P>
	We also need to assure that the Human Rights Commission 
will have the resources and the authority to ensure compliance 
with the legislation presented to the House.
<P>
	Finally, with respect to downsizing, cuts will be made in many 
areas. I hope the groups we are discussing today will not be 
unduly hardshipped by the downsizing that is taking place at the 
moment, because a lot of them were newly arrived to the present 
system and are on contracts.
<P>
	Our public service must reflect the reality of Canada. It must 
be representative of all the components of our society. We are 
not talking about merit here. Are hon. members on the other side 
of the House saying there are no qualified individuals in any of 
these four groups? Are there no women, no visible minorities, 
no handicapped people, no native people who are qualified for 
these positions? I doubt that reflects the reality. In fact there are 
many of them. However there is enough systemic discrimination 
in the system, enough biases in the system not to allow these 
qualified individuals to have access to our public service.
<P>
	I would like the hon. members to take these facts into 
consideration.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sharon Hayes (Port Moody-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to rise today as a Reform member 
on the standing committee on human rights to address the 
government's proposed legislation to extend employment 
equity.
<P>
	Bill C-64, an act respecting employment equity as tabled by 
the human resources minister yesterday, reflects the 
government's disregard for proper process in its presentation 
and the government's ongoing folly of spending non-existent 
public money to undermine the job creation abilities of 
Canadians and to create further division and social pressure 
among competing groups of otherwise talented and proud 
Canadians. I am delighted to take the opportunity to expand on 
these tenets.
<P>
	Today much discussion has been shared in the House on the 
pros and cons of such a program. The rhetoric and mixed 
messages become confusing. In response I take a moment to 
consider how employment equity measures up to three basic and 
clear philosophies I believe the vast majority of Canadians 
would welcome and support.
<P>
	According at least to the red book, Liberals too would agree, 
first, that deficit reduction is a major priority. They have agreed 
that billions of dollars in government spending must be cut to 
accomplish it. Second, Canada must have a credible place in the 
global economy. To quote from the red book:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The federal government can and should support and facilitate the national 
effort to prepare Canadians to compete in the world.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Third is the equality of opportunity, and again I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Governments should support a framework of fundamental fairness and 
decency within which Canadians are able to pursue their individual goals.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Let us hold up the existing proposals of the bill against such a 
benchmark. It is not in viewing things in isolation but against a 
true measure that we can separate pretence from fact.
<P>
	Even the present Liberal government is finally recognizing 
the debt and deficit are a major threat to Canada's present 
situation and future potential. Current government policy has 
finally recognized the connection between fiscal recklessness 
and unemployment, between high indebtedness and the loss of 
economic and fiscal sovereignty.
<P>
	In a recent release from the Department of Finance entitled 
``Creating a Healthy Fiscal Climate'', the government now 
seems to realize that the deficit problem cannot be addressed 
without a clear priorization of federal spending. Budgetary 
actions ``should weigh toward reductions in expenditures''. 
Choices must be made between high and low priority items.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="8991"> 8991 </A></B>
<P>
	Although as Reformers we believe their 3 per cent target to be 
totally inadequate, it has become apparent in public debate that 
even for that goal billions must be cut, which will demand cuts 
to some untouchable programs.
<P>
	The first question I ask is: Should the added expense of 
broadening employment equity be a top priority in the mind of a 
budget balancing government? We must keep in mind that 
employment equity already exists as a policy across all public 
service within the Public Service Act.
<P>
	Bill C-64 will mandate that approach in law though the 
Treasury Board now refuses to try to estimate the cost of the 
existing policy.
<P>
<b> (1355) </B>
<P>
	Does this imply that such a policy has been immune from the 
departmental review process demanded by the government in 
recent months? Does this imply that the policy of employment 
equity is so philosophically important it takes priority over 
federal downsizing or even some social programs? Is this so 
necessary as to be deemed untouchable in government 
operations even before it comes before Canadians for 
discussion? If so, who did the government listen to in order to 
come to that conclusion.
<P>
	A Gallup poll conducted last December showed that the 
majority of Canadians accept the concept of equality in the 
workplace. However 81 per cent of Canadians oppose numerical 
hiring goals and 90 per cent oppose exclusionary job 
competition. The government is also ignoring the fact that 74 
per cent of those surveyed are definitely opposed to government 
equity programs.
<P>
	In response to the government's mantra of jobs, jobs, jobs, 
how will this priority program affect Canada's long term 
viability in the important world markets? The purpose of the act 
is the explicit encouragement of employers to discriminate in 
favour of targeted groups over all other employees, largely 
white able-bodied males.
<P>
	No matter how we look at it, the establishment of numerical 
goals as outlined in the legislation means quotas. The rejection 
of merit as the only distinguishing characteristic dictates that 
the best candidate, as opposed simply to the qualifying 
candidate, will not necessarily be the one chosen for any 
particular position.
<P>
	By treating some more equal than others the government's 
mandated policy dictates that we end up with a workforce less 
expert than otherwise may be possible. Canada increasingly 
exists within the demands of an ever expanding and increasingly 
competitive world market. Every means possible from sound 
fiscal management to excellence in every sector of the economy 
will be necessary for us to hold our own in the challenge of that 
competitive environment.
<P>
	Finally I want to spend some time on the notion of equality. 
Section 15 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms claims 
Canadians are equal before and under the law. True justice lies 
in a process, not in the outcome.
<P>
	Any competition between two individuals, whether it be a 
race or a job competition, can only be deemed fair in the equal 
treatment during the process. The outcome is never predictable. 
The test of the race should never be in comparing the anticipated 
with the actual results.
<P>
	The true test of equality of opportunity is the very randomness 
of the outcome. Fairness dictates only that the best man or 
woman wins. This legislation is not just. It establishes 
numerical goals that must be met, which affects the outcome in 
favour of those covered under the goals.
<P>
	As a member of a designated group I take offence at the 
implications of the government's numerical goals or quotas. 
There is a suggestion by their very existence that somehow the 
system lacks confidence in the ability of women in general to 
really compete on a level playing field.
<P>
	The same Gallup poll I referred to found that 75 per cent of 
women agreed with the statement that governments should not 
actively hire more women or minority groups. As a group, 
women are not at a disadvantage. The 1994 annual report 
indicates women are actually doing better outside the act than 
they are under the employment equity program.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. member will have the floor after 
question period. However, as it is two o'clock, pursuant to 
Standing Order 30(5) the House will now proceed to Statements 
by Members pursuant to Standing Order 31.

<P>
	Many questions remain unanswered and the whole thing is 
starting to look more and more like a government cover-up

	<B>Mrs. Daphne Jennings (Mission-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday a good friend of mine was laid to rest in 
Mission-Coquitlam. Roger was a victim of armed robbery and 
the gun used was not a handgun but a sawed-off shotgun.
<P>
	This crime happened because two young men have no respect 
for the law, no respect for the rights of others and probably have 
never been held accountable for their actions.
<P>
	What we need in this country is crime control, not gun 
control. We have the laws in place. What we have to do is 
enforce them. We must establish the rights of victims over the 
rights of criminals, tougher sentencing and the tightening up of 
the Young Offenders Act.
<P>
	If we put emphasis back on the role of the family in teaching 
the basic values which build character and make responsible 
citizens of our young people, then we will be going in the right 
direction. Responsibility begins at home. In this way we can 
attack the very serious crime problem in Canada by teaching

congratulations are in order for the Ontario Fibricare

taken their cleaning one step further.
<P>
	Recently they signed a memorandum of understanding with 
the Ontario and federal Ministers of the Environment to 
establish a Green Clean project, a voluntary pollution 
prevention initiative which promotes water based technologies 
and processes as an alternative to the use of chemicals in the dry 
cleaning industry.
<P>
	The Toronto Green Clean depot is the first of seven such 
cleaners to be outfitted by Environment Canada for January 
1995. The depot's objectives are to educate consumers on green 
cleaning and to promote wet technology to industry members.
<P>
	Governments, corporations, environmental groups, industry 
associations and individual Canadians must work together to 
improve the environment for all of us. This initiative will work 
to eliminate the paradox that getting our cleaning done means 
polluting our environment.

economy.
<P>
	The high amounts of profit the banks have declared this past

fact that while some banks are making over $1 billion profit, 
they are at the very same time putting builders and developers 
out of business with a callous take it or leave it attitude.
<P>
	I call on the Prime Minister to fulfil the recommendation of 
the Standing Committee on Industry to implement an

the deregulation theory that Transport Canada has been pursuing 
for over a decade.
<P>
	In spite of evidence to the contrary, transport ministers from 
Axworthy to Mazankowski and on to the current minister have 
insisted that ``safety will not be compromised''. NDP members 
have always argued that without regulation and adequate 
inspection staff, safety would inevitably take second place, 
particularly when carriers are strapped for cash. In such cases 
maintenance is reduced, accidents increase and consumers are at 
risk.
<P>
	Since the department's strategy is in question I suggest that 
the minister take charge and ask someone like Judge 
Moshansky, who reported on the Dryden crash, to do a 
follow-up investigation to see if Transport Canada's inspections 
are now improved enough to correct the shortcomings 
previously identified.

Quebecers will settle the problem concerning the Quebec 
independence movement. What really threatens the well-being

of thorough reform.
<P>
	The tax system is unfair and inequitable to the majority of

it any right to unilaterally declare Quebec's sovereignty in its

wilderness area in northern British Columbia as a world heritage 
site at the United Nations, with absolutely no public discussion, 
input or support.

	The Tatshenshini contains rich mineral deposits worth more

British Columbians believe it is important to check for mineral 
deposits when considering setting aside land for parks. 
Sixty-seven per cent believe that mining and other land uses 
should co-exist.

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, last 
Friday, the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs said that he 
intended to send some of his officials to Saint-Jean to negotiate 
an agreement on the basis of the proposal put forth by the mayor 
of Saint-Jean.
<P>
	Yesterday, using as a pretext what Quebec's 
intergovernmental affairs minister had said, the minister 
reversed himself and refused to delegate his officials to resume 
negotiations today, as planned.
<P>
	In view of the urgency of the decisions the staff and their 
families will have to make and since everyone has agreed to 
resume discussions on the basis of the mayor's proposal, how 
does the minister explain his latest about-face, his refusal to 
send officials to Saint-Jean to resume negotiations today, as he 
had promised?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy 
Council for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
and Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, if anyone has not flip-flopped on this issue, it is I. 
For the past four months, I have been telling the opposition day 
after day that this matter must be settled on the basis of the 
agreement signed with the Government of Quebec on July 19.
<P>
	Ms. Beaudoin, in her press conference yesterday morning, 
denied the basis of our agreement. She denied that the July 19 
agreement would be the basis of our negotiations, so she is the 
one who has set aside what would have made it possible for us to 
reach a positive conclusion for the college in Saint-Jean.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs is dancing the 
cha-cha-cha on the Saint-Jean college issue-and he knows it. 
He is taking one step forward, and two steps back. That is what 
he is doing.
<P>
	I would like him to tell us exactly in what way what the 
Quebec minister said changed the proposal from the mayor of 
Saint-Jean, which is based on the July 19 agreement that seems 
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8996"> 8996 </A></B>
<P>
to be so dear to the minister. How did that change the mayor's 
proposal which Ms. Beaudoin and the people of Saint-Jean are 
prepared to discuss? The minister is the only one who will not 
get involved in the negotiations.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy 
Council for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
and Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is always better to dance the cha-cha-cha than 
St. Vitus' dance, like the opposition.
<P>
	The proposal from the mayor of Saint-Jean, Mr. Smereka, 
only implements the sixth point of the July 19 agreement. 
Therefore, by stating, as she did literally yesterday morning, 
that she does not believe in the July 19 agreement, Ms. Beaudoin 
has set aside the whole basis for negotiations.
<P>
	At midday today, I wrote to Ms. Beaudoin, indicating that if 
she advised that she was prepared to accept the terms of the July 
19 agreement, I would gladly resume negotiations, because what 
we care about is keeping the college in Saint-Jean going and the 
welfare of the people of Saint-Jean.
<P>
<b> (1420) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, despite 
the importance of this issue for the community of Saint-Jean, 
the teaching staff and their families, the minister stubbornly 
persists in refusing to discuss it.
<P>
	The Quebec minister clearly indicated to the minister that she 
was ready to discuss the proposal put forth by the mayor of 
Saint-Jean and the minister himself said that this proposal was 
consistent with the July 19 agreement. What more does it take, 
Mr. Speaker? If the Quebec minister abides by the agreement, or 
rather the proposal, from the mayor of Saint-Jean, and the 
federal minister thinks that it is consistent with his proposal of 
July 19, what more does he need?
<P>
	I put my question to the Prime Minister so that someone in 
that government will see the light.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I would ask the hon. member to put his 
question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier:</B> Yes, Mr. Speaker. I always have trouble 
avoiding relevant comments.
<P>
	Given the importance of this issue for the community in 
Saint-Jean and the teaching staff, does the Prime Minister 
intend to intervene to bring his minister to his senses since his 
attitude is completely incompatible with what he himself called 
flexible federalism?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, flexible federalism means that when there is an 
agreement, the other government respects it. That is the basis of 
the good relations which should exist in Canada.
<P>
	On July 19, we signed an agreement in good faith with the 
Government of Quebec and it was hailed as a very good 
agreement. The people of Saint-Jean were happy. But since a 
new government was elected in Quebec, there is no more 
agreement. If the Government of Quebec wants to abide by the 
agreement we signed with the previous government, there will 
be no problem. If it wants to reopen the issue, well, what can I 
say? The people of Saint-Jean will suffer the consequences.

question is directed to the Solicitor General. This morning, we 
heard that the government had decided to remove and not release 
several parts of the report of the Security Intelligence Review 
Committee on the disturbing Bristow case, in which CSIS not 
only infiltrated but actually contributed to the activities of the 
racist Heritage Front organization.
<P>
	How can the Solicitor General, who claimed that he wanted to 
release all the facts on the Bristow case, justify this attempt to 
conceal several parts of this report? What is he trying to hide 
from Quebecers and Canadians?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, we must not make any final decisions. I said that I 
wanted to release as much as I could of the SIRC report, in 
accordance with the appropriate legislation. We still have the 
entire report under review. I hope I will be able to announce a 
decision very shortly.
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, if 
the government still claims it wants to release the facts about the 
disturbing allegations in the Bristow case, how can the Solicitor 
General explain the fact that he has yet to submit the full report 
to the parliamentary sub-committee on national security for 
consideration?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, according to the legislation governing CSIS, the report 
is submitted to the Solicitor General. It is therefore the Solicitor 
General's responsibility to decide on the best way to release the 
report. My responsibilities include making sure that when I 
release the report, I am guided by the appropriate provisions of 
the Privacy Act and the CSIS Act. I trust the hon. member would 
want me to take seriously the legislation adopted by Parliament 
in this respect.

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr.

at Michael Schelew and the Immigration and Refugee Board.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8997"> 8997 </A></B>
<P>
	On November 21, Mr. Schelew was quoted as saying that he 
would not negotiate a severance package because he wanted 
exoneration. A judicial inquiry was ordered. It was called off 
because Mr. Schelew resigned with a $100,000 parting gift from 
the federal government.
<P>
	Who negotiated and authorized this severance package? Will 
the minister make public the details of the negotiations which 
led to this 180 degree turn by Mr. Schelew?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the ultimate decision to stop 
the inquiry was made by Judge Hugessen who said in his ruling 
that there would have been no reason or right to proceed. The 
deputy chair offered his resignation. Accordingly the 
government entertained a settlement. The settlement was 
conducted by government officials. The settlement in the end 
was in keeping and in line with standard government 
procedures. We believe it to be a fair settlement.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question was: Who negotiated the settlement with 
Mr. Schelew?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and

my first response: Government officials.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, can the minister tell us which government officials 
negotiated the settlement with Mr. Schelew and what his own 
role was in those negotiations?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I repeat that the negotiations 
were nothing untoward, nothing special. They were in keeping 
with normal standard procedures between government and

	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond 
(Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Transport.
<P>
	In a release published yesterday, the Transportation Safety 
Board of Canada reported serious deficiencies in the way 
Transport Canada handled the inspection of safety measures 
taken by air carriers. The board mentioned in particular major 
deficiencies with respect to the nature and frequency of the 
inspections, as well as insufficiently thorough audits and 
follow-ups.
<P>
	Considering that safety must be his top priority, how can the 
minister explain that such deficiencies are allowed to continue 
in terms of air safety, in spite of the many recommendations put 
forward by Canadian control organizations? And what positive 
steps does he intend to take to remedy the situation within his 
department?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, the question raised by my hon. colleague is a very 
serious one. We have read carefully the report of the 
Transportation Safety Board and taken note of its two major 
recommendations. First, air carriers must be subjected to much 
more minute inspections. Second, when faults of any kind are 
found in the system, there has to be a follow-up to ensure that 
these faults or deficiencies have been corrected.
<P>
	The board's report takes into account all incidents since 1984, 
the latest one dating back to December 1993. We take very 
seriously every one of the recommendations made by the board 
and intend to act on them.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond 
(Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
would you kindly remind the minister that he has been in office 
for over 14 months now. How does he expect to be taken 
seriously, knowing that similar recommendations were made in 
the past by the Transportation Safety Board and ignored by 
Transport Canada?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this is not a matter that we are going to pursue in this 
House on the basis of when the incidents occurred. Anything 
that has to do with the safety and security of travelling 
Canadians we are going to take very seriously.
<P>
	The report brought in by the board yesterday identified two 
major problems. The first was the depth of the audit that is 
conducted. We have undertaken to make sure that situation is 
corrected. The second was the follow-up. The first incident 
occurred in 1984. The last one referred to by the board occurred 
in December 1993.
<P>
<b> (1430 ) </B>

	My hon. friend knows that we are doing as much as we can to 
maintain a climate of confidence in the transportation system in 
Canada. We understand the import of what was recommended by 
the safety board. We intend to follow through on it. I can assure 
my hon. friend that a hell of a lot more will be done in the next 
few months than in the last 10 years.

	Within the next couple of days in Edmonton a refugee claim 
being made by an American woman claiming spousal abuse will 
be heard by a full member panel of the IRB. Hundreds of other 
refugee claims will be made this year by people who come from 
democratic nations. Surely the minister can see how ludicrous 
this is.
<P>
	Will the minister agree to a full review of the way the IRB 
determines refugee status and who is eligible to make a claim in 
the first place?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as I have mentioned in this 
House and outside this House many times, the government is 
conducting a full review of its agencies, boards and 
commissions. Within this review is also the IRB. We have every 
intention of undertaking any reform or measures that would 
strengthen the institution.
<P>
	As well, the chairperson will be moving very quickly on the 
commission that she had asked for some months back about the 
Hathaway report, about how individual members react to 
different situations.
<P>
	I also mentioned to him during the course of question period 
yesterday that I will be meeting with the chair later this week so 
that I can also ascertain how she feels about a number of things 
over the last number of months which has not been easy.
<P>
	If the member has ways of trying to improve the institution 
then count me in. If he simply wants to undercut the institution 
he can count me out.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
that is precisely the same arm's length excuse that we have heard 
from this minister all along but it does not wash.
<P>
	This minister has the power under the Immigration Act to 
prevent before they begin refugee claims by people from 
countries like the United States, but he has chosen not to do so.
<P>
	Will this minister admit that his unwillingness to stop refugee 
claims from the United States and Israel makes a mockery out of 
the IRB, his office and the country as a whole?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the member criticizes me for 
being at arm's length. Three weeks ago they were giving lectures 
about how ministers have to respect independent, quasi-judicial 
boards. Which one is it?
<P>
	The member asks whether I would deny or allow a refugee 
claim. That shows a profound ignorance of how refugee 
determination works in this country. It is not the minister or 
members of Parliament who adjudicate. That is why it is 
semi-judicial and independent, so that those adjudications may 
be done properly by members of the Immigration and Refugee 
Board.

has the Immigration and Refugee Board been tainted by the 
Schelew affair but the entire process for admitting immigrants

<P>
	The problem is much bigger than Mr. Schelew, the IRB or this 
particular minister. What is needed is a thorough investigation 
into the whole immigration and refugee determination process 
along with a look at alternative methods and procedures.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister get to the bottom of this mess and 
order a white paper on the immigration and refugee 
determination system in Canada either through this minister or 
through a new minister with the skills and commitment to 
reform the system?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I know very well that the policy of accepting some 
refugees in Canada does not please the Reform Party. Canada 
has always been more able than any other country to help people 
in very difficult positions around the world.
<P>
	I do not want to do that, in conformity with the laws that this 
Parliament has passed. If there is some need for change in the 
legislation, the House of Commons will have an occasion to 
study it and make recommendations.
<P>
	This government in a year and one month has shown that we 
have the proper balance. There are some incidents. It is not easy 
to come to a conclusion in cases like that.
<P>
	We have appointed members with their own convictions and 
they try to do their best. In this case apparently there might have 
been some error made and the person decided to resign. He has 
the right to resign and somebody else will be appointed. We 
want to maintain a policy that permits the people of the world, 
when they are in very difficult situations, to know there are some 
people who are concerned about human beings, the Canadian

<P>
	Rogers, the cable television company, decided to change 
access to its French-language channels TV5 and Météo Média, 
and to cancel Musique Plus, as of Thursday of this week. These 
changes will significantly reduce access to French channels for 
francophones. This situation is undoubtedly the result of a bad 
decision made by the CRTC regarding RDI, a decision that the 
heritage minister refused to review, in spite of a request to that 
effect by the opposition.
<P>

	The United Nations World Health Organization has asked the 
World Court for an advisory opinion whether the use of nuclear 
weapons is against international law. Will the government 
consider informing the court of those areas in which Canada 
considers the use of nuclear weapons to be against international 
law?
<P>
	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, Canada supports the objective of the elimination of 
nuclear weapons. However, we believe a treaty that would be 
binding on all the parties would be more conducive to efficiency 
than a mere reference to the international court of justice.

	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, today 
in this House the Liberal government summoned members from 
all over Ottawa so they could smother debate about the fact that 
their government is considering tax increases. How can the 
finance minister claim his government is willing to listen to 
Canadians when he permits his government to smother debate 
about the issue in this House?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am not quite sure 
what the member means by smothering debate.
<P>
	The finance committee has gone across the country and has 
heard from Canadians. There has been extensive discussion 
within the committee in which the member participated. In this 
House there have been countless questions. There have been 
discussions back and forth.
<P>
	I am not quite sure what further debate the Reform Party 
would like to see. We have listened to the members ad nauseam 
putting up strawmen like carbon taxes and everything else.
<P>
	One day the leader of the Reform Party talked about what it 
cost per minute to listen to this House. We have blown a billion 
dollars listening to the Reform Party.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rather 
get the impression that the finance minister along with the rest 
of his party did not have a clue what they were voting on this 
morning. What has happened to the Liberals and the finance 
minister since they sat on this side of the House?
<P>
<b> (1445) </B>
<P>
	Perhaps I could help the finance minister remember that on 
April 27, 1993 he said: ``In the real world outside Parliament 
Hill political revolution is under way''. He said: ``Canadians are 
demanding an end to the volleys of taxation that issue from the 
nation's capital every spring''. What does he think of his own 
words today?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the member is

took place and that is why we are in government.

a government cannot take sides in any industrial dispute.

	My question is for the government House leader. In light of 
the fact the government is so short of legislation to bring before

	Last June, the Liberal majority on the Standing Committee on 
Citizenship and Immigration, supported by the Reform Party, 
adopted a report on the Citizenship Act, which included a 
recommendation to eliminate a long standing right in Canada to 
hold dual citizenship. The Bloc Quebecois objected strenuously 
to this recommendation.

accept these recommendations to abolish the right to hold dual 
citizenship in Canada, a right that is recognized by more and

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as the Prime Minister 
confirmed a few days ago, the Canadian government and the 
Parliament of Canada will ultimately decide citizenship 
matters.
<P>
	It is true the Standing Committee on Citizenship and 
Immigration was asked to do a study and report on how we could 
upgrade our Citizenship Act, which has been untouched 
virtually for some 20 years. There were many recommendations 
within that report and dual citizenship was one of them. The 
report and those recommendations are currently before cabinet. 
One would expect that those amendments would come to the 
House next year.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, The 
minister did not answer my question. Would the minister agree 
that this recommendation is a blatant attempt at blackmail, to 
scare Quebecers on the eve of the referendum on sovereignty?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I hate to disappoint the 
member but it is absolutely false and irresponsible to say that 
about members of Parliament from all parties who worked hard 
on the Citizenship Act.
<P>
	They heard issues being raised by the public. They travelled. 
They had representations made to them. On balance the report 
made a very worthy set of recommendations.
<P>
	The dual citizenship which the member outlines was only one 
of many recommendations. It would be absolutely unfair if we 
were simply to lift one recommendation from a generally good 
report. Instead we should deal with it on balance in a 
comprehensive and fair way.

are drawing separation expenses, that is they are being paid an 
allowance because they have chosen to retain their home 
elsewhere during their tour of duty here in Ottawa.
<P>
	No one would object to reimbursing out of pocket expenses 
during a temporary dislocation from home and family. But when 
such reimbursement becomes a permanent part of an

long that is, for what period of time separation allowance is 
normally paid?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fred Mifflin (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question. I am sure 
it is posed within the context of his concern for Canadian forces 
personnel.
<P>
	In response to his question I have three points to make. The 
first one is that the program he talks about is called imposed 
restriction. It is related to the mobility that Canadian forces 
members have compared to any other part of Canadian society.
<P>
	The second point I would make is that there are 900 members 
of the Canadian forces involved or less than one per cent and 65 
per cent of them are non-commissioned members.
<P>
	The third point is if he has any indication the regulations are 
not being followed properly and there are some unauthorized 
things happening, I think he owes it to the Canadian public to be 
more specific to me and to the minister.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have a supplementary question.
<P>
	We are talking about $12 million a year here. One individual 
received separation allowance for a full year, almost $20,000. 
Another received over $86,000 for a period of more than four 
years. All this is in addition to their normal pay and allowances.
<P>
	Why would the Department of National Defence allow these 
two individuals to remain separated from their families for so 
long, knowing it was costing the taxpayer well over $100,000 in 
separation expenses?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fred Mifflin (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member knows the management of 
personnel in the Canadian forces is a complex task with many 
different dimensions.
<P>
	He also knows that the military career requires a much greater 
degree of mobility than any other segment of Canadian society. 
This imposes stress on individuals and their families and a much 
greater burden on the organization itself, considering their 
families. I am quoting from a report which the hon. member 
signed.

<P>

secondary education. The criticism is based upon the need to 
ensure that Canadians are better educated, not worse educated. 
Provincial education  ministers have expressed concern, at the 
least, and some have indicated that the proposals are disastrous.
<P>
	I wonder when the minister will stop hysterically attacking 
provincial cabinet ministers who disagree with him and start 
listening to those ministers who want to save post-secondary 
education in Canada. When will he stop this disastrous attack on 
post-secondary education and Canadians in general?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is incumbent upon 
everybody involved in looking at the whole need to restructure 
our social framework, including the way to provide for higher 
education, to deal with the facts. The facts are that over the next 
several years the revenue going to the provinces substantially 
increases, not decreases, as a result of the growth in revenue 
coming from the tax points.
<P>
	When certain provincial ministers refused to acknowledge 
both that fact and their responsibility to ensure that those 
increased revenues were in fact turned over and transferred for 
investment in higher education, it does deserve some rebuttal to 
show that responsibility must reside where it is clearly placed on 
provincial ministers to make sure they spend the money the 
federal government transfers to them for the betterment of 
higher education.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon-Clark's Crossing, 
NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wonder what world the minister lives in. 
He used to be a university professor. He should understand what 
post-secondary education is all about.
<P>
	How can doubled tuition fees and skyrocketing student loans 
possibly help Canada, Canada's students or the future of the 
country?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic

spent some time in the university system that I know there is 
much room for serious reform, serious restructuring and serious 
modernization of the system so that we can reach out to far more 
students.
<P>
	The proposal under the green paper is to provide increased 
accessibility for another quarter million Canadians. That 
requires reform on the financial side and begins to require 
serious reform and consideration by those in the academic 
community to look at how they are spending money and how 
they are investing money to get full value for it.

Question No. 82 standing in my name and the answer I received 
to an access to information request. I have advised the Minister 
of Fisheries and Oceans of my intention to rise today on this 
issue.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, with your permission, I would first like to state 
the case to demonstrate the discrepancy and then present 
supporting precedents. My question was: What effect did the 
late signing of the aboriginal fisheries agreement in British 
Columbia have on the Department of Fisheries and Oceans-
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9004"> 9004 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order. I am sure all hon. members will want to 
listen to this point of privilege. The hon. member for Delta.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cummins:</B> In his response on November 10, the minister 
stated that while negotiations on agreements with aboriginal 
groups for the management of aboriginal salmon fishing were in 
many cases protracted, leading to delays in signing of 
agreements, these had little impact on agreements and fisheries 
regulations. I emphasize the words ``little impact''.
<P>
	Access documents which I received December 7, 1994 
contradicted the minister. I will bring several of these 
contradictions to the attention of this House.
<P>
	In a memo dated August 17, 1994 approved by D.D. Aurel, 
Chief of Conservation and Protection, Fraser River Division it is 
stated: ``The late signing of the aboriginal agreements has also 
resulted in difficulties in respect to proper management of the 
fishery and, in many cases, bands have not been able to abide by 
the terms of the agreement''.
<P>
	The second point states: ``The lateness in the signing of the 
1994 aboriginal fishing agreement has resulted in the 
breakdown of effective management of the native fishery on the 
Fraser River. Again, many aspects of the agreement failed to 
materialize or were simply neglected. DFO officers were unable 
to perform their duties''.
<P>
	The third point in the memo states: ``The late signing of the 
aboriginal fishing agreements has contributed to management's 
reduced capacity to adequately monitor the fishery, provide 
accurate catch information and provide enforcement of the 
regulations governing the fishery on the Fraser River between 
Steveston and Lillooet during the period of June 25 to July 31, 
1994''.
<P>
	In a memo dated September 19, 1994 to Paul Sutherland, 
Acting Regional Director, Pacific Region from the Director of 
Conservation and Protection, Pacific Region it is stated: ``The 
major aboriginal agreements were not signed until well into the 
month of July 1994. As such there would have been no 
designated aboriginal guardians patrolling their early fisheries 
until such times as the agreements were signed. This created a 
gap not only in the enforcement program but also in the 
monitoring of the early portion of the fishery''.
<P>
<b> (1505) </B>
<P>
	The second point of the same memo: ``In addition, there were 
a number of start-up problems with the guardian program once 
the agreements were signed, including the lack of an 
enforcement co-ordinator until mid August. There was 
therefore a lack of direction for those aboriginal guardian staff 
who were hired by the bands until the enforcement co-ordinator 
position was filled''.
<P>
	On August 22 the Fraser River fishery catch estimation was 
addressed to the Chief of Conservation and Protection, Pacific 
Region from the Field Supervisor, General Investigation 
Services, Fraser River Division and stated: ``Agreements in the 
Sto:Lo and Musqueam-Tsawwassen areas were not signed and 
hence no mandatory landing program was in place until well into 
the early Stuart sockeye migration in the lower river with a 
potential unreported catch in this fishery''.
<P>
	These documents indicate that the late signing of the AFS 
agreements had a massive impact on the enforcement of the 
agreements and fisheries regulations. The documents contradict 
the minister. The minister knew this. In early November of this 
year he met with fisheries officers of Vancouver and discussed 
the shortcomings of the enforcement regime in place last 
summer.
<P>
	The rights of the members of this House include the right to 
accurate information. Beauchesne's sixth edition states in 
citation 24:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Parliamentary privilege is the sum of peculiar rights enjoyed by each House 
collectively as a constituent part of the High Court of Parliament, and by 
Members of each House individually, without which they could not discharge 
their functions.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Surely we must expect the responses to Order Paper questions 
to be accurate and well-reasoned. I placed that question on the 
Order Paper recognizing it was one that required detailed study 
by the government because I wanted a detailed answer. After all 
is that not the purpose of such questions?
<P>
	In speaking to a similar discrepancy to an Order Paper answer 
and access to information documents, the member for Kingston 
and the Islands in 1990 stated: ``The information provided to the 
House must be accurate and must not mislead the House''.
<P>
	I offer for the Speaker's consideration the 1978 decision 
where the member for Northumberland-Durham raised a 
question of privilege in the House of Commons. The then 
Solicitor General had written and provided information which 
later proved to be erroneous.
<P>
	On December 6, 1978 the Speaker indicated as reported at 
page 1857 of <I>Hansard</I>: ``I therefore find a prime facie case of 
contempt against the House of Commons''. If it was contempt 
against the House of Commons to provide a member of 
Parliament with erroneous information, then surely to provide 
the House itself with erroneous information through a written 
reply to a question on the Order Paper would also be a prime 
facie case of privilege.
<P>
	It is incumbent upon the government to provide through the 
Order Paper not only the questioner, in this case myself, but the 
House accurate information in order for us as parliamentarians 
to discharge our functions appropriately.

	I have been able to get accurate information under access to 
information. Both the access request and the Order Paper 
question were submitted in late September. How is it that the 
minister could get away with inaccurate information responding 
to an Order Paper question in the House?
<P>
	The response given in this House would have been illegal 
under the Access to Information Act. If members want accurate 
information, is it necessary to go to access to information rather 
than to this House? Surely members of this House should expect 
a standard of accuracy that is as high as that received under

on September 23, 1994 is not absolutely complete and the 
minister knows it is not complete because in early November, 
six weeks later, he met with enforcement officers in Vancouver 
who gave him additional information.
<P>
	If you check the ``blues'', Mr. Speaker, because I listened very 
carefully, you will find that is exactly what the member said, 
that the minister should have known better on September 23 and 
had a more complete answer because on November 2 the 
minister met with enforcement officers and was given additional 
information.
<P>
	I want to confirm that as the member knows, I did meet with 
enforcement officers on November 2 at DFO headquarters in 
Vancouver. I was given additional information. As a 
consequence of that additional information I set up a panel 
which in the last week has held public hearings in British 
Columbia listening to every single stakeholder group talking 
about the management of salmon on the Fraser River. The 
member knows that as well, even though he has called into 
question the integrity of this panel which is chaired by none 
other than the former Speaker of the House of Commons, the 
Hon. John Fraser.
<P>
	Let me say this to the member and let me say to you, Mr. 
Speaker, that at the time the question was asked the answer 
which was given makes reference to the fact that delays in 
signing agreements have had little impact, it says, on the 
enforcement of aboriginal fisheries. That is the information the 
minister had. I learned subsequently in discussions with 
enforcement officers over a full month later of additional 
concerns.
<P>
	We have acted to have a total public review to deal with those 
concerns. I have a review going on internally in the department 
to deal with concerns about enforcement. Nobody is attempting 
to mislead anybody. The member is a month behind the process. 
We were already working on the problem before he even brought 
it to the House.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I do not in any way minimize the seriousness of 
this question of privilege raised by the hon. member for Delta. 
He surely has a grievance which perhaps can be corrected 
without proceeding to a complete point of privilege. I would 
hope that the hon. member for Delta and perhaps the member for 
Kingston and the Islands and the hon. Minister of Fisheries and 
Oceans might come together to resolve this particular 
grievance.
<P>
	I want the House to understand that I do take this very 
seriously when a member feels that he or she is in any way 
impeded from performing his or her duties as members of 
Parliament.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="9006"> 9006 </A></B>
<P>
	I would give this assurance that I will return to the member for 
Delta if indeed he does not get a response to his grievance in 
discussions with the hon. member for Kingston and the Islands 
and the hon. Minister of Fisheries and Oceans. I will leave it at 
that for the time being.
<P>

<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order. Is this on the same question of 
privilege?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cummins:</B> Yes, Mr. Speaker. I want to correct the record 
on a point made by the minister.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I wonder if the hon. member might consider my 
suggestion. We could let this sit at this point with the full 
assurance of the Chair that I will return to the member if his 
grievance is not responded to in a satisfactory manner. Can we 
leave it there?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cummins:</B> Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Mr. Speaker, a point of order. I think you might 
find there is unanimous consent in the House to revert to 
statements by ministers so that the Minister of Transport can 
make a brief statement.

	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, the House will know that on September 21, CP Rail 
System tabled an unsolicited bid of $1.4 billion for the CN North 
America eastern rail assets.
<P>
	I am announcing today that the Government has rejected CP's 
offer and is not prepared to entertain any further the sale of CN 
Rail assets.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In reaching our conclusions, we reviewed the business and 
policy cases beyond the financial implications of the deal. 
Canadian Pacific's bid would have had a substantial impact on 
employment, the rail network and the cost of rail service for 
eastern shippers. The government was also concerned about the 
impact that the transaction would have had on CN's remaining 
western operations.
<P>
	We must address the fundamental problems facing the rail 
industry to ensure that the sector is viable, competitive and 
continues to meet the needs of Canadian shippers. A series of 
meetings have been held with shippers and other stakeholders in 
all regions of the country. This phase of the consultation process 
will wrap up with a national shippers' meeting in Ottawa 
tomorrow.
<P>
	I have also asked a committee of members of Parliament 
headed by the member for Kenora-Rainy River to discuss with 
Canadians the feasibility of commercializing Canadian 
National. I look forward to the recommendations that the 
member and his colleagues will bring forward, particularly with 
regard to the possibility of employee participation in any 
commercialization of Canadian National.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We will announce a comprehensive and workable rail policy 
framework in 1995. We must put the Canadian rail sector on a 
stable footing and try to maintain a healthy level of competition 
within the rail industry and against other modes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond 
(Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
even if we did not have the opportunity of looking at the details 
of the CP offer, for lack of relevant documentation and because 
the government did not deign to consult us, the opposition is 
nonetheless relieved to learn today that it has decided to reject 
the offer.
<P>
	Indeed, we are of the opinion that CP's bid was too low, as 
pointed out in a study by Morgan Stanley, and involved too 
many drawbacks for the people of Canada and Quebec.
<P>
	We were not unconcerned by the creation of a monopoly east 
of Winnipeg and there was no indication of how local railways 
would be treated under this new monopoly. We do agree with the 
government: this offer of CP Rail had to be rejected on financial 
and public interest grounds.
<P>
	However, the question of Canadian National and the Canadian 
rail system still remains unresolved. It is particularly 
disappointing to see how undemocratically the Liberal 
government is treating the opposition around this issue. No 
opposition member, neither from the Bloc Quebecois nor the 
Reform Party, was asked to sit on this committee.
<P>
<b> (1520) </B>
<P>
	This is above all a partisan parliamentary group studying the 
privatization of CN. The eight Liberal members and the federal 
senator on the committee have worked their way toward 
recommendations which have no doubt already been drafted, 
long before the so-called hearings are over.
<P>
	On February 18, as the Official Opposition's transport critic, I 
asked the Standing Committee on Transport to give priority to 
the matter of rail service. I asked again when the House 
reconvened on September 19, and the minister's response was 
the creation on September 29 of this partisan Liberal working 
committee.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="9007"> 9007 </A></B>
<P>
	Last week in committee, although it had been agreed to put 
aside consideration of the national airport policy to concentrate 
on ports, we again asked the committee to give priority to rail 
issues and travel to the regions to hear what the people have to 
say.
<P>
	The government is set to introduce a global rail policy in 1995 
without even consulting the elected members of the opposition. 
I hope that the government will reconsider its approach in this 
matter, and not in cavalier fashion either, because it is totally 
unacceptable. We hope that the minister will be much more open 
and democratic with the democratically elected members of the 
opposition.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I can go along with the minister's decision not to accept 
CP's offer but not the part that states the government is not 
prepared to entertain any further offers for the sale of CN Rail.
<P>
	The formation of CN Rail began in 1917 when numerous 
small rail companies found themselves in severe financial 
trouble. The root cause of the rail industry problem even then 
was an excess of trackage. Once formed, CN commenced an 
aggressive program of expansion, despite evidence that there 
was already excessive trackage in Canada. In order to compete 
CP Rail was forced to expand as well. The results were 
inevitable.
<P>
	In 1937 CN's debts were a major problem so the government 
of the day cancelled them. It was a Liberal government. No one 
addressed excess trackage which resulted in CN again finding 
itself in severe financial trouble in 1952. Once again the 
government of the day entered the picture and bailed them out. 
Once again the government of the day was Liberal. Still no one 
addressed the problem of excess trackage.
<P>
	During the next two decades CN, despite losses of 
approximately $25 million a year, continued capital spending of 
up to $200 million a year. The results were once again 
inevitable. Enter the government in 1978 with yet another 
bail-out and, yes, once again it was a Liberal government.
<P>
	It appears the latest Liberal government is now prepared to be 
the fourth to bail a government company out of trouble so that it 
can compete with a public company using the taxpayers' money 
as a subsidy. That is not acceptable.
<P>
	A task force to study this, made up of only Liberal members 
who have an obvious political agenda to maintain this unviable 
rail company, is not acceptable.
<P>
	Yesterday I made a statement in the House indicating my 
expectation of the government's position based on my 
observations of the task force in action. The task force had a 
predetermined policy and only went forth to manipulate people 
into accepting it.
<P>
	The only solution to Canada's rail problem is the privatization 
of CN. Whether it is sold as a whole entity or sold in part is not 
the issue. After almost 80 years of problems it is time for the 
government to butt out. Government interference causes rather 
than resolves problems. Reduce government's role to a 
regulatory position and allow the marketplace to resolve the 
problem. They will do a far better job than politicians and 
bureaucrats ever could.
<P>
<b> (1525 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I wish to inform the 
House that pursuant to Standing Order 33 because of the 
ministerial statement, Government Orders will be extended by

	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sharon Hayes (Port Moody-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I look forward to resuming debate on Bill C-64.
<P>
	To sum up what I have already said, as a Reformer I stand by 
and support the concept of equality for all Canadians, whether 
that equality be in law or in opportunity in the marketplace. As a 
Reformer I am strongly opposed to the injustice of establishing 
employment goals for designated groups. I have listened to 
young people who also resent the inference of inequality of such 
employment equity legislation as we see today.
<P>
	Visible minorities do not want this type of help as it creates 
resentment not only within their own communities but also in 
their efforts to be accepted as equals within the larger 
community.
<P>
	A young second generation Chinese Canadian journalism 
student recently shared her frustration in my constituency 
office. Despite her excellent qualifications, the recognition that 
she had received was lessened by the question of whether her 
success was in fact a token of her perceived difference rather 
than reward for her unequivocal excellence. Tokenism has no 
part in Canada if we truly believe in equality.
<P>
	It is the government's job to provide the means for equality of 
opportunity. It is not the government's job to push unjust and 
unfair equality of results in the marketplace. Employment 
equity is unnecessary and it is unwise as it institutionalizes the 
very notion of discrimination that it purports to reject.

<P>
	Years ago as society's architects only mused about the notion 
of legislating hiring practices, Martin Luther dreamt of a society 
that was blind to race and gender. ``Judge us not by the colour of 
our skin but by the content of our character'' he implored. How 
sad that Canadians are being driven to adopt policies that deny 
the very principles we hold dear. These are principles that are 
upheld by Canadians of all abilities and backgrounds. These are 
principles that will lead us to the prosperity we deserve as a 
great country, principles which we have presented in this brief 
discussion.
<P>
	The legislation of Bill C-64 works against the principles I 
have described, principles of equality, of fiscal accountability 
and of the excellence of all Canadians in our society.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my brief remarks are designed to repeat some of the 
basic arguments against pay and employment equity which 
underlie Reform's opposition to Bill C-64.
<P>
	Reform believes that government should assure equality of 
opportunity in economic life, but it has no business using the 
labour market to assure equality of outcome. Doing so interferes 
with basic freedoms, makes false assumptions about the causes 
of inequality, creates large inefficiencies and is basically unjust.
<P>
	Consider the problem with freedom. Canada has developed 
into a prosperous society by upholding basic personal freedoms. 
One of these consists of the ability of individuals to sell their 
labour services to the highest bidder and for employers to 
choose freely those whom they wish to hire as long as they do 
not interfere with the fundamental freedoms of others.
<P>
	These freedoms are an end in themselves, but they also are the 
engines which drive economic activity in a market economy that 
has produced the riches our society enjoys today.
<P>
	Throughout the world and history people have died for these 
freedoms. We all remember the American civil war. Slavery 
represents the extreme limitation on people's freedom to sell 
their labour services to the highest bidder. Employment and pay 
equity legislation imposes on free Canadians just a bit of such 
slavery. Our society is on a slippery slope.
<P>
<b> (1530) </B>
<P>
	Consider the idea that existing inequalities between groups is 
due to discrimination. Reform believes that this proposition is 
based on false assumptions and empirical evidence. Studies by 
Tom Sowell at Stanford University have shown that Americans 
of Japanese origin as a group have much above average U.S. 
income.
<P>
	My former colleague, Don DeVoretz at Simon Fraser 
University, has shown that immigrants on average have higher 
incomes than people born in Canada. The recorded 
extraordinary success of these two groups is indicative of the 
impossible task of establishing that  group disadvantages are 
caused by discrimination based on race, gender or national or 
ethnic origin.
<P>
	Economists led by Nobel laureate Gary Becker have long 
argued that free markets offer the best protection against 
discrimination. Consider a firm that gets paid $1 for the 
assembly of a computer component. The wage rate is $10 per 
hour and the average male is able to complete 10 units per hour. 
Consider that women have greater dexterity and are able to 
assemble 12 units per hour. Any firm which refuses to hire 
women for this task is at an obvious competitive disadvantage 
with a firm that does. It will ultimately go out of business.
<P>
	Students of labour markets have been able to show that 
discrimination in the labour market has historically persisted 
only in instances where government regulation or government 
enforced monopolies like labour unions have prevented the 
adjustment from taking place.
<P>
	Bill C-64 and similar legislation involves serious costs. 
Bureaucrats, lawyers and the police needed to enforce such 
legislation are not available to produce goods and services that 
determine our living standard. The private sector incurs large 
administrative costs. In addition there are the costs of lost 
efficiency. Goods and services will no longer be produced using 
the lowest cost.
<P>
	In the United States affirmative action has been estimated to 
result in lost output equal to 4 per cent of national income. Since 
Canada may be assumed never to want to lag behind the U.S. in 
such social legislation for long, we may soon expect at least 
such cost.
<P>
	The ultimate cost of governmental attempting to create 
perfect equality of incomes has become obvious through recent 
developments in socialist and communist governments around 
the world. Employment and pay equity in these systems had 
been perfected. Now communism and socialism around the 
world have failed or are in retreat.
<P>
	What does the Liberal Government of Canada do? It pushes 
state efforts to achieve equality of income by applying it to the 
civil service. In addition, the recent Liberal recommendations to 
the finance minister in the report of the Standing Committee on 
Finance bragged about the fact that if adopted they will further 
equalize income. Have the Liberals learned nothing from 
history?
<P>
	Let me now discuss briefly the sense in which the proposed 
legislation is basically unjust. Using the course of power of the 
state to help one group of disadvantaged individuals 
automatically discriminates against others and deprives them of 
their rights and freedoms without due process.
<P>
	These groups are paying a discriminatory tax and are 
implicitly declared guilty of discrimination. Reform sees no 
justice in forcing young people belonging to one group to pay 
today for discrimination that may or may not have taken place in 
the past.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9009"> 9009 </A></B>
<P>
	By the same token, where is the justice in giving members of 
minority groups alive today benefits in return for injustices real 
or imagined suffered by past members of this group?
<P>
	Let me close by reminding members of the slippery slope on 
which we find ourselves. In one of his novels, Kurt Vonnegut 
describes a world in which state created equality of outcome was 
perfected.
<P>
<b> (1535) </B>
<P>
	It had moved from assuring pay equity to equity in looks and 
sports. In Vonnegut's brave new world, good looking people had 
to wear glasses and other devices to assure equality of looks 
with those disadvantaged by nature.
<P>
	Gifted athletes were made to wear heavy weights to assure 
that they were able to jump no higher and run no faster than the 
rest. In the end, the hero of the story discards the starting post 
equalization devices and enjoyed his life to the fullest for a short 
time until he entered jail for the rest of his life.
<P>
	Whenever it is impossible to make a strong intellectual case 
against the government policy like pay employment equity the 
question arises why governments persist with such policy. 
Public choice theory of government provides the answer.
<P>
	Such legislation serves the interests of politicians and parties. 
Identifiable groups are given benefits and they are expected to 
reward the donors at the ballot box and with financial support. 
The cost of the legislation in terms of lost freedoms, 
discrimination against the innocent and reduced output are 
difficult to measure.
<P>
	As a result the victims of the policy have little or no 
incentives and knowledge to punish the politicians who have 
imposed those costs on them. Such special interest group 
legislation slowly and exorbitantly lowers the income of 
Canadians and most tragically deprives them of their freedom.
<P>
	Bill C-64 and similar legislated pay and employment equity 
reduce the welfare of Canadians. That is why Reform opposes it.

	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.)</B> moved that the amendments made by 
the Senate to Bill C-42, an act to amend the Criminal Code and 
other acts (miscellaneous matters) be concurred in.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I would like say a few words about Bill 
C-42.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The other place has now amended the bill in two respects but 
has otherwise passed it. I should add it has also made minor 
changes to certain parts of the French language version.
<P>
<b> (1540) </B>
<P>
	The two important changes which arise from the work of the 
other place should be mentioned briefly. Clauses 61 and 62 have 
been deleted. Clause 61 would have replaced section 604 of the 
Criminal Code. It would have prohibited the defence from 
publicizing information received from the prosecution in the 
fulfilment of the crown's disclosure obligations.
<P>
	The limited purpose of the amendment was to ensure that this 
information would only be used to prepare the answer and 
defence in the courtroom.
<P>
	The committee of the Senate felt that a number of related 
issues should be dealt with at the same time. I am able to tell the 
House that is going to be possible because the government is 
now looking at the prospect of codifying disclosure 
requirements arising from the Supreme Court of Canada 
judgment in Finchcomb as part of our work toward the reform of 
the preliminary inquiry and criminal procedure generally.
<P>
	We agree with having clause 61 removed from the bill. Now it 
can be dealt with in the context of the broader treatment of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9010"> 9010 </A></B>
<P>
disclosure and we accept that change for the very good reasons 
given by our colleagues in the other place.
<P>
	The second clause deleted is clause 62. That would have 
amended section 648 of the Criminal Code to restrict publicity 
about certain jury trial proceedings that occur before the jury is 
empanelled.
<P>
	It was the intention of the government in putting this clause in 
the bill to fill a gap which has existed for some time and to 
provide for orders banning publication in those cases in which 
pretrial motions concerning the admissibility of certain 
evidence were heard in courtrooms before the jury was actually 
sworn in.
<P>
	The publication of such pretrial motions, particularly as they 
relate to evidence that might eventually be heard, might 
contaminate members of a prospective jury panel, might give 
them impressions or information about the evidence which 
would make it more difficult or impossible for them to serve 
impartially.
<P>
	It was pointed out by the committee of the Senate which 
considered this clause that the language which the government 
used to achieve that purpose might be overbroad. It might be 
mandatory where permissive language might be preferable. In 
any event the provision, however worded, should permit the 
publication of matters other than those which might sway a jury 
if they were made public before the panel was sworn in.
<P>
	We are happy to have that clause removed as well. We will 
consider it and try to meet the legitimate concerns that have 
been expressed. We will try to improve it and bring it forward at 
another time.
<P>
	The government is indebted to the other place for its 
characteristically careful work, particularly the detailed 
analysis done in a very constructive way by the committee of the 
Senate. We are grateful if its work will result in an improved 
bill, a better law for Canadians.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval-Centre, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I will be the only member to speak on behalf of the 
Official Opposition on Senate amendments to Bill C-42, an act 
to amend the Criminal Code and other acts. As far as we are 
concerned, we, the voice of democracy, have already made 
ourselves heard when the bill was read the third time and passed 
in this House, on October 4, 1994.
<P>
	If I rise today, it is to denounce the amendment process used 
by the other chamber of this Parliament. The Standing 
Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs of that 
institution tabled its recommendations on December 12. The 
committee suggested that some amendments be made. The 
spokesperson of this committee of the other place complained 
about the Criminal Code review process as well as that used for 
Bill C-42.
<P>
<b> (1545) </B>
<P>
	In his view, it would be highly desirable in the future that such 
bills be submitted to the other place first. He says that the other 
place has proven itself in that area.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois has always been openly opposed to the 
existence of an institution like the other chamber of this 
Parliament. Let me tell you why.
<P>
	The primary function of the other chamber of this Parliament 
should be akin to a consideration and review process to put the 
brakes on the House of Commons. The role of this institution is 
supposed to be to counterbalance the parliamentary executive. 
The Fathers of Confederation gave the other place the means to 
act as a federal chamber looking after the rights of the 
provinces, the rights of the regions, and to guarantee their 
participation in the federal legislative process.
<P>
	We are forced to recognize that such is not the case however. 
The inherent goals of this institution of the Parliament of 
Canada have been replaced with less noble and less democratic 
goals, such as thanking friends of the regime and representing a 
handful of groups with interests often less than compatible with 
those of a true democracy. The elitism prevailing in this 
obsolete institution is not reconcilable with democratic activity. 
We, the Official Opposition, think that it is up to the elected 
representatives of the people of Quebec and Canada in this 
House to pass or reject the legislation introduced by the 
government.
<P>
	Therefore, we are not interested in giving consideration to the 
amendments suggested by the members of the other place. The 
amendments proposed by the house of partisan appointments in 
regard to this bill clearly demonstrate the uselessness and the 
waste of time, energy and money generated by the activities of 
the members of the other place.
<P>
	Notwithstanding the respect we may have for some members 
of the other place, the fact remains that their work can often 
amount to mere stylistic or cosmetic changes. We see the 
legislative role of the other chamber as unacceptable overlap, 
especially in these times when we have to put public finances in

<P>
	Is it justifiable to spend $26,952,000 a year so that the other 
place can tell us that a bill we have just passed, on which all 
democratically elected members of this House voted, needs 
cosmetic or stylistic changes?
<P>
	Allow me to quote a short passage from a speech delivered on 
June 8 by my colleague from Richmond-Wolfe: ``The Bloc has 
always spoken out against the existence of a Senate, and I would 
like to demonstrate that this institution is, in our opinion, as 
archaic as it is useless. This institution is nothing more than an 
excuse for the government to reward its friends, be they Liberal 
or Tory, who will then work-in true partisan fashion-for the 
government or for the interests they represent''.
<P>

<P>
	No, we do not need the other chamber. Given the current lack 
of constitutional progress, I understand how some members of 
the other place, with pensions and perhaps a passion for passive 
political life, would want to justify their salaries. But all this 
only adds to a system which is already too heavy and costly.
<P>
	Furthermore, this does not enhance in any way the process to 
consult on and pass a bill already approved by all members of 
this House.
<P>
	Let us have a quick look at the proposed changes. There are 
six amendments, including two technical changes and two 
somewhat questionable stylistic changes. The last two 
amendments suggest that the members of the other place did not 
understand the purpose of Bill C-42, since their amendments 
deal with protecting the right to a fair and equitable trial and 
with the obsolescence of a current provision in the Criminal 
Code.
<P>
<b> (1550) </B>
<P>
	As you can understand, we refuse to give any consideration to 
the amendments proposed by the other place, since it does not 
represent anyone, has no mandate from the population and is to 
all intents and purposes a mere patronage nest or, if you prefer, a 
haven of recognition, pure and simple.
<P>
	We will therefore vote against the amendments proposed by 
the other place, since they are, in our opinion, cosmetic in nature 
and questionable and come from an institution without 
legitimacy in the eyes of the Bloc Quebecois, the official 
opposition. I am sure that the vast majority of Quebecers will 
support our position on this.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul E. Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is a privilege to speak again on Bill C-42, 
although I did not expect to be doing so when I last spoke on this 
legislation on October 4. At that time the Reform Party agreed 
with the majority of the bill the way it stood and therefore 
proceeded to committee of the whole and quick passage through 
the House of Commons. We had one clear objection at that time 
but it now appears the House of sober second thought has had 
some other ideas about the bill.
<P>
	The amendments deal with the French version of the text and 
are apparently only housekeeping items that I am sure better 
clarify the meaning of the text. The amendments of concern are 
those to clauses 61 and 62. Clippings of newspapers were filled 
with editorials and columns urging the Senate to reject these two 
clauses of the bill. Apparently the Senate listened well and 
proceeded to send the bill back to the House with those two 
deletions. Here we see the power of the media at work.
<P>
	I am not going to criticize the Senate for sending the bill back 
with amendments. That is what it is supposed to do. However, I 
am sure the Senate could have made  other more important 
amendments that would have strengthened the legislation.
<P>
	Clause 28(3) of the bill states: ``Everyone who commits 
mischief in relation to property that is a testamentary instrument 
or the value of which exceeds five thousand dollars''. The bill 
would replace the word ``one'' with the word ``five''. Why did 
the Senate not bring forward an amendment to this part of the 
bill? The reason is clear. The bleeding hearts think this would be 
too cruel, too onerous. They did not think twice on this one.
<P>
	In 1954 the dollar indicator for theft over, theft under was 
$50. The next time this clause was changed was in 1975 when it 
became $200. The law as we know it today was amended in 1985 
to $1,000. The punishment for theft over is an indictable offence 
and liable for imprisonment up to 10 years. For anything under 
$1,000 the punishment is usually a summary conviction with 
minor consequences available.
<P>
	The government must realize that when it brings forth 
amendments it will set a precedent on amendments in the future. 
This government does not think logically. Neither does it 
consider the past nor the future.
<P>
	Property crimes in Canada historically account for 
approximately two-thirds of all Criminal Code offences. In fact 
in 1990 thefts over and under $1,000 comprised over two-thirds 
of all property crimes reported to police.
<P>
	The area of concern is theft over. From 1986, one year 
following the dollar cut off being raised to $1,000 until 1992, 
theft over had increased by 9 per cent. I am sure the government 
at the time felt that raising the rate from $200 to $1,000 would 
help curb the property crime rates.
<P>
	Now today with Bill C-42 the government hopes that by 
raising the limit from $1,000 to $5,000 this increase will help 
curb property crime rates in 1995 and beyond. The government 
should take a careful look back at history and see how things 
failed before charging ahead with an idea that it only hopes will 
work for the best. In my opinion the government should keep the 
dollar amount at $1,000. Getting softer with criminals is not 
going to reduce the crime rate. It will perhaps only increase it.
<P>
	Bill C-42 was first read on June 15, 1994. The member for 
London West spoke on October 4, with a speech that perhaps 
could have been prepared by one of the minister's staff. In that 
speech she said: ``It is important that the rights of accused 
persons to a fair trial before an impartial jury not be 
compromised by premature publicity of information which may 
or may not be relevant in admissible evidence''.
<P>
	The hon. member went on to say: ``The rights of witnesses and 
victims also require protection from the needless public 
disclosure of personal information. A prohibition would be 
created to ensure that sensitive material disclosed to the accused 
for the purposes of making a full answer in defence is not made 
public for  that purpose. This will serve to maintain the balance 
of interests between the right of the accused to a full answer in a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9012"> 9012 </A></B>
<P>
defence and the confidence the public needs to encourage 
co-operation in criminal investigations and prosecutions''.
<P>
<b> (1555) </B>
<P>
	The member in her speech stressed that this provision would 
protect the rights of the witnesses and the victims from needless 
public disclosure of personal information.
<P>
	If the member for London West agrees with the justice 
minister that these two amendments are necessary, that would 
mean she believes that without this provision in Bill C-42 the 
rights of witnesses and victims will not be protected because 
this is exactly what she implied in her speech. Will she come 
forward and back up the words she spoke in this House on 
October 4? Not in a million years.
<P>
	The minister clearly liked the bill or he would not have 
endorsed it. Now he is endorsing a major change to the bill. Was 
he influenced by the Supreme Court, his colleagues in the 
Senate, or was it the backbenchers of the Liberal caucus? Will 
these groups be factors in other bills, say perhaps in Bill C-41 
which is also raising its fair share of controversy?
<P>
	We are in support of the amendments that have come back 
from the Senate. However, we are simply frustrated that there 
were not more changes to other important parts of the bill, 
namely the theft over clause. Reformers want a more open 
system of the courts and of government. Do the Liberals?
<P>
	The public and the media have been screaming to open the 
courts for all to see and know. Perhaps it is for inquiring minds 
and perhaps it is for future safety. Reformers look at it for safety 
and the principle of general deterrence. That is why we 
recommended for the disclosure of names of young offenders, 
simply for the good of public safety.
<P>
	Canadians apparently have been calling for a lift on 
publication bans and the Liberals listened for now. Good for 
them for listening. Canadians have definitely called in a louder 
voice for the names of young offenders to be released, but the 
Liberals' ears all of a sudden go deaf. Something is definitely 
wrong.
<P>
	The minister can stand before this House today and say he is 
in support of the amendments which come from the Senate but 
look for future alterations to this same section of the Criminal 
Code. The minister has said he will try again with these limits. 
The Liberal member for London West clearly spelled it out in 
her speech: ``Historically this bill and ones like it were 
introduced on a regular basis. However the last such bill was 
introduced in 1985. The Minister of Justice intends to return to 
the previous pattern. He anticipates bringing forward a second 
bill of this nature once Parliament has dealt with this one''. Need 
I say more?
<P>
	The chamber of sober second thought did not have enough 
second thought about what the public wants in view of the 
demarcation of theft over and theft under. Alternately, deleting 
clauses 61 and 62 leans toward more openness and disclosure in 
the courtroom. The top court of the land has said that freedom of 
the press and the public's right to know what goes on in court 
should be accorded equal weight with the constitutional right to 
a fair trial. The public must be vigilant for systems and 
bureaucracies have a tendency over time to become insular and 
self-serving, thereby more closed to its operations to not submit 
to public scrutiny.
<P>
	We have heard from the other place. They apparently are 
awake over there. If however the system or this government has 
failed in respect to the measure of theft over and theft under in 
the definition, then I call on the government not to proclaim this 
specific section until broader public support can be 
demonstrated for it. It is my reading of the public mood that the 
theft over line is going in the wrong direction.
<P>
	We are in support of the amendments that are before this 
House today dealing with Bill C-42. I think I have clearly gone 
on record to state the dissatisfaction we have with the 
performance of the Senate and the lack of amendments it 
produced.
<P>
	Bill C-42 is a housekeeping bill. The minister is accepting a 
change from the other place. May he also heed what I am saying 
today for the Canadian public is also listening.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rock:</B> I am grateful for this opportunity, Mr. Speaker. I 
just want to comment on one aspect of the hon. member's 
statement concerning these amendments to the bill.
<P>
	As I understood the hon. member he referred to the change in 
the value of property involved in crime in an effort to influence 
the incidence of crime reporting or the crime rates. Perhaps I did 
not understand the hon. member's point. I apologize if I have it 
imprecisely but let me just tell the House lest there be any doubt 
what our rationale was as a government for proposing that 
change.
<P>
<b> (1600) </B>
<P>
	The dollar amount of property involved in such crime is the 
demarcation point for determining where the trial of such 
charges occurs. At and below that amount the trial of such 
charges occurs in the provincial court and within the jurisdiction 
of a provincial court judge. By increasing the amount we have 
increased the number of cases that will be tried in that court, 
without the necessity for the more elaborate procedures of 
preliminary inquiry and the prospect of a trial by judge and jury.
<P>
	The change is intended to reflect agreement on the part of 
participants in the criminal justice system-the provinces that 
administer the system, the prosecutors, the defence lawyers and 
government federally that writes the criminal law-that we 
should encourage the disposition of as many of these cases as 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9013"> 9013 </A></B>
<P>
possible in the least  expensive and most summary locale, which 
is the provincial court.
<P>
	It has nothing to do with crime rates, nothing to do with 
percentages, but everything to do with the more efficient 
administration of justice and always in keeping with the right to 
a fair trial and disposition. I am grateful for the opportunity to 
clarify the matter.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Forseth:</B> Mr. Speaker, the change for theft under or over 
also is a significant change to the available consequences. On 
the principle of stare decisis the justice minister knows that 
there is a going tariff for theft under. This is certainly going to 
change. For the public to get hold of the idea that the common 
tariff or consequence for theft under is now going to include 
property up to $5,000 is quite a considerable shock. When I 
mentioned this recently to some policemen on the street as I was 
riding with them on their shift they could not believe what 
Parliament was doing.
<P>
	I ask the minister to perhaps consult further with the people at 
the line level and delay the proclamation of this amount.

question?

	He said: Mr. Speaker, I begin my little speech about the 
motion to amend by saying that it has been a very frustrating 
experience to go through Bill C-52.
<P>
	We are told it is a routine bill, one that has as its purpose to 
simply bring together a few departments into one. Actually it is 
an action that was done by the previous government and is now 
being rubber stamped by this one.
<P>
	While we were told in committee to hurry, hurry, hurry and 
were not even allowed to listen to witnesses in some cases 
because we were in such a hurry, the message was obviously 
hurry up and wait. That was over a month ago. The bill has been 
on the Order Paper four times and now finally we are here.
<P>
	I want to speak to the motion in amendment. First, this motion 
to amend standing alone is not very meaningful. We have to start 
by listening to the first part of clause 7 which states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In exercising the powers or performing the duties or functions assigned to the 
Minister under this or any other Act of Parliament, the Minister shall</BLOCKQUOTE>
	We are now suggesting that some four clauses be inserted on 
things the minister shall do. I must speak briefly about the 
process. In my little more than one year as a member of 
Parliament I have discovered that as government backbenchers 
or opposition members the only way we have any hope of 
changing anything is to persuade the minister to give the 
instruction that it should be changed.
<P>
	However it is very difficult to persuade the minister if the 
minister will not hear. The only way to get the minister to hear is 
perhaps if we could ask Liberal members who are listening to 
hear the quality of the argument, to assess it and then to decide 
that perhaps these are well founded amendments that should be 
supported. If those members will then twist the arm of the 
minister so that he will give instructions on how the party will 
vote, the amendment will pass. If he does not do that then I speak 
here in vain.
<P>
<b> (1610) </B>
<P>
	Here are the arguments. The first paragraph states: ``refrain, 
where possible, from engaging in activities in direct 
competition with private corporations''. I want members of the 
House to know that my party and I have received a number of 
representations from individuals,  groups and small businesses 
with grave concerns about the government entering into 
competition.
<P>
	There is one kind of competition we welcome in terms of 
government. If an arm of the government has to compete with 
private enterprise where private enterprise has shown that it can 
do things more efficiently, we think the taxpayer gets the best 
break if the private organization will do the work at a lower cost 
to taxpayers. Very often when government gets into a position of 
competing with private enterprise it has a totally unfair 
monopolistic advantage.
<P>
	The reason we are supporting this group of four amendments 
is that we want to ensure that business thrives and indeed 
survives. At least 80 per cent of the economic activity of the 
country is derived from small business. To ask these businesses 
to pay taxes that are used to provide financial backing to the 
government firm or the government agency to compete and 
undercut prices is a violation of a fundamental principle of 
justice and the principle of what is right.
<P>
	Some may wonder about the wording because we have said: 
``refrain, where possible''. It is because I am a bit of a realist and 
somewhat pragmatic. I realize the probability of the motion 
being passed would essentially disappear totally if we made the 
motion hard and effective the way it ought to be.
<P>
	We want at least to insert into the bill the requirement that the 
minister ``refrain, where possible''. I do not know how he could 
determine this. There would be times when he would say it is not 
possible. I suppose that would be subject to debate and perhaps 
even a court investigation to see whether he was living up to the 
terms of this clause in the bill. The important point is that the 
minister would be given the directive to stay out of competing 
with private enterprise.
<P>
	The second paragraph indicates that the minister is to 
``ensure, where possible, that public disclosure of decisions and 
other information is complete and easily accessible''. One 
problem with the way government does business is in the area of 
questioning backroom deals. If we accept the integrity of the 
Liberal government, it has said in its campaign literature and 
has kept on saying that it wants honesty, openness and integrity. 
It would provide the minister with the ability to provide 
openness according to the standards of the governing party, 
according to its words. We are saying ``ensure, where possible'' 
so that it does not come in so hard that they say they are going to 
throw out the amendment of this renegade third party guy.
<P>
<b> (1615 ) </B>
<P>
	We want them to consider it seriously. That is why it has this 
little softening phrase.
<P>
	The third motion is that the minister shall ensure that the 
Queen's Printer for Canada is operated efficiently and compe-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9015"> 9015 </A></B>
<P>
tently, maintaining as a priority the effective use of tax dollars. 
This is the missing ingredient in Bill C-52.
<P>
	The overriding concern of Canadians from sea to sea is that 
we are not being responsible with their tax dollars. We need to 
build into legislation the necessity of being frugal, of saving 
money, of cutting expenses, of balancing the budget, getting rid 
of the deficit.
<P>
	Canadians are demanding this. One way of achieving it is to 
require the ministers to actually maintain as a priority the 
efficient use of taxpayers' dollars in performing these services.
<P>
	In the last several days we have received the report of the 
committee that was studying the Canada Communication 
Group. I am intrigued in reading that report to find that this 
independent review committee has suggested very strongly that 
Canada Communication Group, which as most people know 
does all the printing for the government, among other things, 
should be privatized. It should be sold to private interests so that 
when government has a contract to let, everybody out there is on 
an equal playing field. It is critical that we listen to that report. 
This motion aids that.
<P>
	The fourth subgroup in Motion No. 1 is that the minister shall 
ensure that the reduction of all costs remains a high priority in 
the operations of the department.
<P>
	In other words, this amendment would require that the 
minister pay some attention to the reduction of costs. We in the 
public works and government operations committee could then 
ask him to be accountable when he comes before the committee.
<P>
	We could say to the minister: Mr. Minister, how did you 
express cost cutting efficiency as a high priority? From minister 
to minister we can insist that there be measures taken to be 
totally efficient.
<P>
	In conclusion, the four points in the motion, if given careful 
thought, are very reasonable. I urge all members to support these 
amendments, not because I have asked them to, although 
obviously I agree or I would not have proposed the motion. I do 
not urge them to support them because the Reform Party 
supports them. If they did so, partisanship would enter and they 
would automatically oppose the motion. I urge those members 
to consider supporting this motion strictly and totally because it 
best represents the needs and the aspirations of Canadians who 
are footing the bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like for a few moments to add a few thoughts to 
the debate.
<P>
	Much of what I would add has been said in the previous 
readings of the bill. However I would like to illustrate 
something that has been brought to my attention by a number of 
very interested parties and that is the desire of the federal 
government to begin to compete with private enterprise at the 
very time it is ostensibly getting out of business or privatizing.
<P>
	The illustrations that I would use today will probably deal 
most directly with the post office but I would also like to bring in 
the example of Canada Mortgage and Housing and its appraisal 
process. I would also like to speak briefly about the impact of 
the bill and the ability that it gives the minister to compete in the 
private sector with the engineering fraternity.
<P>
<b> (1620 ) </B>
<P>
	Ostensibly the bill is a routine housekeeping bill that has the 
effect of consolidating the department. When we are 
considering the intrusion of the federal government into private 
enterprise or into areas that could be better served by private 
enterprise, we have to keep in mind that the government brings 
an enormous weight and an enormous amount of sway to the 
table whenever it decides it is going to get into a business.
<P>
	Before I entered the political realm I was in the photo 
finishing business. I can remember being absolutely appalled 
when some years ago the post office was trying desperately to 
recoup some of its losses. The thought perhaps never occurred to 
the post office that one of the ways it could increase the use of its 
product was to provide a faster, better and more efficient 
service. It decided it was going to expand its product line. I 
believe it was Consumers Distributing products that were going 
to become available in post offices.
<P>
	There I was, a small businessman, paying taxes to support the 
post office and finding myself in a position where I would be 
competing with the post office. Fortunately this did not come to 
pass.
<P>
	Recently it was brought to my attention, and I am sure to the 
attention of other hon. members present, that the post office 
once again, as it was privatizing and becoming a crown 
corporation, was trying to increase its revenue rather than trying 
to decrease its expenses. It had announced a 2 cent price increase 
in the cost of a stamp. The post office had made, I think, a $26 
million profit that year.
<P>
	The post office was increasing the price of a stamp because it 
had to have more money. However, there were many sceptics 
who thought that perhaps the reason it was going to increase the 
first class postage rate was because it wanted to cross-subsidize 
and get into other businesses.
<P>
	The post office started with a tremendous advantage as a 
crown corporation. It had a distribution network coast to coast. 
Imagine the situation, if you will, of someone being in the 
instant printing business, as has happened right here in Ottawa. 
They wake up one day, open their mail delivered to them through 
the post office, because of course the post office has a monopoly 
on the delivery of first class mail, and it is a survey from Canada

as typesetting, small run instant printing, the kinds of things that 
as one comes to the post office it would be kind of convenient to 
have right there. The trouble is the world does not need another 
instant printer. Instant printers are all over the place and they 
have, by and large, got themselves into business at their own 
expense.
<P>
	Now they find themselves in a situation where they are 
competing directly with a crown corporation that has a 
monopoly on first class postage and can raise prices so it can 
compete with the private sector.
<P>
	Another instance that has come to my attention concerning 
the post office has to do with it purchasing a courier company, I 
believe it was Purolator, and then going into competition with 
other people in the courier business. If the post office feels that 
it has the right, the purview and the privilege of going into 
competition with existing businesses, then should not existing 
businesses and other courier companies have the same right to 
go into competition with Canada Post? If Canada Post can 
compete with small business why then can business not compete 
with Canada Post?
<P>
	It would be absolutely reasonable and fair that if Canada Post 
intends to continue down this path, it should find itself 
competing for the first class postage delivery.
<P>
<b> (1625 ) </B>
<P>
	If the post office finds itself in competition when delivering 
first class mail, what will happen? I bet the mail will be 
delivered faster. I bet it will be delivered on Saturday and I 
wager it will be delivered for less. Usually when there is 
competition the consumer benefits.
<P>
	Now we have the reverse situation where a crown corporation 
with a monopoly on the delivery of first class mail is able to use 
the profit generated by the monopoly situation to 
cross-subsidize its ambit into other areas of business.
<P>
	I submit to hon. members this is not right. It is not fair and it is 
counterproductive to the notion of free enterprise and 
privatization which is absolutely essential as our country moves 
down the path toward becoming self-sufficient and not 
becoming a sinkhole for taxpayers' money.
<P>
	The third example I would like to raise is the question-this is 
part of the broader, more general intrusion of government into 
business-of Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation and 
the practice of agents who work for Canada Mortgage and 
Housing to do appraisals on real estate in competition with the 
many competent people in private business who are licensed to 
provide that service.
<P>
	Does this not have the potential for conflict of interest? An 
employee of Canada Mortgage and Housing is going out and 
doing an appraisal on a property that would be financed by 
Canada Mortgage and Housing. Is that not the same kind of one 
hand feeding the other dealsmanship that got us into a problem 
in some of the other financial institutions? Would it not be better 
if Canada Mortgage and Housing were required to have third 
party appraisals?
<P>
	I suggest this kind of creeping intrusion of crown 
corporations into the sphere of private enterprise is not only 
counterproductive, but it is unhealthy for our economy because 
it does not bring in the discipline of the marketplace.
<P>
	The last and final example I would like to bring to the 
attention of the House is that Bill C-52, at least according to the 
Canadian Association of Professional Engineers, would give the 
public service the mandate, the free rein, to set up in 
competition with professional engineers. As a matter of fact 
``the bill's loose wording gives complete power to bureaucrats. 
The sections read that the minister may incur expenditures or 
perform or have performed services or work in relation to any 
federal real property, or any other non-crown property with the 
consent of its owners''.
<P>
	As the government devolves from the sphere of private 
enterprise as we are wont and forced to do, in my opinion it 
would be a very good precedent for this Parliament to set to say 
that if private enterprise has the ability and the desire to compete 
in any sphere, then the government through a crown corporation 
or directly will not compete as a matter of principle.
<P>
	I would ask that hon. members present give thought to these 
concerns and whenever the opportunity arises, to give private 
enterprise the advantage over public enterprise.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to speak on Bill C-52 and to support the Reform 
Party's motion because it is an improvement on the bill tabled by 
the government.
<P>
	Unfortunately, Bill C-52 lacks vision and backbone. This bill 
in no way improves the government's regulations. It is so bad 
that some clauses and provisions in this bill are regressive. It is 
going backwards-the Liberals and this government are going 
backwards.
<P>
<b> (1630) </B>
<P>
	This bill makes changes which are bad for private enterprise 
or do not improve openness or access to information. You know 
as well as I do that if there is a department where patronage, 
favoritism and unfairness are rampant, that is wasteful and 
contributes to the government's deficit, it is Public Works.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9017"> 9017 </A></B>
<P>
	I admit, anyone who reviews Bill C-52 will know the impact 
it can have on the operation of the Department of Public Works 
and Government Services. Anyone can see how important it is to 
improve the operation of this department. It would have been 
easy for the minister to suggest changes to the acts governing 
these departments, Public Works and Government Services, for 
instance, to introduce as a code of ethics to regulate contracting 
out, which is increasing and almost out of control in the federal 
government.
<P>
	The minister could also have given officials the power to 
disclose information, he could have empowered officials in his 
department and given them the chance to blow the whistle on 
mismanagement and government waste. Or the minister could 
have suggested amendments that would have given the public 
and members of this House better and easier access to 
information so that this department and this government avoid 
waste, thus reducing the deficit.
<P>
	But no. This is a very lacklustre bill that contains nothing new 
and was introduced by a minister who seems near-sighted, and 
that is very worrisome. I wonder if this reflects the spirit of the 
government. The minister introduced a bill that does not 
improve in any way an old act containing provisions which 
hinder its efficiency. It is worrisome to have someone at the 
helm who is near-sighted.
<P>
	As the Reform Party member mentioned earlier, the debate in 
committee on Bill C-52 was illogical, if not insane. We made 
very good suggestions to improve this legislation, but the 
Liberal members refused to listen, or else they were unable to 
grasp the underlying logic. Perhaps they have less brains than 
their own minister, who is already pretty blind. We got the 
distinct impression that they were only interested in having this 
legislation passed as quickly as possible, without any 
amendment.
<P>
	They refused to let the committee hear witnesses on 
amendments to some clauses of the bill which have a very 
serious impact on the operations of the department, and which 
involve the right of the government to interfere in the private 
sector, particularly in the consulting-engineer sector.
<P>
<b> (1635) </B>
<P>
	This legislation is very poor; it contains nothing new and it 
reflects a total lack of imagination. This is why we will support 
the Reform Party motion, not because it is the best possible one. 
Paragraph (<I>c</I>) reads: ``ensure that the Queen's Printer for Canada 
is operated efficiently and competently-'', while paragraph (<I>d</I>) 
says: ``ensure that the reduction of all costs remains a high 
priority-''. These are pious wishes which carry no legal 
weight. Nevertheless, we are prepared to support this motion, 
although it has no real impact on the Department of Public 
Works.
<P>
	However, paragraphs (<I>a</I>) and (<I>b</I>) are a definite improvement 
over the existing bill. In the case of (<I>b</I>), the Department of 
Public Works is encouraged to open the door to information, to 
reveal more information to the private sector or the general 
public on the way contracts are awarded, and to improve access 
to information, which is now extremely difficult to obtain. As I 
said before, it is an improvement. The department and the 
Liberal government must provide access to information, 
especially on the process of awarding contracts.
<P>
	I think the Reform Party's motion is an improvement, but it is 
flawed because of the words: ``where possible''. There is no 
legal obligation on the government to disclose information if the 
motion is worded this way. My point is that the words ``where 
possible'' open the door to all kinds of abuse and arguments 
preventing access to information, preventing the government 
from disclosing information on contracts or even members of 
Parliament from having access to such information when 
contracts are awarded in their own riding. This is not 
satisfactory.
<P>
	We run into the same problem in paragraph (<I>a</I>) of the motion, 
which deals with a matter that is even more serious, coming 
from the Department of Public Works. A Reform Party member 
already mentioned the problem about opening the door to 
competition between the federal government and the private 
sector. Paragraph (<I>a</I>) of motion No. 1 tries to prevent the 
government from competing with the private sector. But again, 
``where possible''. These words open the door to all kinds of 
abuse. The fact is that basically, the Department of Public Works 
should not have the right to compete with the private sector.
<P>
	We are talking about a substantial part of this bill. This is a 
new power the Minister of Public Works has acquired. It is very 
skilfully done, by the way, because clause 5 is already an 
introduction to this new power and clause 10 as well, and of 
course clause 16, which we will have a chance to discuss later 
on.
<P>
	For the first time in the history of the Government of Canada, 
we have a proposal that the federal government should compete 
directly with private businesses, especially engineering firms 
which, incidentally, are well established in Quebec. Several 
members in this House, including Liberal members, I am sure, 
have received representations from SNC Lavalin, HBA, Tecsult, 
and more than 100 companies altogether that are concerned 
about the unfair competition in which the federal government is 
about to engage through Bill C-52. So although this Reform 
Party motion does not go far enough, we on the Bloc side still 
think it is a definite improvement over the bill as it stands.
<P>
<b> (1640) </B>
<P>
	In concluding, the Bloc will try to amend this good motion 
from the Reform Party. I therefore move, seconded by the hon. 
member for Charlevoix:

order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
President of the Treasury Board, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I wish to 
make a few comments on what has been said, and then I will 
highlight the key points with respect to this motion.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The first colleague who addressed this bill called it a routine 
bill, which it is. It is an important bill but a routine bill.
<P>
	Members have complicated it. Either they have not 
understood it and therefore by virtue of that it has been 
complicated for them or they have understood it and by virtue of 
that they have tried to take advantage of it for political reasons.
<P>
	We talk about not having been able to get witnesses. Of course 
we had witnesses but there comes a time when we have to stop 
meeting. Are we going to wait for the whole of Canada to come 
forward? We know that many of the witnesses had absolutely 
nothing to do, the witnesses they wanted, with clarifying the 
elements.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
And the only reason was petty politics, an attempt to embarrass 
the government, pure and simple.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	My colleague refers to backroom deals. What backroom 
deals? If he knows of a backroom deal put it on the table. He 
should not suggest that members of government have been 
dishonest. Either put up or be quiet. It is inappropriate behaviour 
for any member to be suggesting that someone else has been 
dishonest. Either he has proof or he does not. Do not slur the 
reputation of colleagues. That is not the way a parliamentarian is 
supposed to act.
<P>
	He refers to the question of desire to compete. I have any 
number of quotes I can bring forward by reputable Canadian 
organizations, some of them from the province of Quebec, that 
indicate quite clearly that they do not see this as the 
government's intent to try to compete.
<P>
	We are trying to get the best deal when we are dealing with 
other governments for Canadians. That is what we are trying to 
do. We are trying to respond to the private sector if it asks us to 
respond to assist it. I would be delighted to share some of those 
in the process of this particular debate.
<P>
	The second speaker referred to Canada Post and CMHC, I 
guess the point being that government is becoming increasingly 
involved with the private sector. I hope it was not suggested that 
Canada Post and CMHC are somehow involved with this 
legislation. I want to make it perfectly clear they are not. I would 
dispute the claims being made with respect to government 
competing with the private sector in those instances as well.
<P>
	I want to point out very quickly that one of the weaknesses of 
the particular motion, and it has been addressed in part, is where 
possible what would happen if this were to go through?
<P>
<b> (1645) </B>
<P>
	The opposition would always say it was possible and we did 
not do it. All of us thought we would be debating in the House of 
Commons the interpretation of where possible is. On that very 
basis it has to be set aside.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	As I said earlier, I do not wish to accuse all the members of the 
Bloc of engaging in petty politics. But the one who just spoke 
made accusations of patronage, without any proof, of 
favouritism, without proof, and waste, also without proof. It is 
very easy to make such accusations in the House of Commons 
and not back them up. This is unfortunate, most unfortunate.
<P>
	He said that the minister lacks vision. This is insulting! 
Because he does not understand the bill, he blames the minister. 
Because the bill has limited scope, he accuses the minister of 
lacking vision. This is too bad. He says that the Liberal members 
are deaf and blind. How insulting to those people who are so 
afflicted! That is what he said, Mr. Speaker. Now, I suppose he 
will deny it. In the House of Commons, he can say anything he 
wants, without proof. He likes to hear himself speak. How very 
unfortunate!
<P>
	To top off everything he has done and said, he criticized the 
motion and then went on to say that he will support it. What a 
contradiction!
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I simply wanted to mention that I have been very patient in 
this first round. Not all of the comments have been terribly 
relevant but in the second round I shall try to make awfully 
certain that I bring to members' collective attention any 
comments that are off topic.
<P>
	I have a few more comments to make and I shall be brief. I 
know that my colleagues are anxious to get on to other 
palpitating clauses and motions as I am. With regard to the 
motion that was made, the amendments proposed by my 
colleague from Elk Island are already addressed in clause 
7(1)(a) as amended by the committee.
<P>
	I want to read that clause and make awfully sure that I do not 
mislead anyone. Clause 7 has already been amended at 
committee and the words ``and for enhancing the integrity and 
efficiency and the contrasting process'' were added to the 
clause.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9019"> 9019 </A></B>
<P>
	With respect to competition, one of the issues, we have 
already addressed this at great length in committee and we will 
be talking about it some more. This is the debate. This is it. We 
are in disagreement.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We are not in agreement. That is fine, no problem. Do you 
want me to produce my 1,000 witnesses? You will produce a 
thousand more, and then we will decide who makes the most 
sense. Well, I think that sometimes you have to pause and start 
afresh.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	On public disclosure, members know as well as I that the 
minister has offered to the members of this House the open 
bidding system, the government business opportunities 
publication. He has provided guidelines for advertising and 
public research by the government.
<P>
	This minister and this government have been open and 
transparent. Those members have not been able to get the 
figures when they wanted them in terms of what they wanted 
even though those have not been available, and so they choose to 
attack the government and pretend that it was less than up front.
<P>
	With regard to the Queen's Printer we want what the member 
wants but we want it for all of the government's operations, that 
is, being efficient and cost effective. The Queen's Printer has 
had a long and proud history providing government and 
advancing the printing industry. When there was a problem in 
that sector, the minister moved forward boldly and corrected the 
situation.
<P>
	With respect to efficiency and savings they suggest 4,000 
people, a billion dollars saved by the year 2005. I guess when 
you say that you really do not care very much about the 4,000 
families that are going to be affected or you do not understand 
how much a billion dollars is-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I hesitate to interrupt any 
member at any time but occasionally the Chair tries to remind 
all of us to come through the Chair and not be direct to one 
another across the floor of the House. I ask the member to keep 
that in mind.
<P>
<b> (1650 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duhamel:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the reminder. My 
enthusiasm is a result of being upset at my colleague being so 
unfair and having exaggerated so much. In the spirit of 
Christmas I thought there would have been some gentleness.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I thought there would have been a little kindness, a little 
open-mindedness, but obviously they are not yet aware of the 
approaching festive season.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I think I have made the major points. The way it is worded, as I 
have indicated, the debate would be whenever it is possible. We 
simply cannot do this. We believe it has already been covered. 
We believe this government has been open and transparent and 
we believe we are going forward in the right direction.
<P>
	I will limit my remarks at this time. I assure my colleagues 
that I am ready for a lot more.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Before proceeding on the 
debate of Motion No. 1, it is my duty pursuant to Standing Order 
38 to inform the House that the questions to be raised tonight at 
the time of adjournment are as follows: The hon. member for 
Saint John-Rail Line Abandonment; the hon. member for 
Quebec-Social Program Reform; the hon. member for 
Manicouagan-Canada Labour Code; the hon. member for 
Vegreville-the Canadian Wheat Board; the hon. member for 
Regina-Lumsden-Banks.
<P>
	Resuming debate on Motion No. 1, keep in mind that 
members who have already spoken must wait until we proceed 
to the next motion. Members have 10-minute interventions 
without questions or comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Epp:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order. I am sure you will 
correct me if I am wrong, but do I not have an opportunity now to 
speak since there has been an amendment to my motion?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I thank the member for 
Elk Island. He has learned very quickly. He is ahead of me. I do 
not mind telling the member that yes there has been an 
amendment and he can speak again.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have some 
statements which are relevant to the amendment. I do not know 
if you noticed, but I think I was very close to being on topic 
speaking about the four points of my amendment one by one. I 
was very careful to do that.
<P>
	I would like to say a few things partially in rebuttal to the hon. 
member from the Liberal Party who just spoke. He indicated 
how patient he has been. I suppose if we were to blow up our 
chests a little those of us on the other side would say that we too 
have tried to exercise patience in trying to work together and I 
shall continue to do that. It is not my objective here to merely 
fight for the sake of fighting. I want to do what is right and what 
is best for the Canadian people.
<P>
	The member said that there was a time to a stop in these 
discussions. I think the record ought to show that we probably 
discussed Bill C-52 in committee for 10 hours maximum. That 
is my estimate. We heard one witness. That is my recollection of 
it. I stand to be corrected if that is wrong.
<P>
	Second, the member made some statement about backroom 
deals. I did not accuse anybody about backroom deals. I said the 
perception out there among the people is that governments 
engage in backroom deals. Because the Liberal government has 
said it wants more  openness and honesty and integrity, and 
Reformers are also saying this, surely we can agree that we will 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9020"> 9020 </A></B>
<P>
do away with any reality of that which may have occurred in the 
past. Let me be really charitable in the spirit of Christmas and 
say it happened before the Liberals were elected, some of them, 
at least to the government side.
<P>
	We need to do away with not only the reality of it but the 
perception of it. The only way to guarantee that the perception is 
removed is by actually putting into legislation that there is this 
openness.
<P>
	With respect to the amendment to my motion that says ``where 
possible'', I do not know how to say this in such a way that it 
does not come out wrong. I am going to try very hard to do that. 
The only reason that we inserted these two words in sections (a) 
and (b) was the government side. Observing the way discussions 
went in our committee and recognizing that if we were to come 
with an amendment which would be very hard and which would 
say the minister must engage or make sure, refrain from 
engaging in activities and so on, we were quite certain that the 
Liberal side would have just said nix to it. We softened it 
deliberately for them, to give them an opportunity to vote for 
this so that the minister has greater flexibility. That is why the 
words are there, to say ``where possible''.
<P>
<b> (1655) </B>
<P>
	I know the hon. member from the Bloc is most sincere and 
actually made an amendment to my motion to remove those 
words which would have been my first choice. I know they do 
not have a chance of getting it passed. Instead of not going 
anywhere, I would like to at least move the government a little in 
the right direction, and that is why we said ``where possible'. 
That is my comment with respect to the amendment that has 
been made.
<P>
	In the spirit of Christmas, if I may quote the hon. member for 
St. Boniface, in the spirit of gentleness let us get together on this 
and let us vote in favour of the motion but let us leave those 
words in so that the Liberals can feel comfortable voting for it.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Resuming debate on the 
amendment to Motion No. 1.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gérard Asselin (Charlevoix, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
support the amendment to the amendment to Motion No. 1 
moved by the hon. member for Québec-Est, to delete the words 
``where possible'' and here is why.
<P>
	First, Bill C-52 provides the government with the opportunity 
to amalgamate Public Works Canada, Supply and Services 
Canada and the Translation Service. It appears to us that, in the 
context of a bill, ``where possible'' is little more than idle talk, 
as the hon. member for Québec-Est indicated. Such words also 
leave room for interpretation and favouritism.
<P>
	At the same time, we could expect -I hope it will not be the 
case under this government as it was under the previous one- 
that this will encourage the granting of contracts to friends of 
the regime and leave the door wide open for lobbyists. It is only 
natural for lobbyists who attend luncheons at $1,000 a plate 
organized by the federal government to be tempted to come and 
knock on the doors of Liberal members to get contracts. It has 
been done before the Liberals came to power and I would hope 
that, in a spirit of openness and transparency, the member will 
not object to seeing things change.
<P>
	Quoting the red book, the Liberal government talked about 
transparency during the campaign. There have been several 
books and papers since, of course. We have gone from red book 
to green paper, from green to purple, from purple to orange, 
from orange to grey and we certainly hope that all these will not 
result in a black paper.
<P>
	So, in a spirit of transparency and goodwill in administering 
public assets, you, the Liberal government, hold a majority of 
seats. If ridicule kills, that is why the Conservative government 
no longer exists. And if you continue to be wasteful with respect 
to contracting-out and privatization, your days are numbered, 
gentlemen.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order! As I said a moment 
ago, you are encouraged not to address one another directly 
across the floor, but rather through the Chair. It may be more 
useful someday.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Asselin:</B> Mr. Speaker, you scared me. I was sure you were 
about to say that one day I, the member for Charlevoix, might 
occupy the Speaker's chair.

	In close co-operation, the member for Québec-Est, the

public works and governmental affairs, and myself have shown

testimony. We took the time to listen to the witnesses and asked 
appropriate questions.
<P>

clause 16 of this bill, which allows the government to compete 
with private engineering firms.

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Motion No. 3</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-52 be amended by deleting Clause 16.</BLOCKQUOTE>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Chamberlain:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am glad to have the 
opportunity to put forward an amendment to clause 16. With this 
amendment, the requirement for governor in council approval 
under clause 16(b) is being proposed. This will allay some of the 
concerns that the members in our particular task group on 
government operations had. I hope they are going to support this 
amendment.
<P>
	Concerns have been expressed by some members of the 
private sector also. For example, the Association of Consulting 
Engineers of Canada, which represents 14 per cent of the 
consulting engineering community, has expressed reservations 
about 16(b) opening the door for public works and government 
services to compete with the private sector.
<P>
	I want to be very clear on this point. The bill does not permit 
the department to compete with the private sector. It cannot even 
respond to requests for proposals. That is very clear in this.
<P>
<b> (1705 ) </B>
<P>
	The authorities contained in clause 16 are not new. They are 
contained in section 13 of the current Department of Supply and 
Services Act. This section enables the department to; first, work 
with the other levels of government to reduce overlap and 
duplication; second, to partner with the private sector when 
requested. The introduction of a requirement for an order in 
council, as I propose, guarantees a higher level of authority and 
accountability. It will ensure that the department only partners 
or engages in reduction of duplication with provinces with the 
direction from the cabinet. We cannot get a greater safeguard 
than that. This is pure accountability.
<P>
	Currently PWGSC has over 120 active bilateral initiatives for 
areas of discussion with provinces and territories in services 
ranging from translation, bulk purchasing and co-operative 
procurement practices, real property management and shared 
accommodation. These are aimed at reducing overlap and 
duplication. Hence, savings for taxpayers. This is something 
that we promised to do. It is something we all promised to do. 
Every single party in the Chamber promised savings for 
taxpayers.
<P>
	If other levels of government approach PWGSC with a view to 
co-operating in the provision of cost-effective services related 
to any of its 21 service lines, the department should be and must 
be in a position to consider such requests in the interest of the 
taxpayer. This is consistent with the government's election 
commitment to work closely with provincial governments to 
reduce duplication and improve service delivery in all areas 
where governments are involved.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, if you think you have heard that quote before, 
well you have. You will find it in the red book at page 23. We 
cannot forget that there is only one taxpayer in Canada. We have 
a responsibility to work co-operatively to ensure the most 
efficient and cost effective delivery of services possible for 
Canadian tax dollars.
<P>
	This is what clause 16 guarantees to all of us as Canadian 
taxpayers. Clause 16 of Bill C-52 assists in fostering the spirit 
of co-operation and partnership between the government and 
the private sector. This is especially important for the small and 
medium sized businesses that are currently requesting 
partnerships with the government.
<P>
	As we stated in the red book, the crucial role of the 
government is to work with the private sector to identify 
strategic opportunities for the future and then to redirect its 
existing 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9022"> 9022 </A></B>
<P>
resources toward the fulfilment of these opportunities; again, a 
quote from the red book, page 44.
<P>
	We are moving on our campaign goals and our promises. The 
government is committed to working with the private sector to 
identify strategic opportunities and to redirect our existing 
resources toward the fulfilment of all these opportunities when 
requested.
<P>
	The opportunities clause 16 offers for partnerships with the 
PWGSC, businesses, particularly small and medium sized 
businesses, can lever the federal government, use its experience 
and expertise to create and expand new markets, particularly 
foreign markets and to create jobs. Private sector jobs, is this not 
what we are all about? Is this not why we are here today?
<P>
	This Liberal government recognizes that when Canadian 
businesses prosper abroad Canadians prosper at home. The 
government has heard the concerns of the private sector, 
including the Association of Consulting Engineers of Canada. It 
rightly feels that it should not have to compete with government. 
At the same time it supports public-private partnership as long 
as it is industry led.
<P>
	I quote the association's president who appeared before us in 
committee. He said he is ``not against private-public 
partnerships where the private sector is in the lead role and not 
the other way around''.
<P>
	PWGSC has received many letters indicating support for 
industry led government partnership initiatives including letters 
from members of the Association of Consulting Engineers of 
Canada. I have many quotes from letters that we have received 
in support of Bill C-52.
<P>
<b> (1710 ) </B>
<P>
	The government recognizes that no legitimate purpose would 
be served by allowing the department to compete with the 
private sector. I would not support that. In fact, when there has 
been actual or perceived competition with the private sector, the 
Minister of Public Works and Government Services has moved 
swiftly to rectify the situation.
<P>
	For example, he took action to address the concerns of the 
printing industry with the Canada Communication Group. With 
clause 16, Bill C-52 moves the government down a path of 
reducing the tax burden for Canadians while assisting business 
in partnership, on request. The proposed amendment put 
forward ensures greater accountability in this process. For these 
reasons I encourage all members of the House to support this 
amendment.
<P>
	To do less is not doing what our taxpayers want us to do. They 
want us to reduce duplication. They want us to see where we can 
help firms in public practices when requested. When we can 
with tax dollars help them, they want us to do that. To do any less 
is irresponsible. I call on all members to support this 
amendment.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
once again, government members confuse and mislead the 
public with their arguments that do not hold  water. For instance, 
they say that the president of the association of consulting 
engineers of Canada agrees with this motion. I can tell you that I 
was on the phone with him this morning, as I have been 
repeatedly these past few weeks, and he keeps telling me that he 
is against this motion and this clause in Bill C-52.
<P>
	I want to tell the government that the association has 
demonstrated its opposition by issuing countless press releases 
stating that the government is not listening, that ``The 
government is not listening, it is encroaching on our markets''. 
The association, which is concentrated in Quebec, represents 
800 consulting engineering firms whose 35,000 members 
question this bill.
<P>
	The government member would have us believe that the 
government is creating jobs. This is pure nonsense. What this 
clause does is threaten high-quality jobs that have evolved over 
several years, perhaps mostly in Quebec, jobs that are not 
created overnight. What is at stake here is top expertise that our 
consulting engineering firms have demonstrated around the 
world. It is mainly this sector which is being targeted.
<P>
	The government cannot mislead the population by saying, as 
my colleague did earlier, that it does not intend to compete with 
the private sector.
<P>
	The minister himself said in a letter that ``in response to your 
question, the primary purpose of Bill C-52 is''-imagine 
that-``to authorize Public Works and Government Services 
Canada to provide common services to the departments, boards 
and agencies of the Canadian government''. Clause 16 increases 
this power by allowing the minister to provide common 
services, similar to those offered by federal Crown corporations, 
to other governments and to the private sector in Canada and 
abroad.
<P>
	A few paragraphs further, the minister goes on to say: 
``Clause 16 is not intended to make the Department of Public 
Works and Government Services into a fierce competitor of the 
private sector''. Certainly not a fierce competitor, but a 
competitor nonetheless under the monstrous guise of trying to 
compete and reduce this government's deficit through 
economies of scale.
<P>
<b> (1715) </B>
<P>
	Let me give you an example. What is proposed is that the 
government would provide all the supplies, as well as all other 
goods and services, not only to itself but maybe also to the 
provinces, the territories and the municipalities across the 
country. This is a concentration of purchases. If we had a warped 
mind like some government members, we might think that there 
are economies of scale or savings to be made. But we know very 
well that this is not the case. This would only create a monster 
like the former U.S.S.R. That country enjoyed a government 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9023"> 9023 </A></B>
<P>
monopoly and had economies of scale in every sector. But look 
at what happened to the U.S.S.R.: it no longer exists.
<P>
	The basic problem is that the government does not understand 
that the public and private sectors each have a specific role to 
play. When you mix the two together, particularly if the federal 
government starts to compete with the private sector, the whole 
system becomes skewed, because the federal government can 
hide all sorts of costs. It can change numbers to make it look as 
though a particular item or service costs less or money is saved 
here or there. In this way, the government can compete with 
certain companies and put them out of business, while favouring 
friends of the party. This is wonderful-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Asselin:</B> This is what you call progressive federalism.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Marchand:</B> Precisely. In Quebec, we want to avoid this at 
all costs, because clause 16 shows a blatant lack of 
understanding on the part of this government. It seems that the 
government does not even understand the strongest tendencies 
in the economy and in modern politics. The government should 
not go for concentration and centralization. Centralizing all 
federal, provincial, municipal and other purchases and sales in 
the country will not result in savings.
<P>
	Such a move goes against the most elementary and basic rules 
of economy. This government proposes a bill, clause 16 in 
particular, which goes against basic economic rules. This is why 
the government and the people of Quebec are anxious to leave a 
regime which is headed the wrong way, as confirmed 
unequivocally by clause 16.
<P>
	Despite all the representations made by the private sector and 
all the issues raised with members and the Minister of Public 
Works, there seems to have been no realization that perhaps this 
clause should have been deleted or even the previous legislation 
reinstated.
<P>
	The consulting engineering sector suggested it preferred the 
previous act, because Bill C-52 which we are considering today 
gives the minister additional powers, powers that did not exist 
before. It is the only really new element in this bill. The rest is 
not new, just a bunch of provisions that have been revamped. 
However, this new element is almost an insult to the intelligence 
of people who understand the workings of our economy. It is a 
threat to an industrial sector that is thriving and highly 
specialized, and it opens the door to unfair competition and, 
once again, to even more patronage.
<P>
<b> (1720) </B>
<P>
	Clause 16 certainly does not encourage people who are the 
slightest bit familiar with the operation of the Department of 
Public Works to support this provision. In fact, Mr. Speaker, 
suggestions by the government that perhaps these overtures to 
the private sector should be made in consultation with the 
business community would actually make no difference at all.
<P>
	This clause gives the government complete latitude to operate 
on the turf of the private sector, where it has no business to be, 
because, I repeat, this opens the door to patronage and is a threat 
to industries that, over the years, have developed an expertise 
that is appreciated and an expertise they want to maintain. The 
government has no business in this sector. And that is why we in 
the Bloc are opposed to this clause and to the government's 
amendment.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am a little 
frustrated in getting up here. This amendment comes from the 
Liberal side. I know the way things work around here with the 
majority over there and the less than majority over here that it 
will pass and what we say probably will not.
<P>
	I will not miss this opportunity to go on record as powerfully 
and as strongly as I can to say that this is not the answer to the 
problems we have in this country, specifically on this one issue.
<P>
	When I first saw this amendment I thought of a television 
show I watched for about 10 minutes one day. This lady was put 
into a box; the box was closed; the magician sawed her right in 
half. It was incredible. Her body was cut in two. Then he opened 
the box and she was fine again, there was no severance. That is 
what this particular amendment does. It gives the illusion of 
accomplishing something but really nothing is accomplished at 
all.
<P>
	It is important for us in considering what we are talking about 
to really know what this motion says. Originally it said the 
minister may do anything for or on behalf of any department, 
board, or agency of the Government of Canada or a crown 
corporation or any government body or person in Canada or 
elsewhere.
<P>
	It was mentioned earlier here that this was already in the 
previous act, the one this bill replaces. Not quite right. The two 
words ``or elsewhere'' were added. In other words the ability of 
the government to perform these functions now goes even 
outside of our country according to what it first proposed.
<P>
	We now have this amendment. It still has exactly the same 
words except the one little word ``a'' has been taken out. Other 
than that the words are all there. The only difference is that for 
the minister to do anything for or on behalf of any government 
body or person in Canada or elsewhere, he or she must now 
obtain the approval of cabinet. In other words there is no 
restriction at all on whether or not government can still do 
anything for anybody.
<P>
	The other day I was giving a little speech to a few people. I 
said the rough paraphrase of clause 16 of Bill C-52 was simply 
that the minister may do anything for anyone and the taxpayers 
pick up the bill. It was then said to me that that was not quite fair 
and that I was overstating it. Yet, it is very difficult to read 
anything else into this when it says that the minister may do 
anything  for or on behalf of, and then everything listed includes 
anybody because finally it gets down to that every entity is 
<P>

<B><A NAME="9024"> 9024 </A></B>
<P>
either a government, a government agency, a body, or a person. 
There is no exclusion.
<P>
<b> (1725 ) </B>
<P>
	I would also like to make reference to a quotation. It is from a 
letter written by no other than the minister himself. These are his 
words: ``I have already decided that Public Works and 
Government Services Canada will not be competing with the 
private sector by offering services outside the federal 
government''. That quotation is from a letter signed by the 
Minister of Public Works and Government Services.
<P>
	I am at a loss to understand if that is his intention why he 
would hesitate for a second to state that in the legislation. The 
legislation says one thing and the minister says exactly the 
opposite. He is trying to assure us and the critics of this bill that 
we ought not to worry because it is not his intention to do this. 
Yet the bill clearly says that the government may do it. I do not 
see where the logic lies there; it misses me completely and I 
think it would miss anybody who stopped to think about it.
<P>
	We have had a number of very strong presentations on the 
intrusion of government into private enterprise. I have a whole 
stack of them here. I know I cannot refer to them so I will not, 
Mr. Speaker, but they are here. Most of them are from small 
business firms and notably among them are consulting 
engineers. I will not quote it but I remember one of them said 
that this legislation cuts right to the very core of small 
engineering firms whose lifeblood is bidding on and providing 
services for provinces and municipalities.
<P>
	This legislation now says that the taxpayer is going to be 
subsidizing the competition because government agencies are 
also going to be bidding. That introduces such a large unfairness 
into the free enterprise process.
<P>
	I would also like to read a statement from a very well-known 
organization which does things along the lines of analysing our 
economic problems and difficulties and solutions to those 
problems. This is that organization's assessment of this bill, not 
mine: ``It is clear that if the implication of the bill is that the 
federal government intends in any way to engage in the 
undertaking of work for private purposes in competition with 
contractors in the private sector, this would be entirely wrong 
and the bill ought to specifically preclude the federal 
government from doing this''.
<P>
	There are other references. As I said I have many of them here 
from individuals, groups and businesses. They all give the 
message that the government should not be in the business of 
competing with private enterprise, period. Why it is in this 
legislation at all is a total mystery to me.
<P>
	Now there is an amendment that clause 16 ought to be 
amended by dividing the two parts. One part says to let the 
minister go ahead, but in the other part he has to get a nod from 
the other cabinet ministers, behind closed doors, no openness, 
no accountability and no restriction on what he can do for 
anyone anywhere on planet earth.
<P>
	I object. On behalf of all of those people who wrote to me and 
my colleagues, I object. I object on behalf of all of those small 
businesses, those engineering firms, the printers, the small 
newspapers who wrote. They said they do not like having 
government taxation subsidy driving them out of business. For 
all of them I say as strongly as I can, please, members of this 
House, reconsider this. Do not pass this legislation and then 
regret it later because I know you will.

	The House resumed from November 15 consideration of the 
motion and of the amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. George S. Rideout (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Natural Resources, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to have an opportunity to rise and speak on this motion 
of the member for Scarborough-Rouge River to deal with an 
issue which I am sure does not capture the hearts and minds of a 
whole lot of people.
<P>
	I had the opportunity to work on a parliamentary committee in 
the previous government. We were responsible for a five-year 
review of CSIS. This motion really emanates from the lack of 
courage as I would put it of the previous government to deal with 
this issue of oversight over agencies that can collect data and 
information on individual Canadians.
<P>
	In that sense I welcome the opportunity to be here this evening 
and talk about the proposal that would see the Communications 
Security Establishment, CSE, fall within the oversight 
provisions of SIRC, the Security Intelligence Review 
Committee.
<P>
	This recommendation really flows from our committee 
recommendation which was unanimously adopted by all parties 
in the previous Parliament. I congratulate the member for 
Scarborough-Rouge River for keeping the issue in front of 
Parliament and in front of Canadians and bringing forward a 
motion that I hope all members of the House will see their way 
clear to support.
<P>
	The effects of the motion quite frankly would see that CSE 
would fall under oversight. People will ask what is oversight and 
what does it mean. It is a protection for individual Canadians 
and it is really Parliament overseeing agencies that can collect 
data and information and even conversations of individual 
Canadians as they go about their daily lives.
<P>
	I think the issue was put quite nicely by the Library of 
Parliament in its paper on CSE. I would like to read one section 
of it because it does put the issues fairly succinctly. I am quoting 
page 14:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Ward Alcock told the House of Commons subcommittee on national security 
in June 1993 that CSE is a foreign intelligence collection agency. The very nature 
of its work depends upon a degree of secrecy. To the extent to which it works is not 
secret, it loses its capacity to function and to collect information that is of use and 
value to the Government of Canada.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This statement puts the key issue into its most basic terms: how can a 
government institution that functions most effectively in the shadows be held 
publicly accountable without compromising its efficacy? This question is 
especially important when it relates to an agency with the capacity to violate the 
rights and freedoms of Canadians.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The opinion that was given by the Library of Parliament was 
also buttressed by a well known author, Richard Cleroux, who 
recently wrote a book, ``Official Secrets'', a look at the spy 
agencies and other agencies that were involved in collecting 
data on Canadians and to protect Canadians from untoward 
activities by foreign governments and foreign agencies.
<P>
	While I hate to read a rather lengthy quote, I think Mr. 
Cleroux in his book captures the spirit of what is involved and 
what this motion is trying to do. I quote pages 77 and 78:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The CSE, which is considered the only government agency more secret than 
CSIS, employs more than 1,700 people, and uses highly sophisticated radio and 
telecommunications equipment to listen in simultaneously to thousands of 
embassy, ship and airline telephone and telecommunications transmissions and 
voice conversations across Canada and around the world.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The CSE functions as a funnel. Everything that is telecommunications in 
Canada is sucked into it. It needs no judicial warrants because it is part of the 
military, not part of CSIS.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<b> (1845 ) </B>
<P>
	Later on the same page:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Most of the information picked up by CSE is in the form of electronic data 
rather than voice conversation. Ninety-nine per cent is shipped wholesale, 
without ever being analysed here, to the U.S. National Security Agency in Fort 
Meade, Virginia. The Americans in turn tell the Canadians what they think the 
Canadians should know.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is a very clear and concise statement of what is 
happening with CSE as noted by the author Mr. Cleroux. It 
points to why we need some oversight, be it parliamentary or 
otherwise. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9037"> 9037 </A></B>
<P>
This motion says it should be SIRC that carries out that 
particular function.
<P>
	We had the privilege of having Stuart Farson advise us and do 
research for us as we looked at the five-year review of CSIS. He 
was concerned that CSE was without any parliamentary 
oversight and that the question of Canadian rights being 
possibly trampled was very important. In effect he made 
recommendations to us as a committee that we should look at 
including CSE in the oversight function.
<P>
	As we look at what some of the authors have to say, both Mr. 
Cleroux and Stuart Farson in his paper ``Canadian Security 
Intelligence in the Eighties'', it becomes clear that we have a 
number of agencies. CSE is well-known and clearly defined, 
being discussed in Parliament and elsewhere. There are also 
other agencies within the RCMP and other departments of 
government that have no oversight. That circumstance only 
exists in Canada. The United States Congress has an oversight 
committee as well as do other countries in the world.
<P>
	It is important that we protect Canadian rights. We can still 
protect secrecy. It is the beauty of the circumstance with the 
Security Intelligence Review Committee that only those things 
that should be made public are in fact made public. It is an 
independent committee of independent people who are the eyes 
and ears of Parliament.
<P>
	I go further and support the member for Scarborough-Rouge 
River in his efforts to have some parliamentary oversight. While 
there is some duplication, in the long run it is beneficial that we 
have that oversight in order to protect the rights of Canadians. 
When one thinks somebody could be listening into a telephone 
conversation or the electric transmission on a fax machine 
without having a warrant, something is fundamentally wrong 
with the circumstance. It requires parliamentary or in this case 
SIRC oversight. That is what the motion will hopefully 
accomplish.
<P>
	I would refer members to our report on CSIS and 
recommendation 87. It says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Committee recommends that Parliament 1) formally establish the CSE 
by statute-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This is not the case presently.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>and 2) establish SIRC as the body responsible for monitoring, reviewing and 
reporting to Parliament on the activities of the CSE concerning its compliance 
with the laws of Canada.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	As it says in the write-up:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Committee sees no reason in principle, however, why the security and 
intelligence arms of the Department of National Defence should not be 
reviewed by SIRC.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Personally I support the position. I voted in favour of it when 
the committee looked at it and I support it now. All Canadians 
need to be protected. These are important rights that should not 
be easily trampled on. We do not need some big funnel in the sky 
scooping up all of the information and transporting it to the 
United States for analysis.
<P>
	I would recommend the motion to all members of this House.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, let me 
first of all commend the member for Scarborough-Rouge 
River for his concern for making the debate on the CSE more 
transparent than the answers given during Question Period by 
the minister responsible, the Minister of National Defence.
<P>
	Indeed, the member who also chairs the sub-committee on 
national security, has moved: ``That, in the opinion of this 
House, the government should amend the Canadian Security 
Intelligence Service Act to authorize the Security Intelligence 
Review Committee to review the operations of the 
Communications Security Establishment (CSE)''.
<P>
<b> (1850) </B>
<P>
	As you can see, this augurs much better than the minister's 
various statements on the subject. This motion is based on a 
principle which the Bloc Quebecois has stated many times: the 
ability to account to our taxpayers for the activities of federal 
institutions, including the Communications Security 
Establishment.
<P>
	If this motion is adopted and implemented by the Liberal 
government, the Communications Security Establishment will 
be accountable to the Security Intelligence Review Committee, 
better known as SIRC. It is estimated that the CSE spends 
between $200 and $300 million a year without being held 
accountable for it. It is also estimated that the CSE employs 
between 800 and 1,000 employees, but other sources put the 
number as high as 1,850.
<P>
	However, it is impossible to obtain confirmation of these 
figures at this time. Furthermore, recent allegations from a 
former spy who worked in the CSE for several years indicate 
that agents used electronic eavesdropping to intercept the 
telephone calls of Quebec politicians. When questioned on this 
subject, however, the Minister of National Defence hides behind 
the sacrosanct national interest and refuses to answer.
<P>
	The motion of the member for Scarborough-Rouge River 
does not set a world precedent, far from it. The Australian 
Security Intelligence Organization, MI-6, the Government 
Communications Headquarters in Great Britain, and the CIA in 
the United States are already monitored in their respective 
countries by an outside committee, which operates in a way 
similar to what is proposed in Motion M-38.
<P>
	Belgium and some countries which belonged to the former 
Warsaw Pact are now considering the possibility of doing 
exactly what the member for Scarborough-Rouge River is 
proposing for Canada. Unfortunately, our Minister of National 
Defence tells us that it is not in the national interest to reveal the 
operational methods or the administrative standards which 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9038"> 9038 </A></B>
<P>
apply to the CSE's activities, and I refer to an article in <I>Le 
Devoir</I> of October 25, 1994.
<P>
	Where is the respect for democracy when the minister, always 
in the so-called national interest, refuses to tell us how many 
people work for the Communications Security Establishment? 
After all, the Agence France Presse reported, on November 8, 
1994, that the British defence minister was downsizing the 
secret service, and that about 100 of the 6,000 positions related 
to these operations at the Government Communications 
Headquarters would be eliminated.
<P>
	The British can evaluate how their secret service is managed, 
as well as appreciate the fact that it is affected by the budgetary 
cuts announced by their government. They also know how many 
employees work for that service, and they are informed of the 
cuts affecting this organization responsible for analysis of 
so-called sensitive information, or intelligence.
<P>
	This is where democratic transparency starts. By now, you 
will have guessed that I am in favour of having an external body 
monitor CSE's operations, as proposed in the motion now before 
us.
<P>
	However, I have some reservations regarding the Security 
Intelligence Review Committee. First, I wish to point out to the 
hon. member for Scarborough-Rouge River that the current 
membership of that committee, SIRC, must be reviewed. 
Indeed, the members of the committee were essentially 
appointed on the recommendations of the main political parties 
in the previous Parliament. These appointments were made on 
the basis of recommendations by the Liberals, the Conservatives 
and the New Democrats.
<P>
<b> (1855) </B>
<P>
	I agree with my Bloc Quebecois colleagues who feel that 
some SIRC members no longer have a legitimate right to sit on 
the committee, since their presence does not reflect the will of 
Canadians, as expressed during the last federal election. Indeed, 
these members essentially represent political parties which 
were democratically rejected by voters.
<P>
	The membership of this committee should take into account 
the wishes of Canadians, and it should reflect the political 
reality of this Parliament. It is time members of SIRC did the 
honourable thing and promptly resigned so that Parliament 
could then appoint new members to represent them on this 
committee.
<P>
	I should add that in the near future we will have to take steps 
to take politics out of the process of appointing members to this 
committee. Furthermore, the legislation governing SIRC should 
concentrate on reviewing certain mechanisms that raise a 
number of questions. For instance, does the process of reporting 
to Parliament really give members a chance to establish that the 
rights and freedoms of Canadians and Quebecers have been 
respected? Should this mechanism be more transparent? Should 
SIRC be allowed to submit its annual report uncensored to the 
Speaker of the House?
<P>
	Under section 54 of the CSIS Act, SIRC is also required to 
submit to the Solicitor General, on a regular basis, special 
reports concerning specific events. Should we provide that the 
nature and subject of these regular reports be routinely 
communicated to the House?
<P>
	Section 30 of the CSIS Act defines the functions of an 
inspector general, which include monitoring compliance with 
operational policies and reviewing the operational activities of 
CSIS. Before including the CSE in this legislation, we should 
consider the relevance and effectiveness of having both an 
inspector general and the SIRC for monitoring purposes. Is this 
duplication that could be avoided?
<P>
	Should the mandate of the director of the CSE be seven years, 
like his counterpart at CSIS? Or should tenure be during 
pleasure? Should SIRC have access to cabinet documents which 
are not legally accessible at the present time? And finally, 
should a member of the Auditor General's office audit CSE's 
accounts and report his findings to this House?
<P>
	Many questions remain to be answered. I think that in the 
public interest, the government should answer them as soon as 
possible to prevent further erosion of the public's trust in federal 
institutions.
<P>
	In concluding, I seriously hope that the government will react 
favourably to the motion presented by its member for 
Scarborough-Rouge River and that it will give careful 
consideration to my questions and recommendations.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Duncan (North Island-Powell River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to have the opportunity to contribute to 
debate on motion M-38 introduced by the hon. member for 
Scarborough-Rouge River.
<P>
	It is also a pleasure to support this motion. It is not only timely 
but essential to accountability. It is essential to amend the 
Canadian Security Intelligence Service Act to authorize the 
Security Intelligence Review Committee to review the 
operations of the Communications Security Establishment, or 
CSE.
<P>
	This motion brings to light concerns expressed as early as 
1990 in the book <I>Spy Wars</I> and more recently in the new book 
<I>Spyworld</I> written by Michael Frost, a former CSE employee, 
where it is alleged that this organization routinely snoops on 
law-abiding citizens. It compiles dossiers on everything and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9039"> 9039 </A></B>
<P>
everybody from Margaret Trudeau to Quebec separatists. It is 
open season on any unsuspecting Canadian citizen.
<P>
	CSE is a unique entity in government. It normally comes 
under the jurisdiction of the Minister of National Defence as its 
budget is hidden in the communications budget of the military. 
However, in reality it is a separate entity that receives its 
operational tasking from the deputy clerk for security and 
intelligence of the Privy Council. The political tasking comes 
from the cabinet committee on security and intelligence.
<P>
<b> (1900) </B>
<P>
	As we witnessed as a result of recent questioning in the 
House, the mandate of the CSE is questionable. There is no 
political accountability except to a group of cabinet ministers 
which is the most secret cabinet committee of government. Here 
we have an agency with a budget of hundreds of millions of 
dollars listening to overseas phone calls and accountable to no 
one person. This is not ham radio and catching the BBC Sunday 
night opera. This is serious business. It requires serious 
attention.
<P>
	We are told all this snooping is done to protect national 
security. Well the Diefenbunker is no longer a secret and we are 
about to mothball some CF-18s. There is no obvious external 
threat, so why so much resistance from the government to 
outside scrutiny?
<P>
	While I am no big fan of SIRC, it is as good as anything we 
have for this purpose. SIRC has managed to keep an eye on our 
spies without exposing them to danger. We can work on the 
patronage elements of SIRC at a different occasion.
<P>
	Why not let SIRC have a review capacity in CSE? Why should 
CSE be above the law? Why should its budget, mandate and 
methods not be scrutinized? The operative question is: Does 
CSE spy on Canadians? The Deputy Prime Minister says it has 
no mandate to do so, but the Deputy Prime Minister recently 
refused to answer direct questions regarding if in fact it had.
<P>
	In September 1990 a report entitled: ``In Flux But Not in 
Crisis'' was tabled. This report was the work of a special 
parliamentary committee on the review of the Canadian 
Security Intelligence Service Act. On page 153 it reported: 
``This organization clearly has the capacity to invade the 
privacy of Canadians in a variety of ways. It was established by 
order in council, not by statute and to all intents and purposes is 
unaccountable.''
<P>
	The passage goes on: ``While the committee understands that 
this agency must be shrouded in secrecy to some degree, it 
believes that Canadians should be in a position to understand 
what the organization does and should not have to wonder 
whether their rights and freedoms have been infringed. The 
committee has evidence that both the RCMP and CSIS have 
asked the CSE for assistance and as such the committee believes 
that the Communications Security Establishment should have a 
statutory mandate that provides for review''.
<P>
	My congratulations to a member of that special committee, 
the hon. member for Scarborough-Rouge River, the member 
responsible for the motion before us today. He at least 
recognizes the gravity of the previous passage I just read from 
the report.
<P>
	The Minister of National Defence unfortunately believes 
there is already sufficient review. To me, he is another of those 
do nothing, say nothing, status quo ministers who would rather 
stonewall than change. Things are just fine the way they are 
because they do not impact on his personal and private life.
<P>
	The fact is this minister really does not have control of the 
CSE. What he controls is financial and administrative matters. 
The chief of the CSE reports to the Clerk of the Privy Council for 
policy and operations. This is not what I consider a fully 
constituted part of DND like the minister says it is.
<P>
	The minister need only take a look at the government's 
response to the ``In Flux But Not in Crisis'' report entitled: ``On 
Course: National Security for the 1990s'' to see what it has to 
say about control of CSE and what is and what is not a fully 
constituted part of the Department of National Defence. The 
Prime Minister and the Privy Council Office are the real power 
and the issue. The Minister of National Defence is the filler in 
the sandwich.
<P>
<b> (1905) </B>
<P>
	I am not as naive as to believe that Canada does not need to 
intercept communications for intelligence purposes. It is part of 
the electronic information highway. There has to be some form 
of review and accountability, otherwise abuses can take place.
<P>
	As the book <I>Spyworld</I> states: ``Employees of the CSE 
routinely listened to the conversations of Canadians as they 
tuned and tested their equipment''. I also believe there is 
nothing wrong with sweeping offices or encrypting phones. This 
is normal in today's age but I want to know what the CSE is 
doing besides this. I want to know that it is not abusing its 
powers. An external review agency seems the only way we can 
lift this veil of uncertainty, assure accountability and free the 
CSE from suspicion. That does not sound like such a bad thing to 
me.
<P>
	I understand that the CSE is good at what it does. Let us make 
it even better. Let us support this motion for the good of all 
Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise to support the motion of the 
member for Scarborough-Rouge River.
<P>
	Let me begin by first making an observation about the 
Canadian Security Intelligence Service. We recognize that the 
role of CSIS is one of counterespionage and counterterrorism in 
Canada. Its role is to ensure that foreign governments do not 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9040"> 9040 </A></B>
<P>
have an improper influence on the lives of Canadians in the 
sense that it would compromise Canada's security.
<P>
	That is a very important function in Canada because we are a 
multicultural society. We value very greatly immigration from 
all lands. We value our tremendous ethnic and cultural diversity. 
The fear is that this ethnic melting pot, as it were, may be 
influenced by some of the foreign nations from which 
immigrants come and the traditional ethnic hatreds that some 
countries have.
<P>
	To that end CSIS protects our interests by doing intelligence 
work in the ethnic communities in Canada in order to prevent 
terrorists or foreign governments getting a hold. In doing that 
we as Canadians have to be concerned that while CSIS fills that 
very important function that it does not go too far and that the 
rights of Canadian citizens are protected, including ethnic 
Canadians.
<P>
	To cover off that problem we have built into the CSIS act a 
very excellent control, the Security and Intelligence Review 
Committee. It is basically a committee of Canadians of 
conscience who are appointed. They have sweeping powers to 
doublecheck what CSIS does to make sure that while it does 
operate in secrecy it operates in a way that has the interests of all 
Canadians at heart.
<P>
	Now we come to the Communications Security 
Establishment. This organization springs from the second world 
war and Canada's involvement in code and cipher breaking. It is 
well known what it does now. It is an agency whose role is to 
intercept communications and to process them. Its direction is 
toward the collection of foreign intelligence.
<P>
	I should say it has quite an interesting history. It arose from an 
organization called the examination unit and specialized in the 
second world war in breaking Vichy French codes and some 
Japanese and then went on to break the codes of the free French.
<P>
	Indeed we will find when the book is written on the subject 
that the Communications Security Establishment during the 
early part of the cold war undoubtedly specialized in analysing 
the diplomatic codes and ciphers of France. I think we will find 
that this was one of the reasons for the vive le Quebec libre 
speech of Charles de Gaulle. I think he was very annoyed to 
discover that Canada had France as a target.
<P>
<b> (1910) </B>
<P>
	There is nothing unusual in that as all nations monitor the 
telecommunications of other nations, be they friends or 
enemies. It is a way of determining whether contracts are kept, if 
governments are interfering in the diplomatic and commercial 
affairs of one's own nation.
<P>
	This type of study takes two shapes. It is code and cipher 
breaking where you actually attempt to break the codes and 
ciphers of another nation, be they diplomatic or commercial 
ciphers. It also takes the form of traffic analysis. When you 
cannot break the codes and ciphers of another nation you 
examine where messages are being sent and the volume of 
messages. That gives an indication of what that country is doing 
in terms of its diplomatic or commercial activities.
<P>
	Over the last 15 years code and cipher breaking has lessened 
in importance in the field of communications intelligence, 
primarily because code and ciphers have become increasingly 
hard to break. More than that, it is because communications 
satellites particularly have enabled governments to monitor the 
affairs of other nations in a much more efficient manner than 
could be done hitherto.
<P>
	I believe the collapse of the Soviet Union had much to do with 
the fact that satellites were monitoring its lack of economic 
progress more than with any other cause. The Soviet Union 
could not hide from the satellites that trains were not running, 
that there was pollution everywhere and that the Soviet Union 
was in an economic mess. It worked the other way as well. The 
Soviet Union was monitoring Canada and the United States and 
the western world. It could see that it was losing the economic 
war.
<P>
	In the world of intelligence the agency that looks after 
domestic counterespionage and the foreign intelligence 
gathering agency like the Communications Security 
Establishment are complementary. They always work together. 
In the case of foreign and diplomatic intelligence it is important 
for CSIS to monitor what is happening to foreign nationals on 
Canadian soil who may be engaged in espionage. The parallel 
activity is the Communications Security Establishment which 
monitors the actual traffic in diplomatic and commercial 
communications. These things always go together.
<P>
	There is the same situation in Canada with its ethnic makeup. 
While we have CSIS looking after anti-terrorism shall we say, it 
inevitably has to probe into the affairs and activities of various 
ethnic communities in Canada. Similarly the CSE has to be in 
tune with what may be happening in terms of communications, 
whatever it can derive either from telecommunications or other 
communications sources what is happening to the nations that 
may not have Canada's interests at heart or may be attempting to 
influence ethnic communities in Canada. The two are 
complementary and very necessarily so.
<P>
	This type of activity overlaps in subtle ways. I would like to 
go back for a second to World War II and tell a very brief story 
which illustrates this point. It was a great triumph for Canadians 
during World War II and was not reported very well at all.
<P>
	In 1940 in North Africa the British were facing the Italians in 
great numbers. Britain had very few troops on the ground in 
Egypt and the Italians had an enormous army in the western 
desert. Britain had its back to the wall with the fall of France and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9041"> 9041 </A></B>
<P>
was very fearful with Italian entry into the war about what would 
happen in North Africa.
<P>
	The Canadian army intelligence had the advantage of being 
able to monitor the telegraph lines that left Canada from 
Newfoundland and Nova Scotia and went to Britain, the Canary 
Islands, Spain and ultimately to Italy. Telegraph traffic coming 
out of the United States had to pass momentarily through 
Canada before it went on to Italy.
<P>
<b> (1915) </B>
<P>
	Even before Mussolini declared war on the allies after the fall 
of France, or as France fell, Canadians were monitoring the 
traffic of Italian Americans communicating with relatives in 
Italy. Mussolini, in an attempt to raise money to buy weapons, 
had asked Italian Americans to remit U.S. dollars to Italy so 
relatives would be paid a bonus in lira in Italy. Italian Americans 
were constantly sending remittances to their relatives in Italy. 
This was just before the Italians declared war and just after.
<P>
	Canadians were monitoring all this. As the banks in the 
United States required that the remittances give names and 
addresses, it was found that many remittances were being sent to 
Italians in the military. They were being sent to the actual bases 
where the Italian military personnel were located. This enabled 
Canadians to construct the entire Italian order of battle before 
Mussolini declared war. Wavell, the famous British general who 
defeated the Italians in the western desert, knew exactly where 
every division or every unit in the Italian army was in the desert.
<P>
	We can see how in the intelligence field, communications 
intelligence, foreign intelligence gathering can be mixed with 
something that is essentially a domestic phenomenon. In this 
case it is out of country; it is the Italians but it is a 
communications phenomenon.
<P>
	I told the story for the basic reason that we should have a 
situation in the intelligence world where one arm of secret 
intelligence gathering, which is CSIS, is responsible and 
answerable to some review committee which, shall we say, has 
an oversight role. We cannot have half a loaf; we need the entire 
loaf. I submit that no matter how competent the 
Communications Security Establishment inevitably there is 
some overlap. Both arms of secret intelligence should make this 
independent review, and for that reason I entirely support the 
motion.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
a pleasure for me as well to speak on the motion put forth by the 
hon. member for Scarborough-Rouge River and the 
amendment of the hon. member for Bellechasse.
<P>
	The motion per se is to amend the Canadian Security 
Intelligence Act to authorize the Security Intelligence Review 
Committee to review the activities of the Communications 
Security Establishment. As for the amendment, it is designed to 
force the review committee to table each year before this House 
a report on the activities of the CSE.
<P>
	First of all, I would like to say that I agree entirely with the 
motion with amendment, as I think it is essential for the elected 
representatives to retain a minimum of control on agencies and 
institutions related to the world of espionage and intelligence 
that CSIS, the CSE and the SIRC are.
<P>
	It also appears necessary, in the light of recent events, to 
remind the individuals who are part of such organizations that 
their duty is first and foremost to serve the public and that we 
have been elected to represent the public.
<P>
	Concerns expressed by members from both sides of this 
House are born out by disconcerting revelations concerning 
alleged unlawful activities of the Canadian Security 
Intelligence Service and the Communications Security 
Establishment.
<P>
	How does a country that prides itself on being one of the most 
democratic in the world explain having agencies that account for 
their activities only when and to whom they please? One can 
also wonder what the current Liberal government is doing to 
give a feeling of security and restore confidence to all 
Canadians, but Quebecers in particular, who may have been 
targeted more often than they should by unlawful investigations.
<P>
	Why did the government not react when it found out that 
serious allegations had been made and that the relevant standing 
committee of this House had been unable to obtain satisfactory 
answers? Why did a private member have to take the initiative? 
How will this be perceived by the public?
<P>
<b> (1920) </B>
<P>
	Although the member's initiative is eminently positive, we 
have a right to wonder what kind of image this passive 
government is sending to the population whose suspicions and 
concerns are quite justified.
<P>
	There is no doubt that the Security Intelligence Review 
Committee is essential to ensure at least a minimum of 
accountability on the part of CSIS and eventually the CSE.
<P>
	Only yesterday, we learned from a Canadian Press article 
published in <I>La Presse</I> that CSIS may have overstepped its 
mandate and inadvertently revealed secrets in trying to fight 
industrial espionage. The national agency may have collected 
with complete impunity information having nothing to do with 
any threat to national security.
<P>
	It is certainly not the first time, and probably not the last, that 
such a thing has occurred. In this case, the review committee 
produced in 1993 a secret report that was obtained under the 
Access to Information Act. This should not be seen as a model of 
openness but it is an acceptable minimum. Unfortunately, this 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9042"> 9042 </A></B>
<P>
acceptable minimum does not currently apply to the CSE which, 
as we have seen recently, enjoys an unusual level of freedom.
<P>
	The Deputy Prime Minister said loud and clear in this House 
that the CSE's mandate was not to spy on Canadians. But no one 
was fooled, especially since the question that was put to her did 
not deal with the CSE's mandate but with its actual operations. 
In fact, the CSE has no mandate defined in legislation and is 
accountable only to the Privy Council. Clearly, it is not in the 
Privy Council's interest to make the CSE's blunders public, 
which makes it a very poor watchdog, we must admit.
<P>
	The motion being debated today would considerably improve 
the situation, since it would make the CSE subject to monitoring 
by SIRC. Unfortunately, I must express some reservations about 
SIRC's effectiveness. I am thinking, for example, of SIRC's 
serious credibility problems, which are due to the fact that it is 
now made up of people who have not understood that they are 
answerable to Parliament and to the public, and who hide behind 
a narrow interpretation of some legal provisions to justify their 
silence.
<P>
	The testimony given by members of SIRC before the House 
Committee on National Security on September 13 was a 
disgrace and Canadians and Quebecers were certainly not well 
served. At least four of these individuals, whose sense of ethics 
seems to be quite underdeveloped, were appointed by the 
previous government, which, need we remind you, was rejected 
by the voters in the most summary fashion. We are entitled to 
question the legitimacy of these well-known Conservatives who 
sit on SIRC.
<P>
	That is why I join my colleagues in the Bloc Quebecois to 
demand the immediate resignation of these individuals, and I 
urge the Liberal government to act on this.
<P>
	A significant renewal of SIRC's staff would reflect the new 
make-up of this House and bring new blood to an organization 
which really needs it.
<P>
	Hopefully, with a minimum of four new members, the 
Security Intelligence Review Committee could regain some of 
its lost credibility. These changes are essential, but they are still 
cosmetic.
<P>
	Only this government, through the Solicitor General, can 
make the required changes to the legislation on the Security 
Intelligence Review Committee.
<P>
	We can have motions to force the SIRC chairman to provide 
real answers to parliamentarians, instead of just saying 
``maybe'' or ``maybe not'', but he will not do so as long as the 
government does not make significant changes to the act 
establishing the SIRC.
<P>
	Although the Official Opposition can only agree with the 
underlying principle of this legislation, it questions the process 
for appointing SIRC members, as well as the ambiguous 
relations of that committee with Parliament.
<P>
	In conclusion, the issue debated today was in fact the relation 
of confidence between Canadians and their institutions. When 
they were in opposition, the Liberals kept asking for greater 
transparency, as well as better control by Parliament over spy 
agencies.
<P>
	The Communications Security Establishment spends over 
$250 million annually.
<P>
<b> (1925) </B>
<P>
	What does it do with that money? How does it spend it and for 
what purposes? We hope that the proposed motion will shed 
some light on CSE's operations. However, we are very aware 
that it is up to the federal government to ensure greater 
transparency regarding intelligence activity in Canada. 
Unfortunately, this government seems totally paralysed over 
this issue, as with several other strategic issues.
<P>
	I want to congratulate the hon. member for 
Scarborough-Rouge River, and the hon. member for 
Bellechasse for their initiative which, I hope, will be supported 
by the government and approved by the majority of members in 
this House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I think we should bear in mind 
several aspects of the world situation, in other words, the 
geopolitical, strategic situation of Canada. As a nation with a 
population of 30 million and a member of the G-7, as a country 
with a fairly important position in the world, we have to 
consider not only Canadian industry but also the security of this 
country today and in the next century.
<P>
	It would perhaps be useful, in a discussion about the 
Communications Security Establishment, better known as the 
CSE, to consider briefly Canada's foreign intelligence activities 
and the role of the CSE in this respect. First of all, I would like to 
explain what is meant by foreign intelligence. The term foreign 
intelligence refers to information on the resources, intentions 
and activities of foreign states, moral entities or individuals as 
they concern Canada's defence or the conduct of Canada's 
international affairs.
<P>
	This may include information of a political, economic, 
military or scientific nature or indeed information related to the 
country's national security. We should also realize that, unlike 
many of its allies, Canada has no active foreign intelligence 
service. However, like most countries, Canada has set up a 
number of limited mechanisms for collecting and analysing 
information from other countries.
<P>
	Earlier I mentioned the political context. Since the demise of 
the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc, there has been an 
increasing sense of instability. This is no longer the world we 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9043"> 9043 </A></B>
<P>
used to know, where we had the  Communists on one side, and 
the free world on the other, and when we knew who our enemies 
were. The world has changed considerably since the fall of the 
Berlin wall in 1989.
<P>
	I think that today we live in a world that is far more insecure, 
unstable and uncertain-when we look, for instance, at Eastern 
Europe-a world where there is a certain lack of cohesion. We 
have all these small republics, the conflict between Russia and 
Chechenya, the dissolution of Yugoslavia and the problems of 
reconstruction in Eastern Europe. There are very real threats, 
not only locally, but internationally.
<P>
	We no longer have the kind of control over nuclear arms that 
we had at one time, and unfortunately, this uncertainty has 
caused some nations to cast envious looks at Canada and the 
West. That is why Canada is not necessarily immune to the 
changes that have been taking place during the past five years, 
and especially as a result of the events and disruptions in Eastern 
Europe. That is, as you know, the political reality we are all 
faced with.
<P>
<b> (1930) </B>
<P>
	There are economic challenges as well. More and more, a 
number of countries, some of which we may have thought of as 
friends, are showing a great deal of interest in Canadian 
industries. I would say that, these past few years, allegations of 
industrial spying in the pharmaceutical industry have been 
increasing. In Quebec, there have been blatant cases of Quebec 
interests being targeted. They were spied on because they had 
knowledge and technologies that some of our allies, who will 
remain nameless, wanted for themselves. It makes us realize 
that we have knowledge that the whole world is interested in 
having. Why not use it?
<P>
	The same with the airspace industry. Many countries have 
shown an interest for Canadian companies such as Bombardier 
and de Havilland. I also hear that we have companies specialized 
in high technology and biotechnology. There is no doubt that an 
increasing number of foreign countries are interested.
<P>
	So, we are not immune to change, nor to other countries 
wanting to obtain information from Canada unlawfully, if not 
illegally.
<P>
	I think that Canada has prospered because of the security we 
enjoy in this country, good understanding and economic and 
political stability between provinces, co-operation between the 
industry and the Government of Canada. But this security must 
be maintained and that is why I think that a communications 
security establishment meets that need not only to look after our 
interests, but also to ensure that military changes or upheaval 
outside Canada do interfere with scientific and technological 
progress on the home front.
<P>
	There is no question that the world we live in is not an easy 
one. Personally, I would rather live an a world where there 
would be no CSE, no CIA, no M-5, no KGB, and no foreign 
interest.
<P>
	I believe some people, and this is often the case for the Bloc, 
have concerns, whether they are founded or not, about the 
existence of the CSE and other such organizations we have 
known in the past. But we have a role, an obligation to protect 
our industries. That is why the CSE is more interested in helping 
protect Canadian industries trying to develop in an increasingly 
competitive world.
<P>
	There is Eastern Europe and then, there are emerging Asian 
countries. Again, there is interest in the new Canadian 
technologies, the aluminum and paper industries in particular, 
where Canada has held on to a certain tradition of supremacy. In 
an increasingly competitive international environment, we need 
an intelligence service like the CSE to make sure that 
information stays in Canada and that such countries do not 
disrupt the operation of our businesses.
<P>
	Canada is also a multicultural country. More and more of our 
people come from other countries.
<P>
<b> (1935) </B>
<P>
	Since Canada is a welcoming country, we have people coming 
from various countries in Latin America, Asia, Central and 
Eastern Europe. Sometimes, people return to Canada and settle 
here to destabilize the country.
<P>
	There are even well-known and not so well-known ethnic 
groups facing internal conflicts that have unfortunate 
repercussions at the national level.
<P>
	I think that my time is up, but I would like to say, in 
conclusion, that we need an intelligence service like the CSE, 
whose main concern is protecting Canadians in the international 
community and, unfortunately, because of the geopolitical 
realities prevailing here as the century draws to a close.

	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Before I give the floor to 
the hon. member for Saanich-Gulf Islands, being as we are 
getting close to a period of recess, I wonder if there might be 
unanimous consent to allow the member for Saanich-Gulf 
Islands, instead of taking five minutes now and having the 
remaining five minutes of his ten minute maximum to be taken 
up at the third hour debate at another time when we return, if the 
House would give unanimous consent to allow the member to 
make his intervention complete. At that time we would go to the 
late show. The member would have five minutes and we would 
go with no later than ten minutes from the time he would start. Is 
there unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9044"> 9044 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in speaking to Motion M-38 today, I am convinced that 
important Canadian issues are involved. That there are problems 
with the Communications Security Establishment, CSE, is 
emphasized by the fact that the hon. member for 
Scarborough-Rouge River who chairs the subcommittee on 
national security feels obliged to call for the government to 
authorize a regular ongoing review of CSE operations.
<P>
	Concerns over the mandate of CSE and other Canadian 
intelligence agencies have been reported in the media, and the 
release of <I>Spyworld</I> has caused indignation in many quarters.
<P>
	CSE is not directly accountable to the public purse, to 
Parliament or to any other independent body. The 1990 review 
by the special committee of the Canadian Security Intelligence 
Service Act acknowledged that it is now time to examine the 
wider dimensions of Canadian security and intelligence 
community and to impose statutory mandates and review 
mechanisms where necessary.
<P>
	However, government took no action. Ten years ago 
Parliament passed legislation holding CSIS operations 
accountable to an independent body, the Security Intelligence 
Review Committee, SIRC, which is made up of five political 
appointees.
<P>
	SIRC would not rank anywhere near being the best check and 
balance on the operations of CSIS but it is certainly better than 
having no review or accountability mechanism. To paraphrase 
an old saying, if halitosis is better than no breath at all then SIRC 
is better than no supervision at all.
<P>
	Thus, while SIRC may not be the best answer, one wonders 
why the review committee did not also invoke the same 
requirement for CSE operations. Therefore, Motion M-38 is 
timely and important.
<P>
	When the special committee called for a regular review of 
security and intelligence agencies it also recommended that this 
agency should have statutory mandate to provide for review and 
monitor mechanisms. At the time government was considering 
providing the Minister of National Defence with additional 
capacity for review of the CSE. To this day government has 
dragged its heels and has failed to initiate the means for review. 
It has failed to hold the agency accountable to an independent 
body for its expenditures or even direct legislation to protect 
private citizens from the prospect of CSE intruding into and 
invading our privacy.
<P>
	There is cause for great concern. Today high tech, 
computerized world is much different from that which prevailed 
at the time of CSE's inception during the second world war. It 
was then set up to intercept signals and break enemy codes, 
referred to as ciphers and codes.
<P>
	Today CSE is responsible for communications or information 
technology security, COMSEC or INFOSEC, and signals 
intelligence, SIGINT. It sounds not unlike Goldfinger in James 
Bond or Captain Kirk in ``Star Trek''or ``Star Wars'' all rolled 
into one.
<P>
<b> (1940 ) </B>
<P>
	Unquestionably there is a need to know the state of the art so 
that CSE can ensure federal government telecommunications or 
electronic data processing systems are known to be secure.
<P>
	It must ensure that government personnel are given security 
training or education and that Canadian industry has access to 
appropriate security advice, although this aspect might better be 
left in the hands of the private sector.
<P>
	The darker side, of which little is known, is that CSE monitors 
the communications of foreign countries to provide intelligence 
to government. It listens in on radio and telephone 
communications between embassies and home countries or 
consulates. It follows all national and international telephone 
calls. It records foreign radio communications and reads 
electromagnetic transmissions from embassy typewriters, 
processors, and so on.
<P>
	We understand that 80 per cent of its operational budget is 
directed to the signals intercept program for communications 
intelligence which uses radio waves or radar to spy and protect 
national security; for example, telemetry intelligence, 
interception of signals relaying information from sensors on 
board a test vehicle to test engineers, revealing the vehicle's 
flight and performance characteristics.
<P>
	Parliament has no statutes or laws to direct the CSE because it 
was established by order in council, by a cabinet directive. Thus 
one can speculate on the obvious CSE operations but only the 
depth of our imagination limits the breadth of its capability and 
potential involvement. By and large it seems that CSE is 
accountable to no one. It has virtual carte blanche to write its 
own terms and exercise full discretionary powers.
<P>
	Little is known of its operations and even less about how it 
spends the public's funds it is given. During House of Commons 
debate hon. members have quoted from the <I>Globe and Mail</I> that 
expenditures in the order of $100 million to $125 million were 
budgeted for 1991. Another hon. member ventured to guess that 
$250 million would be a conservative estimate. Who knows how 
much is spent, how it is spent or why it is spent-perhaps some 
cabinet ministers, but certainly no independent regulatory 
agency exercising control.
<P>
	When one considers Canada's massive deficit-debt it 
becomes obvious that government has an obligation to seek 
ways to trim fat, ensure accountability and avoid duplication of 
efforts. This motion provides government with an excellent 
opportunity to do just that.
<P>
	Two special joint committees of this Parliament have only 
recently concluded reviews of Canadian foreign policy and 
defence policy. As a result Canada's role in foreign affairs and 
our military will be adjusted to better reflect today's needs. It 
would be logical to follow with a review of Canada's security 
and intelligence agencies. There has been no such review since 
<P>

<B><A NAME="9045"> 9045 </A></B>
<P>
their inception in  the 1940s and operational control has become 
lax because their accountability is not adequately enforced.
<P>
	Obviously a certain amount of secrecy and restricted 
knowledge of activities is required for CSE. Everyone 
understands that an intelligence agency cannot adequately 
perform its duties unless it is to some extent clothed in a veil of 
secrecy. However, there must still be a mechanism to ensure that 
activity control limits are in place and enforced and that the 
taxpayer's dollar is being appropriately and efficiently 
employed in service to Canada and Canadians.
<P>
	In 1975 an order in council transferred responsibility for CSE 
from the National Research Council to the Department of 
National Defence, but only administrative responsibility was 
transferred, not its mandate, powers, control or accountability. 
Thus, I strongly endorse Motion M-38 calling for the 
government to amend the Canadian Security Intelligence 
Service Act to authorize the Security Intelligence Review 
Committee to review CSE's operation and budget.
<P>
	Government could and should go even further by transferring 
CSE from the Department of National Defence to CSIS. Such 
action would make CSE subject to the same control and 
accountability that CSIS now is.
<P>
	There is urgency required in implementing some statutory 
directive because of CSE's capacity to invade and intrude into 
our privacy. Southam News has already reported that the Privy 
Council Office has asked the RCMP's legal branch to examine 
legislation that would make it easier for police to intercept 
digital or computer communications.
<P>
<b> (1945) </B>
<P>
	In the United States similar laws are under study and the 
Digital Telephony and Communications Privacy Improvement 
Act giving telecommunications companies funds to develop 
software technology allowing full access to telecommunication 
systems has been debated in the U.S. Congress.
<P>
	If enacted, this U.S. law would permit monitoring of a wide 
range of personal data. Are we in Canada also to have our own 
big brother tracking our every move? Electronic eavesdropping 
is surreptitious, easily used, and has the capacity to intrude into 
our most private lives with no search warrants required.
<P>
	Despite the minister's assurance that CSE has no mandate to 
spy on Canadians, we do not know what its mandate is. Without 
checks and balances CSE has no limits to its operations and can 
be used against anyone without their having any knowledge that 
it is happening. To have the legal ability to so infringe on our 
right to privacy is simply unacceptable.
<P>
	In conclusion, while I have concerns about SIRC being as 
responsive and appropriate a monitoring agency as I would like, 
it is certainly better than having no monitoring agency at all. 
Perhaps an improvement in answer to this dilemma would be for 
the monitoring  agency, for both CSIS and SIRC, to be 
constituted as a separate cell under the aegis of the Auditor 
General who reports to Parliament. Unless there is some 
technical reason why this cannot be, it would seem to provide 
the arm's length monitor required to do the job without political 
bias or interference.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The time provided for the 
consideration of Private Members' Business has now expired, 
but I want to put on record that by unanimous consent we 
extended the time of debate on Motion No. 38 by an extra five 
minutes so that the next time the motion is before the House 
there will be 55 minutes left of debate.
<P>
	Pursuant to Standing Order 93, the order is dropped to the 
bottom of the order of precedence on the Order Paper.

deemed to have been moved.

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="RAIL LINE ABANDONMENT">RAIL LINE ABANDONMENT</A></H4>
	<B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
November 2, I asked the Prime Minister to ensure that Saint 
John, New Brunswick, was given a dayliner after VIA's final run 
through Saint John which takes place on December 15.
<P>
	The Minister of Transport responded to my question by saying 
what he needs to hear are proposals that make sense and not what 
was being done by the former PC government, the party that I 
now represent.
<P>
	I find irony in what the minister has said because what the 
minister has done to Saint John does not make any sense. A new 
train station was built just last year by the former government. 
The Liberal government closed it, took away the VIA service 
and offered a bus to take passengers to Moncton.
<P>
	The former government built a new air traffic control tower in 
Saint John. The Liberal government has now closed it and has 
taken the air traffic controllers away. The decisions are a waste 
of taxpayers' dollars.
<P>
	I understand the present fiscal constraints the government is 
facing. The government has decided to cut non-profitable 
operations. One of these operations was the VIA Atlantic train 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9046"> 9046 </A></B>
<P>
from Sherbrooke to Saint John, the first mainline ever to be 
abandoned.
<P>
	In the Gaspé area the NTA recommended that the Gaspé rail 
line be abandoned, but the government of the day, the previous 
government, decided that the abandonment decision should be 
overturned because the loss of the rail service would negatively 
affect the quality of life in that region.
<P>
	The same thing is happening in New Brunswick and in Saint 
John with this decision. The quality of life in my area is severely 
negatively affected with the removal of VIA passenger service.
<P>
	Why did the hon. member's government not do the same for 
the eastern line as the PC government did with the Gaspé 
abandonment? Where is the rat pack that was there in the 
opposition? The minister of fisheries, the Deputy Prime 
Minister and others formed what was known as the rat pack. 
They fought hard with myself as mayor of the city of Saint John 
to make sure the people of Saint John had a rail service.
<P>
	I cannot accept that the government has cut off the total 
passenger service to my riding and replaced it with a bus. In 
light of the savings to the federal treasury that the cut of the 
Atlantic service will provide, I do not feel that a dayliner would 
be cost excessive. Since we have a brand new railway station I 
feel we should get some use out of it and not waste the 
taxpayers' money that was spent on it. The government looks 
very irresponsible as does the commission for VIA when they 
close down a railway station that has just been built.
<P>
<b> (1950) </B>
<P>
	A dayliner service to Moncton would be more appropriate, 
given the state of highways in New Brunswick. As well it seems 
to me that a dayliner link if scheduled and priced properly could 
make money, given that the highest population density in the 
province resides in the area of Saint John. The decision by the 
minister to offer a bus instead of a dayliner is really an insult to 
the people of Saint John.
<P>
	We were told by the previous government: ``You use it or you 
lose it''. The citizens have used it. It is a way of life for our 
people. There are many people who have no other way to travel 
except by that train.
<P>
	The closure of the VIA Rail Atlantic will not save taxpayers 
much money and comes at a time when the Amtrak network is 
expanding in Maine. All these cuts and closures come at a time 
when in Europe and the U.S. they are building high speed and 
very efficient trains.
<P>
	I am asking the government to ensure VIA service to Saint 
John by providing a dayliner to Moncton instead of a bus. In this 
time of giving I ask the government to give a little back to the 
citizens of Saint John that it has taken away.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joe Fontana (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, owing to the impending sale of 
CP's operating assets between Sherbrooke and Saint John, there 
is no assurance of continued access for the Atlantic train. The 
member knows that VIA does not  own tracks. It operates on 
running rights from CN and CP. Therefore with CP selling the 
assets there is no track available for VIA.
<P>
	VIA will discontinue its Atlantic train over the CP route on 
December 17 and will increase train frequency to six round trips 
per week over the ocean route. VIA has done a first rate job in 
arranging for bus service between Saint John and Moncton to 
connect VIA passengers with the ocean service. This is the most 
economical way to provide connections within the VIA network.
<P>
	In addition, the interline ticketing and tariff agreement VIA 
has made with SMT will provide for ease of ticketing and 
baggage handling. SMT will also be modifying schedules on its 
Fredericton to Newcastle route, providing a direct connection at 
Newcastle to the ocean for passengers from Fredericton.
<P>
	It is evident that a connecting bus service is the less costly 
option by far. The annual cost of a dayliner service would be in 
the order of $1.2 million per year. The bus service is much less 
than that by half.
<P>
	We have been asked why VIA's newly constructed station in 
Saint John will no longer be used. Perhaps the member should 
ask her former Conservative government. When the station was 
constructed CP was already negotiating the sale of the entire 
Sherbrooke to Saint John line. The member might want to 
respond on why her colleagues spent the money on the basis of 
speculation.
<P>
	The commitment of Minister of Transport to Saint John and 
New Brunswick is unquestionable. His actions with respect to 
the CAA at Saint John, his action with respect to the port of Saint 
John and with respect to highways in Saint John and New 
Brunswick are sure testimony of the minister's commitment to 
good transportation systems in Saint John and New Brunswick.

	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
exactly eight days ago, I asked the Minister of Human Resources 
Development when he would table the five missing technical 
papers that were to clarify, if possible, the direction that his plan 
to reform social programs would take.
<P>
	At that time, the minister answered that he thought the 
remaining documents would be made public in ten days. I want 
to tell the minister that he has only two days left to keep his 
promise, but that is not the main purpose of my statement today.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9047"> 9047 </A></B>
<P>
	On this point, I first want to speak out against how the 
minister is proceeding. In a few days, the Standing Committee 
on Human Resources Development will complete a 
Canada-wide tour of consultations in which thousands of 
citizens will have participated. What a mockery has been made 
of the consultation process!
<P>
	An incredible amount of energy has been mobilized but the 
people whom they said they wanted to consult were not provided 
with the proper information. They were consulted on an 
indefinite subject, but I suspect that the chosen direction has 
already been decided and they are being very careful to keep it 
from the public. All this remains to be confirmed, of course, but 
the confirmation should come soon.
<P>
<b> (1955) </B>
<P>
	In the House, on December 5, I also asked the minister to 
confirm that he had in fact gone blindly into a reform guided 
only by the cuts imposed by the finance minister. Instead of 
answering my question, the minister replied that I was 
completely ignorant, and said: ``A large-scale national survey 
showed that 96 per cent of Canadians believe major changes 
have to be made in social policy. It may be that the hon. member 
does not understand but 96 per cent of Canadians are in favour of 
what we are doing''.
<P>
	The minister was quite right. I do not understand, but not 
necessarily what he thinks I do not understand. I cannot 
understand how a minister can interpret in such a shameful 
demagogic way the results of a poll. Here are the facts. The 
Decima poll, to which the minister was referring, revealed that 
96 per cent of Canadians feel that the time has come to reform 
social security programs. Some 53 per cent support major 
changes, while 26 per cent are in favour of a comprehensive 
reform.
<P>
	How can the minister distort the facts in such a way and 
accuse me of not understanding anything? This is a mystery 
which, I am sure, only the minister can penetrate.
<P>
	Let me repeat again the results of that poll, just to make sure 
the minister understands: 96 per cent of Canadians feel that a 
reform of social programs is necessary. This is not at all the 
same as saying that 96 per cent of Canadians support the 
government's approach, far from it!
<P>
	I also want to tell the minister something he surely knows 
already: Canadians do not agree at all with the proposal, as 
introduced by the government. The same poll indicated that 19 
per cent of Quebecers strongly supported the idea of a 
two-tiered UI system, while 56 per cent somewhat agreed with 
it. This is a far cry from the 96 per cent degree of support of 
Quebecers that the minister claims.
<P>
	Finally, I want to take this opportunity to remind the minister 
that women's groups, including the National Action Committee 
on the Status of Women, which alone represents over 80 groups, 
condemn the proposed changes to the UI system, because they 
feel these changes  are discriminatory. Would the Minister of 
Human Resources Development go so far as to claim that all 
these women did not understand anything either?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joe Fontana (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as of today the government has 
released four background papers: ``Income Security for 
Children'', ``Persons with Disabilities'',``Child Care and 
Development '' and ``From Unemployment Insurance to 
Employment Insurance''. The remaining four papers will be 
released in the next few days. I can assure the member there is 
still time for public debate and for the standing committee to 
analyse these papers as it prepares its final report early in the 
new year.
<P>
	Social security reform is an ongoing process. We will 
continue to make information available to the public throughout 
the process. Let me emphasize again that our programs are 
outdated, costly, and no longer meet the needs of today's labour 
market.
<P>
	As recent polls have shown, the Canadian people believe there 
are problems with our social programs and that changes are 
required: 96 per cent of the people believe there are at least some 
problems with social programs requiring either minor changes, 
17 per cent; major changes, 53 per cent; or a complete overhaul, 
26 per cent. Slightly fewer Canadians, 89 per cent, believe the 
UI system should be changed. The majority, 55 per cent, believe 
change is required because the system is antiquated, while 
one-third believe the expense associated with the program is the 
main reason the UI system should be changed. There is 
overwhelming support, 80 per cent, for our two-tier system of 
UI.
<P>
	I am convinced the government has the support of the 
Canadian people as we work to reform an antiquated social 
security system. The release of the remaining technical papers 
in the next few days will further inform and allow us to make the 
important decisions required to ensure the survival of Canada's 
social security system.

	<B>Mr. Bernard St-Laurent (Manicouagan, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I rise to speak about the anti-scab bill and the minister's 
commitment to table such legislation, which was supposed to be 
done some time in December.
<P>
	In March 1994, in my riding near Sept-Îles, at the QNS &amp; L 
Company, 300 employees were in a legal strike position and 
were locked out. The strike or labour dispute was to go on for 
three months. As soon as the dispute started, the employer 
rushed to hire scabs.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9048"> 9048 </A></B>
<P>
<b> (2000) </B>
<P>
	So, as you can imagine, this led to violence and did not 
creative a climate conducive to bargaining with respect and 
dignity by the workers and the employer. The emphasis was on 
confrontation throughout the process, and there was no attempt 
to reach an agreement because scabs had been hired.
<P>
	Last week, I travelled to Decatur, Illinois, with Ogilvie Mills 
workers belonging to the CSN, who joined fellow workers who 
are also on strike, sympathized a little, and tried to meet the head 
of the business in Decatur, where Ogilvie has its headquarters. 
To all intents and purposes, I have never seen anything like 
Decatur in my life, although I have witnessed many labour 
disputes. I was involved in the union movement for a while 
before being elected to the House of Commons, so I knew what 
to expect, but it was the first time I saw anything like that. 
Decatur could be called Dictature City or Scab City, as the 
people over there call it. It is the same thing.
<P>
	If you want to work, all you have to do is show up at Decatur. 
ADM owners hire, on the spot, workers they then send to one of 
the many places where there is a labour dispute, to work as 
scabs, because at Decatur, it is normal to work as a scab. So, this 
creates a climate of incredible violence. Bargaining is the 
establishment of a power relationship between two groups and 
in turn, this power relationship creates respect, which ensures 
that everything will be done in a dignified manner. Then, once 
this is established, you can talk about a clean, decent labour 
contract. But as long as there is no anti-scab legislation in place, 
this cannot be achieved.
<P>
	In front of the Ogilvie Mills workers here on Parliament Hill 
on September 19, the minister promised to amend the Canada 
Labour Code to ban strike-breaking. He was to bring in a bill 
making the required changes to the code. This sounded rather 
interesting. But more recently, on December 4 to be exact, the 
minister backed away, claiming that his department was 
preparing another bill, a bill on pay equity, which really has 
nothing to do with anti-scab legislation.
<P>
	So, based on that, I wonder, and I repeat the question I asked 
earlier: how can the minister justify his about-face on the need 
to incorporate anti-scab amendments into the Canada Labour 
Code? How does he explain this about-face, as I asked him 
before, except as an act of obvious lack of political courage?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joe Fontana (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, part I of the Canada Labour 
Code establishes the framework for industrial relations and 
regulates the conduct of collective bargaining in the federal 
private sector.
<P>
	This jurisdiction covers the operations of enterprises which 
fall within the definition of federal work, undertaking or 
business and includes interprovincial and international rail, 
road and pipeline transportation, air  transportation, shipping, 
longshoring, grain handling, telecommunications, 
broadcasting, banking and certain crown corporations.
<P>
	As the Minister of Human Resources Development indicated 
on December 5 in responding to an inquiry raised by the hon. 
member for Manicouagan, part I of the Canada Labour Code, 
including the issue of replacement workers, is currently being 
reviewed with the view to modernizing and improving it so that 
it can better reflect today's realities. Creating a legislative 
framework which is free of barriers to co-operative labour 
management relationships also supports the initiative of the 
Minister of Industry in building a more innovative economy.
<P>
	The minister has asked a senior assistant deputy minister to 
undertake the review process. This involves a consultative 
process with business, labour unions and other affected parties 
to seek their views. The views expressed during the consultative 
process will be carefully considered prior to introducing 
amendments to part I of the Canada Labour Code.
<P>
<b> (2005) </B>
<P>
	The hon. member for Manicouagan also made reference to a 
dispute involving Archer Daniels Midland Company, formerly 
Ogilvie Flour Mills, and the Syndicat national des employés des 
Minoteries Ogilvie Ltée.
<P>
	The company and the union are currently negotiating the 
renewal of their collective agreement which expired on January 
31, 1992, and which covers approximately 150 flour mill 
employees. When the parties were to conclude an agreement 
with the assistance of a conciliation officer appointed by the 
minister they were placed in a strike-lockout position. The 
union membership began a strike on June 6, 1994, following the 
rejection of a company offer on the previous day.
<P>
	A federal mediator met with the parties in July and October of 
1994 but little progress was made. Meanwhile the union filed a 
request with the minister for consent to file a complaint with the 
Canada Labour Relations Board alleging that the company had 
failed to bargain in good faith.
<P>
	Ministerial consent was granted and the CLRB held a hearing 
on November 4, 1994, at which time the parties agreed to resume 
mediation meetings in an effort to settle their differences. The 
mediator met with the parties November 30 and December 1 and 
talks resumed today, December 13, 1994.
<P>
	A federal mediator resumed meetings with the parties today 
and mediation talks are scheduled to continue December 14 and 
15. It is encouraging that the parties are continuing to meet and I 
am advised some progress is being made. Both sides have been 
urged to take advantage of this opportunity to arrive at a 
settlement of their long and difficult dispute.

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CANADIAN WHEAT BOARD">CANADIAN WHEAT BOARD</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, pursuant 
to Standing Order 37(3) I rise to get a more detailed answer to 
questions I raised on December 5 and 6.
<P>
	As a person who is concerned about the future of the Canadian 
Wheat Board I feel it is imperative to point out some of the 
activities of its government appointed commissioners during the 
advisory committee elections. I believe these activities point 
out problems with the board which could, if not immediately 
dealt with, lead to its demise over the next few years.
<P>
	The real threat to the Canadian Wheat Board is not from 
outside but rather from within and result from its lack of 
accountability and its lack of willingness to change. The main 
issue to be dealt with is the complete lack of accountability of 
these appointed commissioners to western Canadian farmers.
<P>
	This is a concern I have heard from farmers over the past 
several years. After all, farmers pay all of the operating costs of 
the Canadian Wheat Board out of their pockets. Why does it 
seem too much to ask for the commissioners that run the board to 
be directly accountable to farmers? The only way to ensure that 
the board of directors is accountable to farmers is by allowing 
farmers to elect them. There is no other way.
<P>
	On Monday, December 5, I asked the minister of agriculture 
about the results of the Canadian Wheat Board advisory 
committee elections. I mentioned it was no surprise that less 
than 40 per cent of farmers eligible to vote turned out to elect 
these largely symbolic positions.
<P>
	What was a surprise, however, was that leading up to the 
election, Lorne Hehn, the chief commissioner campaigned for a 
group of candidates that had a specific political agenda. In 
addition Richard Klassen wrote an ``open letter to prairie wheat 
and barley growers''. Their articles appeared in the <I>Western 
Producer</I>, <I>Grainews</I>, and many local papers.
<P>
	Section 17(4) of the Canadian Wheat Board Act strictly 
prohibits these actions. It states: ``It is the duty of the board to 
exercise direction and supervision over the administrative 
conduct of an election of members of the advisory committee''. 
Therefore, the role of commissioners parallels that of Elections 
Canada in a federal election.
<P>
	By promoting the point of view of one group of candidates the 
commissioners, I believe, violated the Wheat Board Act and the 
trust given to the people who hold these positions. On this basis I 
asked for the resignation of those who knowingly violated 
politically neutral positions.
<P>
	In his response the agriculture minister said he would not ask 
for their resignations because he had no proof to justify these 
allegations. He also stated it was not unusual  for a chief 
commissioner, from time to time, to defend the policies and 
practices of the wheat board.
<P>
	The proof can be found in the chief commissioner's words and 
in the words of other commissioners. Not only did the chief 
commissioner openly offer his opinion in the November 17 issue 
of the <I>Western Producer</I> but he also stated that during the 
board's 60-year history it is entirely unusual for commissioners 
to defend the actions of the board.
<P>
<b> (2010 ) </B>
<P>
	Hehn states: ``The events of recent weeks compel me to 
violate the long tradition of silence on controversial grain policy 
issues. I do so at the risk of being accused of meddling''. 
Therefore, Mr. Hehn knowingly violated section 17(4) of the 
Canadian Wheat Board Act. This is a very serious offence and I 
am sure the chief commissioner was aware of the consequences.
<P>
	Clearly, the politically neutral stance of the wheat board was 
violated by the chief commissioner and other commissioners. It 
is also clear that the actions of these individuals should be 
reviewed. Furthermore, it is clear to everyone that farmers must 
review and make decisions about how their marketing agency 
should be run.
<P>
	I have three specific questions for the minister. With this 
evidence before him, will the minister acknowledge that the 
commissioners have violated the Canadian Wheat Board Act 
and the trust given to them? Will the minister ask for the 
resignation of all commissioners who campaigned during the 
period leading up to the advisory committee elections? Will the 
minister replace those political appointed commissioners with 
an elected board of directors? If yes, when? If not, why on earth 
not?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lyle Vanclief (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
point out that section 17(4) of the Canadian Wheat Board Act 
referred to by the member for Vegreville addresses the 
administrative requirements for an election of a Canadian 
Wheat Board advisory committee.
<P>
	The recent speeches and articles by the Canadian Wheat 
Board commissioners are a response to producer requests for 
more information on the board and how it markets wheat and 
barley on behalf of the producers.
<P>
	The Canadian Wheat Board commissioners did not campaign 
on behalf of any candidates. They were responding to those 
producers who want more information. It is only logical that the 
wheat board commissioners who are charged with the 
responsibility of marketing wheat and barley on behalf of the 
western Canadian producers would be in the best position to 
describe how they are fulfilling their responsibilities.
<P>

<P>
<HR>

<P>
	As the hon. member well knows, the debate on the issue of 
grain marketing has been ongoing. It was not initiated with the 
particular Canadian Wheat Board advisory committee election 
and it will not end with this election.
<P>
	As we have stated on numerous occasions, producers need the 
opportunity to discuss the grain marketing issue in a logical, 
structured form with all the facts available to them. The 
producers will be provided with a forum to discuss and debate 
the issue over the coming months.
<P>
	Any decision on how we market grains and oilseeds should be 
made in the context of where we want our grain industry to be in 
five to ten years from now. As a result, the federal government 
has initiated discussions with the industry to develop a longer 
term vision.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="BANKS">BANKS</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
when inflation is high in Canada, bank profits are high. When 
inflation is low in Canada, bank profits are high. When the 
economy is in recession, bank profits are high. When the 
economy is in a growth mode, bank profits are high. When 
interest rates are high in this country, bank profits are high. 
When interest rates are low, bank profits are high. They are high 
in every circumstance when it comes to economic indicators.
<P>
	The fact is that bank profits continue to be high in this 
country. In view of the fact that the chartered banks donated to 
the Liberal Party over $700,000 to the last campaign in Canada 
and the financial institutions as a whole donated over a million 
dollars to the Liberal Party slush fund in the last campaign, I am 
curious to know why the banks continue to get a free ride when it 
comes to contributing their fair share to building Canada.
<P>
	In the last year alone the six major chartered banks in Canada 
reported profits of $4.3 billion. The chartered banks have an 
important role in our country's economy due largely to the 
regulations that are in place under the Bank Act. With the 
privilege of banking should come the responsibility of assisting 
in the development of our economy.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance agrees that Canada's deficit is a 
serious problem. He, in consultation with the Minister of Human 
Resources Development, has made it clear that they will be 
making cuts and reductions to Canada's social security 
programs. Many Canadians have experienced the hardship of 
the recession and also faced cutbacks to their unemployment 
insurance coverage.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance has made it clear that we will all be 
tightening our belts to help pay down Canada's debt. Meanwhile 
we have the banks in Canada that have made huge profits during 
hard economic times. They have made their profits on the backs 
of Canadians. It is money that is made on the spread of interest 
rates, financial transactions and on the government debt.
<P>
	Another reason is bank service charges. Service charges are 
one of the fastest growth areas for banks. They allow the banks 
to continue making money in hard times and in good times.
<P>
	I believe the government should ask the banks to justify their 
banking practices and their actions. As responsible corporate 
citizens the banks have a moral responsibility to pay their fair 
share of taxes and to reinvest their wealth in Canada and create 
jobs.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance has a responsibility to regulate the 
banks and ensure that they participate in our country's economic 
recovery.
<P>
	Bank customers receive interest rates of 2 per cent or 3 per 
cent on their savings accounts while being charged up to 11 per 
cent on their loans. The interest rate spread is wide and the banks 
are the winners on the spread.
<P>
	After 127 years of Liberal and Conservative governments in 
Canada we are approaching $550 billion in debt. There has been 
no job creation as a result of this latest bank manoeuvre. The 
banks have made profit by cutting back on staff as a matter of 
fact. A year go the Royal Bank announced the need to slash 
3,000 jobs from its payroll as well as another 1,100 jobs from its 
newly acquired Royal Trust, because of the recession its said.
<P>
	Is the Royal Bank now willing to create 4,000 new jobs or is it 
going to continue to make profit at the expense of its former 
employees? The answer to that is not likely.
<P>
	The Royal Bank in 1993 year end made profits of $324 million 
and paid absolutely no taxes. As a matter of fact, it received 
from the federal government and the revenue department $5 
million in tax credits.
<P>
	Two years ago the CIBC announced cutbacks of 2,500 jobs. In 
fact, 14,000 banking jobs have been eliminated in the past four 
years. Banks reasoned that cutbacks were necessary but now we 
see their profit margins. The banks lost money on bad real estate 
loans primarily over ambitious commercial projects in foreign 
countries. As well, they have lost money loaning money to other 
countries without providing the same equity backup and 
guarantees that individuals in Canada must provide.
<P>
	I am asking in summary that the government provide 
leadership on this issue and ensure that the banks make a 
stronger contribution by paying their fair share of taxes back to 
this country and to institute a fair interest rate policy and to 
justify some of their monopolistic practices so that Canadians 
do benefit from banks when they make a profit.
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Walker (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, over the past few weeks six major 
banks have reported their profits for the year ending October 31, 
1994. The six largest banks reported profits of over $4.2 billion, 
a 47 per cent increase over last year. This has prompted some 
<P>

<B><A NAME="9051"> 9051 </A></B>
<P>
observers to ask whether the banks are paying their fair share of 
tax.
<P>
	Banks do pay considerable amounts of tax. Banks pay income 
taxes and are subject to two federal capital taxes, the large 
corporations tax which applies to all corporations with more 
than $10 million of capital, and the financial institutions capital 
tax. This latter tax is paid annually at an average rate of 1.25 per 
cent of capital. This tax is designed as a minimum tax for banks 
and other large financial institutions.
<P>
	Over the past five years the six largest banks and their 
mortgage subsidiaries paid on average $850 million per year in 
federal income and capital taxes. In 1991 and 1992 they paid 
around $1 billion per year in federal income and capital taxes.
<P>
	Banks also paid income, capital, property and other taxes to 
provincial and municipal governments.
<P>
	The hon. member is no doubt aware that further measures 
were introduced in the 1994 budget to ensure that banks and 
other financial institutions continue to pay their fair share of 
tax. These changes will improve the measurement of income on 
securities and loans held as part of their ordinary course of 
business.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Pursuant to Standing 
Order 38, the motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to 
have been adopted. Accordingly, this House stands adjourned 
until tomorrow at 2 p.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24.
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 8.19 p.m.)
