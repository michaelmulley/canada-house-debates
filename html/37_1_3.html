</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Year of the Snake, mankind can expect greater

greatly rewarding.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on November 27, 2000, the Liberal Party of Canada won an 
important victory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's Prime Minister, the leader of our political party, 
managed the impressive feat of getting his government elected for 
its third consecutive term of office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal Party of Canada improved its results in terms of 
votes cast, and obtained more votes in Quebec than the Bloc 
Quebecois, which lost six members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We owe this victory to Quebecers, of course, but also to our 
Prime Minister, who has been able to rely on the unwavering 
support of his wife through these many years of political life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In yesterday's throne speech, the Prime Minister urged us to 
build the Canada of tomorrow on a strong foundation.  He also 
urged us to build a world-leading Canadian economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister has the full support of the Liberal team when 
he calls on the people of Canada to share their prosperity, to 
fight against exclusion and to help children get the right start 
in life.

Speaker, I rise today to draw attention to the role that our 
government can play in helping to end one of the greatest human 
rights tragedies of our new century.  I speak of the Chinese 
government's brutal repression of freedom of conscience in 
general and of Falun Gong in particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister will shortly be departing for China on a team 
Canada mission.  Team Canada missions are about trade, and I am 
sure that every member of the House will agree that free trade 
and free enterprise promote human rights.  Team Canada missions 
are also about aid, and aid to a tyrannical government can be 
interpreted by that government as an endorsement of and a subsidy 
for its repressive actions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian aid, and that includes any subsidized or preferential 
trade, must be linked to human rights.  If the persecution 
continues there can be no room for Canada to give aid to China. 
This is the message that team Canada must take to China.

scale of 7.5 ripped through the Indian state of Gujarat, leaving 
tens of thousands homeless and killing others.  The toll is 
13,000 and rising.  Thousands of children and families are in 
need of emergency aid as they are without food, water, shelter 
and medical supplies.  The federal government has acted quickly 
by providing $3 million in aid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage the federal government to further its aid for the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, in yesterday's throne speech Canadian 
farmers were hoping to hear a federal vision for agriculture. 
Instead they were told to move beyond crisis management and find 
better uses for their land.  They were hoping to hear a 
commitment to support farm families and to vigorously fight the 
foreign subsidies that have suppressed grain prices and oppressed 
the family farm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are farmers surprised to have been ignored by the government yet 
again?  No, they expected it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nick Parsons, from Farmington, B.C. in my riding, has once 
again brought his combine, Prairie Belle, to Parliament Hill 
seeking fairness for Canadian farm families.  Last year in a 
private meeting, the Prime Minister assured Nick that the 
government was doing all it could for western farmers.  Yet when 
the government had the chance to offer some hope to farm families 
in the throne speech, it was not a priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals' agricultural legacy of inaction and indifference 
is a disgrace.  Yesterday's throne speech provided the latest

P.E.I. potato industry is being devastated by unfair United 
States trade action.  The single biggest threat to our most 
important industry is not the potato wart, which was discovered 
in October and quickly and appropriately dealt with using sound 
science, but the threat of United States protectionism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of being wrongly banned from the United States 
market and having taken action to protect the rest of Canada's 
potato industry, P.E.I. producers have suffered extreme losses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call upon the federal government to take strong action. 
Potatoes originating in states with a record of potato related 
diseases should be subjected to the most rigorous scrutiny at the 
border.  Soil testing requirements similar to those required for 
us should be instituted for states.  Finally, the federal 
government must come forward with an assistance program to deal 
with the financial hurt.

yesterday's throne speech we heard about the so-called Liberal 
vision of a prosperous nation ready to embrace globalization, but 
who really gets to be included in the new high tech Canada of the 
future?  It is not the 200,000 homeless people sleeping on the 
streets tonight, not the 14% of Canadian families who continue to 
live in poverty, not the students facing crushing debt loads and 
not the thousands of aboriginal peoples dealing with the 
hardships of life in our urban cores. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the throne speech signals the return to Liberal roots of 
social justice, then a heck of a lot of people got left behind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Social justice is not about vague promises or hollow platitudes. 
It is not about the Liberal tradition of announcing the same old 
patchwork programs over and over.  Social justice is about real 
inclusion.  It is about a national housing strategy, universal 
day care, a national grants program and acknowledging the 
responsibility to off reserve aboriginal peoples.  That is what 
the throne speech should have been about.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian

period, and I know members opposite on the government side are 
just itching to join with me, by congratulating the Prime 
Minister on his successful re-election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The economy continues to 
show signs of change.  There is no question that we are headed 
into turbulent times.  We think we will be able to sail through 
the choppy waters, but not without a budget in place that clearly 
shows the change in the reaction to the revenue assumptions, the 
change in the exchange rates, interest rates and revenue flows. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of these changes and in light of the fact that it is 
unprecedented that a government would start a session without a 
budget, will the Prime Minister reconsider and present a budget 
this February?

congratulations on the election.  I want to offer my 
congratulations to him and to every member for winning their 
seats. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the question from the Leader of the Opposition about a 
budget, the government was very wise to have a mini budget in 
October because the reality is that the tax cuts that the 
Americans are dreaming about at this moment were implemented in 
Canada as of January 1, 2001. 
<P><A NAME="LINK40"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, that teeny tax reduction by the 
Liberals in no way compares to what is happening in the United 
States and that is a cause for concern. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although we have every reason to be optimistic, it would be 
logical and prudent for the government's forecasts to reflect the 
new economic realities. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Prime Minister has no idea of the implications of the tax 
reductions and no idea of the assumptions can he at least give us 
the total cost of the promises in the Speech from the Throne 
delivered yesterday?   What is the total? 
<P><A NAME="LINK41"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, everything that was written in our program was costed 
before.  Contrary to the opposition party, which cannot add its 
figures very well, we know everything that was in the plans that 
we submitted to the Canadian public.  As we said in the Speech 
from the Throne, we know exactly what the cost will be, which is 
what we told Canadians during the last campaign. 
<P><A NAME="LINK42"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian 
Alliance):</B> Mr. Speaker, the answer, for those who need a 
deciphering of that response, was that the Prime Minister does 
not know the cost of what was put into the Speech from the 
Throne.  A few moments ago it was announced that the U.S. rate 
was lowered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the Prime Minister indicate to us if there is anybody on 
that side who knows the cost of those promises?  The Prime 
Minister does not.  Is there anyone on his team who does? 
<P><A NAME="LINK43"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, over the years the opposition has complained and has 
always blamed our Minister of Finance for being too prudent in 
his forecasting.  It was good that he developed a habit of being 
prudent because it now gives us a lot of comfort.  If adjustments 
are needed we will of course make them.

offices both in Ottawa and Toronto have been evacuated.  The 
immigration building here in Ottawa is, and I quote, “closed 
until further notice”.   Will the immigration minister stand and 
confirm today that it is because of a suspected biological 
threat? 
<P><A NAME="LINK46"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Elinor Caplan (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration,

what happened.  An envelope was received in my office.  It was 
opened.  There was a substance inside.  The substance was tested. 
As soon as it was determined it contained bacteria, it was 
immediately sent to a lab for testing.  Because of our concern 
for the employees who work for us the building was closed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK47"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it seems to me that there should be some mechanism 
in place before people open general mail.  There are reports that 
this could potentially be anthrax.  That moves it into a

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  The hon. member for Edmonton 
North has the floor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is hard to believe 
there is so much noise on the floor of the House of Commons when 
lives are potentially in danger. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report has come out that the substance may possibly be 
anthrax.   What is the immigration minister able to do and what 
will she do to make sure that she is in control of her department 
and in control of this crisis that is ongoing now? 
<P><A NAME="LINK48"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Elinor Caplan (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration,

member opposite that it is irresponsible to speculate on what the 
substance might be.  The scientists are making that decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second thing I will tell her is that the employees who came 
into contact with the substance were immediately examined by 
physicians and given, as a precaution, antibiotics to ensure that 
their health and safety was our number one priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support the decision of the senior management of my department 
to close the building until we have the answers to all the 
questions.  I also want her to know that the issues have been 
referred to the appropriate authorities, the RCMP and the 
scientists, and everything that should be done is being done.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday's throne speech made repeated references to what the 
Prime Minister calls “the Canadian way”, which is just an 
excuse for increased interference in the jurisdictions of Quebec 
and the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, the main innovation in the throne speech was to ignore 
federal jurisdiction or introduce a series of initiatives that 
ride roughshod over the jurisdictions of Quebec and the 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore ask the Prime Minister if he can explain to us why 
the only area in which he really shows any imagination is that of 
interfering in jurisdictions that do not concern him. 
<P><A NAME="LINK51"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
in the throne speech we alluded more than once to the fact that 
we had agreements with the provinces in all these areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have signed a number of agreements, regarding children in 
particular. We have been working together with the provinces for 
several years now and we are continuing to do so because we

<P><A NAME="LINK52"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
speaking of agreements, there was one on health last September. 
Let us remember that it came about after the federal government 
cut off health funding.  The provinces were left holding the bag 
because they had to provide the services.  This has been a great 
hardship to the provinces.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, for 
years, the provinces, and Quebec in particular, have had problems 
with health service funding.  The reason for this is simple: the 
needs are in Quebec, while the money is in Ottawa. Instead of 
dealing with this problem in the throne speech, the Prime 
Minister has again trotted out his obsession with the “citizens' 
council”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Aware as he is that the present level of federal funding of 
health systems has dropped from 20% to 14%, can the Prime 
Minister not, instead of hanging on to this pointless concept, 
assume his responsibilities and raise the transfer payments to 
their 1994 level, as all provincial premiers are demanding? 
<P><A NAME="LINK56"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as 
the Prime Minister has said, several months ago Quebec signed an 
agreement, along with all the other provinces, concerning not 
just health care funding but health care system reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have considerably increased transfer payments to the 
provinces for health and we have reached an agreement on the 
priorities for reform and improvements to our health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are therefore working together, the federal government, 
Quebec and all the other provinces, on this public priority. 
<P><A NAME="LINK57"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, at 
the time this agreement with the premiers was reached, his idea 
of the “citizens' council” was rejected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the Prime Minister explain to us why he insists on imposing 
this fancy of his, which will in no way improve health care and 
services, whereas considerable progress would be made if he were 
to increase transfer payments?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
during the election campaign, we promised to work toward setting 
up such a council in order to get Canadians more directly 
involved in the process of health care reform.  It is clear, 
however, that we are going to proceed by consulting our 
provincial partners, and  I intend to raise this matter with my

Mr. Speaker, Canadians will be very surprised to learn all of a 
sudden that we have lower taxes than the United States.  Our 
taxes federally are at least a third higher than in the United 
States.  That was one heck of a nose stretcher. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister says that everything is fine and that we 
can be happy.  The chairman of the U.S. federal reserve says that 
there is zero growth in our largest trading partner.  Many major 
economists say the U.S. is headed into a recession or is in a 
recession. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has cut an unprecedented one full point off interest rates in 
the last month, including today.  The markets are not reacting. 
This could pose a crisis for the economy.  What does the finance 
minister intend to do about it? 
<P><A NAME="LINK81"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I neglected to congratulate the member for Richmond on 
posing his first question in the House, and I would like to 
congratulate him.  I wish I could congratulate the financial 
critic who was in New York with me at the time we had discussions 
with representatives of the American business community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They seemed to understand that Canadian corporate taxes will be 
lower than those of the United States.  They understood that our 
capital gains taxes are now lower than those of the United 
States.  They also understood that our treatment of stock options 
is more generous than in the United States.  If they understand 
it in the States, why does the critic for the Alliance not 
understand it? 
<P><A NAME="LINK82"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, if they understand it, why are Canadian business 
people, investors and young people leaving the country every day 
to pursue economic opportunities in the United States?  They 
understand that there are greater economic opportunities where 
taxes are lower. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister is avoiding a very serious issue.  We 
export more manufactured goods to the United States than we 
consume domestically.  Consumer demand in the United States is 
going through the floor.  The stock markets, as we speak, are 
actually reacting negatively to a 50 basis point cut in the fed 
rate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the finance minister propose to do?  Will he just 
ignore the growing storm clouds on the horizon, or will he bring 
in a budget that cuts taxes and does so quickly? 
<P><A NAME="LINK83"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, there is no doubt that the implications of the slowing 
U.S. economy will have their effect in Canada.  We will monitor 
the situation very closely and if it is necessary to take action 
we will take it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think I should be able to simply cite one economic forecaster 
among the many in the country to tell members exactly what the 
government has done.  Let me simply do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Conference Board of Canada indicates that recent changes in 
taxation, combined with the spillover from the 2000 budget, have 
created cuts in personal income tax, boosting household spending 
power in Canada.  It goes on to say that at a time when the U.S. 
economy is slowing and exporters are hurting, the federal 
government in Canada appears to be riding to the rescue.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The government of Saskatchewan has put some support there, but 
nowhere near the level of support that some other provinces have 
given to individual farmers.

farmers will be fulfilled.  I can guarantee that.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>POINTS OF ORDER 
</H3><P align=left>
<P><A NAME="LINK132"></A></P>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>GOVERNOR GENERAL'S SPECIAL WARRANT 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK133"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I notice in <I>The Canada Gazette</I> that an amount of 
$1.768 billion has been approved by Governor General's special 
warrant providing for expenditures from January 13, 2001 to 
February 11, 2001. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer to private member's Bill C-270, assented to on February 
19, 1997, with which I think the Speaker is quite familiar.  If I 
may quote the bill, it says “Subject to subsection (1.1) where 
payment is urgently required for the public good” and “there is 
no other appropriation pursuant to which the payment may be 
made”, the Governor General may authorize the payment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I look at the details of this special warrant, I see that 
they are all basically for operating expenditures.  The House 
approved operating expenditures for all the departments mentioned 
when we approved the main estimates last June. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore in my opinion this is not eligible to be approved by 
way of special warrant because there was already an appropriation 
made by the House last June to cover the operating expenditures 
for the departments listed in this special warrant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore I would like to ask the President of the Treasury 
Board why this $1.768 billion of taxpayer money is being expended 
without reference to the House and when this will be rectified. 
Perhaps she could clarify whether or not this is actually legal, 
because in my opinion it is in contravention of the law as it 
currently stands.

<A HREF="#LINKT13"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The Chair has grave reservations as to 
whether this is in fact a point of order or a matter of argument 
on the application of the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the government House leader, in a brief reply, could 
clarify the situation for the hon. member for St. Albert in a way 
that would let the matter rest for the time being at least.  I 
know there will be other opportunities to investigate these 
special warrants. 
<P><A NAME="LINK134"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will be very brief.  Standing 
Order 81 explains for the hon. member and for anyone else how the 
convention of supply works.  It should be obvious to anyone that 
the House could not grant supply before parliament had been 
reconvened.  The House was of course called back to elect our 
Speaker on Monday and received its Speech from the Throne 
yesterday.  The hon. member knows that even before estimates 
could be approved by the House we would need at least seven 
opposition days in order to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member is questioning whether these expenditures are 
necessary because they are for operations.  Need I remind him 
that if there is no money for operations and the government 
ceases to function at the same time as he and his colleagues are 
demanding further expenditures, there would be at least something 
wrong.  It is not only the privilege but the duty of the 
government to ensure that the government functions until 
parliament can properly grant supply. 
<P><A NAME="LINK135"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  We will treat the matter as closed for 
the time being.  I am going from memory at this point, but my 
recollection is that these special warrants are referred to the 
standing committee on something or other, and I think it is the 
public accounts committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the hon. member for St. Albert was a member if not the 
chair of that committee in the last parliament.  Who knows what 
will happen when the striking committee reports, but I am sure 
that if he is the chair he will be able to take up that matter in 
the committee with vigour and enthusiasm and find out all the 
details about whether there was anything amiss in the special 
warrant to which he refers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the Chair has notice of a point of order from the hon. 
member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough. 
<P><A NAME="LINK136"></A></P>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>ORAL QUESTION PERIOD 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK137"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, allow me to congratulate you on your rocket-like 
ascent to position of Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I rise on two points of order.  My first point of order concerns 
a letter that was referred to in an answer in question period.  I 
would ask that the Minister of Industry table the letter so that 
it forms a part of the record of the 37th parliament.  I 
acknowledge that he has provided us with a copy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My second point of order concerns a response to a question I 
posed to the Prime Minister.  The Minister of Industry 
characterized my question as a false and misleading statement. 
Mr. Speaker, I would refer you to Beauchesne's sixth edition, a 
publication that I know you are very attached to.  At page 151, 
citation 494, it states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been formally ruled by Speakers that statements by Members 
respecting themselves and particularly within their own knowledge 
must be accepted.  It is not unparliamentary temperately to 
criticize statements made by Members as being contrary to the 
facts; but no imputation of intentional falsehood is permissible. 
On rare occasions this may result in the House having to accept 
two contradictory accounts of the same incident. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It may be that the Minister of Industry is feeling a bit testy 
because his old riding of Straits—White Bay North has just gone 
Tory for the first time since Confederation.  Trevor Taylor was 
elected there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask in all honesty that the new member would now 
withdraw that characterization as false and misleading in this 
Chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I will deal with the first issue concerning 
the tabling of a letter.  If the Minister of Industry did read 
from a letter, I would be glad to hear from him on that point. 
<P><A NAME="LINK138"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Bonavista—Trinity—Conception, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I would be very happy to table the letter in 
question but pursuant to standing orders I will have to await the 
appropriately translated version of the letter in order to lay it 
on the table of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I await your direction on this, but with respect to 
the second matter I would be happy to respond now if the Speaker 
so desires.

</P>
<P><A NAME="LINK139"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The hon. member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough has raised an interesting point. 
Perhaps if instead of reading Beauchesne's he had read Marleau 
and Montpetit, he would have come up with a slightly different 
bent on his argument. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As he knows, Beauchesne's is an older book now and Marleau and 
Montpetit is just the latest and greatest on procedural matters, 
of course.  I know the hon. member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough reads that book extensively. 
However the difficulty is that the words the Minister of Industry 
used did not include the words deliberately misleading.  My 
recollection, without having gone through Marleau and Montpetit 
extensively on this occasion, is that the words must be that the 
statement was deliberately misleading the House. He did not say 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Accordingly, while I heard him say it and the thought passed 
through my mind, as I know it did through that of the member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough and sent him running for 
Beauchesne's, I do not feel that he has transgressed the rules 
today on this point.  Accordingly I have nothing further to say. 
I do not think the point of order is well taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Brian Tobin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I was well aware that the 
word deliberately in fact would have put me in a position where I 
would have transgressed the rules of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I want to say that I have been in a far gentler House 
for the last five years, a gentle place full of gentlemen and 
gentlewomen, and I realize today that I have returned somewhat to 
old form.  Even though I have not violated the rules of the 
House, because it is my first day back and I want a good start, 
if I in any way, shape or form have offended the sensibilities of 
the member opposite, I want him to know that I hope he sleeps 
well tonight.

motion that I believe is supported by members of all parties 
represented in the House and is seconded by my colleague, the 
member for Vancouver East. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I move that this House condemn the cruel punishment of 100

torture, the UN convention on the rights of the child and the

order to seek guidance of the Chair.  There have been 
consultations on all sides of the House and an agreement from 
members representing all parties.  With great respect, I wonder 
if the Speaker might seek consent of the House once again.  I 
think he might find that it is forthcoming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Perhaps there were consultations with all House leaders. However, 
when members produce a long motion like the member just gave 
looking for unanimous consent, I think some of us would prefer a 
bit of notice so we could consider it in detail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I think it is apparent there is not consent. 
Clearly the hon. member could put his motion on the notice paper 
and then seek consent once it has been on the notice paper for a 
period of time.  Perhaps that is the way to deal with it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
welcome back to the chair.  I have had a lot of good 
opportunities when you have been in the chair to ask permission 
for an emergency debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under Standing Order 52, I ask that the House, through your 
auspices in the chair, allow an emergency debate with respect to 
the crisis in agriculture today.  As seen in the House today, all 
parties, including the government, agree that there is a general 
crisis in agriculture.  We should have the opportunity in the 
House to discuss openly what is happening right now in my 
community and other communities across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1999 we have lost 22,000 farmers.  The year 2000 was the 
worst.  The year 2001 and beyond will be worse yet.  We have to 
talk about short term requirements and long term support 
programs, and we have to talk about them now.  I ask the Speaker 
to allow us an emergency debate on agriculture.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The Chair has carefully considered the

the House that we are debating today, tomorrow, and I believe 
Friday, the Address in Reply to the Speech from the Throne.  That 
allows debate on any topic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since any topic may be raised, including the very important

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>RESUMPTION OF DEBATE ON ADDRESS IN REPLY 
</H4><P align=left>

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from January 30 consideration of the motion 
for an address to Her Excellency the Governor General in reply 
to her speech at the opening of the session. 
<P><A NAME="LINK160"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I rise to resume debate on the Address in Reply to 
the Speech from the Throne. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I wish to thank Her Excellency the Governor General for 
the class that she displayed in delivering the Speech from the 
Throne and for the passion with which she fulfils her duties as 
the representative of Her Majesty the Queen in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were all very touched by her recent visit to the Innu 
children of Sheshatsiu. Her Excellency travelled there on behalf 
of all Canadians to show our compassion toward the children of 
this community in crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to congratulate the leaders of all the other parties 
for the way they campaigned. I know that harsh words were 
sometimes spoken and that Canadians expressed their frustration 
at the tone used during that period, but I also know that party 
leaders are dedicated and determined people and that they firmly 
believe in what they do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I wish to congratulate the Prime Minister on getting a 
new mandate from Canadians. 
The official opposition has a duty to ensure that the government 
fulfils the responsibilities it has been given by Canadians. 
While we sometimes disagree with the policies or administrative 
measures of this government, our task is made easier in knowing 
that the Prime Minister cares about serving the public and loves 
our country. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure everybody in the House would agree, regardless of 
party, that when I say our greatest desire is to help the people 
of the country achieve their greatest potential that should 
be our goal.  We want our constituents and all Canadians to be 
able to meet their daily needs, to reach their personal goals and 
to fulfil their dreams. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hear a lot of talk about the difference among regions in 
the country and the difference of goals and the difference of 
values.  I believe there is much more that joins us than divides 
us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All Canadians have hope and aspirations for their future.  I 
think we would all agree that all Canadians want good jobs that 
allow them to live in comfort.  They want an excellent education 
for their children.  They want health care to be available when 
they need it.  They want a clean environment.  They want safe 
communities and strong families.  They want freedom in the 
pursuit of their dreams. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the hopes and dreams all Canadians share regardless of 
regions in the country.  Our task in the House is to make sure 
that people have the freedom and the ability to achieve those 
hopes and dreams. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two basic philosophies or approaches toward government 
in terms of seeing a people attain their hopes and dreams. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On one side there is a strong interventionist approach that 
holds that the machinery of government should be intervening 
significantly throughout economic and social life.  In helping 
citizens to reap the harvest of their dreams, the government 
chooses the field, prepares the land, selects the seed, plants 
the crop, drives the plough, harvests the crop and markets the 
produce.  The people do what the state tells them and then they 
receive what the state gives them and are expected to be happy 
with the results.  This is sometimes called an entitlement 
approach because people receive what the government tells them 
they are entitled to have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other approach says that people themselves should plant and 
harvest their own field of dreams.  It is individual 
citizens who should choose their field, sow the seeds of their 
own hopes and harvest the yield of their own crop of dreams.  The 
government's role is to ensure that all are treated fairly under 
laws of equality and that all have an equal opportunity to work 
toward the dreams and receive the rewards of their own efforts. 
This is sometimes called an empowerment approach because people 
are given the tools and resources they need to pursue their 
goals, their hopes and their dreams. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These two approaches are not totally incompatible.  All 
democratic societies have a blend of intervention and also 
freedom, entitlement and empowerment.  There are genuine 
entitlements; the right to support seniors in the form of 
pensions and the right to health care for all, which we all 
accept.  Advocates of both models believe society must show care 
and compassion, especially for those who cannot care for 
themselves.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the lessons of the last century is that the philosophy of 
a limited form of government and intervention, one which 
encourages empowerment rather than one which intervenes all the 
time in terms of entitlement, is the one that yields the broadest 
possibility of people attaining their hopes and dreams. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the vision of the Canadian Alliance.  It is a vision of 
empowering Canadians.  Empowering Canadians means that rather 
than relying on politicians and bureaucrats to shape our 
collective future, we must instead see that people are equipped 
with the tools they need to build their own futures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In reply to the Speech from the Throne I will propose those 
things that we believe will explain why the positive vision of 
the Canadian Alliance, the official opposition, can be used in 
the attainment of these goals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can empower the Canadian economy by giving individuals, 
entrepreneurs and business more freedom, allowing them to keep 
more of their hard earned money and to fulfil their own 
potential.  We can empower Canadian community and civil society 
so that Canadians working together, especially at the local 
level, can be assured of excellent health care, a clean 
environment and safe streets and communities.  We can accomplish 
those things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can empower Canadian democracy, providing a renewed sense of 
citizenship and participation in the decisions of government, 
starting with reforms that are necessary right here in the House. 
This is the people's Chamber and we believe that a more 
democratic Canada will be a stronger and more united Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Democratic empowerment, community empowerment and economic 
empowerment is our vision for a stronger, better and a more 
united Canada.  We hope we can persuade the government that 
the philosophy of empowerment would result in a better country 
than would the fading philosophy of entitlement and massive 
intervention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speech from the Throne shows a government that has dozens 
and dozens of program ideas, vague promises and trial balloons. 
These are all well focus tested no doubt, but lacking in overall 
depth and understanding of the very nature of the people we 
serve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was interesting in the Senate chamber yesterday as I watched 
the effect of promise after promise on one of the very few young 
people who had been invited by the federal Liberals.  I 
say young people in deference to my wife who is here and also to 
others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has absolutely no reflection on Her Excellency who 
delivered a marvellous speech, but as the speech progressed and 
as promise after promise was made and laid upon the shoulders of 
Canadians with the ensuing cost, the face of the young person who 
works in the Senate became more and more pale and beads of sweat 
began to appear on his forehead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is just my assumption as to why he was suffering.  He 
looked like a strong young man and well intended but eventually 
he went down on one knee under the weight I presume of what he 
was hearing.  I had to encourage him, as did others.  I said not 
to worry, that we could address the situation.  He was helped to 
his feet and taken from the room somewhat refreshed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we want to do is take these old, tired ideas that the 
federal government brings to this Chamber and refresh them with 
the policies of empowerment that will especially see our young 
people stand strong and encouraged for the future which faces 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the reason we are making these proposals today, and we 
will continue to do so.  The government still believes in its 
heart that the answer to every problem is more and bigger 
government, more intervention and more dominance.  The government 
believes that it knows best and that the people of Canada cannot 
be relied upon to make decisions for themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe in the people of this country.  That is the big 
difference between us and the government.  We believe they know 
what is best for them.  We believe the role of government is to 
assist people, not to control them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was in the period of state expansion in the sixties and 
seventies that the philosophical ideas of the Liberal Government 
of Canada were formed.  The Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime 
Minister were a part of that era of dramatic government expansion 
and intervention.  The Minister of Finance, who was not there 
during those times, absorbed the whole process by osmosis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The experience of the eighties and nineties showed even the 
Liberals that the tax, borrow and spend policies of the sixties 
and seventies would eventually take us to the brink of economic 
disaster.  For those interested in that, the truths of classical 
economics were rediscovered. 
In plain terms, these are the same truths that most households 
are aware of from their own budgets.  What they do not have they 
cannot spend.  Even liberals and socialists, as we look 
historically around the world, have been forced to rediscover the 
virtues of balanced budgets and, more recently, tax reductions.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, politically the federal government has been forced 
to retreat from the position of intervention and entitlement, 
especially in the social field, through the use of its spending 
power.  It had to change course, not only because the federal 
intrusions were exacerbating federal-provincial tensions and 
fanning the flames of separatism in Quebec, but also because it 
could no longer afford that scale of intervention in the lives of 
its citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Economic and political reality have now forced the Liberals to 
retreat from the kind of massive deficit spending that they 
indulged in during the 1970s and 1980s.  What I am concerned 
about is that their heart has never been in it.  Their heart has 
never been there.  As we see the possibility of surpluses, I am 
very concerned about a return to those old ways because that is 
where their hearts are, massive intervention into these types of 
programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fundamentally, Liberals believe that there is no problem so 
tough, no challenge so difficult and no chasm so deep that it 
cannot be solved with another government program.  They have 
never understood that a less dominant state can lead to a 
stronger, healthier economy and a flourishing civil society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals have never understood that a less invasive state 
can be accompanied by the empowerment of individual families, 
citizens, community groups, businesses and local governments so 
that they themselves can find answers together to the challenges 
they face. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government asks Canadians for blind trust while showing a 
lack of trust in those Canadians.  The government believes in 
itself but we believe in the wisdom, hard work and ability of the 
Canadian people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will present the vision of the Canadian Alliance, the official 
opposition, and those proven policy positions which will enhance 
the quality of life for all Canadians.  First we have to look at 
empowering the Canadian economy.  The first step toward doing 
that is to make sure people are equipped with the tools they need 
to compete in the global economy of the future and that they are 
provided with the incentives that reward those efforts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The throne speech attempted to paint a rosy picture of the 
Canadian economy.  We heard again today that the picture may not 
be all that rosy.  There are cracks beneath the facade of 
economic prosperity.  We think that these cracks can be managed 
if the right policies are in place, but it appears as though 
those policies will not be in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The United States economy, which has been the economic engine of 
growth substantially for Canada and other economies for the last 
several years, is now reporting a possibility of zero growth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Alan Greenspan and the U.S. federal reserve have taken sharp 
rate cuts, again today, to stave off the economic slowdown.  Mr. 
Greenspan recently announced U.S. growth was near zero.  Canada 
is bound to feel the effects of this, especially in sectors where 
we rely on the United States, such as the automobile industry, 
the high tech industry and others where we are seeing an 
increased number of layoffs being reported.  With the threat of a 
slowdown, the Canadian people need a plan that will empower them 
and the economy to see them through these choppy seas that lay 
ahead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are the Liberals doing to empower Canadians and equipping 
them to face the uncertain economic times that we are now 
entering?  They have announced some teeny tax cuts in their teeny 
budget but these are grudging, half hearted, half step measures. 
Their hearts are not in it.  It is not enough in the short term 
to address the current economic uncertainty.  It is not enough to 
ensure that the Canadian economy will start to catch up to the 
United States or keep us from falling further behind.   We have 
already paid the price for that in a declining standard of living 
relative to other countries.  Our standard of living, as measured 
by real disposable income per capita, has actually declined from 
70% of the U.S. average in 1990 to just over 63% in the year 
2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The then Royal Bank's chief economist, now the member for 
Markham, commenting on the Canadian performance in the 1990s, 
used the Latin words decennium horribilis, roughly translated as 
being lousy Liberal politics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a survey of the 25 wealthiest OECD countries, Canada's growth 
and standard of living ranked a terrible 24th over the decade 
from 1988 to 1998.  Do we still enjoy good living in Canada?  Of 
course we do, but in which direction is it headed?  We must be 
consumed with that question.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ireland was actually number one and has moved from having only 
half of Canada's per capita income to almost the same level in a 
mere 10 years.  Think about that.  Ireland has doubled its 
standard of living in a decade while Canada has been standing 
still. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian economy is growing slightly now but it is falling 
behind many of our trading partners.  These realities must be 
recognized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have hope and optimism that these trends can be corrected but 
not on the plans and proposals offered to us by the government. 
If Canada does not catch up and overtake the productivity growth 
in the other countries, it will find itself continuing to fall 
behind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is worse is that the gap between the United States and 
Canada will grow and not shrink over the next few years.  With 
the Bush administration in the United States it is very clear 
that it is going to aggressively pursue tax reductions and debt 
reductions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Alan Greenspan has also given the nod of approval and stated 
that is a prudent way to go.  The gap will only increase in terms 
of competition and in terms of potential reward for people 
deciding where they are to put their investment dollars and where 
they should be working themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposals, which now seem on their way to implementation in 
the United States, echo the proposals of the official opposition. 
As a matter of fact the official opposition proposals were in 
place even before those of the Bush administration.  It must have 
been reading our manual somewhere along the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance calls for significant tax cuts and tax and 
debt reductions.  We want to empower Canadians by leaving them 
not just more of their hard earned money but with the hope for 
investment and opportunity in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The plan, if it is fully implemented, would save Canadians $130 
billion dollars over the next five years.  It would reduce income 
tax rates to 17% for 97% of all Canadians within the first four 
years, and 100% of all Canadians, in a second mandate, would be 
enjoying a single rate of 17% on our approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Large personal exemptions of $10,000 per person and $3,000 per 
child would also help Canadians.  We are asking that those be 
implemented as well.  Let the Liberals take the credit and let 
the families benefit, especially lower income Canadians and 
families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our burden of income taxes as a percentage of GDP would drop 
from over 14%.  That is the highest rate in the G-7 countries, 
which is not something to be proud of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals complained that our program was too large and too 
radical but then they turned around and implemented their own 
pale copy of our program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An interesting comment that someone passed on to me comes from 
the German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer.  He once said that 
all truth passes through three stages:  first, it is ridiculed; 
second, it is opposed; and, third, it is accepted as being 
self-evident. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That has been the Liberals' approach to the Canadian Alliance 
call for tax cuts and other proposals.  First they say it is 
crazy, then they say it is dangerous and finally they do it 
themselves.  However, while the Liberals stole some of our 
program, we begged them to steal more of it for the good of all 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need these bold tax cuts to keep Canada competitive, not half 
measures.  Not only are the government's tax cuts half measures, 
its plan is only half baked.  Its implementation is too slow, in 
fact only half fast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal mini cuts will still leave Canada with the highest 
income tax to GDP ratio in the G-7, even while the U.S. is 
dramatically lowering its tax burden.  We need to give hard 
working Canadians, businesses and entrepreneurs the same kinds of 
incentives and rewards that they could be achieving elsewhere or 
they will be lured to those other places. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that if Canadian businesses and workers are allowed 
to harness their own dreams and visions, the country will benefit 
as a whole.  The most important vision for the country is that of 
the Canadian people themselves and not the tax and spend 
fantasies of the Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why the official opposition believes that the Minister 
of Finance should table a new budget in the spring, rather than 
wait a full year after the election.  We are disappointed that 
the Speech from the Throne did not commit the government to an 
earlier budget.  It must bring one down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians must be updated on the cost of the government's 
election promises.  Today when I asked what those costs were, 
there was no response.  The government does not even know and yet 
economic times are changing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government must reassure markets in this time of economic 
uncertainty and it must take measures to help Canada be 
competitive with our trading partners.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance urges the Minister of Finance to table an 
early budget to continue the necessary work of tax reduction, 
debt reduction, and seeing revenues come in to support our social 
programs.  The key changes are lowering the marginal rates, 
expanding exemptions for individuals and families, reducing 
corporate income tax and reducing capital gains tax.  These will 
enhance Canada's competitive position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Increased productivity will lead to increased revenues, and this 
is an area where the Liberals cannot connect the dots, so that 
the federal government can continue to provide the quality of 
health care and social services that the people of Canada rely 
on. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such changes—reducing the maximum marginal rate, providing 
exemptions to all taxpayers, reducing corporate tax rates and 
taxes on capital gains and improving Canada's 
competitiveness—will ensure that we do not suffer from the more 
aggressive economic measures taken in the United States. 
Increased productivity will result in greater revenues, which 
will allow the federal government to continue to offer the 
health care and social services that Canadians need. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If these steps are not taken, the Canadian dollar will continue 
to go down and Canadian businesses which are attractive because 
of the hard work of Canadians will increasingly be purchased by 
Americans.  That will then cause a rise in the concern from the 
Liberals to bring in foreign investment restrictions.  All of 
these things will lead to a wrong conclusion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen today, announced only a couple of hours ago, the 
purchase of a dearly beloved team, Les Canadiens.  The Montreal 
Canadiens have been purchased by an American business.  The key 
reasons the Americans were able to purchase the team were 
indicated: high taxes which inhibited Canadians from buying it, a 
low Canadian dollar and the U.S. salaries.  That is an indicator 
of what is happening.  The Liberals continue to allow Canadian 
business to be underpriced and purchased by American business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tax cuts and debt reduction are a crucial first step to 
empowering the Canadian economy and perhaps the most single 
important contributor to our competitive position, but they are 
not the only answer.  A strong system of education and training, 
good industrial and transportation infrastructure, and support 
for research and development are essential components for future 
economic growth.  The Canadian Alliance recognizes that.  The 
government, however, claims it cannot lower taxes too much 
because it needs the increased revenues to allow for government 
investments in the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government still does not get it.  It does not understand 
that reducing taxes and debt and investing in needed economic and 
social infrastructure are complementary goals.  By reducing 
taxes, reducing the debt, invigorating the economy and increasing 
revenues, it is with an invigorated type of fiscal position that 
we can support the social programs Canadians want.  That is the 
approach that must be taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Too often when the government makes public investments, the 
investments take the form of creating new entitlement programs, 
such as subsidies which dispense grants and loans to favoured 
industries from favoured regions of the country or programs which 
maximize the visibility of the federal government and its bronze 
plaques without maximizing economic efficiency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We welcome the throne speech commitment to double R and D and 
to strengthen universities and government labs, but the emphasis 
here should be investment in basic scientific research through 
such programs as Canada's research granting councils and the 
National Research Council rather than the government trying to 
second guess industry about which applied technologies or new 
products to pursue through industrial subsidies.  That is not the 
most effective way of approaching it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Investing in basic R and D and science is not a frill.  It is 
essential and we recognize that. It is essential for building a 
better economy and a better society.  As a matter of fact, to put 
it in terms that the government may understand, it is reported 
that when the great British Prime Minister Sir William Gladstone 
met Michael Faraday, the inventor of the electric dynamo, he 
asked him whether electricity would ever be of any use, to which 
Faraday replied “Yes, sir.  One day you will be able to tax 
it”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are trying to help the government connect the dots on 
economic growth.  We will call on the government to increase its 
investment in infrastructure, in particular the rebuilding of the 
crumbling highway system.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Technological infrastructure is necessary.  The national fibre 
optic backbone network needs to be looked at.  Canadians from 
coast to coast are also demanding a serious upgrade of the 
Trans-Canada Highway.  The Liberals have promised that.  Where 
are the specifics on that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will call on the government to increase its contribution to 
post-secondary education through the CHST and by encouraging 
greater information sharing and co-operation among colleges, 
universities and provinces, not by coming up with new programs 
that duplicate what is happening in the provinces and waste 
dollars that could and should be going to students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Industrial subsidies through Technology Partnerships Canada or 
the Export Development Corporation must be phased out and 
eliminated.  As John Roth of Nortel has said, Canadian business 
must learn to stand on its own two feet.  We can help it do that 
with proper tax policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The energy and creativity of Canadian business should not be 
diverted into the game of seeking subsidies and grants from 
government.  It should be assisted through low taxes, a skilled 
workforce, an excellent public infrastructure, and people who are 
empowered and equipped to take on the world.  That is the path to 
sustainable economic growth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also need to look at empowering our communities and building 
a stronger society.  Economic growth, jobs and wealth are not the 
only things that point to health in a society.  There are many 
measures of social progress that cannot be built into the GDP. As 
well as a strong economy we must ensure a strong society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Empowering Canadians means empowering Canadian communities and 
civil society.  We must ensure we have quality health care that 
is second to none.  We must ensure that our children are nurtured 
in strong families and educated in excellent schools.  We must 
ensure that our seniors have dignity in their retirement years. 
We must ensure that our streets and communities are safe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals too often see the balance between a strong economy 
and a strong society as a trade-off.  The two are complementary. 
They believe that more government taxation and regulation of the 
economy are necessary to provide the types of programs that lead 
to strong communities, but we believe a free and prosperous 
economy goes hand in hand with a stronger society and stronger 
communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Invasive, dominating, centralized government programs do not 
create a strong society.  However, government can empower and 
equip citizens, families, charities, community groups and others 
at the local level who are themselves the foundation of a strong 
and flourishing civil society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us apply the philosophy of empowerment to our communities 
and to programs like the national health care system.  There is a 
lot of ongoing debate today about Canada's public medical system 
after years of cutbacks and neglect from the federal Liberals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Dr. Peter Barrett of the Canadian Medical Association stated, 
the serious problems facing medicare today can be labelled a 
health care crisis.  For patients awaiting health services it is 
a personal crisis.  He goes on to say that doctors and nurses on 
the frontline know it is a crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The waiting lists continue and have increased dramatically under 
this government.  Average wait times between seeing a general 
practitioner and receiving treatment have increased from 9.3 
weeks in 1993 to 14 weeks in 1999.  This has severe consequences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada continues to lose doctors and nurses to the United 
States.  Eighteen doctors leave permanently for the United States 
for every one doctor who comes north. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada rates 23 out of 29 in the OECD when it comes to doctors 
per capita.  That is not acceptable.  We are far behind many OECD 
countries in terms of providing access to medical technologies. 
Yet with all of these difficulties, the Liberal government 
refuses to consider genuine reforms to our system of health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance, the official opposition, is firmly and 
fully committed to a publicly insured health care system that 
respects the five principles of the Canada Health Act.  Let us be 
very clear on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us also be clear that the Canadian Alliance, the official 
opposition, is committed to preserving, maintaining and 
strengthening the Canadian health care system within the letter 
and spirit of the Canada Health Act.  Indeed we believe there 
should be a sixth principle added to the Canada Health Act: the 
principle of stable funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government should increase funding to the provinces 
for this fiscal year to bring the 2001 federal contribution to 
medicare through the CHST back to the level of 1995, before it 
ripped it away from the provinces. 
We also need to guarantee that level of funding for the next five 
years.  However money is not the only answer.  There must be true 
reform to the system.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As we do this, we need to respect the positions that are being 
articulated and not mischaracterize the positions of others.  We 
will debate them fairly and show why they are faulty.  We cannot 
have a clear and open discussion on this issue when people resort 
to the type of name that knock people off the desire to have a 
debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to see the health care system improved and maintained 
under the five principles of the health care act.  We believe our 
approach would allow Canada to develop the best system in the 
world.  That is not the case now.  It can be with the proposals 
that we look forward to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same philosophy of empowerment should be applied to other 
areas of the Canadian social union.  Empowering Canadians means 
empowering our aboriginal communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its throne speech the government devoted much attention, and 
rightly so, to the problems faced by aboriginal Canadians.  With 
a growing younger population but continuing chronic poverty, the 
situation of Canada's aboriginal communities must be addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am willing to admit that the government has proposed a few 
positive initiatives.  The promise to introduce more democratic 
accountability to band governments is a crucial step and one that 
we have been advocating for years.  We will of course support 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will examine carefully the legislation that the government 
brings forward.  We will consult with aboriginal Canadians and 
offer positive suggestions on how to ensure accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of the government's proposals will only deepen its culture 
of invasiveness and shackle aboriginal Canadians to the cycle of 
dependency that has led to many of the problems they are dealing 
with.  Most aboriginals see the Indian Act as archaic and 
destructive, yet the government continues to cling to it.  Why? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's aboriginal communities need to be empowered to solve 
their own problems and drive economic growth in their own 
communities while knowing that existing treaty rights will be 
respected.  That is a key point that we must say over and over 
again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is crucial that both local bands and status Indians be able 
to choose to participate in the free market economy on an equal 
footing with other Canadians.  Bands should be able to buy and 
sell property.  Individual aboriginal families should be able to 
enjoy the dignity of home ownership, if that is their wish, the 
same as other Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government can certainly play a role in helping aboriginal 
economic development get started, but programs need to be 
designed with autonomy and self-sustainability as the goal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the approach that will work, not the one of massive 
intervention and invasiveness that the Liberals have pursued for 
too many years, even while the present Prime Minister was the 
minister of that particular department.  We need to be doing 
this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The throne speech also discussed the government's ongoing 
children's agenda.  Nothing could be more important than our 
children and their healthy development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again we have to question whether the federal government is the 
best placed institution to judge children's needs or whether the 
answer lies in empowering and equipping Canadian families to make 
their own choices in their children's best interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we favour a universal per child tax credit so 
families can make their own choices, rather than an 
interventionist, one size fits all child care program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we favour equalizing the personal and spousal 
exemptions to end discrimination between one income and two 
income families.  It is time we began treating all family 
decisions respectfully and equally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support the existing child tax credit to help lower income 
families with children.  Indeed, it is a far better approach to 
getting children out of poverty than the subsidized approach of 
one size fits all that the Liberal government continues to invade 
us with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must also pay attention to the root causes of child poverty. 
We salute the throne speech's acknowledgement of both this and 
the effort and support that need to go to single parents who are 
raising children, many times in difficult circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must acknowledge that a significant factor in predicting 
child poverty is the issue of fatherlessness. 
We must not be afraid to discuss that.  We need to look at this 
and other family issues with compassion, not finger pointing, and 
look to enhancing the factors which truly strengthen family 
bonds.

<A HREF="#LINKT23"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also need to look carefully at our tax laws, divorce laws and 
social programs, which may have contributed perhaps inadvertently 
to weakening family bonds, and at what factors strengthen those 
bonds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We applaud the commitment in the throne speech to modernize 
child support, custody and access laws.  We hope the government 
will be guided by the parliamentary joint committee report on 
child custody and access, which had many useful recommendations, 
including how to keep both parents involved in the welfare of 
their children even after a marriage or a relationship has broken 
down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government must help strengthen the position of families through 
increased parental choice in child care, strengthening the 
position of families in our tax code, and recognizing the value 
of families in law.  These are positions of the Canadian 
Alliance, the official opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Empowering Canadians also means empowering groups of citizens 
through voluntary and charitable organizations at the local level 
to meet their social needs.  Charities, whether they are faith 
based groups such as Catholic Social Services or community based 
groups, need more financial support from the federal government 
but not federal invasiveness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to examine new legislation to support charities to 
replace the arcane common law rules that govern them, which have 
led to perverse results in many instances, such as community 
music groups being denied charitable status while terrorist 
fronts receive it.  We need to take a common sense look at these. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Charitable groups of all types have done much to educate 
children, care for the sick, feed and clothe the poor. The 
contributions of all such groups should be recognized and 
encouraged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although faith based institutions make up nearly half of all 
registered societies in Canada, they had virtually no input into 
the Prime Minister's task force on the voluntary sector.  That 
was an oversight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen the federal government, in an interesting 
situation, name churches as co-defendants in lawsuits against the 
federal government for its treatment of native children under its 
care.  The government must look at these lawsuits which threaten 
the survival of entire denominations that have done and continue 
to do much to meet the spiritual, emotional and physical needs of 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must acknowledge wrongdoings that have happened.  We are 
absolutely committed to that.  We must ensure that justice is 
done in relation to those wrongdoings.  Surely that can be done 
without eliminating entire organizations which have had a long 
history of helping and strengthening our communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Empowering Canadians, individuals and groups is what we need to 
be doing.  That will ensure communities are safe from the threat 
of crime and violence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the past seven years the government has adopted the 
rhetoric of getting tough on crime and on the causes of crime. 
However, too often the government has put the rights of accused 
criminals above the rights of victims and has ignored police and 
local communities.  Canadians are saying it is time to change 
that focus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For seven years we looked forward expectantly and heard promises 
to reform the Young Offenders Act.  Let us get to work on this. 
Let us acknowledge that citizens need protection from serious 
repeat offenders and that we need to apply preventive and caring 
approaches to young people who are at risk of becoming serious 
offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even in the past week the Supreme Court of Canada, while 
upholding the essence of Canada's law against the possession of 
child pornography, has read in certain exceptions to the law that 
three of the justices fear may cause harm to children and hamper 
the prosecution of these cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government acted too slowly in the Sharpe matter, the B.C. 
decision.  It failed in its responsibility to maintain the law 
while the case worked its way through the courts and caused many 
prosecutions to be abandoned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is now the government's responsibility, and ours with it, to 
ensure that these supposedly minor exceptions do not provide 
loopholes for those who would exploit our children and steal 
their innocence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Empowering Canadians means preserving the natural environment, 
the environment that we depend on for our resources, our economy 
and the health of our communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We encourage responsible measures to protect the environment and 
work co-operatively with the provincial and municipal agencies 
and governments that are closest to the challenges.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We understand that the government intends to bring forward a new 
endangered species bill in this session.  There have been hints 
that the legislation may be improved to address the valid 
concerns of rural Canadians regarding fair compensation.  The 
Minister of the Environment claims to have learned from the 
abysmal implementation of Bill C-68 how crucial and how important 
it is to work with rural Canadians and not try to criminalize 
their traditional ways of life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will examine the new bill with interest.  We will consult 
with Canadians.  We want to preserve the diversity of Canada's 
natural species and balance that with the needs of local 
communities in the areas most affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must also empower Canadian farmers and rural Canadians in 
resource dependent communities.  The federal government has not 
only ignored the voice of rural Canadians when it comes to 
firearms control and balancing the preservation of natural 
species, but it has also ignored the entire area of agriculture 
and natural resource management.  After seven years the 
government has failed to help struggling farm families during the 
ongoing farm crisis.  We meet those families every day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>AIDA help was supposed to be delivered two years ago but only 
50% of that money has been distributed.  Fifty per cent of claims 
from 1999 remains unprocessed while family farms move into 
bankruptcy.  Farmers need immediate assistance.  This promised 
money must go to farmers before the next spring seeding.  They 
need the help now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will continue to work with farmers and the agricultural 
community to aggressively push the government to move toward 
ensuring that farmers get the help they need and that farm 
families are not driven from their lands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The root causes of the farm income crisis must also be 
addressed.  Foreign subsidies must be aggressively negotiated 
downward.  Where is the federal government on this particular 
process?  Red tape and bureaucracy must be cut and federal 
assistance programs must be redesigned so that they meet the 
needs of the farmers rather than support bureaucracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Governments need to look at farmers' input costs. They are 
burdened with fees and high taxes on everything they buy and with 
skyrocketing fuel costs.  Why does the federal government refuse 
to lower some of its own fees and charges to the agricultural 
community?  This must be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen in the recent unjustified blockade of Prince Edward 
Island potatoes how the government has failed farmers and has 
failed to maintain good relationships with our largest trading 
partner, the United States.  Not only did the government fail to 
negotiate a timely solution to the P.E.I. dispute, the minister 
of agriculture was absent at critical times during the 
negotiations.  Even though Canadian officials demonstrated that 
there was no scientific merit to any blockade of those P.E.I. 
potatoes, the government has been unable to negotiate a solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Time and again the government has failed to get results in 
reducing international subsidies, which are now choking our 
farmers.  Results can be obtained but we need to be tough and we 
need to use the leverage available to us in the negotiating 
process.  In fact our farmers are being forced to compete against 
foreign subsidies that have actually risen in the last few years. 
Where is the federal government in terms of protecting our 
farmers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government must be more aggressive in pursuing these 
subsidies.  For example, the collective buying power of 
free trading nations should and could be used to push the 
protectionist countries back to the bargaining table.  Where is 
the government in terms of trying to organize that?  As I visit 
farmers from coast to coast, too many have told me that they do 
not know if they can survive the winter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us have no more Liberal excuses.  It is time for action: 
reduce costs, reduce foreign subsidies and set Canadian farmers 
free to feed the world as we know they can do.  That is what 
empowering Canadian agriculture means for Canadian farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A similar problem confronts us in a resource based industry 
crucial to the livelihood of rural Canadians with the ongoing 
softwood lumber dispute with the United States.  The government 
knows that on March 31 the existing softwood lumber agreement 
with the United States will expire.  We are hearing reports that 
the government is not on this issue and that it is not moving 
rapidly to make sure our concerns are on the table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People paid more for homes, furniture and other goods because of 
this flawed agreement, but provincial governments and industries 
still have not seen a clear strategy from the federal government 
on this.  Where is the government? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These ongoing disputes over agriculture and lumber show how 
important Canada's relations really are with our strongest ally 
and our largest trading partner, the United States.  We need to 
have good relations.  We need to be strong negotiators but we 
need to have positive relations.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government over the past seven years seems to have taken 
more pleasure in tweaking the nose of our trading partner, 
whether by appearing to favour the Castro regime in Cuba or 
simplistically opposing the American position on various 
international treaties or most recently avoiding the discussion 
of a proposed continental anti-ballistic missile defence shield. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Incredibly, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, at his recent 
meeting with the U.S. secretary of state, said Canada would 
approve of this defence system if it could convince the Russians 
and Chinese to agree first. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House of Commons needs to be empowered in a non-partisan way 
to discuss foreign policy with all facts available and with input 
from our constituents duly on the table.  Issues such as the 
terrorist threat from rogue nations are too important to be 
decided on the political whims of the Prime Minister's office. 
These are important issues for Canadians.  They must be discussed 
here in the Chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no mention in the throne speech of the need to increase 
support for our armed forces nor to modernize their equipment. We 
are losing our influence in NATO and other international 
organizations because we have reduced our support for our armed 
forces.  They are not properly equipped when we send them to 
foreign fields and sometimes we cannot effectively bring them 
home from those fields.  That has to change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How seriously do we think American trade negotiators will be 
told to take Canadian concerns if they know that Canada is not 
pulling its weight in our collective defence and may be out to 
embarrass the United States diplomatically at the next 
international meeting?  These issues are tied together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to take a tough position with the United States but one 
that signals that we recognize it is actually an ally.  We 
must work together, be tough for Canadian interests but recognize 
the greater diplomatic realities.  Canada needs to develop a 
mature relationship with the United States based on trust and 
mutual understanding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that the partisan position of the government toward the 
new administration has not handicapped this relationship and 
therefore diminished our chances of success as we negotiate 
everything from farm subsidies to softwood lumber to 
environmental accords. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, it was good to see in the Speech from the Throne an 
acknowledgement of freer trade with the Americas.  We will 
support that.  However, after the photo ops are over Canada must 
aggressively pursue getting a trade deal that meets the interests 
of Canadian workers, farmers, businesses and consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to look at the possibilities of trade expansion, 
including the United Kingdom and our possible linkages with 
NAFTA.  Empowering Canadians means taking a responsible approach 
on the world stage that puts a clear priority on the security and 
interests of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Empowering Canadians above all else means empowering Canadian 
citizens to play a more active role in governing their country. 
Perhaps the area where the government has most failed to empower 
Canadians is in failing to empower its elected representatives, 
whether they are MPs elected federally who are routinely ignored 
by an all powerful executive branch run out of the Prime 
Minister's office or at other levels of government whose 
constitutional authority is routinely usurped by the federal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Respecting, not rejecting, the elected members of parliament 
sent to Ottawa by Canadians, and respecting the jurisdiction of 
provincial governments that have democratic mandates no less 
legitimate than those of the House, is in fact respecting and 
empowering Canadian people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that many of the members in the last House, even on the 
government side, felt frustrated.  They told us these things. 
They were unable to properly represent their constituents as 
legislators.  Liberal MPs have regularly been forced to vote 
against their will and the will of their constituents on issues 
ranging from gun control to hepatitis C compensation to high 
taxes on gasoline. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last election it was fascinating to go into those MPs 
constituencies and hear them scrambling to speak on behalf of 
their constituents instead of the Prime Minister's Office.  When 
members of parliament are not treated with respect then the 
Canadian people who sent them there are not being treated with 
respect.  Citizens feel that disrespect and that contributes to a 
sense of alienation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government mentioned parliamentary reform in the throne 
speech.  My heart skipped a beat and hope increased when I heard 
about voting procedures and increased reform in the House of 
Commons.  It said it would accomplish that by increasing 
resources to the parliamentary library.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I love taking guests to the library.  It is a fabulous resource 
and the people who work there are to be acknowledged.  However, 
that is going to do nothing to increase the free voting that can 
happen in this particular assembly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We intend to make these issues central in this session and democratic 
reform will be one of the central issues in this parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You understand, Mr. Speaker, the importance of this and the 
tradition of the Chamber.  All members have a responsibility to 
foster and pursue that ideal.  We in the official opposition 
pledge ourselves to the task. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would say to the Prime Minister that I believe he has the 
right to look for a legacy.  I believe that in all sincerity.  I 
believe one day that there will be a legacy of a building that 
will crumble, a highway that will become potholed or a mountain 
top that may blow its stack. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister has served with distinction and he deserves a 
more fitting legacy.  What greater legacy to leave for this 
century than an opening of parliamentary freedom, the freedom of 
his own MPs to vote.  What a legacy for him to leave.  Unless he 
changes, history will record that parliament was used to rubber 
stamp plans drawn up in the back rooms of his office rather than 
the plans that came from the living rooms of the Canadian people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance has proposed constructive alternatives to 
make the House work better.  We have grouped them in a package 
that we call “Building Trust”.  We have made 12 concrete 
suggestions, 12 simple steps that would free members of 
parliament to represent their constituents.  It is a 12 step 
program for those who are addicted to power.  It will require 
politicians to put their trust in the hands of a power higher 
than themselves and that power is the Canadian people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will be advancing those causes.  We will also be advancing 
the cause and joining with the Liberals in their promise of 1993 
that the office of the ethics counsellor be transformed into a 
truly independent ethics commissioner's office, reporting 
directly to parliament.  We are going to support them on that. 
We know there is going to be great movement there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These measures and others contained in our proposals called 
“Building Trust” will go a long way to reducing the alienation 
that Canadians feel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Alienation is not just a regional phenomenon.  The deepest 
alienation of all is between government and a disaffected 
Canadian people.  Voter turnout in the last federal election fell 
to an all time low, near 61%.  Almost two in every five eligible 
Canadian voters said “none of the above”.  This is not something 
any of us can be proud of.  It is something that all parties 
should work to address.  We can do this by empowering members of 
parliament to truly represent their constituents.  That would 
allow Canadians to feel empowered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was born in Ontario and raised in Montreal.  I lived and 
worked in the maritimes, British Columbia, Alberta and the 
Arctic.  I love Canada.  I see, I understand and I know that the 
yearning in the hearts of Canadians in these areas is similar 
from coast to coast.  These are elements of Canadian unity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people in Quebec and a few other regions say that Canada 
does not work and that we should give up on the federal approach. 
I will never give up on this country.  If Canada is not working 
as well as it should, then it is our job to make it work, to put 
aside the partisan differences, to give up those corridors of 
power and allow Canadian citizens to be empowered to make this 
country everything it can be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister was challenged again today on the fact that 
he spends more time in the United States than he does in western 
Canada.  I am willing to take him at his word when he says he 
wants to see relations improve with western Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been recent proposals in western Canada from a group 
of prominent citizens who have acknowledged that improvements can 
be made in the standard of life for Canadians.  We are not 
talking about massive devolution of power.  This is how the Prime 
Minister tries to avoid a discussion on balancing constitutional 
provisions between the provinces and the federal government.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I hesitate to do this because I really do not want his 
popularity to go up, but I am willing to suggest that the Prime 
Minister reach out to western Canada.  The next time there is an 
opportunity for a Senate appointment, he should appoint a senator from the 
province of Alberta.  It has already elected its senators in 
waiting.  If he does that, he could once again dare to venture 
into places like Calgary, Edmonton, Cochrane and Fort McMurray 
and he would be received happily there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time we turned the page on the entitlement approach to 
government programs and the desire of the government to leave 
greater and greater levels of spending as its only legacy.  It is 
time we turned the page.  It is time to empower Canadians 
socially to be able to handle their local challenges.  It is time 
to empower Canadians democratically.  It is time to empower us 
economically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can do these things.  Hope runs eternal.  I have hope and a 
sense of optimism that we do not have to wait until the next 
election.  We have already talked to some MPs from across the 
floor who have said they are interested in empowering Canadians. 
I am sure they will agree that the motions we are bringing 
forward will empower all Canadians.  I have great optimism that 
can happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime, although the government has identified some 
positive initiatives that we can support, it has failed to 
provided us with an empowering vision for Canadians in its Speech 
from the Throne. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, reluctantly I move that the motion be amended by 
adding: 
<A NAME="LINK161">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>And this House regrets to inform Your Excellency that although 
there are a few initiatives in the Speech from the Throne worthy 
of support, your advisors have not provided the leadership 
Canadians deserve from a new government by their failure to 
commit to real tax relief, fair criminal justice reform, 
stabilizing social programs, empowering Members of Parliament to 
vote freely on behalf of their constituents, fighting for the 
family farm and failing to embark on a new era of respect and 
co-operation with the provinces. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We look forward to seeing Canada truly empowered and Canadians 
becoming everything they can be within their field of dreams.

children's agenda.  I would like to thank him.  He has become a 
spender.  It will be noted by the Canadian people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, as one who has been in the House for some years now, I 
welcome and congratulate all the new members, whatever their 
party affiliation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an honour and a great privilege to serve in the House of 
Commons.  Whether one is elected for the first time or the 12th 
time, or in the case of the Deputy Prime Minister, the 13th time, 
one has to know it is a humbling experience to be chosen by your 
fellow citizens to represent them in the Parliament of Canada. 
Only Sir Wilfrid Laurier and the member next to me managed to be 
elected 13 times to the House.

</I></B></P><P align=left>No one comes here for the money.  No one comes here for the 
hours of work.  All of us, regardless of party, come here for the 
same reason:  to serve our constituents as best we can and to 
contribute, to the best of our abilities, to making our country a 
better place.  Regardless of party, we all have the obligation, 
by our words and our deeds, to dedicate ourselves to building 
trust in our institutions and our democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should remember what Churchill said about democracy.  He said 
it is “The worst system of government in the world...except for 
all the rest”.  He was right.  Of course improvements can always 
be made, but there should be no doubt that Canada's parliament 
serves our country very well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like any human institution, the House of Commons is not perfect. 
It can be strengthened.  Over the years many changes have been 
made to improve parliament and more will be made to bring 
parliament into the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House leader is working with his colleagues from all parties 
on reforms that will make the House work even better for the 
benefit of all Canadians, for example, electronic voting, more 
research support for committees and more bills referred to 
committee at first reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was happy to hear the Leader of the Opposition speak about 
reforms a few minutes ago but he should not try to teach us too 
much.  He was the house leader in the Alberta legislature for 
many years and was in some very nice situations.  For example, 
when he was Alberta's house leader, he questioned the need for 
the legislature to have a fall sitting.  He said that the longer 
the legislature sat, the greater the temptation was “to come up 
with new laws and regulations”.  He also said “Albertans would 
rather see us shout at each other on our own time”.  I could go 
on.  At one time the legislature sat for 36 days until he finally 
said that was enough and that it had to adjourn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have no great lessons to learn.  We will be listening but we 
will certainly not do what he was doing in Alberta. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last November 27, the people of Canada gave the government a new 
mandate.  I am particularly proud that we Liberals have members 
on this side and in the corner on the other side.  They have the 
best spot because they can see more than the ones behind us and 
are in a better position to tell me when they do not agree with 
me.  What is very important is that we have members from every 
province and every territory, which proves that we are truly a 
national government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course I recognize, as is always the case in a democracy, 
that many Canadians voted for the other parties.  In some 
provinces we do not have as many members as we would like.  We 
will be working very hard as a government to ensure that many 
more Liberal members from western Canada will be here after the 
next election. My pledge is that the government will listen to 
all Canadians, wherever they live in Canada, and will govern in 
the interests of all Canadians, regardless of who they voted for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been given a mandate by the people of Canada to move 
beyond old disputes, old fights, old problems and old solutions; 
a mandate to set ambitious goals and objectives for a strong, 
united Canada for the years to come; a mandate to build on the 
solid foundations that have been put in place since we assumed 
office; a mandate to prepare the country for the fast paced 
change the new economy demands; and to bring the best of Canada 
into the 21st century by building an innovative economy, by 
ensuring social inclusion and by strengthening our collective 
voice in the world.

address in more detail other elements of the government's agenda 
during the course of this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No country can look forward to the new century with more 
confidence than Canada.  We will make this first decade of the 
21st century an exceptional decade for Canadians, a decade marked 
by the pursuit of excellence and the sharing of opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we formed the government more than seven years ago, we came 
here with a vision of the country we wanted to build and of the 
values and principles that will guide our actions, a distinct 
Canadian way, a distinct Canadian model. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our vision and our purpose have not changed:  a society of 
excellence with the commitment to success, where prosperity is 
not limited to the few but is shared and created by the many; 
where every child gets the right start in life; where young 
people have a chance to grow and be the best at whatever they 
choose to do; where citizens have access to the skills and 
knowledge they need to excel; where citizens, regardless of 
income, receive quality health services; where families enjoy 
strong, safe communities and a clean, healthy environment; and 
where Canadians work together with other countries to promote 
peace, cultural diversity, human purpose and the benefits of the 
new global economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We understand that it is not possible to do everything at once, 
that the secret to success in governing is to make progress 
pragmatically in a step by step manner and with boldness where 
necessary, to set broad goals and objectives, to make choices 
based on the values that have made Canada strong, and to bring 
about major change in a manner that is sustainable and 
affordable.  That is exactly what we have done over the last 
seven years.  That is the approach to governing that has been 
endorsed and endorsed again by the people of Canada in three 
successive elections.  That is the approach we will continue to 
take. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We set out to restore fiscal sovereignty to regain the capacity 
to make choices for the future.  We have succeeded beyond 
anyone's wildest expectations.  We remain firmly committed, as we 
go forward, to balanced budgets, debt reduction, and a 
competitive tax environment for investment and entrepreneurship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is obviously uncertainty today about the short term 
prospects for the United States economy.  The government will 
closely monitor developments in the United States and in the 
global economy and their possible impact on Canada.  That being 
said, the success of our economic policies has put us in a better 
position than ever to manage in the case of a temporary slowdown 
in the United States economy.  We have every reason to believe 
that our economy will outperform our major competitors and 
trading partners this year.

</I></B></P><P align=left>A healthy fiscal climate is not an end in itself.  It is the 
essential prerequisite for all social and economic investments 
that government must make, in collaboration with its partners, to 
build a prosperous country where opportunity can be shared by 
all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We on this side of the House believe that an activist government 
can be a force for good in society.  An activist government 
requires a first class public service.  I am proud of our public 
service.  The government will take all necessary steps to ensure 
that we continue to have the talent necessary for a public 
service that is committed to excellence, and we will make the 
necessary reforms to modernize the public service for the 
requirements of the 21st century. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We set out more than seven years ago to do our part as a 
government to build a more innovative economy: the Canada 
Foundation for Innovation, the Networks of Centres of 
Excellence, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, the 2000 
Canada research chairs, the increases in support to the granting 
councils, the changes in our corporate tax rates and our capital 
gains tax rates and making Canada one of the most connected 
countries in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have built a strong foundation, but we cannot rest on our 
achievements, otherwise the world will pass us by.  In the 21st 
century our economic and social goals must be pursued 
hand in hand. Let the world see in Canada a society marked by 
innovation and inclusion, by excellence and justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To achieve this we have a plan which combines innovation, skills 
and learning, and a commitment to ensure all of our children are 
given the chance to realize their potential. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me start with innovation. In the new economy, the race goes 
to the quick. This is true of high technology, but applies as 
well to virtually all sectors from resource extraction to 
farming to merchandising. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada must have one of the most innovative economies in the 
world. A key element in getting there is to ensure that our 
research and development effort per capita is among the top 
five countries in the world. 
To achieve this objective, the government has a five part 
plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, it will at least double the current federal investment in 
research and development by the year 2010. The government over 
the course of its mandate will increase its investment in the 
granting councils. It will do more for Genome Canada and the 
Canadian Institutes of Health Research and for research within 
government. This will make Canada the place to be for world class 
researchers. It will strengthen our economy and our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, it will build on what we have already done to make Canadian 
universities the place to be for research excellence and a 
place where the best and the brightest want to come. The 
government will work with the university community to assist our 
universities so that they have the resources necessary to fully 
benefit from federally sponsored research activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third it will accelerate Canada's ability to commercialize research 
discoveries and to turn them into new products and services. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1640"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT32"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, it will pursue a global strategy for Canadian science and 
technology. Canada must be at the forefront of collaborative 
international research which expands the frontiers of knowledge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fifth, it will work with the private sector to determine the best 
ways to make broad band Internet access available to all 
communities in Canada by the year 2004. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, our research commitment as a country must not be that of the 
federal government alone. It must be a national endeavour. 
Today I challenge the private sector and the provinces to 
devote more of their resources in the years ahead to making 
Canada one of the leaders in the world in research and 
development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The transition to the new economy is not about any one sector of 
the economy alone. Economic success across all sectors of the 
economy depends more than ever on human enterprise, ingenuity 
and creativity. It depends fundamentally on our human talent. In 
this context, our most important investments are the investments 
we make in people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want Canada to be seen throughout the world as having the most 
skilled and the most talented labour market force anywhere. That 
has to be a national goal and a national effort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Learning does not take place in school alone. 
From early childhood development programming to the public 
school system to post-secondary institutions and to on the job 
training, Canada has all the elements of an evolving national 
infrastructure for lifelong learning. All governments, the 
private sector and educational institutions must work together 
to enhance this national infrastructure for the benefit of 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For its part, the Government of Canada has invested 
significantly over the course of our first two mandates to help 
to make Canada the most talented and skilled place in the 
world. From Canada education savings grants to help parents save 
for their children's education to increases in the education 
tax credit to the Canada millennium scholarships for today's 
students to new rules for RRSPs to help Canadians finance 
retraining and skills upgrading and to new Canada study grants for 
students with dependants and other similar programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, there is still much to do and this government is prepared 
to play its full part in this national effort. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want at least one million additional Canadian adults of 
working age to be able to improve their skills.  Therefore, we 
will create registered individual learning accounts to make it 
easier for Canadians to plan for and finance their learning 
needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will ensure that our youth employment programs reach out to 
youth at risk to help those who have the most difficulty in 
making the transition from school to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will do our part to ensure that those who most need training 
are eligible for training funds.  A national effort to have the 
most talented and skilled labour force requires the support and 
collaboration of the provinces and of the private and voluntary 
sectors. 
We will be inviting them to jointly launch with us a national 
literacy initiative.  We must raise the level of literacy in 
Canada because too many Canadians lack the literacy levels 
necessary for the new economy.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada needs more skilled workers.  We must do better as a 
country to attract highly skilled immigrants.  As a federal 
government, we will take the necessary steps to make sure that 
unnecessary barriers are not placed in their way.  In a global 
economy, Canada must do better to recognize quality credentials 
earned abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge provincial governments to revise their policies with 
respect to the recognition of foreign credentials of new 
Canadians.  In Europe, doctors can move from one country to 
another but in Canada many professions cannot do that.  It is 
protectionism within each province.  It is detrimental to all 
Canadians because some professions are not open even for 
Canadians to move let alone people with great competence who come 
to Canada where a professional body refuses to recognize them. I 
invite the provinces to help us in this field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge provinces to give life to the social union framework and 
move quickly to ensure the full mobility of Canadian students and 
other Canadians with Canadian credentials across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Elementary and high school education in Canada falls within the 
exclusive jurisdiction of the provinces.  I know that each 
provincial government takes its obligation very seriously.  Each 
province works very hard to provide high quality public 
education.  However, we all know that in the knowledge economy 
those who drop out of school are also dropping out of 
opportunity.  The school dropout rate remains too high in Canada. 
We cannot afford the social and economic costs when young people 
become discouraged and drop out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to challenge provincial governments to redouble their 
efforts to ensure that those who are in school finish school and 
that those who have dropped out come back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need literate, skilled, educated and healthy people to be a 
world leading economy, but this in turn requires a truly 
inclusive society.  We cannot separate social and economic 
priorities.  Just as a strong economy allows us to pursue our 
social values, an inclusive society is a prerequisite to a very 
strong economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through our progressive tax system, active measures and our 
social safety net, Canada has avoided the worst social and 
economic costs of exclusion.  While incomes are now rising for 
most families, there are still too many single parent families, 
visible minorities, recent immigrants and aboriginal Canadians 
living in poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians with disabilities still face too many barriers to 
participation.  We are determined to help families break out of the 
poverty trap, to reverse the cycle of dependency and to help 
parents realize their hopes and the dreams of their children.  We 
cannot afford the moral, human and economic costs of child 
poverty.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Economic growth and job creation are the most effective ways to 
reduce poverty.  There is no doubt about that.  Tax cuts put more 
money in the hands of families but they do not solve all our 
social problems.  Governments have an important role to play. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need a balanced approach.  We must find new and better ways 
to promote opportunity and to ensure that the basic needs of all 
are met.  Nowhere is the need more important than for our 
children and nowhere can we have a greater impact for building a 
strong and inclusive Canada.  It is not something the federal 
government can do alone.  It is something all of us have to work 
on together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have made considerable progress over the last seven years and 
we have done so in co-operation and collaboration with the 
provinces.  The national child benefit is the most important new 
social program since medicare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The early childhood development agreement of September 11 is a 
further important step in the right direction.  We must and we 
will do more.  Our goal must be that no child be excluded from 
opportunity because of the debilitating effects of poverty and 
that every child be given the right start in life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most urgent place to start is with aboriginal children. 
Quite frankly, I am concerned that in the case of aboriginal 
peoples we may be spending too much time, energy and money on the 
past and not nearly enough on what is necessary to ensure a 
bright future for the children of today and the children of 
tomorrow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Too often our spending does not reach those in the greatest 
need.  That must change.  We must turn the page.  From now on we 
have to focus and target our investments on where we can achieve 
the greatest good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are never enough resources to do everything.  Our approach 
will be to focus on the future and, most important, on the needs 
of children.  As a start we will significantly increase resources 
dedicated to aboriginal head start, a program our government 
started, a program that is working exceptionally well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must significantly reduce the incidence of fetal alcohol 
syndrome in our aboriginal communities.  We pledge to be part of 
a national effort to achieve this goal.  I will tell the House of 
Commons that there is a member of parliament, the member for 
Mississauga South, who has written books about the issue.  He has 
spoken about the issue in caucus and in the House for years.  He 
is a backbencher who had an idea that he felt strongly about.  He 
talked about it for years and now it has become one of the 
priorities of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would be putting our heads in the sand if we did not 
recognize as a society that there are too many young aboriginals 
in the criminal justice system.  We have to take the steps 
required in our social and economic policies to reduce that 
number.  Our goal must be to reduce the number of aboriginal 
people incarcerated or in conflict with the law.  Within a 
generation there should be no disparity in the incarceration 
rates between aboriginals and the rest of Canadian society.

Mistakes will be made along the way.  All will not be achieved in 
one mandate but we all have to be part of this national effort. 
Its success or failure will say much about the type of country we 
are. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last September 11, we had a very successful first ministers 
meeting here in Ottawa on health and on early childhood 
development.  Subsequently, we agreed with all the provinces on a 
federal-provincial-municipal infrastructure program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have demonstrated time and again since we took office that 
when we focus on the needs of the future, we can all work 
together and that our federal system works well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians see beyond the borders of their province or region. 
They are part of a larger community and they want their 
governments to work co-operatively to reflect our common values 
and give meaning to the Canadian experience. We can and must do 
this in a manner that respects one another's responsibilities as 
well as one another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our spirit of co-operation and collaboration tells me that we 
can set very ambitious goals, that we can achieve these goals 
together, and that a national effort can succeed in giving every 
child a good start in life and real access to the opportunities 
of Canadian society. We are prepared to do our part and I extend 
my hand to my provincial colleagues to join in this great 
national effort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It took a generation working together to reduce the incidence of 
poverty among seniors. It happened step by step, but we took a lot 
of steps together. We cannot be complacent, but we have come a 
long way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can and must make similar progress for children. We will not 
do it overnight. There will be bumps along the way. It is my view 
and that of my party that we must ensure that our children are a 
national priority. We must make this great national objective a 
major focus of what are always limited resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the course of this mandate in the budgets that we bring 
down we will establish an investment timetable that will allow 
us to make real progress in ensuring opportunity for all Canadian 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Essential to opportunity and the well-being of Canadians young 
and old is, of course, a modern health system and quality health 
care.  I referred a few minutes ago to the agreement of September 
11 on health. We agreed on new investments, substantial 
investments, but we also agreed on a plan. In the years ahead, we 
will keep working together to support that plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through collaboration, we will achieve our goal of timely access 
to high quality health care available to all Canadians, regardless 
of income or place of residence and we will report to 
Canadians on our performance and our progress.

</I></B></P><P align=left>All of us have vivid memories of the last election campaign. 
There were partisan rallies and visits to homes and factories throughout 
Canada, but for me one event stands out above all the others. 
It was a visit on a beautiful Saturday morning to the 
conservatory of music in Victoria to listen to performances by 
extraordinarily talented young Canadian musicians and to reflect on 
the importance of the arts and culture as central to the fabric 
of any society and to the Canadian fabric in particular.

in the age of the Internet, it is more important than ever to

ourselves and, as ambassadors to the world, share the best of

</I></B></P><P align=left>We have developed over more than a century a distinctive 
Canadian way. We have pursued a flexible approach that recognizes 
the importance of individual and collective action and 
responsibility. We have learned the value of working together in 
common purpose in a federal system that permits diversity and 
experimentation. We have recognized the advantage of our 
linguistic duality and multicultural society. We have developed a 
deep commitment to democracy and human rights. We have become a 
model for the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the course of this parliament, we will be playing an 
active role in the international community. Whether through the 
chairmanship of the G-20, by the Minister of Finance, hosting the 
G-8 in 2002, or the very important meeting of the summit of the 
Americas in Quebec City in April of this year, we will be working

expand opportunities for more countries to participate in the 
benefits of globalization while promoting peace and human 
security in the world. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will be working very closely with the new administrations of 
President Bush and President Fox.  The United States is our most 
important trading partner, our closest ally.  I will be 
travelling to Washington next week to meet with President Bush to 
reaffirm the importance of our relationship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank him because he was very gracious in calling Canada first 
after he became president and because his secretary of state 
received our Minister of Foreign Affairs first.  Next Monday I 
will be the first leader to meet with the new president.  We will 
discuss the importance of safe and efficient access to each 
other's markets.  We will be talking about accelerating the joint 
work that has already begun to modernize our shared border to 
facilitate trade and investment while ensuring security for both 
countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will also express the strong position of the Canadian 
government and, I am sure, of the House of Commons of Canada that 
our farmers should be able to compete on a level playing field 
and that subsidy wars are in the interest of no one.  It is a 
very important item and one of the first I will discuss with him, 
because I suspect it is the wish of members of all parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a great story to tell Americans and overseas investors 
about the success of the Canadian economy, about Canada as a 
place to invest, about Canada as a place of action and 
excitement.  We will be devoting much effort, with the help and 
co-operation of the private sector and the provinces, to 
promoting 
Canada as a highly innovative, skilled economy that attracts and 
keeps talent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government agenda for this parliament is a positive one.  It 
is moderate and forward looking.  It is balanced but it is also 
ambitious.  It builds on what has made Canada the country it is 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last fall, after the death of Pierre Elliott Trudeau, Canadians 
were moved to reflect on and discuss not only the Trudeau legacy 
but the meaning of Canada and our attachment to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His vision was of a mature, confident Canada shaping its own 
destiny, tied together by a common citizenship based on shared 
rights and mutual responsibility; a bilingual Canada in which 
citizens could enjoy and benefit from our rich French and English 
heritage; a country respectful of the special place of aboriginal 
people; a multicultural Canada open to the world and fully aware 
of its global responsibilities; a just Canada in which 
opportunity is truly equal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will take steps to commemorate his legacy in a way which both 
reflects and furthers these values.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This vision has shaped how the world sees Canada.  It has helped 
to define the Canadian model.  Increasingly the world is seeing a 
new Canada as well, a Canada built on this rich foundation but 
also a Canada of exciting opportunity, advanced science, 
leadership in new technologies and excellence in education, with 
a skilled and innovative labour force, a Canada that is a place 
to invest in and do business in.  That is the Canada we must also 
build in the weeks, months and years ahead: a Canada with a 
dynamic new economy and strong, healthy communities, a Canada of 
innovation and inclusion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are more than citizens of a single province or a single 
region.  We are more than just taxpayers.  We are citizens of a 
great country.  We have responsibilities to each other.  We need 
a national government working in partnership with all Canadians 
to assure our strong voice in the world, to assure a strong 
economy, and to protect and strengthen the social fabric of our 
society and the unity of our country.  We on this side of the 
House will provide that government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for me, I have been fighting for Canada all my 
life and, believe it or not, I am just getting warmed up. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK163"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
first, I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate all 
those who were elected this past November 27 and to extend a 
particular welcome to my new colleagues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that all hon. members want the House to be a true forum 
for debate.  All of us represent the population of Canada and we, 
along with others of course, represent the population of Quebec. 
All of us have the required legitimacy to express a variety of 
opinions that characterize our distinctive societies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one thing that strikes me in the Speech from the 
Throne, one statement that I must make. Canada is constructing 
itself in its own way, according to its own values, its way of 
doing things, its objectives.  That is legitimate; we acknowledge 
that.  Quebec does not, however, fit into this Canadian construct 
and it too must construct itself within a world that is evolving 
and changing at a dizzying pace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two concrete examples of this.  I am thinking of the 
Young Offenders Act.  The government tells us of the flexibility 
within this legislation.  I would remind my listeners that Quebec 
possesses, without a doubt, the most efficient system for 
rehabilitating young offenders.  That is universally 
acknowledged.  There is a totally different vision across Canada, 
one that is more punitive than rehabilitative. 
We do not want to impose our system on others, nor do we want a 
system that is not ours imposed upon us. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1715"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT40"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT40"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1715
<A HREF="#LINKT41"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT39"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government speaks of flexibility. Yet as far as justice is 
concerned, the weight of precedent, the weight of jurisprudence on 
which our justice system is built, at least as far as criminal 
law is concerned, knows no boundaries and will not stop at the 
Quebec border.  In other words, decisions taken elsewhere, within 
a different mentality, might be used in a case in Quebec and lead 
to a result that is totally different from the objective pursued 
until now by the system in place within Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why not remove Quebec from the application of this law, 
especially since this does not involve the criminal code?  We 
are not talking about one criminal code for all of the country 
and a different one for Quebec, although there are proposals in 
this regard from the native peoples.  In the case of young 
offenders who do not come under the criminal code, we want a 
different approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why not apply the motion on the distinct society that this 
government boasts of passing?  This represents an opportunity 
for the government to prove to us that the motion has some 
meaning, that it recognizes Quebec's distinct nature, in the 
case, for example, of the Young Offenders Act.  There is a very 
broad consensus in Quebec among all the political parties, among 
all the stakeholders, from the police to social workers, 
yet the federal government says “No.  Things will be done only 
one way, Ottawa's”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second example is that of parental leave.  All the political 
parties in Quebec, the Liberals, the ADQ and the PQ, and women's 
groups, employers and unions all recognize and prefer by 
far the plan proposed by the government of Quebec because it 
is much better suited to modern realities. The Prime Minister talks 
of modernism, of the rate of change in 
the world, of our need to innovate and adapt to new realities. 
This is an opportunity to prove it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the federal government opposed to the plan Quebec is 
proposing?  It had better not try to tell us that one complements 
the other.  A thorough examination reveals obstacles to fully 
carrying out a plan that meets the needs of young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why not take the time to negotiate?  There is another year 
before Quebec implements its program. 
There is still time to sit down and look at the mechanisms that 
we could set up to ensure that there is only one plan and that 
young couples can fully benefit from it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are two consensuses that are dismissed out of hand by the 
federal government, but that same government is about to get its 
heavy hand in provincial jurisdictions. In fact, the Prime 
Minister was even clearer in his speech when he said that the 
federal government would get involved in education, yet 
education is clearly a provincial jurisdiction. I also just 
mentioned early childhood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for manpower, we thought the issue had been settled. An 
agreement was reached in 1997, but the federal government is 
back with a vengeance in that area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rarely have we seen a throne speech that touches on so many 
areas that do not come under federal jurisdiction while saying 
so little about issues that are under federal jurisdiction. This 
is somewhat disturbing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is there anything positive in this speech?  I recognize that 
there are two good intentions that seem to be a step in the 
right direction. First, the government seems to want to address 
the causes of the problems experienced by aboriginal 
communities, by the first nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This effort, or at least willingness, is laudable and we support 
it.  However, we want to see what it means in concrete terms. 
Will the government follow the Erasmus-Dussault report, which was 
accepted by the first nations and which we supported as soon as 
it was released? Nothing has happened since that report was made 
public. 
We will see, based on the quality of the proposed legislation, 
whether these good intentions translate into good legislative 
measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second interesting point in the throne speech is that the 
government finally recognized the need for anti-gang legislation, 
true anti-gang legislation. While the government denied that such a need 
existed, we spent months asking questions to that effect in this 
House. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1720"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT40"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We pointed out, and rightly so, that if there are limits to the 
freedom of speech—as shown recently by the ruling in a child 
pornography case, which did not, however, raise the whole issue of 
freedom of speech in Canada—then there must also be limits to 
the freedom of association. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government does acknowledge that stronger action is needed. 
We will have to wait and see if it comes up with concrete 
measures or only brings back something similar to what it put 
forward in 1997. I have told the government that time is of the 
essence. While we wait around, these groups are moving ahead. The 
government is duty bound to solve this problem before June and 
refer the issue to the supreme court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some gaping holes, but mostly smaller holes, in this 
speech first about how the surplus will be used. The election 
was supposed to be on the surplus. That is what the Prime 
Minister told us when he called the election but now we have 
three options before us and we still do not know what the 
Liberals' position is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister said that 50% of the 
surplus will go to debt and tax reduction and 50% to social 
programs. In his mini budget, the finance minister said that 80% 
of the surplus over a period of five years and not for the coming 
year will go to deficit and debt reduction and 20% to social 
programs. The star economist and new member for Markham, who used 
to work, I believe, for the Royal Bank, predicted a $2 billion 
deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would have been interesting to know from the Speech from the 
Throne which takes precedence: the predictions of the hon. member 
for Markham, the Prime Minister's speech or the Minister of 
Finance's figures.  The answer to this is still forthcoming. It 
seems to me that it was the least that could have been expected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another significant omission is the whole matter of a 
shipbuilding policy.  We had asked for Canada to have a 
shipbuilding policy.  The Liberals voted in favour of a bill 
introduced by my colleague, the hon. member for 
Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Industry is in the process of touring Canada and 
people are telling him that the Bloc Quebecois bill ought to have 
been passed.  There is not a single word in the throne speech on 
this issue and I find that disconcerting given the intolerable 
situation that prevails at the present time in British Columbia 
and in Ontario, but particularly in the Atlantic provinces and 
Quebec.  There is nothing about this in the throne speech. This 
is rather disconcerting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another promise, the one concerning the highway system, should 
have been in the speech, but was also absent.  My former 
colleague, Mr. Daniel Turp, was greatly interested in this issue. 
The member who replaced Mr. Turp in representing 
Beauharnois—Salaberry, the public works minister and the 
President of Treasury Board have all made a promise. They have 
said “It's official; there will be $357 million for the 
construction of two bridges”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the letter from the Minister of Transport contradicts 
this statement.  His answers to our questions today also 
contradict it. 
Have we come back to the old policy of promising to build 
bridges over the course of three or four elections?  This seems 
to be the case with the Liberal attitude.  Have we returned to 
the climate of 1993 when the Prime Minister wanted to eliminate 
the GST? That was not the way it was put, but let us say he 
wanted to eliminate the GST?  We saw what happened: he reneged 
on his promise.  The problem is the same with the promise with 
respect to the highway system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was nothing on the need for ethics in government.  Over twenty 
investigations are underway into the administration of this 
government.  Charges have been laid in some cases, including in 
the Prime Minister's riding.  This is a serious matter.  We 
raised these issues. 
Initially they denied the existence of such things.  We simply 
asked that an ethics counsellor or adviser be appointed by the 
House and be made accountable to it.  What is so dangerous about 
someone having the autonomy necessary to reach the most 
objective decision possible, certainly, and with the ability to 
speak freely? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1725"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT42"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT42"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1725

<A HREF="#LINKT41"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have is a situation in which the Prime Minister chooses 
the counsellor, who is accountable to him even when he is 
investigating him.  This is unacceptable.  Naturally, they were 
saying today that the leaders of the opposition of the day 
supported the appointment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would point out two things.  First, supporting an appointment 
is not enough. In practice we have seen where that has 
led the counsellor must be accountable to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, in the recent appointments—I am thinking in particular of 
the privacy commissioner—the opposition parties were asked for 
their views.  Our party did not approve of the appointment of 
Mr. Radwanski, but he was appointed all the same.  That is why 
the House must go ahead, not the Prime Minister himself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members can imagine the situation if the person being 
investigated could select the police officers and the judge and 
if the latter were to hand down a verdict before considering 
the facts.  This would be ridiculous and would diminish the 
quality of public life here and throughout Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another area not addressed was employment insurance.  Even 
though the government admitted its error during the election 
campaign, there was nothing in the throne speech.  We are told 
that a bill will be introduced Monday; that is all very fine and 
well. Apparently it will be the same as the one which was initially 
tabled but which never reached second reading in the last 
parliament.  Despite the assertions of certain Liberals during 
the election campaign, this bill was never voted on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That having been said, the bill is not good enough.  We do, 
however, support a good number of its proposals, all the more so 
as they were ones we made for months on end to the government, 
which rejected them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is only one clause in this bill that we cannot live with 
and that is the one making it legal for the government to 
continue to divert funds rightfully belonging to the unemployed, 
to entrepreneurs and to employees.  That is unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the government really want to have more democratic, 
substantial debates here? Would it agree to split this bill so as 
to not uselessly trap opposition parties and to allow us to vote 
on what directly affects the services provided to recipients, 
those who really do need them? This would be a lot quicker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>True debate is necessary to discuss the final use made of such 
funds while people are being taxed for dubious reasons, since 
this money is being collected for all sorts of unrelated 
purposes. This is immoral. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another source of concern in the throne speech is the 
government's intention to change financial institutions. I think 
this specifically refers to banks. We have some problems with 
that, particularly in regard to the National Bank, by far the 
largest bank in Quebec, which could be owned by a single person. 
This is disturbing. We expressed our concern about this some 
months ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there are the services provided to citizens by banking 
institutions. There has been a deterioration of services, and 
some people cannot have access to these services. I am now 
announcing that we will be proposing significant changes in that 
regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another area of concern is that of sustainable official language 
minority communities. This is a new concept or designation. 
Is the government telling us that some communities are 
sustainable while others are not? We asked the question today, 
but did not get an answer, 
yet goodness knows plenty of time is taken in drafting a throne 
speech to choose the proper terms.  Do not let them try to get us 
to buy the idea that this was a poor translation—that would be a 
rather serious mistake—because the word sustainable is no 
better.  Does this mean that some communities are sustainable 
while others are not?  That does not hold up.  Some explanations 
are in order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the health field, reference is made to the September 
meeting.  The Minister of Industry was the premier of 
Newfoundland at the time, and all provinces were unanimous in 
calling for a return to the 1994 funding level.  They were 
unanimous, yet this was refused. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing the provinces refused was the creation of a 
citizen's council answerable to Ottawa, which would determine how 
health care needs to be delivered, whereas there is virtually no 
expertise on the other side of this House in this area, except 
where aboriginal people are concerned. There are huge 
problems with poor service delivery, and where the Canadian 
armed forces are concerned, it is a disaster. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1730"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT42"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They know nothing about this and yet they want to set standards 
instead of putting the funding back at its source so that the 
provinces may be really in a position to provide the required 
services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also concerns about social housing.  The terminology 
has been changed once again.  Now it is called affordable 
rental housing.  In other words, builders are to be given the 
money instead of those in need which is saying that the market will 
naturally succeed in responding to the needs of these people. We 
can see what is happening in California at the present time with 
electricity. I do not believe that the housing market funding can be 
handed over blindly without consideration to social 
housing needs at a time when there is a huge crisis in the major 
centres of Quebec and of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another concern relating to culture.  Reference is made 
to Canadian culture.  There is no recognition of the existence of 
the Quebec culture nor the aboriginal cultures.  Only the 
Canadian culture is referred to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The existence of national cultures is denied, including that of 
Quebec, and the existence of the Quebec nation is denied.  Yet 
there is such a thing as the Quebec culture, and this is obvious 
to anyone spending a little time in Quebec and in the rest of 
Canada.  One culture is not superior to the other, but there are 
different cultures.  It would be best if they looked after 
Canadian culture and left us to deal with the culture of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I see that the “My name is Joe; I am Canadian” superhero 
has emigrated to the United States, I think there is cause for 
concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I see in this speech is the extension of the social union, 
of the Canadian nation building concept. The only solution for 
us is to reach a new agreement, to create a new equal 
partnership between Quebec and Canada. Equal partnership means 
that both would have equal status. It means that Quebec must be 
a sovereign nation under a modern definition of sovereignty, 
different from what it was 40, 30 or even 10 years ago. 
Countries are different today, and it is this new world that we 
want to be part of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is particularly important to us with the creation of a free 
trade zone covering the three Americas, a concept we have always 
supported whereas the Liberals were against it a few years ago. 
We want to draw on models that exist in Europe, models with a 
common currency, something the Liberals refuse to discuss. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not saying that the option I am advocating reflects the 
majority opinion in Quebec. I am saying that the kind of 
federalism that we see developing in Canada does not reflect the 
majority opinion in Quebec either. I am saying that 
unfortunately Quebec is divided, that the Quebec issue remains 
on the table and that other people in Canada are increasingly 
perplexed about Ottawa's role. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a duty to think about that rather than to try to crush 
the aspirations of a people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I would like to move the following amendment to the 
amendment: 
<A NAME="LINK164">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the amendment  be amended by adding, after the word 
“provinces”, the following: 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“and, consequently, Canadian federalism offers Quebec no 
option for redefining the partnership between Quebec and 
Canada except to become a sovereign country.”

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Louis Plamondon (Bas-Richelieu—Nicolet—Bécancour, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, before I put a question to my leader, I would like to 
thank the constituents of Bas-Richelieu—Nicolet—Bécancour for 
re-electing me for a fifth term with a 57% majority. I want them 
to know that, during this fifth term, I will continue to serve 
them as diligently as before and that my work in the House of 
Commons will be as effective as ever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, my party's whip has congratulated me for the wonderful 
work I have done here, in committees and in the House, but as 
my leader has said, our ridings should not be neglected, so I 
will also be very active at the riding level as I have always 
been. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question for my leader. 
He mentioned all the provincial areas of jurisdiction the 
government is about to infringe upon, based on what was said in 
the throne speech. Should the House not reflect on this issue 
since all of the provinces want more taxation powers in the 
future and less power for the federal government? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it not time to address this issue so that all the provinces 
have the opportunity to prevent the federal government from 
interfering in areas of provincial jurisdiction thanks to tax 
revenues it is collecting? If, however, taxes were levied only 
by the provinces, then the provincial governments would have the 
power to negotiate acceptance of some of the so-called national 
policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ask the hon. member if the time has not come to have a 
very serious debate on who should be taxing the residents of the 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe:</B> Mr. Speaker, that is a debate that has been 
going on for more than a few decades.  In my view, it is one 
which is necessary and which must take place in a different 
context, one that will have to evolve over the years to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I believe that there should be fundamental respect for 
the jurisdictions for which money is being collected through 
taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When, in the case of employment insurance, I see that to date 
some $38 billion has been collected while only some 43% of 
unemployed workers receive benefits, I can say that the money is 
being used for something else.  The Minister of Finance would be 
the first to agree: this money is being used for purposes other 
than those for which it was collected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what is unacceptable and what makes Canadian federalism 
dysfunctional. It is dysfunctional because the money is in 
Ottawa, but the provinces, which have the needs, must supply the 
services. Ottawa takes in much more money when the economy is 
strong. It provides services and increases its involvement, but 
it pulls out when it can no longer afford to foot the bill and 
the provinces are stuck with the existing services.  That is 
what led to this basic dysfunction in the Canadian federation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have a couple of questions to ask of the leader of the 
Bloc. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One has to do with the funding of health care.  He indicated 
that the federal government should fund health care and allow the 
provinces to implement the health care system in their provinces 
as they so choose.  In his amendment he has proposed that Quebec 
should become independent of Canada, which means that the federal 
funding would then obviously cease.  Does the member see a 
contradiction in that statement? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other question concerns culture.  I acknowledge very freely 
that some 25% of Canadians speak French and are of French origin, 
while 75% are not. 
Many other cultures in Canada are represented.  I happen to be 
one of those who is neither English nor French.  I think that I 
have the right to practise my culture with my family and my 
relatives, as do all of the Ukrainians in my riding.  That is by 
far the most populous group.

<A HREF="#LINKT44"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should the federal government be involved in supporting the 
culture only of the French language in Quebec and in the rest of 
the country, or should it get out of that and allow Quebec to 
promote its own culture, or should we fund all different cultural 
groups equally? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe:</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all, there is no 
contradiction between asking that the money collected from 
taxpayers for health care be given to the provinces, since they 
are the ones responsible for delivering these services, and 
saying that Quebec wants to become a sovereign country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would no longer receive money from the federal government, 
but we would no longer be sending Ottawa any money either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing is sure, and you will have the 
opportunity to realize it in the years to come, money does not 
grow on trees on Parliament Hill.  It comes from taxpayers' 
pockets. 
We send in money that comes back to us. If 
we stop receiving money, we will stop sending in money, which 
seems very logical to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, on the issue of culture, this is something that exists 
in every country. I am thinking of Ukraine, which became a 
country after many years of struggle. The culture in Ukraine is 
that of the Ukrainian people, which is perfectly normal. Unless I 
am mistaken, I do not think there is a multiculturalism policy in 
Ukraine that would give funding for Russian theatre, for example. 
If anybody knows of the existence of such a policy, they should 
tell me, but I would be surprised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is normal for each country to have its own culture, for 
Italian to be spoken in Italy and for the development of the 
Italian culture to be a priority in that country, without 
intolerance toward other cultures being generated. What I see is 
the Quebec of tomorrow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I look at what is going on in the province of Quebec, I 
realize that the only true bilingual city in Canada is Montreal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Moncton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe:</B> No, I am sorry, it is not Moncton. Legally 
maybe, but not in real life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, despite the heroic efforts of the francophone and 
Acadian communities outside Quebec, their assimilation rates are 
alarming and very worrisome. In fact, their assimilation rates 
are unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we should condemn the situation and ensure that things 
improve. We see the complete opposite in Quebec. For instance, 
we have three English universities: McGill, Concordia and 
Bishop's. They are doing very well, and it is a plus for our 
province. There is nothing like it in the rest of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to be clear on this issue. I see Quebec as an open, 
non-racist, non-sexist, non-violent nation, welcoming everyone with 
open arms. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK167"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. leader of the Bloc 
Quebecois for mentioning shipbuilding in his policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could he quickly elaborate as to the blatant arrogance by the 
industry minister who before the election made promises and 
indications to the people in the industry that he would do 
everything he could and then, after the Bombardier deal, turned 
around and said nobody in the shipbuilding industry would even 
get this consideration? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could he elaborate a bit more on the arrogance of the industry 
minister in his views toward shipbuilding? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe:</B> Mr. Speaker, that may be how one moves up 
the ladder in Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same thing happened with the health issue, where the former 
premier of Newfoundland took a stand contrary to the Liberal 
principles he adhered to later on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same with shipbuilding. I am sad to say that the Liberals 
often talk like New Democrats during an election campaign, but 
they do not act like New Democrats once they are in office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should think about that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very glad 
to take part in this debate and to represent the New Democratic 
Party and particularly the constituents of Halifax. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to add my congratulations to all members who were elected 
to serve in the 37th parliament.  In addition, I extend an 
appreciation, and I do so on behalf of all Canadians, to all 
candidates who offered to represent people in their communities. 
That appreciation needs to extend not only to the candidates who 
offered to represent the five parties now in parliament, but also 
to the smaller parties, such as the Green Party, the Canada 
Action Party and others.  We cannot have too much democracy in a 
democratic society, and I think we should thank them all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to congratulate the Speaker for the high honour 
bestowed upon him by his peers earlier in the week in being 
selected to preside over the Chamber.  It is a demanding task to 
interpret the rules fairly, to ensure that all members are heard 
and to maintain order in a Chamber where there is such a vast 
range of views, beliefs and political philosophies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, you will enjoy the support and co-operation of 
myself and my colleagues in the NDP caucus as long as you 
continue with your already demonstrated practice of firmness, 
fairness and allowing us all to have a bit of fun while we get on 
with getting the job done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to state the obvious. Parliament is the forum through 
which our citizens speak.  The Parliament of Canada must 
represent the people of Canada in all their diversity.  As we 
debate the throne speech and as we vote on whether parliament has 
confidence in the government, it seems to me that we must 
consider an even more profound and disturbing question:  Do 
Canadian citizens have confidence in parliament to get the job 
done? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the recent federal election it was alarming to recognize that 
a mere 58% of Canadians actually bothered to vote.  I think those 
terrible results of very low voter turnout indicate how many 
people really have lost faith in parliament.  It indicates how 
many people see some of the archaic practices in parliament and 
excessive partisanship as not being able to address their 
concerns and as being remote from their everyday lives and 
somewhat irrelevant to their concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to seize the challenge that this presents.  Far too 
often, amid the pomp and splendour of parliament, there is a 
tendency to ignore the dangerous and growing gap between those 
who govern and those who are governed.  If we ignore the problem 
then we place our precious democratic system in peril. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From their parliamentary perches, too many government members 
are asking themselves what could possibly be wrong with an 
electoral system that elected a Liberal majority government.  Let 
me say that narrow partisanship will not heal democracy.  It is 
not leadership.  As parliamentarians we know that it is essential 
to represent citizens in every community in every corner of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members of parliament we have different political 
philosophies, but together, at the end of the day, we share the 
responsibility to help restore the faith that Canadians have in 
the democratic process and in parliament's ability to get on with 
addressing their concerns.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me the project deserves more than the vague 
reference it received in yesterday's throne speech, a bare 
mention, conjuring up the image that parliamentary reform is to 
consist of not much more than a little technological tinkering on 
the corners of our desks when it comes to voting.  Radical 
parliamentary and electoral reform are imperative if we are to 
revitalize democracy within these walls and throughout our 
nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We share as well an obligation to ensure that Canadian democracy 
is not threatened by external factors.  Canadians are justly 
proud of our reputation as responsible, compassionate members of 
the world community.  The 21st century provides an unprecedented 
opportunity for us to work in partnership with other progressive 
forces to promote peace, human rights, social justice and genuine 
economic progress around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is therefore disappointing in the extreme that the throne 
speech failed to reject unequivocally the national missile 
defence system, the madness that threatens to reignite the 
nuclear arms race and to introduce dangerous instability into 
today's world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The throne speech regrettably was also silent on other important 
international issues.  In trade agreements the government has 
uncritically embraced the corporate model of globalization.  In 
the throne speech and in the Prime Minister's response to my 
questions earlier today, it remains true that the government 
ignores the legitimate concern of Canadians that trade deals 
protect core labour standards, basic human rights and our 
cultural diversity; protect our social programs, particularly the 
universality of our health care system; protect our natural 
resources and our primary producers; and protect our environment, 
including the most life sustaining provisions of all, clean air 
and safe water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the government these critical concerns are casually 
dismissed as impediments to the corporate goal of unfettered 
trade.  The government is virtually bargaining away our ability 
to choose and chart our own future as a sovereign nation.  It 
threatens the very democracy that is so prized by Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In opposition the Liberals recognized, or at least they 
professed to recognize, that unless the flaws in the free trade 
deal were fixed the trade agreement remained unacceptable to 
Canadians and therefore should not be ratified.  However, once in 
government, the Liberals reneged on their promise not to ratify 
the flawed free trade agreement.  In fact, they compounded the 
problem by entrenching those same flaws in the broader NAFTA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thanks to NAFTA, we have not only moved away from the polluter 
pay principle in protecting our environment, our most precious 
resource, but we are actually facing the indignity of having to 
pay the polluters.  Thanks to NAFTA, Canada is forced to permit 
the use of MMT, a dangerous neurotoxin banned in many other 
countries.  To add insult to injury, for having dared to protest, 
Canada is now required to hand over $20 million to Ethyl 
Corporation, the American company which supplies that neurotoxin. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sadly, last week at Davos, Switzerland, Canada's industry 
minister killed the last hope that the federal government would 
wake up to the growing concerns held by Canadians about the 
Liberal-Tory globalization model.  I have to say that the new 
industry minister's fawning over the Mulroney free trade deal 
rivals the <I>Irish Eyes Are Smiling</I> embarrassment in the 
Ronald Reagan era.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thanks to NAFTA, Canadians are struggling to heat their homes 
this winter because a U.S. energy crisis will not allow us to 
sell our fuel to one another at reasonable prices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers and farm families cannot get the support they need to 
survive in times of crisis, while U.S. and European agricultural 
competitors are massively subsidized by their national 
treasuries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What critical analysis of and what solutions to these problems 
does the government offer in the throne speech?  Absolutely none. 
Nothing.  Not one word.  Not even an acknowledgement that these 
problems exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to believe that the throne speech of platitudes and 
warm fuzzies that we heard yesterday will translate into genuine 
progress and concrete solutions for our citizens:  for our 
aboriginal peoples, too long shut out; for persons with 
disabilities, too long ignored; for visible minorities, too often 
sidelined; for women who still suffer discrimination in many ugly 
forms; and for those trapped in poverty and those living without 
adequate shelter or, worse still, living on the streets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately yesterday's throne speech was devoid of solid 
initiatives, like a national housing strategy to help the quarter 
of a million Canadians who are living in substandard housing or 
who have no roof over their heads. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where was the concrete action to introduce the promised 
legislation to ban bulk water exports? Where was the action to 
protect our endangered species or to meet our climate change 
commitments?  Where were the national pharmacare and home care 
programs, which are needed to modernize Canada's health care 
system and help people deal with the rising costs of medical 
care?  Where was the commitment to a national child care program, 
promised in 1993 and still not delivered? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps most important, where was the promise to introduce a 
budget that would set out clearly and concretely what social, 
environmental and infrastructure investments the government is 
actually prepared to make in the years ahead and throughout its 
mandate? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What choices will the government make, especially with the 
economic storm clouds gathering on the horizon?  Will it be the 
corporations or the citizens of Canada whose interests will guide 
public policy choices through the third mandate of the 
government?  Will it be the elimination of the surtax on incomes 
over $100,000 or the commitment to eliminate child poverty?  Will 
the government delay in another tax break on capital gains 
targeted to those in the $250,000 plus bracket or in another 
barrier to post-secondary education and more student debt? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many more questions that my colleagues and I will have 
in the days ahead.  From the point of view of my constituents in 
Halifax and those in the Atlantic region, I have many other 
questions that go completely ignored in the throne speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern Shore 
has mentioned one of them.  Where is the commitment to the 
national shipbuilding strategy?  After eight years of denying 
that there was a need for any strategy, we finally had some 
acknowledgement on the eve of this election that it was past time 
for the Liberal government to introduce such a strategy.  Then we 
saw the industry minister backpedalling completely from it.  It 
seems to me he has some questions to answer about whether in fact 
the real impediment is not the free trade deal that he is now 
praising from the heights of Switzerland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where is any recognition of and any commitment from the 
government to deal with the problem posed by an unfair 
equalization formula, one that makes it impossible for 
governments in have not provinces to actually make progress 
because of the excessive clawback of any resources from, for 
example, the offshore development that now may give an 
opportunity to Nova Scotia and Newfoundland?

</I></B></P><P align=left>Democracy in Canada is at a crossroads.  The choices made by the 
government and what we achieve in this parliamentary session will 
determine where we go from here.  It is significant that as we 
launch this 37th parliament we have an opportunity to rethink the 
very nature of our country's democracy, which is in peril because 
of the government's approach to free trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the free trade of the Americas summit happening in Quebec 
in April, there is a perfect opportunity for Canada to see the 
fact of this happening here in our midst as an occasion for 
Canadians to begin to be heard on the fundamental concerns about 
the threat to democracy because of this uncritical embracing of a 
corporate model for globalization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we want to restore the faith of Canadians in our public 
institutions, we must reform those institutions.  Most important, 
we must deal concretely and sincerely with the everyday concerns, 
the bread and butter issues that plague our citizens, together 
with the myriad of issues this 37th parliament must tackle.  If 
we can restore Canadians' belief in capability and resolve of 
their public institutions to get the job done, I believe it would 
be possible to declare the 37th parliament a success. 
<P><A NAME="LINK169"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron (Fundy—Royal, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I take 
this opportunity to make some comments about some points that I 
would like to help the hon. member with and on which I disagree 
with her position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know that the member for Halifax is a very learned and 
solid contributor to the House of Commons, but with respect to 
the free trade initiative we have to reflect on the overall 
impact it has had on Canada.  Our trade with the Americans was 
around $90 billion in 1998.  Now our trade with them is over $320 
billion each and every year.  That is the single largest 
instrument of the growth we have had in our economy.  To some, 
globalization is a problem, but we know Canada can win on a trade 
based regime. We can compete with the world and actually grow our 
economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the MMT issue, the member is absolutely right. 
There was enough scientific capacity to say that MMT could have a 
negative effect on human health.  All the Government of Canada 
had to do was to ban that substance as a toxin under schedule 1 
of the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, a very pioneering 
act brought forward by guess who?  The Progressive Conservative 
Party.  Had the government banned it as a schedule 1 toxin as 
opposed to making it a trade issue, it would not have been 
challenged under NAFTA.  To hold NAFTA responsible for the 
Liberals' mismanagement of MMT as an environmental cause is 
wrong.  Clearly under NAFTA and under FTA Canadians have the 
right to set our own labour, cultural and environmental 
standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am sure we will have 
many occasions to debate these issues over the next while. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In general it is not the view of the New Democratic Party, nor 
did I express it today, that globalization per se is a problem. 
The problem is the approach to globalization and specifically the 
nature of the trade agreement into which the government has 
entered and into which it now seems absolutely intent to propel 
us yet again with the free trade area of the Americas agreement.

<A HREF="#LINKT49"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is that the government has lost sight, as the 
Mulroney government did, of the fact that trade ought to be the 
servant of the people, just as the economy ought to be the 
servant of the people, not the master.  Trade is not the end 
goal.  Trade is a means, and a very important means, to develop 
our economy and to potentially improve life for Canadians. 
However, when we see a kind of uncritical embracing of the 
corporate model, we literally see an erosion of the right of 
citizens to have a say in the future of their country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that we debate these things.  That is why it is 
so astounding that in the throne speech, instead of acknowledging 
that there is a growing crescendo of concern among citizens, not 
just in Canada but in many parts of the world, about the flawed 
and failed corporatist model, we get nothing but a once over 
glossy reference to the wonders of free trade that the government 
has brought to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be a little more critical and a little more discerning. 
Let us be a little more willing to look at what flaws have now 
proven to be a problem and let us correct them before we barge 
ahead at the upcoming summit in Quebec, which will lock us and 
other vulnerable citizens in other parts of the world even 
further into trade deals that are bad for citizens and designed 
mainly to address the needs and greed of corporate entities.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to congratulate the hon. member for Halifax for her 
very thoughtful comments in response to the throne speech.  She 
covered the whole gamut of what was lacking in the throne speech 
and what, from the perspective of New Democrats, we need to be 
putting forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the hon. member when she says that what this 
parliament and the Government of Canada need to do is address the 
bread and butter issues facing Canadians.  She laid that out very 
well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the hon. member to comment on one aspect of the 
throne speech, which is that we somehow will have a new national 
project to address child poverty.  Could the hon. member comment 
on this based on the performance we have seen from the government 
over the last three and a half years?  I am sure she remembers 
the time 11 years ago when the Hon. Ed Broadbent put forward a 
resolution in the House of Commons to eliminate child poverty. 
What happened to that national project?  Why is the Liberal 
government only talking about it today as though somehow this 
will be addressed?  The record on this issue is important.  I 
would like the hon. member to give us her thoughts on the matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the answer to the 
question of what happened to the commitment to eliminate child 
poverty in this country, a commitment made by all 
parliamentarians in this Chamber 12 years ago, is exactly what 
we fear go will happen to the “commitment” to eliminate 
child poverty, which is yet again in the throne speech.  It is so 
totally lacking in any kind of comprehensive strategy precisely 
because it is a statement of intentions without any facts or 
figures.  There are no hard dollars and no specific programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first event the New Democratic Party launched in the last 
election campaign was an event to address the issue of child 
poverty.  Ever since then I have worn on my lapel a pin given to 
me by the anti-poverty workers, specifically workers in the field 
of child care and child development.  It is a pin that reads 
“Children First”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government really meant what is stated in the throne 
speech and what is stated by the Prime Minister this afternoon 
when he talks about the head start program, we would not be 
pretending that this is something new that has been discovered. 
With all due respect to the member for Don Valley West, I applaud 
the fact that he has spoken to the importance of the head start 
and early childhood development programs, but I had the sense 
that the Prime Minister was Rip Van Winkle waking up from a long 
sleep this afternoon when he talked about the head start program 
being something new.  I was working in the head start movement in 
1964.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For 40 years it has been proven that if one is serious about 
giving children the best possible start in life then one has to 
eliminate the poverty that exists in families and in communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Giving children a head start is not just a slogan.  If we are 
serious about eliminating poverty then we must make sure that 
they have adequate nutrition.  That means decent incomes.  We 
must make sure they have decent housing so that when they go to 
school they can actually learn instead of suffer from the fact 
that they have not been able to sleep because they are too cold 
or they are living in crowded conditions or, worse still, on the 
street. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The short answer is that this slogan has still not been 
translated into the kind of concrete initiatives needed to get 
the job of eliminating poverty done.  That is why we call for a 
budget.  That is why we call for the allocation of dollars, so 
that this slogan can be translated into something real in terms 
of giving kids the best possible start in life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  By unanimous consent we are seeking that the hours of 
debate be extended to encapsulate the spirit of the agreement by 
the House leaders that all leaders speak on this day in the 
Address in Reply to the Speech from the Throne. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have consulted with the other House leaders and I believe you 
would find unanimous consent to extend the hours for that purpose

extended only to the extent of giving him the allotted time of 20 
minutes? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  My understanding is that there would 
be 20 minutes for the speech and 10 minutes for questions and 
comments.  Is there unanimous consent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK171"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Joe Clark (Calgary Centre, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
thank you very much not only for the opportunity to speak but for 
the agreement to extend the hours if by chance I should be on my 
feet longer than 20 minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I begin by congratulating the Speaker and the candidates for 
speakership.  Indeed I congratulate all members who were elected 
and, as the leader of the New Democratic Party just did, all who 
had the courage to stand for office in the election of November 
27, 2000.  I also extend my congratulations to the mover and the 
seconder of the Address in Reply to the Speech From the Throne. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You will understand, Mr. Speaker, if I extend a particular 
thanks to the voters of the constituency of Calgary Centre.  It 
is a diverse, dynamic and positive community.  It is a community 
that is committed to the country and is able to play a leading 
role in shaping the future of Canada.  I look forward to working 
with the constituents of Calgary Centre to ensure that the voice 
of western Canada is heard in very positive and constructive ways 
on the floor of the House in shaping national decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The throne speech offers no vision for the future of the 
country.  That is not surprising because through the election 
campaign the Liberals offered no vision of the future of the 
country.  They drifted through the campaign as they have drifted 
through the last seven years.  They were elected by default. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to my colleagues on this side of the House that was as 
much our fault as it was theirs, but it is important to underline 
that the government has no positive mandate from the people of 
Canada. It was elected by accident, elected by default.  We on 
this side of the House will ensure that we hold it to account on 
the actions that it undertakes. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the greatest danger is that the throne speech is 
utterly silent on the economic challenges facing the working 
people of Canada.  As industries lay off employees across our 
country and other nations change their policies to fight an 
economic slowdown, the government's only initiative is to delay 
until the fall a budget that should have been brought down in 
February. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The major initiatives in the throne speech on children and 
aboriginals are an indication of the guilt this government feels 
for ignoring these issues for seven years.

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are several issues that need to be addressed in the House. 
I want to break with tradition in the throne speech debate and 
focus my remarks exclusively on how we can reform the House of 
Commons and restore accountability to democracy in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe there is a general willingness in the House, in all 
five parties, to break a tradition that gives governments too 
much power and the elected representatives of the people far too 
little power.  The leader of the New Democratic Party has just 
spoken of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently the Liberal members for St. Paul's and Winnipeg South 
wrote an article on this issue.  They underlined some of the 
alarming developments in our country, one being the low voter 
turnout, which dropped more than 5% in the November 27 election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The article focused on parliamentary reform, such as broadening 
the role of individual members, whether by more free votes, more 
resources to the parliamentary library or more influence on 
committees.  That is an important issue on which I believe a lot 
of progress can be made if we work together in the Chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House leader of the Canadian Alliance has put forward some 
very interesting proposals in that vein.  My party and I could 
support many of those proposals.  Indeed, many of them we put 
forward ourselves in one way or another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking entirely on a personal basis, I would like to look at 
changes that give private members from all parties an initiating 
role in drafting public legislation.  I support this and will 
work actively with my colleagues to achieve more power for 
individual members of parliament.  I call that reform by 
empowerment.  However, the change that would be even more 
important would be reform by accountability. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had the privilege of serving in eight parliaments, in 
government and in opposition.  When it comes to parliamentary 
reform, I believe there is an even more important and 
urgent goal.  That goal is to restore to the House of Commons 
the means to effectively control the spending authority of the 
government, through unrestricted examination and control of 
estimates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a power the House of Commons used to have and gave 
away, for reasons that no doubt seemed compelling at the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That control of the estimates cannot be brought back in the 
forms that worked in the past, but the principle can, and 
should, be restored.  The power to deny the government the 
authority to spend is the best means to hold that government 
accountable to parliament. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will come back to some specific proposals that would have that 
effect, but I want to discuss briefly another way to hold the 
government accountable; that is, to ensure that the watchdogs 
established to monitor government behaviour report directly to 
parliament, not to the cabinet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The place to start is with the 1993 Liberal Party red book 
promise to have the ethics counsellor report directly to the 
House of Commons.  That promise should be kept.  It should be 
retroactive to 1993 so that we can examine decisions taken since 
that time.  The terms of reference should be expanded to include 
representations to crown corporations and other activities where 
suspicious contacts may occur. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to consider what other instruments are required to 
ensure that government is as transparent as possible, because a 
conditioned precedent to holding a government to account is to 
know what it is doing.  That means there must be more respect for 
the work, the reports and the mandate of the privacy commissioner 
and the information commissioner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should also look at innovations in other jurisdictions. 
Thanks in part to the new member for Vancouver Quadra, British 
Columbia has a very interesting procedure that we should look at. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1820"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT52"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a procedure that establishes a special prosecutor for 
cases specifically involving the investigation and prosecution of 
crimes involving persons of particular influence, including 
cabinet ministers, senior public officials and police officers or 
persons in close relationship to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There would be other examples in other jurisdictions.  We need 
instruments to hold any government, whatever its partisan stripe, 
to account.  We need to look at ways in which that could be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will come back to accountability.  The real dilemma in 
societies that are both modern and democratic is to combine 
efficiency in government with real accountability.  In the past 
30 years most societies have made a choice.  We have chosen 
efficiency over accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We did that in Canada in the 1960s and the 1970s.  We changed 
that for what seemed at the time to be very good reasons.  The 
old system of committee of the whole House and supply made it 
difficult for governments to plan.  It made it difficult for 
governments to respond to urgent questions.  There is no doubt 
that it was inefficient.  We made a change in the name of 
efficiency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one in the House would question that we need governments that 
are both willing and able to act.  That requirement is more 
dominant now than ever before in the complex and fast changing 
world of today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a time when the unthinkable happens regularly.  Human 
life can now be cloned.  Terrorists with package bombs are mobile 
and lethal.  Traditional farm or industrial emissions can 
aggregate to poison water, air or streams.  Governments have to 
be able to act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a democracy, if democracy means anything at all, governments 
must also be held to account.  We have lost the capacity to hold 
governments to account in the House of Commons.  We are letting 
the country down.  We have an obligation in this House to make 
changes in the next few years to restore that power to 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Traditionally, the primary role of the House of Commons has been 
the granting or withholding of supply to the government of the 
day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is more than 30 years now since the House of Commons, in an 
attempt to improve consideration of supply, changed the rules and 
began to send the annual spending estimates of government not to 
a committee of the whole where parliament and the world could 
see, but to committee with time limits.  That experiment has been 
a complete failure on every count.  Year after year effective 
parliamentary authority over government spending has been allowed 
to lapse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I took a look at some of the larger departmental estimates that 
were considered in committee last year.  The Standing Committee 
on Defence and Veterans Affairs spent a grand total of one hour 
and 30 minutes on the estimates of the Department of National 
Defence and one hour and 35 minutes, a little bit longer, on the 
estimates of veterans affairs.  The total time on the estimates 
of the Department of Finance last year was one hour and 20 
minutes.  The total time on the Department of Health was less 
than 90 minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a system that does not work.  In a parliament that is 
founded on the idea that we control the government, that is an 
indication of abject and complete failure.  We have an obligation 
to try to make that change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why has the system failed?  It has failed because in that old 
system, when we met in committee of the whole here on the floor 
of this House—and the Prime Minister and some of the rest of us 
are old enough to remember that—there was a tension and there 
was a profile to the examination and the analysis of government 
estimates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In committees now there is no profile and no tension, and so 
there is no attention to holding a government to account.  The 
time limits that exist now and the cycle of questions make it 
virtually impossible for any member of parliament, in government 
or in opposition, to sustain questioning over a period of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the old system, a member of parliament could literally 
continue asking questions as long as he or she stood on his or 
her feet in the House of Commons.  Indeed, if someone happened to 
be speaking at the time the House adjourned, he or she would 
continue speaking in the morning. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1825"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Was that subject to abuse?  Of course it was.  However, it also 
ensured that the government was held to account.  It ensured 
there was no way simply by resorting to a schedule that a 
government could get away from that kind of scrutiny. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened then?  Ministers paid attention to the House of 
Commons.  They also paid attention to their own departments. 
Ministers now are sort of chairmen of the board of their 
department.  They do not get involved with the difficult details 
of running a government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Human Resources last year got into terrible 
difficulty because she did not know her department.  Had she been 
forced to come to committee of the whole and defend the 
estimates, as ministers before her have been forced to do, she 
would have known and we would have known.  There would have been 
an opportunity for us to avoid some of the problems and some of 
the terrible waste that occurred because our system has gone 
wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only would that be good for accountability, it would be good 
in terms of fiscal responsibility.  It would save money.  It 
would mean there would be much less waste.  It would also change 
the relationship between elected members and public servants whom 
the Prime Minister positively and correctly applauded and 
encouraged today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Public servants in that old system knew they had to be ready for 
tough scrutiny.  They had no option but to respect a parliament 
that could hold up virtually forever their spending plans.  That 
has now gone in this committee system.  Nobody takes seriously 
the fundamental responsibility of the House of Commons to control 
the spending of the government of the day.  That is something we 
simply have to change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do we do about it?  One option I believe would be to 
restore a committee of the whole House for the consideration of a 
limited number of departments, but for an unlimited period of 
time.  It could take two departments each year and give it to the 
official opposition decide which two.  We could establish a rule 
that the choice would not be made until the day before the debate 
began so everybody would have to prepare for coming into the 
place and asking questions without any kind of fetter.  That is 
one way in which we could restore the capacity of the House of 
Commons to control the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another option is to take estimates away from the standing 
committee and put them into a new kind of chamber, a debating 
chamber, a committee of the whole House acting as a committee of 
supply that could meet simultaneously with the House as a whole. 
It would meet in parallel with the House.  It should be televised 
so the questions which are asked and answers that are given are 
seen by the public at large. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ministers would answer to the committee in a freewheeling 
process of question and answer without the artificial time 
restraints that are now in place.  Ministers would have to know 
about their departments because they would not be able to have 
officials answer for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are some options.  There may well be others in the 
imagination of the House and by examples that are available to us 
in other jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all recognize that the system as it exists now does not work. 
We have just come back.  We can spend our time trying to breathe 
life into a system that does not work.  We can pretend it is 
parliamentary reform if we have the opportunity to move more 
motions or take a more independent role.  This is not about the 
independence or the participation of individual members, 
important as that is.  This is about making any government 
accountable to parliament.  That is why parliament was 
established.  We have let that power be lost and we must regain 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I consider that issue important enough that instead of dealing 
with other issues, which I will pursue and my colleagues will 
pursue in the days to come, I want to focus attention now on our 
most fundamental responsibility, which is to make this 
institution viable by changing it.  We must ensure that we 
restore and respect the fundamental purpose for which we were all 
elected, which was not only to represent our constituents but to 
ensure that the people of this democracy of Canada would have 
some means on a day to day, year to year basis to control the 
government that affects so much of their lives. 
<P><A NAME="LINK172"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to ask the right. hon. 
leader of the Conservative Party if he remembers a few things 
that occurred some years ago when the Conservatives were in 
power.  He is referring to accountability to this parliament. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1830"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT54"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1988, Mr. Speaker, the year I believe when you were first 
elected to the House of Commons, parliament was recalled, sat, 
never tabled estimates, never was granted supply, adjourned, 
prorogued the session and then called for a Governor General's 
warrant without having asked this parliament for a cent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That can hardly be reconciled with reforming parliament.  That 
is something that was so retrograde that it went against every 
democratic principle.  It was illegal a hundred years ago in the 
United Kingdom.  That was done by former Prime Minister Mulroney 
at the time, and the right hon. member across was a member of his 
cabinet.  They presumably approved the use of a Governor 
General's warrant when parliament had previously sat.  That is 
what he and the right hon. member across did with his cabinet 
colleagues in 1988. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He may wish us to forget that but some of us have long memories. 
Does he recall I asked Dr. Harvie Andre, who was House leader at 
the time, a question about the estimates?  The estimates had been 
tabled and not one minister appeared before a parliamentary 
committee to defend them.  That was the Conservative Party of 
which he was a member.  Why does the right hon. member fail to 
remember all of these things?  Why does he pretend all of a 
sudden to be an advocate for parliamentary reform and 
accountability for this great institution?  I could go on about 
several more like that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The few examples of parliamentary reform that we have were 
co-authored by the hon. Jim McGrath.  The right hon. member said 
parliament was not working at all.  What would Jim McGrath think 
of a speech like that?  We made some of those reforms.  It was a 
Conservative who chaired the committee to have these done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  You repealed the McGrath report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  The hon. member from the back row just 
alleged that we repealed some of the McGrath committee report. 
As far as I know the only reform that was repealed was the one to 
make committees larger than seven members.  We did it because 
there was a five party condition in the House.  Had we not done 
that the Conservative Party would not have had a seat on any 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know something about it because in 1997 I authored that 
initiative to give his party representation on committees.  If 
the right hon. member does not believe it perhaps he could talk 
to his House leader who knows a lot about that issue.  However, I 
do not know what kind of terms they are on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we could shrink the size of that committee back to what 
Mr. McGrath said.  Who would stop us from doing that?  What party 
would be against doing that if we proposed it right now?  I will 
let members guess what party would lose out on that point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened attentively to the right hon. member's speech.  I had 
high respect for him when he was minister of foreign affairs.  He 
did great things for the country and I acknowledge that.  I 
listened to many of his speeches.  I recognize what he did as a 
minister of national unity some years ago.  I will agree that he 
did a good job then too.  However, today he stood and recited 
some of these platitudes.  The first thing I would do is fire the 
speech writer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Joe Clark:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not intend to 
respond in kind but I would imagine that I remember more of what 
the hon. member said in opposition than he does.  If we want to 
get into that kind of exchange, we can do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I may say so, his response indicates exactly what is wrong 
with the House.  If there is a question about which we should not 
be partisan, it is the question of how we make the House work 
more effectively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Was I responsible for actions which did not advance 
accountability in the House?  Yes, I was.  Did the House of 
Commons deliberately decide that we would move away from the 
committee of the whole consideration of estimates?  Yes, we did.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Were we right?  No, we were not.  We were wrong.  We should 
recognize that we collectively were wrong.  Members of several 
parties took that decision because we recognized that the old 
rules were not allowing us to adjust to a new reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am asking the House to recognize now that the new rules we put 
in place also do not work.  I can dig up as much information 
about the past as anyone in the House.  I have a longer memory. I 
have the capacity to make the point in both languages.  That is 
not the purpose of the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, the reason we are in such low repute is that the people 
of the country look at parliament and they see us casting arrows 
at one another, putting partisan interest ahead of national 
interest.  That is not what we are here to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are here to make parliament work.  We are here to make 
democracy work.  If we are honest at all with one another, we 
know that it is not working as well as it should.  Perhaps the 
proposals I have put forward today are not adequate.  If they are 
not adequate, let us bring forth better proposals.  Let us not 
lose the chance to change parliament, to hold the government more 
accountable, and to give more power to individual members of 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that this was a temporary lapse, that the highly 
responsible minister, the leader of the government in the House, 
thought he was a rat packer again.  He got caught in a time warp 
and slipped back to his old behaviour.  I would like to believe 
that there is a real commitment to reform among the members of 
the Liberal Party.  I know that there is a commitment among many 
of their backbenchers.  I hope it is reflected in the government 
benches too.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I only have one question.  While I was listening to the 
member's speech I was thinking that what drove me out of his 
party and into the then Reform Party, now the Canadian Alliance, 
was the lack of accountability by parliament for the finances of 
the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no doubt about the fact that if the government that we 
have now, and the government of which the member was a member 
previous to that for nine years, would have exercised restraint, 
we would not have even today a gross debt of over $600 billion. 
He has put his finger on it.  It took him some 10 years longer to 
find out than those of us who are in this section of the 
opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I honour and respect now what he has just said.  What I would 
like to know is how do we know for sure that on his road to 
Damascus his conversion is real. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Joe Clark:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will not speak about 
the consistency between what people say on the way to an election 
and what they do when they get to the House.  There has been 
recent evidence very close to the member for Elk Island about how 
quickly positions can change.  I do not want to get into that.  I 
will not argue who was where first.  The important thing he said 
is that he agrees with my analysis as to what is wrong here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Judging from the reforms proposed by his House leader, his party 
believes that there are changes that have to be made.  So do we. 
Certainly, if I may speak on this occasion for her, so do members 
of the New Democratic Party. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we could include the members of the Bloc Quebecois. 
Everyone agrees, and some members of the governing party would 
also like to see major changes to the standing orders of the 
House.  We would like to see parliament's ability to control the 
government restored.  That is the challenge we face. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On this we agree.  On other topics, we do not.  That is the 
nature of parliament and democracy, but if we wish to protect 
and enhance democracy in Canada and the reputation of 
parliament, we must consider changes to the standing orders of 
the House. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I welcome the support of the hon. member on this issue.  I know 
it is only on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe we have work to do here.  I hope that in the session 
that begins this week we will accept that responsibility and 
change this institution to restore and serve democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  In closing, let me thank all members 
of the House for their collaboration on this being a leaders' 
day.  I might add that it is great to be back in the Chair.
