<P><A NAME="LINK24"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Minister of Labour, Lib.)</B>  moved 
that Bill C-24, an act to provide for the resumption and 
continuation of postal service, be read the second time and 
referred to a committee of the whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak to Bill C-24, the 
Postal Services Continuation Act, 1997, legislation directed at 
bringing about the resumption of postal service in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members will be aware that the work stoppage which began at 
Canada Post Corporation on November 19 followed a lengthy period 
of negotiations.  Despite the efforts of the parties, the two 
sides were unable to reach a resolution to their differences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As hon. members will recall, I had stated on several occasion in 
the House that the collective bargaining process as part I of the 
Canada Labour Code had to be allowed to work. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1015"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a firm believer in the democratic concept of free 
collective bargaining.  Naturally I am disappointed that in this 
case the parties failed to accept their responsibilities under 
the process and achieve a settlement.  I am also mindful of the 
resulting economic harm which the work stoppage has had on 
Canadian businesses and charities. However, I have no regrets in 
having provided the parties with every possibility to resolve the 
dispute themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fortunately the Canadian experience has been that these 
occasions are relatively few and far between. The vast majority 
of labour negotiations, in excess of 90%, are settled without 
resort to work stoppage action by either of the parties.  That 
underscores the faith which governments at various levels have 
expressed in the collective bargaining system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The dispute which has led to the proposed legislation involves 
negotiations for the renewal of the collective agreement between 
the corporation and the Canadian Union of Postal Workers which 
covers some 45,000 employees. The previous collective agreement 
which was reached in direct negotiations expired on July 31 of 
this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following six weeks of direct negotiations between the two 
sides, the union filed a notice of dispute pursuant to section 71 
of the Canada Labour Code.  While the union expressed a 
preference for no further assistance from my department, I felt 
the interest of all parties would be well served by the 
appointment of a conciliation officer to assist the parties in 
their deliberations.  This was done on June 20, 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parties decided to continue with direct negotiations prior 
to the conciliation officer joining in the discussions on August 
19.  Following a series of conciliation sessions, the union asked 
the officer to report to me, ending their involvement.  On 
September 18 CUPW rejected a global offer made by the employer 
three days earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After careful consideration of the situation, I decided to 
provide the parties with a second stage of conciliation 
assistance and appointed Mr. Marc Gravel, a well-respected third 
party neutral, as conciliation commissioner on October 7.  Mr. 
Gravel held meetings on October 14 and continued to explore 
avenues of settlement with the parties until the end of the 
month. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his report to me, the conciliation commissioner indicated he 
was unable to help the parties resolve their differences.  He 
suggested the parties needed the pressure of a strike or lockout 
deadline to conclude a settlement.  He also recommended that they 
urge the parties to negotiate their dispute promptly, diligently 
and in good faith and that they make the services of the Federal 
Mediation and Conciliation Service available to them. I released 
the commissioner's report to the parties on November 10 and they 
acquired the legal right to strike or lockout at 12.01 a.m. on 
November 18. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the week that followed the release of the commissioner's 
report the parties met on several occasions in direct 
negotiations. These meetings continued following a nationwide 
strike action by CUPW on November 19. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After speaking with both parties and being given their 
assurances that they still desired a negotiated settlement of the 
dispute, I appointed the director general of the Federal 
Mediation and Conciliation Service, Mr. Warren Edmondson, as 
mediator in the dispute. As I indicated, this action had also 
been endorsed by the conciliation commissioner in his report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Edmondson's reputation as a professional in the dispute 
resolution field is well known.  His presence in the proceedings 
provided the parties with an opportunity to demonstrate their 
resolve to arrive at a new collective agreement.

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, neither of the two parties displayed the 
flexibility necessary to move toward a resolution of the dispute. 
The mediator after some four days of intense meetings determined 
that there was very little chance of a settlement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After speaking with Mr. Edmondson on Friday, I decided that the 
time had come to bring the work stoppage to an end and restore 
postal services to Canadians.  It is for that reason I stand 
before the House today to introduce this bill which provides for 
the resumption of postal operations and a dispute resolution 
mechanism to settle the outstanding issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-24 contains two main features:  a resumption of regular 
postal operations and the appointment of a mediator-arbitrator to 
resolve the issues remaining in the dispute between the employer 
and the union with minor exceptions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill will implement a new collective agreement of three 
years duration expiring on July 31, 2000.  It will provide for a 
wage increase of 1.5% effective February 1, 1998, a further 1.75% 
effective February 1, 1999 and an additional 1.9% effective 
February 1, 2000.  The three year term is in line with most 
collective bargaining agreements being signed these days. The 
wage increases are not unreasonable given the current level of 
settlements in the public sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The remaining issues will be referred to the mediator-arbitrator 
who will be guided by the need for economic and service related 
goals for the corporation as set out by the government, while 
taking into account the need for good labour-management relations 
between the employer and the union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The guiding principles contained in the legislation are designed 
to ensure that the mediator-arbitrator recognizes the directions 
which have been provided to the employer by the Government of 
Canada in terms of financial performance and service standards, 
while at the same time balancing these issues with the importance 
of good labour relations within the workplace.  Most experienced 
arbitrators take such factors into account and this clause is 
included in the legislation for greater certainty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There may be questions as to why the legislation provides for a 
mediator-arbitrator given the fact that mediation was already 
provided to the parties in an attempt to resolve the dispute. 
There are basically two reasons for this.  The first is that 
there are still a large number of complex issues outstanding 
between the two sides.  Second, the process contained in the 
legislation offers the parties one last opportunity to resolve 
these issues themselves at the bargaining table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I indicated, both the union and the employer maintain their 
position that they would prefer to reach a settlement by 
themselves.  Both sides are aware that failure to reach an 
agreement at this stage will result in the issue being determined 
by arbitration.  Anyone with a knowledge of labour relations 
understands that the best collective agreement is one which the 
parties are able to arrive at through the bargaining process 
rather than one imposed by a third party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I regret having to take this action particularly after providing 
the parties with the full range of assistance available to me as 
Minister of Labour.  I personally remain convinced that the 
collective bargaining system can and does work for the majority 
of Canadian employers and unions.  However, these parties have 
been unable to demonstrate the required flexibility to make the 
process work for themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I appointed the mediator I indicated that we would 
carefully monitor the mediation process and assess the situation 
as it progressed.  We have done that and have determined that the 
time is appropriate to act to end this work stoppage which is 
beginning to harm Canadian businesses, charities and Canadians at 
large.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>No doubt we will face criticism from various corners for this 
action, by the labour movement for our legislative intervention 
in the bargaining process, and from the business community and 
various segments of the public for not having acted sooner in the 
dispute.  But I believe strongly that our actions in this dispute 
reflect the will of the majority of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have given the free collective bargaining process, a key 
element of our democratic society, an opportunity to work free of 
interference.  The Canada Labour Code gives the parties the right 
to strike or lockout. Early intervention to take away the right 
would be contrary to the spirit of the law and would discourage 
the parties from any serious attempts at settling their own 
differences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However when it became evident that the parties were unable to 
effectively work within that process, we acted to protect the 
interest of Canadians.  I would urge hon. members to support this 
action and restore postal service to this nation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK25"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Gouk (West Kootenay—Okanagan, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, right at the start I will open by making it abundantly 
clear that the Reform Party supports having back to work 
legislation in order to get the postal service operating again 
for the 30 million Canadians who depend on it. In essence what we 
are doing in this particular bill is making the best of a bad 
situation with a flawed piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I get into the main content of my speech, I would like to 
address a couple of comments to the speech made by the Minister 
of Labour. One of the things he said is that he has no regret in 
allowing this process to take place and he said that while 
acknowledging the incredible economic and personal harm that this 
has done to Canadians.  I find that shameful.  I find it very 
shameful that he said that he has no regret at the harm this 
strike and this process has brought to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also talked quite eloquently, as he has throughout the time 
leading up to this particular debate, about how you have to let 
the collective bargaining process work—he is down to just over 
90% today, before he was saying figures of 94%—without work 
stoppage. The reality is that this is the fourth strike by Canada 
Post in 10 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were two strikes in 1987 and in fairness that would have 
been one if the unions were combined as they are now into a 
single union. Presumably there was a settlement in 1989 and there 
was another strike in 1991.  Then a little bit of labour peace 
and here we are in 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether the minister uses the figure of 90% or 94% without a 
strike, that is not the case with Canada Post and he knew that 
going into this.  What we have called on the government time 
after time is to provide some mechanism for the union and for 
Canada Post that does not involve a strike or lockout. Reform's 
position on Canada Post has always been that there should be a no 
strike, no lockout solution for all postal contract disputes. Our 
first concern is and always has been the Canadian public's right 
to have an uninterrupted mail service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Liberal Party's rhetoric during question period, the 
Minister of Finance keeps bragging about this great 10% reduction 
to employment insurance premiums and how much it is going to cost 
the government.  He keeps talking about what a great thing this 
is, what a tremendous sacrifice by the government because there 
is going to be a $1.4 billion reduction in government revenues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since this strike has started, it has cost Canadian business 
over $3 billion and that is still going up by over $200 million a 
day.  By the time this legislation can get passed and the whole 
process can get started with some lag time, it will be at least 
another $1 billion.  That is a $4 billion cost to the Canadian 
economy.  And the government has the nerve to say, “Look at the 
tremendous sacrifice we are making with a $1.4 billion reduction 
in our revenues because of our very, very generous change in the 
employment insurance deductions”.

<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prior to the strike actually starting 1,000 people were laid off 
from mail dependent businesses just from the threat alone.  That 
is the time the government should have opened its eyes and said 
we have a real problem and we have a responsibility to do 
something about it.  Unfortunately the government completely 
ignored its responsibility to the Canadian people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the strike got under way it is estimated that in excess of 
10,000 people have been laid off.  I hope the minister dealing 
with employment in this government takes those figures into mind 
when he starts talking about the wonderful job creation record of 
the Liberal government when in fact its inaction has cost so 
many people their jobs as Christmas approaches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is starting to have an impact on non-mail dependent 
businesses as we go into the highest retail sales period with all 
the business cutbacks and the layoffs that have ensued.  For many 
charities this is prime fund-raising time, a time when they raise 
as much as 80% of their annual funds.  A large chunk of that time 
has been lost and it will not be recovered.  The impact for 
charities alone on this labour disruption is going to be felt 
next year, all through the year when various people in need come 
to these charities for the services which they offer. They are 
going to find that those charities do not have the money.  The 
reason they do not have the money, again, is the failure of the 
government to act swiftly in the interests of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>None of these figures take into account the human hardship and 
suffering by many people who are looking to the mail for things 
like employment insurance cheques, welfare cheques, support 
payments and a variety of other income cheques 
normally delivered through the mail.  Although arrangements were 
made for some people, many fell through the cracks and many were 
left in dire straits.  We have had calls from all parts of this 
country with people absolutely heart broken, in total despair. 
They have no cheque from wherever that source was supposed to be. 
We had one that I mentioned in this House, a woman from Vancouver 
Island, a young mother with two young children who is on 
employment insurance.  The cheque is already a week late. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this great government program which said it would take care 
of everyone and deliver cheques, well, the cheque was lost 
somewhere in post office limbo.  That woman had no food in the 
house to feed those children.  Maybe the government does not care 
about that.  I guarantee we do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We owe it to all these people and to the rest of the citizens 
of Canada to ensure that this situation does not continue to 
occur every few years.  We need an alternative to strikes and 
lockouts that is fair to all the parties involved and fair to 
Canadians who count on the postal service.  The government's 
legislation does not provide that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current back to work legislation is nothing more than a 
band-aid applied to a festering wound without any real repairs 
that are necessary for a long term solution.  The government must 
accept a large portion of the responsibility for this current 
dispute.  It provided no reasonable alternative to a strike.  It 
has intentionally provoked CUPW throughout the negotiations. 
Unfortunately CUPW has played into the government's hands with 
talk of targeting postal businesses and promoting civil 
disobedience. I am pleased to see it has backed off in that 
somewhat, at least for the time being.  It is to be congratulated 
for seeing through this ploy of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On that, there is quite a bit of action from the union 
leadership chastising organizations like to the Canadian Direct 
Marketing Association, the Canadian Federation of Independent 
Business.  Those organizations are acting on behalf of their 
membership in a proper manner.  Is the CUPW leadership suggesting 
that these people should not be allowed to speak out about the 
harm that this is doing to their members? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would hope that the post office union leadership would keep in 
mind that when you target a business because you do not like the 
activity it has had during this dispute, the business is not a 
stand alone entity.  That business has employees, quite possibly 
union employees.  When you target that business you also target 
those employees because of the impact, if you are successful, you 
will have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the interest of the Canadian public, Reform will support back 
to work legislation.  However, we will be offering amendments to 
the legislation in an attempt to make it fair for all parties. 
The principle reason for our actions is to ensure some measure of 
labour peace in the postal service.  Our motivating factor is to 
provide an effective and reliable postal service for all 
Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left>If the process is not fair and balanced, and what the Liberals 
are proposing certainly is not, then the tension that exists 
between Canada Post management and its employees will only get 
worse if indeed that is even possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to have a process that can be held as a model of 
fairness and replace the current and past disruptions to postal 
services.  Invariably these strikes end with legislation but not 
before causing great public harm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a growing resentment of the union for going on strike 
in the first place.  Before we proceed immediately to place all 
the blame on the union we have to consider one point.  It had no 
other alternative mechanism to use and the blame for that falls 
on the government both present and past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government can see the need to end strikes for the public 
good, then why can it not see the need for a no strike, no 
lockout alternative to this action?  It would appear, many claim, 
and I would not dispute them, that the government has been 
proceeding on a predetermined agenda since this dispute began; 
between statements made by the Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services regarding the legislation and the actions he 
would take and in stating that he would ensure that CUPW takes 
the blame for any strike, through government controlled delays in 
the negotiations which caused the seemingly inevitable strike 
being delayed until the Christmas mailing season was upon us, to 
the latest item of an intentionally meanspirited piece of 
legislation. I am going to deal with why I call this meanspirited 
in a minute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First I think it is appropriate to review the about face of, for 
example, the Minister of Public Works and Government Services. I 
would remind the House that this is not the first time that we 
have had a post office service continuation act.  There was one 
in 1991 and of course there was one in 1987. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1987 the then Tory government brought in basically the same 
legislation that we are faced with today, perhaps not as 
draconian as what is being brought in today because there was not 
a legislative settlement. I quote from <I>Hansard</I>, October 9, 
1987, the now Minister of Public Works and Government Services 
who at that time was the post office critic: “We should let 
Canada Post Corporation manage its own affairs”.  That is what 
CUPW was saying going into this.  He further stated referring to 
the Tory government: “You are an anti-worker government. That is 
what you are”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems that something happens when they walk across that 
floor.  Further to that I would like to add one of the other 
members of the now government who was in opposition at the time, 
the former deputy leader of the party, now down to being the 
Minister of Heritage.  She stated, from <I>Hansard</I> October 13, 
1987, referring to the back to work legislation: “It is so 
draconian in its influence that it is possibly a violation of the 
charter of rights and freedoms. This is a very onerous and 
draconian piece of legislation”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Interestingly the legislation then, flawed though it may be 
because it did not offer a final solution to this, was not as 
flawed and draconian as that which introduced in this House 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason that I have referred to this legislation as 
meanspirited is one specific provision in the bill.  That is the 
inclusion of the rate and implementation dates of pay increases. 
The government is appointing an arbitrator to settle outstanding 
issues in this dispute but is taking the wage question out of the 
hands of its own appointed arbitrator. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The settlement in this legislation is less than what was offered 
by Canada Post.  I am not talking in terms of what is the 
appropriate increase or whether this one is appropriate or not. 
There is no justifiable rationale for including the actual wage 
settlement in the legislation when you have your own arbitrator 
in place except to intentionally invoke a reaction from the 
unions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The important question in this area is why did the government do 
this and what is its real agenda.  Removal of this preimposed 
settlement is one of the amendments that Reform will be putting 
forward during committee of the whole.  I sincerely ask the 
government to strongly consider allowing that amendment and 
supporting that amendment because it will take a bit of the 
meanness out of this legislation. 
Then it will only be as flawed as past legislations. guess. We 
are going to deal with other aspects of this as well to try to 
fix this legislation for the government.

<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another amendment, the main one, will be to replace the toss a 
coin arbitration approach of the government with final offer 
arbitration in order to provide a fairer alternative to the 
strike-lockout approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would any government want to introduce legislation that only 
serves to inflame an already bad employee-employer relationship 
and potentially set us up for the next strike less than three years 
down the road?  If the government will accept this amendment we 
will be able to have a permanent postal service that Canadians 
can count on and we can then commence to deal with the internal 
problems of the corporation and its employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada Post Corporation came into existence through 1981 
legislation by the then Liberal government.  It provided three 
mandates for Canada Post.  The first was to reduce the deficit. 
It has reduced the deficit.  In fact, it has eliminated the 
deficit.  We can therefore say that it has made good on that one 
part of the mandate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second part of the mandate was to improve service to the 
public.  I do not know if there is anybody in this House who 
wants to stand up and defend the fact that Canada Post has not 
improved service.  In my rural riding in particular the service 
has gone downhill by a great deal.  It has not lived up to the 
second part of this.  It takes longer to get a letter than it 
used to while postal rates have continued to increase. We are not 
getting mail delivery in towns that come under the guideline of 
qualifying for mail delivery.  In communities that do get mail 
delivery, when a new area of that town opens up it does not get 
mail delivery.  Service has gone downhill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third mandate was to improve relationships with its 
employees.  Maybe in its second mandate it might falsely try to 
argue that service is good, but I do not think there is a single 
person in this House who would have the audacity to rise in their 
place and suggest that relationships between Canada Post and its 
employees have improved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned that our solution to this is final offer 
arbitration.  This is something we have talked about a lot. Some 
people have asked what exactly it involves.  We have fleshed it 
out in great detail.  I think this is something the government 
should pay attention to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point out that when the government has occasionally made the 
remark that final offer arbitration does not work, the Liberals 
themselves, in the last Parliament, used this twice.  It was the 
settlement mechanism they imposed to end the Vancouver port 
strike in 1994.  It was the settlement mechanism they imposed in 
the Canada Transportation Act, a piece of legislation passed by 
the Liberals in the last Parliament as a settlement mechanism for 
disputes between shippers and the railroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to pre-empt the NDP members by suggesting that if 
they oppose this they might consider that it was the NDP 
government that brought this in as provincial legislation in 
Manitoba some years back.  In fact, it was the right wing party 
that took it out.  I would therefore be real interested to hear 
their comments hopefully supporting final offer arbitration in 
this particular mechanism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In final offer arbitration, as proposed by the Reform Party of 
Canada, all steps of the collective bargaining process will 
remain unaffected except for the final dispute settlement 
mechanism. The current final dispute settlement mechanism, which 
is not really a mechanism at all, a strike by CUPW or a lockout 
by Canada Post Corporation, shall be replaced with final offer 
arbitration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At any time during the collective bargaining process an 
alternative dispute settlement mechanism can be used if it is 
agreed to by both parties provided it does not result in an 
interruption of service to the public.  If all the steps set out 
under the rules for collective bargaining have been followed and 
one or more items of the contract remains unsettled and either 
party feels that no further progress can be made, the outstanding 
items only shall be dealt with through final offer arbitration.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things that is important, and it counters what the 
government has done, is that the government has appointed the 
arbitrator in this legislation.  I have already pointed out in 
this House that in appointing the arbitrator, the government has 
a conflict of interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is like having a dispute between a company and its employees 
and the company gets to set all the rules.  Alternatively, the 
dispute can be between a company and its union and allowing the 
union to set all the rules and arbitrarily impose things on the 
company. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is wrong because the government is not even 
attempting to appear fair and impartial.  It is simply setting 
the stage for the next work disruption just a few years down the 
road, maybe about the time some of the companies affected by this 
strike are just starting to recover. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our idea of arbitration selection, when the negotiations 
reach the point of requiring arbitration, each party shall select 
three people as possible arbitrators acceptable to them.  The two 
parties shall then have seven days to provide the other party 
with the names they have selected along with their curriculum 
vitae. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each receiving party shall select one name from the list 
submitted within seven days of receipt and notify the other party 
of their decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is to ensure that, if they simply have each party select 
their arbitrator, they could, innocently even or not, select 
someone that the other side simply cannot deal with because of 
past conflicts or any number of reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This at least allows the opportunity for a selection from three. 
It still allows each party to select from that list, or select 
that list to be presented to the other side.  It does give a 
little bit of leeway for each party if they have problems with 
one particular person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The two selected arbitrators shall then have a maximum of 14 
days to agree upon a third arbitrator who shall chair the 
arbitration panel and these three will then make up the 
arbitration team. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Upon selection of the arbitration panel, each party shall submit 
their best and final position on each outstanding contract item 
within 30 days of the arbitration panel's selection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The arbitration panel shall notify both parties in writing of 
the location at which the final positions must be filed, 
including the precise date and time of the deadline for filing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Failure to submit a final position within 30 days shall be 
considered an abandonment of the process and the other party's 
final position shall be accepted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If both parties fail to submit within 30 days, the settlement 
shall then move to binding arbitration.  The arbitration panel 
may not divulge any details of either party's position to any 
party until a decision has been rendered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The arbitration panel shall consider each party's final position 
on all outstanding contract items as a single package, unless it 
is agreed upon by both parties to the dispute to deal with the 
outstanding items on either an individual basis or in specific 
groupings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, anything that has to do with wages, money and 
bonuses, overtime rates and so on could be dealt with in a group 
that was agreed to by both parties. Anything that had to deal 
with hours of work, vacations, holidays, lieu days could also be 
dealt with in a single group if agreed to by both parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the advantages of final offer arbitration is that it 
tends to move both parties fairly close together.  It does not 
guarantee that will happen but it does tend to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, if an appropriate increase were $1 per hour, if the 
employer were offering 75¢ and the employee group was asking for 
$4, they are going to end up with 25¢ less than they would 
reasonably be entitled to.  It would behove them to try to get 
close to but perhaps a little above. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Likewise, if they are asking for $1.25 when all the indicators 
are that they are only entitled to $1 and the employer offers no 
raise or perhaps a cut in pay, then they are going to get more 
than they are entitled to, and so should they under those 
circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the deliberation period of this arbitration panel when 
these two sides have submitted their best position, each party 
will be permitted one day not exceeding 7.5 hours to make 
personal presentations to the panel in order to justify their 
positions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each party will be provided with not less than five working days 
notice of the time, date and location of their personal 
presentation. 
This notice may be provided during the interim submission period.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The arbitration panel shall select the final position of the 
party whose position is most justifiable in accordance with 
guidelines set out for the arbitration panel within 30 days of 
the filing deadline. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The arbitration panel may not change or modify the position of 
either party. It is that mechanism that tends to ensure that both 
parties are reasonable or know that they are going to lose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If, in the opinion of the arbitration panel, both parties are so 
far removed from a justifiable position, the panel may provide 
both parties with notice to resubmit their final position.  Where 
this is done, each party will have 20 days to resubmit that new 
final position.  The arbitration panel shall again notify both 
parties in writing of the location at which the resubmission must 
be filed and a precise date and time of the deadline for filing. 
No information on details of the first submission may be released 
before the final settlement is announced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If either party fails to resubmit their offer within the 20 day 
period, their last filed position shall be used by the 
arbitration panel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The arbitration panel shall select the most justifiable position 
submitted within 20 days of the filing deadline for the 
resubmission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Within 30 days of the announcement of the successful submission, 
the arbitration panel shall submit a full report containing the 
final submission of both parties and a full point by point 
justification of the arbitration panel's choice of the submitted 
offers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the report is not unanimous, the dissenting panel member 
shall submit a minority report within the same timelines as the 
other panel members.  The minority report shall be appended to 
the majority report and shall form part of that report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report shall then be submitted to both parties and to the 
Minister of Public Works and Government Services. The minister 
shall table in the House of Commons within five sitting days of 
receiving it or, if the House is in an extended recess, the 
minister must forward copies to each opposition party within 14 
calendar days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The factors which must be considered by the arbitration panel. 
Before I read these, I would like to point out that I came to 
Ottawa as we were approaching the possibility of a strike, during 
the so-called break period.  I contacted both Canada Post 
Corporation and the Canadian Union of Postal Workers. I offered 
to meet with them to explain the process and what we proposed, to 
seek their input. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did meet with Canada Post Corporation.  I talked by telephone 
with a member of the Canadian Union of Postal Workers, but I did 
not receive any submission from them with regard to this.  That 
notwithstanding, I have tried to take into consideration the 
things that are fair to them as well as fair to Canada Post so 
that this becomes a balanced mechanism so that it can be deemed 
fair by both sides. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The factors which must be considered by the arbitration panel 
are: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the cost of living index since the last contract 
settlement. One of the basic arguments for an increase in wages, 
other factors aside, are changes in the cost of living. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the average public sector increase since their last 
contract. I intentionally used the public sector because although 
this is a crown corporation and not exactly a direct government 
service, the union itself has argued against the concept of 
privatization and does not want to be part of the private sector. 
Therefore, it is appropriate that we look at the wage increases 
in terms of what is taking place in the public sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, the impact on postal service. This gets more into special 
conditions and what impact they would have on the postal service, 
pro or con. The financial impact of the contract settlement.  No 
business of any kind, even a not for profit business can have a 
settlement where we do not at least look at what the impact of 
that settlement is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, will the settlement cause an increase in postal rates in 
excess of inflation since the last adjustment.  This is done not 
for CUPW or for Canada Post, but for the citizens of Canada. They 
have a right to expect reasonable rates and efficiency and it has 
to be a factor.

<A HREF="#LINKT10"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fifth, any changes in job descriptions.  If Canada Post has 
changed what it expects people to do, then it has to be reflected 
in the submission made by the union to say “we have changed what 
we do and therefore we are asking consideration that these rates 
change”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The final item is any public sector comparisons of any of the 
disputed items.  What is the norm out there?  If there is some 
condition of employment that either the union is asking for or 
the post office is asking for, then what is the norm in society? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the amendments we will be asking for.  If successful, 
we will also ask for an amendment to the Canada Post Act to 
ensure this becomes a permanent settlement mechanism so that 
Canadians who have just gone through the hardship of the fourth 
postal strike in 10 years will not in future have to reel under 
another one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the same context I would like to remind the Minister of 
Labour of his speech when he said that he had no regrets in 
allowing this strike to take place.  We all have regrets that 
this strike has taken place. It is the responsibility of this 
government to ensure we put in place a fair process so that this 
strike is Canada's last postal disruption. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK26"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, here we are 
discussing back to work legislation. This law will force some 45,000 
workers to return to their jobs at Canada Post. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would not have to deal with this if the government had calmly 
let contract negotiations unfold as they should have. Unfortunately, 
today, we have to consider a bill which is depriving 45,000 people of 
their fundamental rights, namely the right to negotiate their working 
conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our labour relations system is based essentially on this capacity 
that workers and management have to deal with each other, to strike a 
balance, to discuss and ensure that decisions are taken to improve work 
processes, that workers are satisfied with their work and that the 
employer also benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is how our system usually works. But that is not how it is 
going to be now at Canada Post. It will not be like that because the 
government has decided to intervene. I can tell you right now that it 
would be easy to engage in demagogy over this issue. Of course everyone 
wants to receive his or her mail at home. Everyone is really happy when 
letter carriers bring their mail to the door. Everybody considers this 
an essential service, a normal service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Companies will be telling us, and in fact, some have already done 
so, how much money they are losing with this postal strike. There is no 
doubt about that and there are obviously hardships for business, for 
charitable organizations, and also for citizens. But it cannot be 
otherwise. This is a strike, this is an action by a group of workers 
that provides them with the means to exert pressure on their employer, 
Canada Post, and also on the government, because it is deeply involved 
in these negotiations. We should normally be letting these workers 
exercise their rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course if this action did not bother anyone, it would be nice 
for the public, but it would not give the workers much leverage. 
By definition, a strike hurts. This has been accepted for a long time in 
our society, and if we do not give this tool to the workers, if we do 
not let them express themselves as a group, if we do not allow them to 
negotiate their working conditions, we distort the rules and create 
problems for ourselves. Today the government has decided with this back 
to work legislation to create all these problems for itself.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What exactly is the situation with respect to the negotiations 
that have taken place?  For several months now, the minister 
responsible for Canada Post and the Minister of Labour have been 
questioned in this House.  We have even questioned the Prime 
Minister. What we have been asking is: What is going on with Canada 
Post?  Is the government going to give negotiation a chance?  Every 
time, the Prime Minister, or the Minister of Labour who got up ever 
so calmly and told us, about 50 times, “Yes, yes, just leave the 
process alone, let things work themselves out.  They are talking, 
everything is going fine.  We hope it will be settled”.  The 
minister responsible for Canada Post has been saying the same 
thing.  Right up to the Prime Minister who told us “Let those 
people negotiate.  They are capable of negotiating their working 
conditions.  We hope it will be settled”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But how can it be that we now find ourselves in the situation 
we are in today, with such a seemingly well-intentioned government? 
How can it be that today they are using a special bill to take away 
workers' right to strike?  Very simple: they have not played fair. 
Right from the start, as far back as August, the minister 
responsible for Canada Post has not played fair with negotiations. 
I am accusing the minister responsible for Canada Post of having 
acted in such a way as to deprive the 45,000 employees of Canada 
Post of their ability to deal with the employer.  They have lost 
their power to negotiate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister was so cool when he met with representatives of 
the Canadian Direct Marketing Association.  He felt as comfortable 
with them as with his buddies.  He told them “Don't worry about a 
mail strike. First of all, they will negotiate a bit, then they'll 
go out on strike because they won't get anything.  They will 
definitely go out on strike.  They will look bad as a result of 
that. 
Then, within a few days, after being on strike for seven or eight 
days, there will be so much public pressure that the government 
will be justified in passing special legislation.  I promise you 
that not only will there be a strike, but it will be a short one, 
and the government will intervene with special legislation”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On August 6, it was the minister responsible for Canada Post who 
took away the postal workers' right to strike. Today, that same 
minister is trying to pass himself off as an angel of mercy, the 
saviour of society, the saviour of Canada Post.  The big bad 
posties will be forced back to work.  This is the person whom I 
accuse of depriving workers of their right to strike. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This game the government is involved in is unacceptable.  The 
government has imposed conditions which leave union executives and 
workers feeling that they have had the wool pulled over their eyes, 
that they have been abandoned. 
What is more, the government not only changed the rules and 
maintained an artificial climate of negotiations, unacceptable 
things happened between the union and management negotiators. 
Ground was lost.  There was, however, evidence of good faith on the 
part of the unionized employees.  Moves were made, but the employer 
remained intransigent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it gave in a little on points that hinted at progress, 
what happened?  There was an altercation between the union and 
management negotiators.  The government, the Canada Post 
Corporation has changed.  I mistakenly said government rather than 
corporation, but everyone understands that it is six of one, half 
a dozen of the other.  The government is distinguishable from 
Canada Post, but we know how close they are.  The government has 
friends at the post office.  Former colleagues work there. 
It is all related.  These people are in touch every day.  Do you 
think the government was not aware of the corporation's strategy? 
Come on.  They are one and the same.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>So the government, or its representative, Canada Post, changed 
negotiators and that is when things started to slip backward.  The 
few advances made in the negotiations were lost.  Things fell back 
to their original inflexibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could go on at length about the demands, but, in the end, 
the employees want to keep their jobs.  Can we blame them?  They 
want to negotiate some salary increases after years of salary 
freeze, like everyone else, after the difficult situations they 
have experienced.  We cannot blame them for wanting to improve 
their working conditions.  It is normal, human and proper.  We do 
not have to take sides in the debate in order to understand that 
these people are behaving well under the circumstances. 
They exercised their right to strike to preserve a number of jobs. Yes, 
postal workers are concerned. Yes, they have been and are still hard hit 
by technological changes on a daily basis. Yes, they have experienced 
many job losses in the past and the government has announced another 
4,000 layoffs this time around. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, they want to defend themselves. Of course, they want 
to do some damage control. Can anyone listening to us blame 
postal workers for fighting with all their might for their jobs, 
their job security, their wages and their working conditions? Of 
course not. We can however blame the government for showing so 
little compassion and open-mindedness and acting this way when it 
is responsible for tilting the balance in the negotiation 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The saddest thing of it all is that, if we were looking for someone 
to blame, the person who messed everything up, we would have to point a 
finger at the minister responsible for the Canada Post Corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only is the government forcing these people back to work, but 
it is doing so with an extremely tough piece of legislation. 
Fortunately, negotiations are ongoing between the opposition and the 
government to ensure that this bill can be passed today without what I 
might call overzealousness. These discussions will soften the bill 
somewhat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to report that, at least one of the sections of the 
bill that poses a major problem, the one dealing with the context 
in which the mediation-arbitration process is to be conducted, 
will be changed. We have the assurance that the government will 
agree to change the whole context set in section 9, which 
basically states that the mediator-arbitrator will be required to 
perform his duties in a context where the Canada Post Corporation 
is expected to meet the criteria applicable to private 
enterprise, where the word competitiveness is used and reference 
is made, although not explicitly, to potential privatization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The context in which the mediator-arbitrator is expected to perform 
his duties makes no sense. It is important to understand that the Canada 
Post Corporation is a public service. The corporation must be efficient. 
Yes, performance requirements are necessary. Yes, Canada Post must be as 
competitive as possible. Yes, the level of service provided must not 
only compare with but exceed that provided by the private sector. 
But this has to be done in the context of a government service, a public 
service, not in the context of a corporation that some would want to 
privatize as quickly as possible to make even more money, without regard 
for services provided to the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, we have the assurance that, through its work, the opposition—namely 
the Bloc Quebecois and the New Democratic Party—will have 
obtained a softening of the arbitration rules by the government. Now, 
the arbitrator, whose hands were tied by the government even before he 
was appointed—even before he started his job—will at least have 
some flexibility. He will have some leeway, which means that workers may 
get an opportunity to be heard and their representations might influence 
the decision of the arbitrator who will be appointed.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We got this assurance and we are proud of that. The required 
amendments will be tabled during consideration in committee of the whole 
by an NDP member, but we are certain that they will be accepted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will also table other amendments. Bloc members will ask the 
government to make sure union members are consulted regarding the 
appointment of the mediator-arbitrator—after all, it is bad enough to 
force Canada Post employees to go back to work. If there is a 
possibility of an agreement, why would the government refuse to consult 
union members to appoint someone who may be able to enlist everyone's 
support, since that person would be entirely above suspicion and 
respected by all sides? 
We will be suggesting changes along these lines and we will see how 
they are received by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the question of salaries.  Not only is the 
government forcing postal workers back to work, but it is giving 
them less than the last offer.  The last salary offer was pushed 
back, resulting in losses for workers.  Unless it was out of some 
sort of revenge, why would the government not give these people 
everything that was negotiated in good faith, the best deal 
possible so that there is some benefit for them? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will also be moving amendments with respect to the 
obligation that the costs of the mediator-arbitrator be evenly 
split between the parties.  The government must be asked to show 
some open-mindedness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If, despite the mistakes it is making in this issue, the 
government were to agree during this working day to take some steps 
in the right direction—and I appeal to the common sense of those 
who sincerely do not want the situation at Canada Post to 
deteriorate—if the government were to agree humanely and in an 
open-minded manner, with the feeling that they have to make up for 
the gaffe of the minister responsible, they must be aware of it, if 
they were to agree to move, to make some accommodation, I have 
absolutely no doubt that Canada Post employees would return to 
work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, it would be with the feeling that they had in a sense 
been deceived by the government, but at least with the feeling that 
lawmakers on the government side, who are not necessarily party to 
the government strategy, those elected to represent the people, 
also represented them in this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And without driving Canada Post into bankruptcy, without 
forcing anyone to shut down, without ignoring the need to be 
competitive, to provide good service, to rationalize, to do all 
these things, the legislator would at least have been sensitive to 
those who, for 12 days now, have been outside and who are quite 
properly calling for better working conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I will say that the Bloc Quebecois is against this 
bill.  We are not about to take away workers' rights when we know 
full well that they have been backed into a corner by the minister 
responsible for Canada Post.  The government simply has to 
understand that the opposition is going to do the responsible thing 
and move amendments to the bill that are designed to improve 
matters, to make up for this government's blunders.

<P><A NAME="LINK27"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
customary to say that you are happy to rise to speak on a certain 
subject or a certain bill.  I cannot say that today.  I am not 
happy to be here speaking on this particular piece of 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not one of the things that I came to Ottawa to do, to vote 
in favour of working against workers rights.  We certainly have 
no intention of doing so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to open by saying how critical the NDP is of this back to 
work legislation.  We believe it is heavy handed.  It is 
unnecessary.  It is an unfortunate intervention into the free 
bargaining process.  Ultimately it will only serve to draw out 
the hostile labour-management relations that exist at Canada Post 
and to condemn the Canadian public to this kind of problem over 
and over again because in actual fact none of the root causes of 
the hostility will be dealt with through the most civilized way 
of dealing with them which is free collective bargaining. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That avenue of recourse has been taken away by this legislation 
that we are dealing with today.  Even if service is resumed, even 
if the postal workers go back to work and deliver mail, nothing 
really is going to be resolved and again we may be back here in 
three or four years having the same kind of debate and the same 
kind of argument. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we should be looking for is a lasting resolution.  The only 
hope for that kind of lasting resolution is by the parties 
sitting down in good faith and being allowed to bargain without 
interference.  That is the key.  All along in this round of 
bargaining we have been seeing one type of interference or 
another. From day one we can trace this history right back to 
when notice to commence bargaining was first served.  The 
interference at that point was failing to come to the bargaining 
table in a reasonable amount of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no reason to be bargaining six months after the 
expiration of the collective agreement.  That kind of bargaining 
should be done early in the year so that they can conclude a new 
collective agreement before the expiration of the old one.  Work 
goes ahead, there is no work stoppage, the public is happy and 
workers are happy. That should be the goal and the objective. 
That did not happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Early in the negotiations, and we have heard other speakers make 
mention of this, we had the type of interference that is even 
more devastating which is that the spectre of back to work 
legislation was raised as early as, I believe, August 8. We heard 
the story from the hon. member, the House leader for the Bloc 
Quebecois, about the Canadian Direct Marketing Association 
informing its membership of a conversation it had with the 
minister responsible who guaranteed at that time don't worry 
about the delivery of your mail. Even if the negotiations grind 
down a bit, we'll have them legislated back to work in no time. 
It will be a very short interruption and within seven or eight 
days service will be resumed. I believe that is what he said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can we expect the two parties to sit at the bargaining table 
and be able to negotiate in any meaningful way when one party 
knows full well it has this heavy handed, unfair competitive 
advantage that it can pull out of its briefcase at any time, slap 
on the table and get virtually everything it wants?  It is not a 
recipe for any kind of lasting solution. The kind of hostility 
that already existed before bargaining started was only 
compounded and escalated and resulted in the ultimate problem 
which is a work stoppage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again I say that we are critical of the legislation and I am in 
fact saddened to be standing here having this argument.  We 
should be very cautious as the House of Commons and as 
legislators to never enter into any kind of legislation lightly 
which will limit or forfeit individual rights.  That is the 
beginning.  It is the thin edge of the wedge.  It is the 
beginning of a slippery slope and it gets to be too easy and too 
comfortable to use that kind of a cop-out to solve complicated 
social problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mussolini made the trains run on time.  That is all very well 
and good, but is that the kind of direction we want to go in as a 
country?  I would argue it is not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should never enter into lightly anything that would limit 
workers' rights to use the only weapon they really have in a 
meaningful way—perhaps weapon is the wrong word—the only tool 
they have to use, which is to withhold their services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We might think that a strike is a violent thing or a disruptive 
thing.  That is not necessarily so. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1120"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT15"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The very action of withholding one's services is a very peaceful 
and passive thing to do in an effort to settle an impasse of any 
type, just as negotiation is the most civilized way to try to 
resolve any impasse.  When those negotiations break down, the 
next civilized thing to do in a situation like that is withhold 
one's services.  It is a right that workers have been given under 
international conventions with the United Nations and the ILO 
because the world recognizes that this is one thing we have to 
have in order to remedy the historic imbalance that exists 
between employers and employees.  There is an imbalance of power 
there that is clearly recognized and in order to level that 
playing field, workers need to be given that right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore as the House of Commons and as colleagues and 
legislators in this House, I really need to caution us to please 
keep in mind that we cannot let this kind of thing be a quick fix 
habit any time there is a dispute in the public sector or within 
the parameters of our influence, that we reach out for this heavy 
handed type of legislation that is a step backward for workers 
rights, human rights and individual rights.  It puts us on that 
slippery slope to where we are not putting rights as our 
paramount and primary priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To understand some of the problems that we are going through 
today and to understand why we are here, we should have some 
background into the bargaining that led us into this mess.  The 
outstanding issues are simple and both are mentioned in the 
legislation that has been tabled by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real issues of substance here are a shift in policy on the 
part of the corporation and the government to where excess 
revenues generated by Canada Post could be used for other 
purposes such as in general revenues, to pay down the deficit, et 
cetera.  This has added a complication to the already complex 
bargaining relationship that has caused the problem we are having 
today and has resulted in this work stoppage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has put undue pressure on Canada Post to yield 
these revenues and generate these excess revenues when in actual 
fact the mandate of Canada Post is to provide good quality 
service and to produce revenues to the degree that it can pay for 
its operating costs, capital investments and updating its 
physical plant.  However, it was certainly never contemplated to 
be a cash cow milked by the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada Post Corporation is faced with this obligation to 
produce fixed amounts of revenue per year.  It has already done 
all it could to increase productivity in the last seven or eight 
years.  Even the former minister responsible for the post office, 
David Dingwall, commented that it had improved productivity by 
63% in the years between 1982 and 1994.  So it has done all it 
could in that respect.  There has been an enormous increase in 
productivity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, it had reduced its staff by 25%.  I do not 
know how much more lean and mean, from a corporate point of view, 
one can get other than boosting one's productivity by 60% and 
reducing staff by 25%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, even after all those gains, increasing and tightening of 
the belt or whatever the corporate terminology is, right sizing, 
there is this added pressure to come up with hundreds of millions 
of dollars more, not to add to the service provided by Canada 
Post but to add to the coffers of the Government of Canada.  That 
is the pressure that Canada Post found itself under when it went 
to the bargaining table.  The only way it could realize that kind 
of additional revenue was to dramatically change the rules of 
work and alter the workforce. It would have to harvest that 
revenue out of the existing workforce because it is not going to 
be able to do it out of increased marketing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Naturally the union is then faced with the prospect, a looming 
spectre, of 4,000 job losses.  It would be irresponsible on its 
part not to react in a vigorous way to oppose that kind of a job 
loss on behalf of the people it represents.  Therein lies the 
impasse.  It is really quite simple and easy to trace back. It 
would have been easy to fix at any time in the last six months of 
bargaining or at any time during the confines of this particular 
strike. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1125"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT17"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT17"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1125

<A HREF="#LINKT16"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would have been quite simple for the Government of Canada to 
tell Canada Post we are going to lighten up on this revenue 
thing. We want you to generate revenues sufficient to pay for 
operating costs and we are not too concerned about paying down 
the deficit using the revenues from Canada Post because it goes 
against the original mandate of Canada Post, against the Canada 
Post Corporations Act and against the mandate review that took 
place a recently as last year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to point out a quote from that mandate review.  In 
the report from the Canada Post mandate review, George Radwanski 
recommended that Canada post be mandated to operate on a break 
even basis.  He even said that it made no sense for Canada post 
to pay dividends to the federal government.  He quite 
specifically referred to this a year ago.  He said that such a 
requirement to pay dividends would result in postal rates that 
are higher than necessary, or it would result in fewer resources 
available to allocate for the necessary expansion of service 
considering that only 82% of Canadian households get direct mail 
delivery.  There is a need for expansion of services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last thing I will read from the report is the actual 
recommendation.  This is a quote from the report, recommendation 
No. 16: “That Canada Post Corporation be mandated to operate on 
a break even basis rather than pursue a commercial rate of return 
on equity, and that this break even basis be defined as 
generating sufficient revenue to cover operating costs to 
appropriate capital investments, expansions and improvements of 
core postal services, and the setting aside of such financial 
reserves to protect against revenue shortfalls and difficult 
years”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That makes quite clear the intent and recommendation of this 
group of experts that reviewed the mandate of Canada Post. It 
clearly contemplated where excess revenues or where any revenues 
generated by Canada Post should be put. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am getting at is that we have a manufactured crisis here 
that was a tempest in a teapot, brought to a head by pressure 
brought by the federal government on Canada Post, which 
translated at the bargaining table into a demand essentially to 
change the work rules that would result in the loss of 4,000 
jobs.   No trade unionist worth their salt would have sat there 
and accepted that kind of an argument because it was so easy to 
trace back through recent history the mandate review, the Canada 
Post Corporations Act and anything else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By way of background that is a bit of the history that got us to 
this terrible impasse; first the labour relations climate that 
has been hostile for a number of years, then the increased demand 
for revenue translating into problems at the bargaining table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A solution to put the Canada postal service back to work and to 
provide service to Canadians and the small business people et 
cetera who are anxiously awaiting some kind of leadership from 
this House of Commons is the piece of legislation tabled 
yesterday.  In retrospect, having had the luxury of time to 
review this and having come from a labour relations background 
where I have seen similar back to work documents, two clauses and 
two articles in the legislation leap out at me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Previous speakers have correctly identified the key problem 
areas and we too will be presenting amendments to this 
legislation with the optimism that other members in the House 
will see the benefit in our arguments and put in place back to 
work legislation that is at least in keeping with the national 
standards of other back to work legislation and which does not go 
beyond the normal goals and objectives to get workers back into 
their jobs.  That takes a bit of explanation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to start with article 9 of the proposed 
legislation, the terms of reference and the guiding principles 
that are set down for the mediator-arbitrator, really the things 
the arbitrator must take into consideration when making his or 
her rulings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The way this clause is worded reads like a Christmas wish list 
for Canada Post. Within the parameters of this particular article 
lie virtually every hot and contentious proposition throughout 
the round of bargaining rolled up into one package and thrown 
into an article and snuck in the back door through the back to 
work legislation. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1130"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT17"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Normally back to work legislation, as I say, deals with getting 
workers back to work.  It does not deal with making substantial 
changes to the way Canada Post conducts its business from now on 
and forever after. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what this clause would give licence to do.  That is why 
it is offensive to us.  We feel it is absolutely necessary that 
this clause be changed to put some element of fairness back into 
the whole round of bargaining and to the possible conclusion of 
the work stoppage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to read part of this clause that most offends 
members of our caucus.  It says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mediator-arbitrator shall be guided by the need for terms and 
conditions of employment that are consistent with those in 
comparable industries in the private and public sectors and that 
will provide the necessary degree of flexibility to ensure the 
short and long term economic viability and competitiveness of the 
Canada Post Corporation, taking into account 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(a) that Canada Post Corporation must—perform financially in a 
commercially acceptable range, 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>None of this is from the Canada Post Corporation Act.  None of 
this can be found in the mandate review.  None of this has been 
agreed to.  Our argument is that if the Liberal government plans 
to make these substantial changes to the way Canada Post conducts 
itself, it should do it through the front door with amendments to 
the Canada Post Corporation Act and not try to slide it in under 
the table with a piece of legislation that is supposed to restore 
postal service to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will certainly have an amendment to present under that 
article to change it to restore some semblance of fairness to the 
whole issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another clause that obviously leaps out is that this piece of 
legislation dictates the wage increase the workers going back to 
work will receive.  This goes well beyond what we would like to 
see in any kind of back to work legislation in that it takes the 
monetary package out of the hands of the arbitrator. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The arbitrator will no longer be able to consider what is fair 
or what is not fair.  The arbitrator will not be able to look at 
the arguments that were made during the negotiations or take into 
consideration the employer's ability to pay or the market share 
or prevailing cost of living increases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>None of these issues will be there on the table for the 
arbitrator to look at because the increases will be predetermined 
within the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are critical of the whole concept of having wages set by 
legislation because frankly MPs in the House are not qualified to 
vote on this issue.  We were not privy to the debate.  We do not 
have access to the books.  We do not know the bargaining history. 
Why should we be voting on something as specific as a 1.9% 
increase in the year 2000? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not suitable to be dealt with in the House because with 
all due respect nobody here has that kind of background.  The 
people at the bargaining table do and the arbitrator will.  It 
should be up to the arbitrator to make that ruling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Secondary to our criticisms of article 12, above and beyond the 
whole premise that it should not be there, is the fact that the 
wage offer made is actually lower than the last offer on the 
table from Canada Post Corporation to the union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not know, as the House leader of the Bloc Quebecois 
indicated, whether that is out of malice, whether they are trying 
to rub somebody's nose into it, whether it is just an oversight, 
or whether it is strictly financially driven.  It is such an 
insignificant amount that it leads me to believe that there is 
more here than just financial purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me say what the difference is.  The last offer made by 
Canada Post Corporation was 1.5% in year one, 1.75% in year two 
and 2% in year three.  The mandated settlement here is identical 
except that in year three it is 1.9% instead of 2%.  We are 
talking one-tenth of one per cent just as a significant sort of 
gesture.  We are going to kick them while they are down.  We are 
sending them back to work.  We are taking away their right to 
strike.  We are taking away any opportunity for them to have any 
input into what their wage settlement will be.  By the way, we 
will take a little away from them too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another more costly significant change in here.  They 
are delaying the imposition of the increases by six months.

retroactive to the date of the expiry of the collective 
agreement, this current legislated package states that the 
agreement will start on February 1, 1998, a difference we have 
calculated to be a saving of $35 million out of workers' pockets 
over the course of the three year life of the agreement.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
have a couple of comments to make and a question for the member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I found it interesting that the member reviewed some of the 
history of Canada Post and its productivity gains.  This is very 
important.  It is also very important that the government gave 
the bargaining process a chance to operate.  The Minister of 
Labour should be congratulated for the patience he extended to 
all parties to ensure the process had an opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I listened to the member it resonated within me that what 
happened in the past is one issue, but the consequences of what 
has gone on so far are equally important particularly as they 
relate to the future of Canada Post. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Radwanski report certainly made a number of interesting 
recommendations, but all members will know that Canada Post has 
lost substantial business to its competitors.  Many businesses 
have now started to rely on private courier services and others. 
They have entered into long term contractual arrangements which 
will hurt Canada Post.  This will exacerbate the situation it has 
been dealing with in terms of trying to modernize Canada Post. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians know that businesses are losing $200 million a day as 
a result of the strike.  Canadians and members will know that 
charities are losing tens of millions of dollars in donations 
because this is the period of the year in which they do most of 
their donation collections. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of whether or not Canada Post should be an essential 
service does not necessarily mean there will be labour peace, but 
we know Canadians will be raising these questions again.  It is 
extremely important that we stop worrying about what happened in 
the past and start recognizing the issues of today.  The real 
issues today are that Canada Post will be put under more and more 
pressure to provide a cost effective service for all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member says that the legislation is offensive to the NDP. He 
should know the strike is offensive to Canadian businesses that 
are losing jobs and are cash strapped.  They cannot get the cash 
flow they need.  He should also know that the strike is offensive 
to Canadians who are waiting for communications throughout the 
Christmas season from their loved ones and families.  They do not 
want CUPW to be the Grinch who stole Christmas from them.  They 
want their Christmas.  The member knows that this situation is 
also offensive to charities. I do not think like the NDP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member indicated that he has some experience in labour 
relations.  The minister indicated that the settlement, including 
the prescribed increases up to February 2000, is in line with 
current settlements within the public sector in terms of rates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation lays out the parameters which are consistent 
with other public sector settlements at this time.  Could the 
member explain why he feels it is inappropriate for the bill to 
establish the parameters of a three year contract? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will answer the member's 
question first and then comment on some of his comments second.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A three year agreement should not be found in this legislation. 
We should not be voting on that aspect because the two parties 
have already agreed to a two year agreement.  The wage rates of 
1.5%, 1.75% and 1.9% should not be dealt with in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I outlined, we do not have the background information.  All 
our information is anecdotal, driven by a motion.  Now that we 
are into a strike there is no real comparable workplace we can 
use as a touchstone or to draw a comparison because Canada Post 
is unique. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should take into account profitability or the employer's 
ability to pay.  We have to keep in mind that Canada Post made 
$112 million last year.  Granted in recent years it has had poor 
years but it has tried to correct that by increasing its market 
share.  Granted it lost some in some areas and gained in others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada Post contemplates market growth of between $500 million 
and $800 million in coming years.   It is actively marketing and 
trying to make up for the share of the market it has lost through 
the advent of technological change and various other things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not change my argument that the House is not qualified 
to make this type of ruling in any kind of a fair way.  We can do 
it.  We are really looking for a lasting resolve and a lasting 
resolve will not come from a legislative settlement because all 
the hostility, the pent up hostility and bad relations will still 
be there.  None of it will have been worked through in any kind 
of mature or sensible way at the bargaining table as we hoped 
would be possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other interests are disadvantaged by the strike such as the 
Canadian public, charities and small business people.  We are 
sensitive and sympathetic to that but the fix was there. There 
was an easy solution early on in the strike.  There was an easy 
solution before the strike even started.  Those were the policies 
of the Liberal government which were trying—and I used the words 
in my speech; maybe they are a bit strong—to milk the cash cow 
of Canada Post by demanding revenues above and beyond the 
revenues necessary for operating costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government could have solved it or nipped it in the bud even 
before we had a strike by backing off on at least some of the 
demands for profit, and we would not be in the crisis we are in 
now. As I said it is manufactured crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that answers some of the member's questions. 
<P><A NAME="LINK29"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Gouk (West Kootenay—Okanagan, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would like ask a question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member said that the bill was unnecessary.  Basically 
that means leaving the workers on strike in order to settle.  I 
point out to him that in one of the strikes in which they were 
ultimately legislated back went on for six weeks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been $3 billion worth of damage to the business 
economy in less than two weeks.  Is he suggesting that we should 
allow the strike to go on for six weeks or even longer?  The six 
week one was settled with back to work legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have another question.  I am having a little trouble 
understanding the position of the NDP in this regard.  It says it 
is totally opposed to the legislation.  Yet it allowed the bill 
to be fast tracked without opposition.  It also agreed to what 
amounts to time allocation on the bill.  It did not oppose that 
either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the hon. member could explain briefly why he says on the 
one hand that members of the NDP will fight the legislation and 
on the other hand they agree to expeditiously handling it in the 
House? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, in answer to the first 
question, we have to deal with every type of labour impasse on 
its own merits.  There is no saying that they were out for six 
weeks last time so we have to nip it in the bud before it goes on 
that long this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That does not wash.  That really does not add up.  Every set of 
circumstances is unique, especially this year when we are dealing 
with a set of circumstances the two parties have never had to 
wrestle with in their history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In actual fact when I say we should leave them at the bargaining 
table, it was with the optimism that there would be a lasting 
settlement. 
My own experience in labour relations is that until those 
longstanding wounds actually start healing, you will be doomed to 
repeat this process year after year after year.

<A HREF="#LINKT20"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not saying that we should have allowed them to strike for 
six weeks or six months or anything else.  I am saying that we 
should have let collective bargaining, without political 
interference, take its course and play itself out.  Then maybe we 
could go for a decade without a serious labour impasse instead of 
the interruptions we are seeing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member asked why we allowed the motion yesterday to receive 
unanimous consent.  I would point out that his party did the same 
thing.  We did that because there are a whole bunch of interests 
at stake.  Reform members, Liberal members and Bloc members have 
all mentioned that the Canadian public wants its postal service 
back.  Canadian business is suffering. Canadian charities are 
going through their main fund-raising period and they need it 
back.  However, there are 45,000 postal workers whose interests 
also have to be recognized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation was being brought down.  By the end of the week 
it would have been done.  We used every political advantage we 
could to make the settlement as fair as possible and that was the 
conclusion we came to. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK30"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique—Mactaquac, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to rise today on the debate on Bill C-24, the postal services 
continuation act, 1997, better known as the back to work bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to talk about the strike that has been going on for 
two weeks at Canada Post, about how it is part of a long series of 
labour conflicts at Canada Post and about how the present government, 
far from bringing in a solution, has made the problem worse because of 
its neglect. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First and most important, I want to show how this work stoppage 
has hurt Canadians, Canadian businesses and Canadian charities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, I will illustrate how a failure of leadership on this 
dossier is part of a pattern of this government which is failing 
to serve Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, I want to contrast the government's lack of effectiveness 
on this issue with how an earlier Conservative government dealt 
competently with a similar situation back in 1991. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I want to discuss what the future holds for Canada Post 
and the real need for leadership by the government in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There can be no doubt by anyone who has read a newspaper, 
listened to the radio or watched television in the last dozen or 
so days that this postal strike has hurt not just Canada Post but 
most of the 93% of Canadians who still use the post office as an 
important means of communication. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those who work in mail sensitive industries and who have 
either lost business or their jobs, the effect has been 
devastating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last Wednesday the Canadian Federation of Independent Business 
released a survey of its membership which showed that 96% of 
small and medium size businesses were adversely affected by the 
interruption of the postal service.  Using conservative 
assumptions, the CFIB estimated that business losses are 
totalling more than $200 million per day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do these numbers mean?  For Greg Dickie of Delong Farms in 
Truro, Nova Scotia they meant that he had to close his mail order 
Christmas wreath and gift business and lay off 100 people this 
season.  For Robert Van Velzen of S.S.A. Incorporated in Markham, 
Ontario they meant that he lost a half-million dollar U.S. mail 
sorting contract and had to put a dozen people permanently out of 
work.  Columbia House, which ships contact discs and videos 
across the country, had to lay off 200 people last week. 
Télémedia Publishing is losing hundreds of thousands of dollars a 
week. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The owners of Golfinn International, a company that distributes 
golfing equipment and accessories, Dave and Jane Finn, who make 60% of 
their sales at this time of the year, had to lay off 17 of their 
employees. A Saskatoon weekly, the <I>Western Producer</I>, which is 
distributed mostly by mail, did not publish last week and lost $250,000. 
According to Terry Robinson, of Sir Mail Order Sporting Goods Ltd., his 
company is losing $25,000 a day because of the strike.

<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Overall, the CFIB survey showed that almost 80% of small 
businesses are using faxes or higher cost couriers.  About 
two-thirds are making their own deliveries or pickups.  Half have 
had their cash flow interrupted and one in ten have lost orders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Direct Marketing Association estimates that layoffs 
in their industries are in the thousands.  The CDMA includes many 
charities which estimate donations by mail have dropped $10 
million per day.  For example, the Welcome Home Mission of 
Montreal which provides food and shelter for 3,100 families each 
year receives 40% of its annual revenue by mail in the month of 
December.  Their executive director wrote to us just before the 
strike began and said “I can attest that a postal strike will 
have disastrous effects on our revenues which will result in 
fewer services for our clients”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He is not alone.  The United Way of Greater Toronto estimates 
that it is out $1 million from its direct mail campaign this 
year.  The Salvation Army reports that it too is hurting. Seventy 
per cent of its revenues come in the mail.  The Canadian Lung 
Association's Christmas Seal Campaign is the country's biggest 
holiday fund raiser.  Each Christmas it brings in $8 million in 
donations, representing 80% of the association's annual revenues. 
It is now in a state of near crisis.  Likewise UNICEF Canada 
sells almost four million Christmas cards a year which would 
normally yield $1.5 million for them in earnings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are these organizations supposed to do this Christmas? 
These groups help hundreds and thousands of Canadians in need 
each year.  Where was the Minister of Labour when they needed 
him? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most of all, Mr. Speaker, this strike has hurt Canadians badly. 
As already mentioned, thousands have been laid off work because 
the government failed to act early on when it could have 
prevented the strike.  For those most vulnerable in our society, 
those Canadians who depend on some form of government assistance 
for part or all of their income, this strike has been 
particularly difficult and the government has been particularly 
without compassion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On August 12 I wrote the minister responsible for Canada Post 
and urged him to examine all available options for the dispersal 
of government cheques in the event of a postal strike.  In 
response to this the minister signed an agreement with the 
Canadian Union of Postal Workers to allow for them to continue to 
deliver employment insurance, TAGS, CPP and other cheques in the 
event of a strike.  Unfortunately, for Canadians who depend on 
these cheques, the Department of Human Resources Development 
Canada decided not to honour this commitment and chose instead to 
implement its own cheque distribution system which at best can be 
called chaotic, at worst, cruel and without compassion to those 
who need assistance to provide the basic necessities of life for 
themselves and their loved ones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One man who has asked that I not use his name was unable to 
purchase insulin for his mother because his cheque was over a 
week late.  Another women who had to rush her son to the hospital 
late one night last week ran out of gas.  With no money for gas, 
she had to call on strangers for assistance to help get her son 
there.  Fortunately he is now okay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Normally this would be embarrassing enough for any government to 
take steps to treat its clients with a bit more respect, but not 
with this government.  To add insult to injury Canadians who 
drove in some cases hundreds of kilometres to the nearest cheque 
distribution centre on November 20 were asked to sign a computer 
printout that had the names, social insurance numbers and the 
cheque dollar amount of everyone in their community who was 
receiving an assistance cheque.  Acting on these complaints, my 
office was successful in asking the Privacy Commissioner to 
investigate and to put a stop to this Orwellian practice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does this government choose through its own neglect to allow 
this strike to cause so much damage to the Canadian economy, to 
businesses, to charities and most of all to the Canadian public? 
This is not an isolated incident but a pattern within this 
government that shows a leadership vacuum beginning at the top.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In the lead-up to the 1995 Quebec referendum on sovereignty, the 
Prime Minister was asked many times to speak on this issue and to 
make a gesture of unity with the people of Quebec.  He refused. 
It was not until the dying days of the campaign when the Prime 
Minister realized that all could be lost that he made some token 
offers to Quebec.  Were it not for the generosity and spirit and 
sincere love of this country shown by Canadians at the Montreal 
rally, were it not for the commitment of the leader of my party 
and his willingness to put everything on the line for this 
country, all would indeed have been lost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Kyoto conference on climate change opened yesterday with all 
of the major countries having made their position known months 
ago, all except Canada.  Our government waited until yesterday. 
Delegates from other countries and the organizers of this 
conference have remarked that Canada has lost its credibility on 
the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Five years ago our Conservative government led by my leader, who 
was then environment minister, showed Canada's ability to lead at 
the Rio Earth Summit because we were prepared. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993 on the advice of the defence department our Conservative 
government showed leadership and foresight by deciding to replace 
the aging Labrador and Sea King maritime helicopters with new 
EH-101 helicopters with made in Canada electronics and airframes. 
This helicopter purchase would have put Canada on the cutting 
edge of technology in this field with no additional burden to the 
taxpayers.  The Liberal government, however, cancelled this deal 
at exorbitant expense.  Now the old helicopters are five years 
older and Canadians are still waiting to hear what solution this 
government will have to replace them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everywhere we turn this government chooses procrastination over 
leadership, the same kind of failed policy that hurts so many 
Canadians in this postal strike. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The royal commission on aboriginal people submitted its report 
over a year ago.  What has been the government's response?  It 
has not finished reading it yet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the year 2000 problem?  What is the government's plan 
to overhaul its computers so that the system does not crash on 
January 1, 2000?  It does not have one yet.  It said “We'll 
write the cheques out by hand if necessary”.  That is what the 
public works minister said just three weeks ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there is fish.  It is not enough that the cod stocks are 
gone and this government could not negotiate lunch with the 
Americans, let alone a Pacific salmon treaty, but now the 
Atlantic groundfish strategy is about to run out of money and 
this government has absolutely no plan to deal with the thousands 
of fishers and fish plant workers who will be cut off next year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Leadership, that is what successful government is all about. But 
we have seen that the Liberal government is devoid of anything 
resembling real leadership, whether it be on fish, helicopters, 
the environment, aboriginal peoples, the future of our country or 
on Canada Post. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where can we look to for an example of real leadership?  In 
October 1991 there was a Progressive Conservative government in 
power faced with a labour situation not that different from that 
faced by the current government.  Back then Canada Post was 
negotiating to bring a number of unions each with their own 
collective agreements in with CUPW under one agreement.  A series 
of rotating strikes in August had urged the government to do 
whatever necessary to allow the two parties to come to successful 
negotiation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This took three steps.  First, a very effective and experienced 
mediator, Quebec Chief Justice Alan Gold, was brought in to help 
the parties negotiate mini-agreements in a number of sectors. 
Unfortunately, Canada Post and CUPW were unable to conclude a 
global agreement at that stage, even though they had worked out 
partial agreements in many areas with Justice Gold's help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Step two was to pass the Postal Services Continuation Act, 1991. 
With the end of mediation the two sides would soon be in a 
position to lock out or to strike and it was necessary for the 
government to prevent the damage to the Canadian economy that 
would result from a work stoppage just before Christmas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This law precluded either Canada Post or the union from 
inflicting harm on Canadians through the use of a strike or 
lock-out. 
It also recognized and formalized the agreements already reached 
by negotiators during six weeks of talks under mediator Alan 
Gold.  These included an immediate pay raise of $2.03 per hour 
for workers and a down payment on retroactive pay amounting to 
over $3,600 without having to wait for the arbitrator's decision.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third step was to provide the parties with an alternative 
dispute settlement mechanism.  The Postal Services Continuation 
Act did this with arbitration as is frequently used in the case 
of essential services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the Canadian public protected from a work stoppage, the 
gains negotiated by the union guaranteed in the new agreement 
with immediate financial compensation to the workers, and a way 
for the two sides to reach an agreement, CUPW and Canada Post 
were able to do just that in the new year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Postal Services Continuation Act is an example of true 
leadership on a difficult issue and should serve as a template to 
other governments.  However, when we contacted the labour 
minister's office on October 30 of this year, as soon as it 
became apparent that the collective bargaining process had 
failed, we were told not to worry, that things would work 
themselves out. The fact that they did not is a testament to the 
failure to provide leadership by this government and by this do 
nothing, say nothing, sleepwalk his way to retirement Prime 
Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately the problem does not end here.  Assuming that the 
government is able to pass this legislation, we still have a 
crown corporation and a union with a labour relations record that 
would make Jimmy Hoffa blush.  Since postal workers were given 
the right to strike in 1967, there have been no fewer than 11 
work disruptions.  This is symptomatic of a government owned 
company that is utterly adrift and has lost both its anchor and 
its rudder. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada has no plan of action for the future of 
Canada Post. The Liberals have not designed for this crown corporation 
a plan that takes into consideration the new choices that Canadians have 
for the delivery of mail, including messenger services, electronic mail, 
fax machines and direct deposits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has not defined any business strategy to ensure the 
continuation of Canada Post services for Canadians, it has not looked 
into the means available to develop new markets such as electronic data 
transfer and it has not decided once and for all whether or not it wants 
to privatize Canada Post. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Public Works was not straightforward on this issue 
during the strike; first he stated that there would be no privatization, 
then he threatened the union with the privatization of that crown 
corporation, and then he changed his mind and repeated that he would do 
no such thing. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that the Liberal government would allow a postal strike 
to occur shows that it has been sleepwalking through the last 
four years.  Now more than ever, Canadians need a plan for Canada 
Post. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On November 24 in this House the minister responsible stated 
that the government had taken the Canada Post mandate review 
report, answered the report and given a new mandate to Canada 
Post. The minister went on to say, “I am sure with the 
negotiated settlement that mandate can be achieved”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the minister will know, the mandate review contained 31 
recommendations about improving Canada Post.  The minister has 
yet to deal with those recommendations appropriately as the vast 
majority of them were ignored by this government. Given the 
current crisis that exists at the crown corporation, it is time 
for him to revisit those recommendations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report of the mandate review released in October 1996 and 
the subsequent report conducted by TD Securities and released in 
April 1997 both identified serious concerns about the labour 
situation at Canada Post. The government has known about the 
pending labour situation for some seven months yet the government 
failed to take constructive measures to correct that situation 
before Canadians became burdened with this postal strike. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that this crisis at Canada Post is mostly due to the 
chronic lack of leadership from the present government. The public has 
certainly complained to a large number of members here about the 
hardships that this useless strike is causing them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I already mentioned one of the measures used by the previous 
Conservative government to settle a serious labour conflict at Canada 
Post and how we could have completely avoided this break in services. 
You have heard the story about the continuing problems of a crown 
corporation that is receiving almost no direction from its shareholder. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality of course is that Canada Post is not actually owned 
by the government.  It belongs to the people of Canada. 
This government owes it to Canadians to get down to developing a 
practical, realistic and comprehensive postal policy for this 
country instead of the piecemeal approach it has taken so far.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Gouk (West Kootenay—Okanagan, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I pretty much agree with what the hon. member had to say 
on the subject of Canada Post.  However, I certainly do not want 
to give him carte blanche for everything he said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would very quickly point out that the previous Conservative 
government legislated an end to a postal disruption in 1987 and 
again in 1991. In both cases it recognized it was essential to 
keep the mail moving in this country.  It reacted by bringing in 
legislation. But obviously it did not solve the problem because 
here were are in 1997 with another postal strike and legislation 
to end it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member regret that his party did not bring in a 
permanent solution to this so that we would not have to keep 
going through this year after year after year? Does he also 
regret that the Liberal government has not done anything to bring 
about a permanent solution to this? Does he support Reform's 
position that we need a permanent solution to this labour 
disruption so that Canadians can once again count on their mail 
always going through? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Bernier:</B>   Madam Speaker, I agree with the hon. 
member from the Reform Party when he says that he agrees with 
most of what I had to say.  I would have been happier if he had 
agreed with all that I had to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To answer the questions, if we were the government we would go 
the extra step because we believe that Canada Post is an 
essential service. In 1967 or 1969 the United States passed 
legislation to make it against the law for postal workers to 
strike. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this postal strike now, right around Christmas, how many 
businesses are hurt, how many thousands of jobs are lost. Talk 
about the children of this country.  Santa Claus is a big thing 
for them. They are not even sure if they would be able to send 
mail to Santa Claus.  I may not believe in Santa Claus but there 
are a lot of kids in this country who do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I totally disagree with the government's route on this that it 
waited so long. The economy of the country has been almost 
crippled by this strike over the last week and a half. Canada 
Post is losing $20 million a day. I have been in business for 
some 15 years.  I do not know of any corporation or any business 
in this country that could sustain a $20 million loss per day. I 
do not know of one.  Yet we have a government that has kept 
sleepwalking through the whole process and waited to take action 
until this last week and a half. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the papers from last year, Canada Post claimed 
that it made $112 million in profits. After five days of this 
strike there goes its profits for this year. Who is going to pay 
the difference this year?  Canada Post is not going to make a 
profit. It is going to have a deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  The government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Bernier:</B>    Oh, now it is up to the government. 
The government is going to pick up the tab, but who is the 
government?  It is the Canadian people.  I say enough is enough. 
We are here to do a job.  Let us make sure that the money is well 
spent and put in the right place.  This morning I was glad to see 
that Canada Post would be legislated back to work because we just 
cannot afford to have the corporation lose $20 million a day.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst, NDP):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
would like to ask my colleague a question, but first I will say 
just a few words, mainly that the small businesses suffering 
because of this strike have my sympathies.  We must, however, 
remember that the Canadian charter gives all of us have the right 
to belong to a union.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has introduced legislation, which once again 
attacks working men and women, and I find this regrettable.  I 
would therefore like to know, in response to one of my questions, 
whether the Conservative Party would be prepared to propose 
amendments and to fight against what the government is in the 
process of doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not true that, if the government wants to pass 
legislation that is against the workers, forcing them back to work, 
they will be the only ones punished.  What has been brought before 
the House today is shameful. It is a backward step in the 
negotiations that have already taken place between the employer and 
the workers, and a backward step as far as wages are concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask a question of my colleague from the 
Conservative Party.  He says he does not want any more strikes at 
Canada Post.  Will he therefore confirm before the people of 
Canada, the workers of Canada, that he is against free bargaining 
for all postal workers?  Is that what my colleague is telling us? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the record, I want it noted that the Conservatives' 
position is one of opposition to postal workers having the same 
right as all other Canadians, that is the right to strike and the 
right to continue to strike until a negotiated settlement is 
reached. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What was their opinion around August 6 when the government 
interfered in the bargaining process and indicated to the employer 
that there would be no problem if there were a strike, because it 
was already thinking of bringing in back to work legislation?  This 
is not how collective bargaining is meant to work. 
In my experience of unions and collective bargaining, when a 
third party with a certain degree of power comes and sticks its 
nose in where it does not belong, I can guarantee that the outcome 
is not good negotiation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would therefore like to hear what my hon. colleague from the 
Conservative Party has to say to that. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Bernier:</B>  Madam Speaker, I appreciate the 
question from my colleague from New Brunswick for the NDP.  We 
are not against unions at all but we need to be responsible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The union at Canada Post represents 45,000 workers.  Canada Post 
has been losing millions and millions of dollars. Businesses have 
been losing millions of dollars.  Charities have been losing 
millions of dollars.  And what about the other 29 million 
Canadians who deserve to get their mail? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this country we have a law that police officers cannot 
strike.  We believe that Canada Post is an essential service the 
same as the police officers in Canada.  I am not against the 
union. I support the union in some cases but there has to be fair 
bargaining. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This strike has dragged on for the last week and a half.  How 
many more millions of dollars does the member want to inflict on 
Canadians and on Canada Post?  How far does it have to go for the 
member to recognize that they cannot reach an agreement? 
Something has to come out of this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my hon. colleague should understand, we are all here as 
members of Parliament to do a job and to represent Canadians. The 
next few words are very important:  the interests of all 
Canadians, not just the union, all Canadians. Until the hon. 
member can differentiate between a few thousand workers or all 
Canadians, I think the hon. member has a few problems in this 
House.

was listening very carefully to my colleague's remarks, 
particularly the remarks about an essential service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a little difficulty reconciling the fact that my 
colleague's party was in power from 1984 to 1993, for nine years. 
It had the opportunity to bring in the kind of legislation that 
would say Canada Post is an essential service and workers cannot 
go on strike. 
But now they stand in opposition and say exactly the opposite of 
what they said when they were in government.  I have a problem 
with that and I wonder if my hon. friend can reconcile the fact 
that he said one thing from 1984 to 1993 and a second thing now.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Bernier:</B>  Madam Speaker, I appreciate the 
question from my colleague on the other side of the House.  It 
goes for both sides.  Back in 1987 and 1991 we were in power.  We 
legislated them back to work even before there was a strike. 
There was no strike.  The member's own government voted for it. 
This included the prime minister, the finance minister, the 
labour minister, the minister of public works.  They were all on 
board.  What is the problem with the member's party today that it 
has allowed the strike to drag on for a week and a half?  Canada 
Post could lose $20 million a day, which is not marbles. 
<P><A NAME="LINK34"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jerry Pickard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
will be splitting my time with the member for Mississauga West. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at what this debate is about, at what this 
legislation is about and at what the negotiations up to this time 
have been about.  They are about who manages and controls the 
workplace. There is absolutely no question that the management 
and control of the workplace is ultimately very important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our government has set a mandate for the Canadian postal service 
that it is to be self-sufficient, that it is to operate by a most 
viable productive method to provide mail service to all Canadians 
at a reasonable cost.  When we get into discussions of the 
direction of government policy it is very important to realize 
that this government has told Canada Post there will be no 
increases this year and next year.  That is clearly the mandate 
of this government. We have a direction in which to go to provide 
no increase, positive services and increased service where 
possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us examine the other side of the question.   The union has 
its national postal workers handbook which contains its national 
constitution.  I will put this statement on the record because it 
is very critical in the explanation of why the negotiations have 
broken down: “The Union views as a primary direction the 
accomplishment of workers control of the workplace. This 
principle ensures that the union and its members will seek at all 
junctures to limit the power of the employer to organise our jobs 
and the methods of production and planning of the work.  In its 
place, the union will seek for its members full control of the 
work they perform and the environment in which they perform the 
work”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we think about that statement, the union has said that Canada 
Post will no longer control Canada Post, the union will.  The 
union is saying that it will not accept any control over jobs or 
any control over the directions it takes.  It will control the 
workplace and everything its members do.  Canada Post cannot 
manage its workplace nor penalize its workers for not performing 
their jobs.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We tried very hard to get negotiations through.  We tried 
mediation and conciliation.  We tried to provide room between the 
union and Canada Post to resolve the problem.  But where the 
attitude is and written in the national constitution that Canada 
Post is not to control Canada Post any longer, then legislation 
had to be brought in.  We had to look very carefully at what was 
happening within the jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is now time to get back to work.  Many Canadians are hurting 
because of the postal strike.  The strike is hurting charities 
which count on most of their support at Christmas.  The strike is 
hurting thousands of small businesses which very much depend on 
the mail service.  The strike is hurting hundreds of mail order 
businesses which, in most parts of this country, receive a 
majority of their business in the month leading up to Christmas. 
The strike is hurting people who are employed in businesses which 
are now facing layoffs. In short, the strike is hurting many 
different Canadians in all areas of the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to talk about the terrible impact this strike is 
having on charities.  These organizations serve the most 
vulnerable members of our society and depend on the generosity of 
Canadians during the holiday season for the majority of their 
funds.  These organizations do most of their fund-raising through 
the mail.  That is the most affordable and convenient way of 
receiving funds and donations to help Canadians.  Charities have 
been vastly affected by the uncertainty of the last while. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to give the House some examples of what the postal 
strike means to some of the charities in our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The co-ordinator of the Christmas Seals program in Alberta, 
Audrey Hamm, said that the Alberta Lung Association depends on 
Canada Post to deliver 95% of its donations.  Ms. Hamm added that 
a lengthy postal strike would probably mean a reduction in its 
revenues by some 50%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nicole Mirault of the Canadian Cancer Society said: “We risk a 
catastrophe.  In Quebec alone millions of dollars come through 
the mail each year.  We don't have the means to use couriers. We 
rely on direct mail service. Therefore we would be grossly 
negatively affected”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Inter-faith Food Bank in Calgary hoped to raise around 
$100,000 through mail donations this season, but people are not 
sending in Christmas donations because of the uncertainty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result these organizations, be they UNICEF or the lung 
association, are suffering a great deal because they do not have 
the funds coming in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even those organizations which managed to get their appeals in 
the mail before the strike are not receiving donations at this 
point in time.  If charities do not get the donations at 
Christmas they may never see those donations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This time is very important.  We must get our postal service 
back onstream so these organizations can get the support of 
generous Canadians and be certain that through this season they 
will be able to do what they have done for Canadians in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to business, of course there are many areas which 
are affected.  Small and medium size businesses, according to a 
survey carried out last week by the Canadian Federation of 
Independent Business, are losing $200 million every day of this 
strike.  Everybody agrees that these companies are engines of our 
economy.  They create opportunity for millions of Canadians, yet 
this strike has already cost $2 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every hour that passes is costing our economy millions.  When we 
talk about the cost to the economy we tend to focus on dollars 
and cents, but there is an enormous human cost as well. Thousands 
of Canadians have been laid off over the last few weeks by 
companies which depend on mail for their business.  Without 
Canada Post, many mail order businesses, direct mailers and 
others simply have to close their operations and lay off workers.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give some examples.  The <I>Western Producer</I>, a 
familiar name to those who reside in western Canada, relies on 
Canada Post to reach its readers. It did not publish last week, 
meaning that it lost all the advertising and subscription revenue 
for that week.  As a result it had to lay off 65 of its 80 
employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Columbia House, one of the best known mail order companies in 
Canada, last week laid off 200 of its 400 employees.  Layoffs 
will continue if the strike goes on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>GWE, a mail order house in Calgary, employs 1,500 Canadians from 
coast to coast. As of last week it laid off 700 members.  More 
layoffs may follow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Golfinn International, a mail order company specializing in golf 
equipment, had to layoff 17 of its employees because of the 
strike. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Christmas will make or break many of our small companies.  It 
remains to be seen whether we recover from the effects of the 
strike.  The postal strike has forced many businesses to lay off 
people.  There is an economic cost.  People are laid off, they 
will not be spending money during Christmas time, and in many 
cases the public suffers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But there is also an enormous human cost.  In conclusion, I 
would like to give the decision of the union not to back the work 
legislation.  We received telephone calls in our office, through 
the minister's office, approximately 1,600 inquiries in the last 
week, of which 96% said they want back to work legislation; 96% 
of Canadians are asking this government to put back to work 
legislation in while only 4% support the strike. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have given the collective bargaining system a chance to 
succeed, but seeing it is at an impasse, we now know it is time 
to bring the workers back to work. 
<P><A NAME="LINK35"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
no one can ever fault the Liberal members for a shortage of gall. 
We have just listened to the hon. member across the way run 
through a list of how many dozens of charities were hurt by this 
strike, dozens of them.  I saw in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> this 
morning an ad from the Sick Children's Hospital in Toronto saying 
that people can still make donations by faxing them and phoning 
in and that kind of thing, but because of the strike it could not 
do its typical fund-raising letter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member across the way has pointed out that this has 
cost the economy billions of dollars.  People have been laid off. 
What the hon. member forgot to mention is that this whole thing 
was preventable, that the government had it within its power to 
prevent this strike from happening in the first place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It could have accepted the advice of the Reform party and 
allowed a new settlement mechanism, the mechanism of final 
arbitration, to prevent this type of mess.  But no, it knew 
better.  It thought it was better to let the people of Canada 
suffer through two weeks of a postal strike, to allow all these 
charities to be deprived of the ability to raise funds for all 
these worthy causes as we approach Christmas, and now the 
Liberals turn around and pat themselves on the back for having 
the courage after two weeks to legislate striking postal workers 
back to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is circular arguing.  It is absolutely ridiculous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the hon. member if he is going to take credit for the 
government legislating these people back to work, will he also 
take responsibility for the damage that he and his government 
have caused by not acting sooner? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jerry Pickard:</B>  Madam Speaker, it is fundamentally 
important that the Reform party realize that there is a 
collective bargaining system in this country.  What it intends to 
put forward here is that there is absolutely no collective 
bargaining process that is acceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quite frankly, there is a system and that system must be 
maintained.  We must give opportunity for systems to resolve the 
problem.  As the Minister of Labour has said over the last week 
in which the strike has occurred, it is ultimately our goal to 
make certain that the union and Canada Post had opportunity to 
resolve those problems by working together. 
That will best serve Canadians in the long run.  To legislate 
workers back to work is not the optimum goal as these folks would 
like to suggest.  The optimum goal is to have the workers and the 
company resolve the problem and come up with a proper solution 
that all parties agree to.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, realizing that it was the ultimate goal that we could 
reach and it was unachievable over the short term, we have moved 
to bring in back to work legislation. There is a necessity when 
we start looking at the damage that is created by this strike to 
bring in back to work legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quite frankly, we introduced the back to work legislation within 
a week of the time the strike was going on.  Forty-eight hour 
notice was required and it was introduced last Friday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not a question when we start down the road to the system 
that is being suggested by the Reform Party.  They are saying no 
collective bargaining in this country any longer, let's just 
close the door, jam it shut and say we will legislate anybody 
back to work in the civil service or anywhere else who disagrees 
with the process.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Bruno—Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, 30 seconds is a bit short.  I rise today specially in this 
House to indicate my support for the government's bill to put an 
end to the postal strike.  Now in its third week, this strike is 
going nowhere at the moment.  In light of the impasse, action is 
imperative, since the post office is a public service vital to our 
economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have no questions for the moment, since time is too short, 
but I will continue the debate later. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jerry Pickard:</B>  I certainly appreciate the fact that 
the Bloc has seen that it is important that back to work 
legislation should come in at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe they have suggested along this line too that we do 
need to maintain the process of reasonable collective bargaining. 
The result is that this is a balanced approach.  We brought the 
legislation in as soon as it was reasonable to do so. 
<P><A NAME="LINK37"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I would like to do something unusual in talking about 
this issue.  I would like to actually talk about the bill that we 
are debating, to share some of the aspects of this bill and 
discuss why I think we are here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me say right off the bat that the Reform Party did not 
invent what they refer to as final offer selection.  They should 
not stand up here and try to lecture the government that they 
told us we should do that. Final offer selection is a process 
that has been around for some time. It allows for issues that are 
clear and definable to be put on the table by either side in a 
labour negotiation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The difficulty with these negotiations is there are many issues 
that simply do not line up in a black and white manner.  If we 
are simply talking about wage demands, then the labour union puts 
their contract offer on the table, the company puts theirs and 
the arbitrator selects one or the other. There is no in-between. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not the case when we are talking about defining postal 
routes, about defining methods of delivering the actual mail. 
Those are issues that require much more sophisticated 
negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would agree, however, that final contract arbitration in 
matters that are clear and simple is an effective tool.  It would 
require both parties to come to the table with their best, most 
reasonable offer which could often result in a settlement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not the case here.  In fact, Madam Speaker, ask yourself 
why are we here.  Why are we seeing such a rise in the militancy 
of the labour movement?  I would suggest that it is precisely 
because of the right wing agenda being promoted in this country 
by parties like the Reform Party or the Conservative Party, in 
particular in the province of Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  And your left wing agendas do what? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  We are not talking left wing.  That is 
what the hon. gentleman does not understand. 
In labour negotiations we need fairness, we need a balance, we 
need to recognize that the rights of the workers should be 
protected.  In this case the rights of the Canadian people must 
also be recognized.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We are seeing this increase in militancy. We see labour leaders 
saying they are going to defy this law.  We see them saying they 
are going to block bridges, close airports and highways.  I would 
say to those labour leaders that what they are saying is totally 
irresponsible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does no service to the fine tradition that exists in the 
labour movement in this country, a tradition which has involved 
the building blocks that have made our economy strong.  No labour 
leader worth his salt has ever bankrupted the company in 
attempting to get a better contract for the worker.  It is pretty 
fundamental and it makes no sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call on the leaders in this labour dispute to calm their 
rhetoric and lead the men and women of the postal service back to 
work so we can have peace and harmony and labour relations in 
postal service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is some suggestion that we came upon this solution quickly 
and without a lot of thought.  It could not be further from the 
truth.  Last July the federal government involved federal 
conciliation officers in an attempt to resolve items of dispute. 
In October the federal government appointed a conciliation 
commissioner.  The very word conciliation should send a message 
that says this government is trying to head off what we are 
facing today, that this government wants to conciliate between 
the members of the postal workers' union and the employer Canada 
Post to see if we can keep the mail going in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The solution by the right wing extremists in this place and in 
this country would be to simply privatize things like Canada Post 
and CBC.  We have a very unusual country, a country that needs 
the public service to deliver services to all Canadians with 
fairness and equity.  We cannot simply leave that to the private 
sector.  I have no difficulty, and in fact support very strongly, 
that certain competition be allowed whether it is in delivery of 
mail and we are seeing that.  We see E-mail becoming a more 
important opportunity for people.  We see couriers for 
businesses.  Fundamentally, just like we need a strong CBC, we 
need a strong service to deliver the mail from sea to sea to sea. 
We do not need the simplistic black and white solutions we hear 
coming from members opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have attempted to conciliate this problem.  The government 
appointed Mr. Marc Gravel who is a respected and neutral third 
party.  He did his best but in the end he said that he could not 
find common ground, a solution.  Even after that when the strike 
began the government appointed, I hope all members in this House 
would agree, a very distinguished Canadian, Mr. Warren Edmondson, 
on November 24.  The government asked him to go the table to see 
if he could find some common ground.  He was unable to do so.  As 
a result, we wound up in a strike position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the government to do?  We have tried the conciliation 
process.  We have tried to mediate this process with respected, 
talented Canadians being involved.  The union leadership stands 
up, goes in a rant and leads everybody out on strike.  I have 
talked to postal workers in my riding and they are saying, the 
men and women on the line, please legislate us back to work.  It 
is Christmas time.  They are worried about their families.  They 
make a reasonably good living.  Their wages start in the $17 an 
hour range and they go up from there to $17.41.  They are not 
interested in being on the picket line at Christmas time unable 
to provide for their families.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not the rank and file we are seeing more and more in 
labour disputes who are leading the protest.  It is the extreme 
comments from many of the union leaders.  Yes, it is, I say to 
the members opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know a little of what I speak having been raised by a labour 
leader in this country.  I was in Sudbury when the steel workers 
led a raid on Mine mill.  At the time I was a 16 year old lad 
driving my dad up to Sudbury to lead the raid.  I thought it was 
really neat.  I thought we were hunting communists.  That was the 
spin.  We were going to Mine mill in Sudbury to get rid of all 
the commies.  Do members know what we were hunting?  We were 
hunting for more members.  Do members know why?  For dues.  It 
was more money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can tell members right now that the union leadership in this 
dispute are talking about 4,000 jobs.  Somebody do the math 
quick.  At $50 a month in union dues, is that a lot of money or 
is that a lot of money?  Money is power and power in this country 
in labour negotiations wins in the minds of the militant union 
leaders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would plead with the rank and file in this case to understand 
that just because the charities were used as examples and the 
small businesses, in fact it is the very men and women who union 
leaders would purport to protect who they are hurting by walking 
out and going on strike. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The big companies do not care.  The big companies who those guys 
pretend they want to get at do not care because they have 
alternatives. They can use their own internal staff or couriers. 
They have alternatives.  It is small business, charities and 
everyday men and women in this country who are being hurt.  It is 
the obligation of this government to put an end to this 
particular strike. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I close by saying that I hope the rank and file will understand 
that we want to end this fairly and with a reasonable wage 
increase.  We think this bill does that.  We look forward to 
getting the mail going as quickly as possible in this country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Fournier (Manicouagan, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
with interest to my hon. colleague from Mississauga West. Frankly, I did 
not find much comfort in his remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are doing here is putting postal workers on trial. I have 
never seen greater contempt for postal workers. This government is 
portraying the workers and their union as the bad guys and accusing them 
of being the only ones responsible for the current situation. These 
people apparently have no sense of responsibility and they are not 
negotiating in good faith, unlike the government. The government is the 
good guy, while the workers have no sense of responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why then did the government pretend to give them the right to 
strike? 
At the time this right was granted, it was argued that this was a sacred 
right because, as citizens of this country, workers had every right to 
fight for better working conditions, to fight for their families.> 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, they supposedly have the right to strike. Why bother giving 
them this right only to take it away? If you think they should not have 
the right to strike, you should take it away altogether. Do you have the 
will and the courage to do that? You are taking this right away from 
them. That is unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You are putting postal workers on trial without giving them a 
chance to defend themselves. You are here blaming them for everything. 
What a fine scenario. As my colleague, the House leader for the Bloc 
Quebecois, indicated this morning, if we were to identify one single 
culprit, it would have to be the minister responsible for the Canada 
Post Corporation. And I agree with him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everything was arranged ahead of time by this government, including 
the Prime Minister. Now the government is trying to sound and look good. 
It says: “Look, the workers are the bad guys. We are introducing 
legislation to make them go back to work. We are good enough to send 
them back to work. We are restoring peace with the workers.”

</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did you give them the right to strike after numerous

from them? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am encouraged that I 
did not give encouragement to a member of the Bloc.  One of the 
reasons I may not have given him or members of the NDP such 
encouragement was that they were obviously not listening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was not castigating post office workers.  I was talking about 
the leadership of the union, the people who are challenging and 
saying that they will close airports, bridges and roads.  What 
kind of a democracy do they think we live in? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is elected and has every right and every 
responsibility to deal with the issue.  There is a lot more in 
terms of rights and being involved in a union than simply the 
right to strike.  There is the right to organize.  There are 
rules and regulations within federal and provincial labour 
boards.  They have a right to be part of a union to better the 
working conditions for the men and women they work alongside. 
They do not have a right to break the law.  Nobody has that 
right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also fully believe in my heart that the rank and file do not 
want this strike.  The rank and file want to go back to work and 
get their paycheques so they can have a decent Christmas and 
build a good life for their families.  We support the rank and 
file.  We do not support the militancy of the leadership of that 
union.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George—Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, all day long no doubt we will see Liberal members 
trying to be the good guys and trying to take credit for ending 
the strike. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that the responsibility for the strike, this 
whole mess, falls squarely on the shoulders of the government. 
For seven months it has known that Canada Post and the union were 
at a stalemate, that their heels were dug in and no one was 
moving.  The arbitrators or conciliators that were sent in told 
the government the same thing.  Did the government do anything? 
No.  It said it would wait and see, which resulted in this 
strike. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With all this fooling around to get us to a strike and the money 
it has cost Canadian families and businesses, what does the 
member say to those who have suffered so much and lost so much 
money?  Would he tell them that the wait and see attitude was a 
good idea? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I say exactly what I said 
in my speech.  We attempted to conciliate and we attempted to 
mediate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing the Reform Party misses is that the minute you go to a 
mediator you lose control of labour negotiations.  Let us take a 
look at the facts.  The results of mediation generally drive up 
costs in labour disputes.  If that is the solution the Reform 
Party wants, it will mean driving up the costs of Canada Post. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would rather see a negotiated settlement.  Since we were 
unable to negotiate it we must take responsibility and get the 
mail moving in Canada.

I am happy to speak in support of the back to work legislation

</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been across the table from unions some 15 years or 16 
years negotiating labour agreements.  I have been involved in

the Liberal Party are creating in the House.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is necessary to say that we have today is no different from 
what we have seen for some years now.  It is called a lack of 
leadership, a lack of positioning on issues.  Whether it is at a 
negotiating table or whether it is in the House of Commons it is 
plainly a lack of strategic planning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the discussions on Kyoto, global warming, our leader came 
into the House and articulated a plan, a position.  The Minister 
of the Environment was awestruck, quite frankly.  She did not 
even understand what he was talking about.  That is a lack of 
leadership from the Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We look at the postal strike today.  We look at the Canada 
pension plan where the government does not have a clue what it is 
doing.  Royal commissions, which were poorly implemented, were 
disregarded to some extent once recommendations were made. What 
we have is lack of leadership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently a member talked about all the good things the 
government was doing because now somebody is suffering was quite 
appalling.  I will agree, for the first time in my life, with one 
of the members from the separatist group that the postal workers 
should not be on trial. It should be the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The strike started on November 18.  Now it is December 2, some 
13 days later, and it is still going on.  It will continue for a 
day or so.  It will take that time to get through the Senate and 
implemented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the government stand in the House today and says it is 
essential to get back to work all of a sudden?  It has only been 
seven months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hear that charities are losing money.  As my colleague from 
Prince George—Bulkley Valley says, we have been in the House for 
weeks telling government members that.  All of a sudden the light 
comes on in a dim room and they see they need labour legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every day in the House for weeks we have been talking about 
dozens of charities that will have problems.  We have been 
talking about newspapers, periodicals and magazines that rely on 
the mail.  We have been talking about jobs that will be lost at 
this time of year in particular.  We have talked about human 
cost.  We have talked about the fact that this is the fourth 
strike in 10 years and that they had to be legislated back to 
work.  This is not a surprise.  Yet there is a substantive lack 
of a strategic plan in the organization.  The government is 
responsible for today's postal service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  The Tories were no better either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Many of us talk about whether or not the 
strike was preventable.  Somebody just faulted the Tories for an 
earlier strike.  We all know about it.  Now they are all excited. 
I will wait until they settle down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For seven months they have been at the table.  What happened? At 
the end of seven months they have the gall to say it is about 
time for back to work legislation.  My experience at the 
negotiating table tells me that if they are at that point at 
seven months the light should not come on now.  It should come on 
well before that, long before that.  They know what the issues at 
the table are.  It does not take seven months to know the issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was interesting to hear a member opposite talk about final 
offer arbitration. 
He essentially said that we could not do that with the postal 
service because the issues were so different.  He really does not 
know much about negotiating labour agreements.  For every 
position the union has, management must have a position on it. 
There are two positions on every issue at all times in 
negotiations.  A position can be null but it has to go to the 
arbitrator in final offer arbitration.

</I></B></P><P align=left>To say that we could not use final offer arbitration because the 
issues are complex, or to say we cannot use it because they have 
an issue and we do not, is quite typically stupid Liberal talk. 
The Liberals do not know what they are talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to figure out where to go from here.  After 10 years and 
four strikes it is high time to get into something a lot more 
productive, and that is final offer arbitration.  Our amendments 
to the legislation will describe that process.  From what I have 
heard today I do not expect the Liberals to understand much about 
it.  We outlined it in writing.  Perhaps they can read it before 
the amendments come before the House.  Perhaps the light might 
come on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current system of bargaining is not working particularly for 
a monopoly that exists in the country that people depend on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Representatives of an organization in British Columbia that 
produces a magazine told me they were in desperate straits. They 
utilize the services of Canada Post almost exclusively.  They 
asked why the Liberals said about a day before the strike started 
that they would make sure the cheques get out for UI and for 
seniors.  Not once did they mention that they would look after 
small business.  I doubt very much if it were even a 
consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why small business has a real problem with Liberal 
government.  It almost seems as if small business is there to pay 
taxes and not to service.  It is the engine of our country.  It 
is being held up by one group at a time in our year, the 
Christmas season, that is virtually impossible for many of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not only an issue for British Columbia.  I was on a 
radio show in Prince Edward Island the day before yesterday.  The 
calls made to that show were the same, that small businesses 
which are dependent on postal services were being ignored.  One 
has to wonder where the government stands on issues related to 
private industry or small business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know you are busy up there, Mr. Speaker, but I would like to 
know how much time I have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Ten minutes, Randy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  It is nice to know that the Speaker is 
on the ball here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about the costs of this strike.  According to the 
Canadian Federation of Independent Business the postal strike has 
cost Canadian small and medium size businesses $200 million a day 
or a total of $2.4 billion as of December 1.  I would say that is 
a very conservative figure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot help but get frustrated when I hear a Liberal member 
across the way say that small and medium businesses are losing 
money and it is time to legislate. 
We told the government time and time again prior to the strike 
that it was going to happen.  Now the Liberals sanctimoniously 
stand in the House to acknowledge it.  They are not only 
acknowledging it, they seem to be taking the credit for it, which 
is equally and typically Liberal.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the seven days leading up to the threatened strike, 
Canada Post's mail volume dropped by 50%.  Canada Post has been 
losing $17 million a day since the beginning of the strike.  How 
ironic it is that the organization which needs the money is 
losing the money.  The employees are saying “They have money and 
we want money”.  The fact is that strikes very seldom, if ever, 
help anybody. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The employees may say it is the only option left to them but in 
this case it is not and it was not.  In this case the negotiators 
on both sides had seven long months warning.  As I stated before, 
I never entered a negotiation when I did not know halfway through 
where it was headed unless I could change the direction of it.  I 
know for a fact that the people involved in those negotiations 
knew where they were going.  The fear of the public was out 
there, yet the government let it happen.  That is poor 
leadership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see in a survey that 82% of small and medium size businesses 
agree that Canada Post should be declared an essential service. 
Is it any wonder why the general public has come to that 
conclusion.  Do the employees really want it that way?  Is that 
what the Liberals want?  Is that what Canada Post management 
wants?  Because that is what the general public is beginning to 
say. They have no confidence that this kind of negotiation 
process will ever cease, will ever improve, will ever be looked 
at for the benefit of Canadian citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the government do about it?  Does it say, “There is a 
concern out there, Canadians have a concern”?  No, it lets 
everything happen as it has done before and then it says, “We 
have to stop this.  It has been 13 days and everyone is hurting. 
Now we should introduce legislation”.  That is poor leadership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over 1,000 Canadians were laid off prior to the strike even 
starting.  It is estimated that as many as 10,000 Canadians have 
been laid off because of the postal strike.  Where did that ever 
once fit into the strategy on the other side of this House?  When 
did it ever once come up in any discussion other than what I 
heard this morning from a member saying, “We have a problem. 
There are people who are getting laid off because of this”. My 
colleagues in the Reform Party have stood day after day saying 
that we have a bad enough problem in this country with 
unemployment and now the government is directly creating more 
unemployment with its inaction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about charities?  I have talked to a few.  Yes, they are 
hurting.  This could not have happened at a worse time.  But then 
of course the parties involved in the negotiations knew about 
that.  Both parties in the negotiations picked the time so very 
well as to when to strike.  The parties that want to strike pick 
the optimal time.  They pick the time when the heat is on the 
government the most to see if it can resolve the differences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parties picked the Christmas season to put the heat on the 
government.  But what about the charities? 
Has anybody ever thought about that in this House, other than the 
Reform Party day after day saying you are going to hurt 
charities?  No.  The Liberals come in here today and say, “Guess 
what, we have some legislation because we think charities are 
being hurt by this process”.  It turns out that charities raise 
80% of their funds for the year during the holiday season.

</I></B></P><P align=left>What are we going to say to the charities?  Gee whiz, we had 
seven months. We kind of forgot to think about the charities and 
we knew Christmas was coming.  We heard rumours from the union. 
The postal worker negotiators knew all along what was happening. 
And the Liberal government in the twelfth hour says it is going 
to save it all. Well it has not saved it all.  It has damaged 
charities by lack of action, by lack of leadership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hear from one of the ill-informed individuals on the other 
side that that is rubbish.  I can tell those uninformed members 
on the other side that it absolutely is not rubbish.  If they 
would like some information from some of the charities in this 
country which have been damaged, we will be happy to oblige. We 
should not even have to come into this place and talk about this. 
They should know that. That is what is wrong with bad 
leadership.  They do not know it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, I guess it is just another disappointing day for the 
rest of us.  Those folks on the other side are going to go out of 
here today and say, “Look at the victory we got. We got an 
agreement here to legislate these folks back to work.  Boy are we 
heroes in this country”.  They are not.  They are a major 
disappointment to the majority of legislators in this House, and 
I suspect many backbenchers on the Liberal side although I do not 
know.  They are a big disappointment to charities.  They are a 
big disappointment to all those people who count on Canada Post. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did a radio show yesterday on CKNW in Vancouver.  I heard 
comments that the labour unions will defy the legislation, block 
public access to our bridges, to our airports and our roads.  I 
do not take any happiness in attacking either union or management 
in times like this because it does not help either party, but we 
have to remember that Canada Post is after all a government 
organization.  We have to remember that the bridges, the airports 
and the roads in this country belong to no one except the people 
who paid for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To take that kind of position is somewhat irresponsible.  I hope 
that those who want to do that will think twice about 
responsibilities, will think twice about the need to have 
respect, will think twice about trying to get people back to 
enjoying what was once a proud service in this country and to try 
to get some form of goodwill back in Canada Post. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, this is yet another boondoggle of the Liberal 
government.  It is yet another show of lack of leadership, yet 
another show of indecision and yet another show of lack of 
strategic planning.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I listened with some interest to the member opposite and as usual 
his Reform rhetoric and his holier than thou position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I noted that the Reform Party, the great party of less 
government that always espouses such, has been screaming for 
government intervention for some time now in this matter. 
Apparently it would be that the Reform Party thinkers believe 
that less government is always a preferred policy approach except 
when Canadian workers are exercising their legal rights.  At that 
point it would appear, according to the hon. member and his 
party, state intervention becomes more acceptable.

</I></B></P><P align=left>My question to the member is, why the double standard?  Why does 
he say one thing for one circumstance and quite the contrary for 
another?  I would like to hear the answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thought I made it clear. 
It perhaps sounded like rhetoric but I may be one of a few in 
this House who understand the intricacies that go on at a 
negotiating table.  The fact is that I do believe the members 
opposite are quite ill-informed of the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The answer is that there are no double standards here.  All of 
this could have been prevented.  Now we are at a stage where this 
government sees fit to think that the answer is to react 13 days 
after the situation happened.  A responsible organization would 
have reacted three months ago, not today.  There is no double 
standard.  There is just weakness on the other side in knowing 
how to manage a country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, as I listened to 
the Reform Party member, I once again got the impression that Reformers 
advocate the wrong approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the hon. member when he says that the issue should 
have been solved a long time ago, but the Reform Party did not suggest 
anything back then. The problem is that unionized employees were granted 
a right to strike and they are certainly entitled to avail themselves of 
this right. Perhaps it is the hypocrisy of the legislation that explains 
why the workers got taken. They exercised a right that was legitimately 
granted to them, and then they were told they should not have done so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such is the government's hypocritical way of doing things. It gives 
a right, and then removes it through special legislation. 
Reformers are no different. They saw it coming. They knew that postal 
workers might avail themselves of their right to strike. Today, they 
support the government's bill, but they do not have a long term vision 
to settle the conflict. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before us is a band-aid solution. The Reform Party is 
supporting that band-aid solution. Why not have the political courage to 
tell postal workers “Postal services are essential services. There will 
no longer be any strikes in those essential services”? Instead of 
resorting to legislation to settle labour disputes, we could then solve 
the whole issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As is their custom, Reformers came from nowhere, got involved in 
the issue and are now bragging that they saw the light before everyone 
else. 
In fact, they have a short term vision and they never propose anything 
to help find a permanent solution to the Canada Post issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question to the hon. member is: what does he have to suggest? 
What constructive measure would he suggest, so that in three or four 
years, when the collective agreement that we are imposing today through 
legislation expires, we do not have to relive the same situation? This 
is my question to the member from the Reform Party. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, where has this guy been?  I 
thought this morning we articulated our position rather well. 
However it was not just this morning.  I just got through saying 
that for several months now we have been trying to get this 
government to listen to issues such as final offer arbitration. 
We have been trying to tell the government, even in the last 
session of Parliament, how to avoid these kinds of things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have also tried to convince the government that this whole 
issue could have been stopped earlier in the process if the right 
tactics had been used, if the right advice had been given and so 
on and so forth. 
I am not sure where this member comes from, to tell you the 
truth.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Would he indicate to this House if he knows of any western 
society, specifically G-7 countries, denying their workers the 
right to collective bargaining?  If he knows, I would like to

question, I am not sure whether there are countries that deny 
collective bargaining, but that is not the case in our situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact of the matter is there has been collective bargaining. 
The fact of the matter is it did not work.  The fact of the 
matter is it was preventable.  The fact of the matter is the 
Liberal government did nothing.  The fact of the matter is this 
Liberal government cannot see one day past today in the House of 
Commons.  The fact of the matter is this Liberal government is 
more concerned about its media image than charities and small 
business in this country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Bruno—Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as the Reform member said, the postal strike does not just 
affect businesses and charities.  It also affects the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My own little survey of residents in my riding was 
particularly revealing.  Everyone I met, without exception, said 
they were unhappy with the strike dragging on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will vote in favour of this bill.  Sovereignists are not all 
left wing, socialist and pro-labour. 
Our numbers include people like myself who think that there is 
still room for the diversity that characterized the Bloc Quebecois 
when it first started out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question for the member.  Did he find the same 
concerns in his riding that I found in mine, setting aside 
businesses and charities, as I mentioned at the beginning?  I am 
speaking about the public in general. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, yes.  In fact in my riding 
there were a large number of concerns, not just business and 
charities but the general population.  In my riding, I have not 
checked lately, but I quite suspect there are a large number of 
people yet that are without their pension cheques, and so on and 
so forth.  At the very minimum, there have been delays. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a concern right across the country, but why is it we are 
here on a day like today, December 2, debating back to work 
legislation?  The point still has not sunk in with those that are 
a lot more dense than the chair you are sitting in that this is 
entirely preventable. 
What I heard from several members is how great the government is 
because it brought in back to work legislation.  The problem is 
it is more concerned about the media than it is the people who 
have been hurt.  It is disgusting.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale—High Park, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I will be sharing my time this morning with the hon. 
member for Abitibi. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak on 
Bill C-24.  I regret that this government has been forced to 
legislate an end to this postal strike which started two weeks 
ago, but it is time.  The circumstances are right.  It is 
appropriate and I ask all members of the House to join today to 
support this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last weekend when I went back to my riding, I was stopped time 
and time again by individuals, small business owners and 
volunteers at the local church, who said to me “Please, it is 
time now, it is time. We believe in the collective bargaining 
process but it is time. We need your help”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada we are fortunate to have an excellent system of labour 
management relations.  A majority of disputes are resolved 
without a strike or lockout.  The system does work.  The 
government has repeatedly said that it would allow the collective 
bargaining process to run its course.  Despite the appointment of 
a mediator and every effort to support a negotiated settlement, a 
settlement could not be reached. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For whatever reason, the parties have been either unable or 
unwilling to make difficult decisions needed to resolve the 
dispute.  The Minister of Labour has been advised by one of the 
country's top mediators that the parties have become deadlocked 
and that it is unlikely that an agreement can be reached.  We 
cannot ignore this advice from the mediator.  With the advice 
from the mediator and under the minister's leadership, the 
government has been left with no other choice but to introduce 
legislation and resolve this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that both parties have tried to negotiate a settlement 
to the best of their abilities.  We can no longer wait.  Yes, 
small business has been affected.  Unfortunately, small business 
relies very much on the mail, but small businesses continue to 
pay their employees.  At times cash flow is very tight for the 
small business.  As we know, small business is the engine of our 
economy, it runs our economy.  We must now extend our hand to 
help it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to speak with respect to the concern of the hon. member 
from the opposition about charities and his allegation that we as 
the government have not cared about charities.  It is because the 
government is concerned about the well-being of the nation's 
charities that we are asking the House to join and pass this 
legislation and resume the postal service.  We have been 
monitoring on a daily, weekly and monthly basis the amount of 
hardship that has been faced by the charitable sector.  This 
postal situation has hurt charities in four ways.  I am going to 
share those concerns of the charities with the member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Charities are reluctant to mail and consumers are reluctant to 
respond.  Charities may now have to lay off operational staff due 
to declining work.  The most important giving season, the 
Christmas season, is now in jeopardy.  The shortfall in revenues 
will have direct impact on charities' abilities to provide 
programs and services.  We are aware.  We are aware of what their 
needs are. Therefore being aware, it is time for us to legislate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again with respect to charities, the impact of the initial 
build-up and uncertainty about the postal situation has hurt a 
number of organizations.  Some funds, diminished though they 
were, flowed into charities during the lead-up to the current 
situation.  Cash flow for a number of organizations which are 
heavily dependent on direct mail revenues have now completely 
stopped.  To put this in perspective, I know of several 
organizations that receive 90% or more of their fund raising 
revenues through the mail. 
The current postal disruption means that there is no need for 
gift processors or volunteers.  Some organizations are now faced 
with laying off their processing staff.

<A HREF="#LINKT40"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given that the Christmas season is now upon us, the anticipated 
revenues that are so vital to so many organizations are now in 
jeopardy.  Fund-raising goals based on the needs of organizations 
are likewise in jeopardy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know of an organization in my riding that after a successful 
year prior to this strike is now looking at a 15% shortfall in 
revenues.  There is no fat to trim in this organization.  This 
shortfall will mean that it cannot sustain the same charitable 
activities in which it has been engaged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the last 10 days articles have been appearing in a Toronto 
newspaper regarding the important and vital role played by our 
charities. I urge members again, in light of what the charities 
do for Canada and the people of Canada, it is now time to 
legislate back to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While most of us may not recognize it, charities also face a new 
threat once the postal strike comes to an end.  These charities 
will be competing with each other with an intensity few have 
experienced within a compressed timeframe.  Every organization 
that has delayed its mailing and every organization that has 
already postponed its mailing is going to be out there asking 
Canadians to help support them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The charities are losing $10 million a day.  It is important now 
that we put postal workers back to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to say to the hon. member from the opposition that 
instead of bemoaning the fact that the government has done 
nothing and does not care about charities, I would urge him to 
not only vote for the legislation but to stand in the House the 
following day and speak to all Canadians.  Tell them just how 
important those charities are.  Ask them to look for their mail 
and to give more than they have given before and be responsible 
in that way.  I will be doing that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I regret that we have had to do this.  I believe in the 
collective bargaining system.  However, my constituents want the 
postal workers returned to work.  I care and the government cares 
about those individuals and the charities.  I would ask all 
members of the House to please vote for the legislation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK46"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Gouk (West Kootenay—Okanagan, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, my inclination is to say what drivel, except that I 
believe the hon. member was very sincere in what she said.  She 
said it was time to legislate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is long past time to legislate.  We have been calling for 
this since the summer.  Finally, the Liberal government has 
started to listen to us, the Canadian people, businesses, 
charities and individuals who have been harmed by this strike. 
Why has it taken it two weeks to do this? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member who just spoke said quite eloquently that 
businesses are losing money, they are laying off people.  That is 
true and it has been true for the last two weeks of this strike. 
Charities are losing money, 80% of their revenues.  That is also 
true, and it has been true for the last two weeks.  We told the 
Liberal government. Why did it not listen to us? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member talked about the collective bargaining system.  It 
has three parts; negotiate, conciliate and mediate.  It has 
always been there.  We can put a settlement mechanism in place 
for when those things break down as they have done not only this 
time, but four times in the last 10 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do believe the hon. member was sincere although misguided 
because she is so late in making her declarations.  This is the 
fourth strike in 10 years, the third time in 10 years that is has 
resulted in legislation.  The previous government recognized the 
need to legislate. This government, belatedly, is recognizing the 
need for legislation.  How many more times in the future are we 
going to let the businesses, the charities and the people she 
lamented about suffer before we bring in a permanent solution to 
this ongoing problem?

hon. member the same thing that he has heard time and time again 
from the members on this side of the floor.  The Liberal 
government believes in the collective bargaining process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have negotiated.  We have mediated, but we also believe in 
the right to strike, the right to settlement.  We have tried and 
again it is our Liberal government that believes in the 
importance of negotiating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two weeks after that strike, after opportunities for people to 
negotiate and the minister's bringing in Canada's top mediator to 
solve this problem, we have negotiated solutions working in 
partnership. Those are the solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When those partnerships fail and they cannot be brought 
together, then it is our duty to bring in legislation.  With all 
due respect, we are doing just that.  I would ask that member to 
join me in voting for this legislation this evening. 
<P><A NAME="LINK47"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
honestly I think my colleague should have become a movie star. 
She almost got me crying this morning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could my colleague tell this House and could she tell the postal 
workers by legislating the workers back to work why this 
government put a wage decrease on what was proposed in the 
negotiations?  If it is so serious about it, if it is so honest 
about it, why did it get involved?  Why did it not let the 
arbitrator make the decision? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, what is the government's concern regarding the 
4,000 people who will lose their jobs? I would like to hear my 
colleague, and not as a movie star. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Sarmite Bulte:</B>  Mr. Speaker, these negotiations have 
not been about one issue.  These negotiations are about a number 
of issues which we all agree are best to be left to the two 
parties at the table to resolve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One issue cannot be looked at, such as why this, why not that. I 
think that is something the mediator probably asked.  I was not 
the mediator and it is what the two parties have tried to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the member's second question about 4,000 
employees being laid off, no one knows how many people are going 
to be laid off.  Where do we get these figures?  We look to see 
what has happened in the last two weeks. We see the people who 
have been laid off, the part time people, the people who need 
work now, especially at Christmas so that they can buy their 
families the things they need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about those people?  How can we quantify?  What I am asking 
everyone to do today is to bring us together and to make sure 
that we try to make this thing much better.  Vote for the 
legislation today.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, Sunday night, I 
prepared a 20-minute speech, but I will not use more than the five 
minutes allowed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that the government had appointed a special mediator and 
that after one week, the parties were at an impasse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Abitibi—Témiscamingue, mail delivery is an essential public 
service without which the economy cannot function properly. The time had 
come to make a decision. The letter carriers went on strike on November 
19 after the breakdown of negotiations on wages, job security and 
changes to letter carriers' routes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since Monday, the best mediator in Canada, Mr. Edmondson, has 
attempted to find some common ground between the Canada Post Corporation 
and its unionized workers. According to the mediator, there was not 
enough flexibility on either side to arrive at an agreement. Since there 
was no such agreement, the strike is getting harder on ordinary citizens 
and especially on businesses which depend on mail delivery and on those 
workers whose jobs are directly linked to the proper functioning of this 
service.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This strike is also hurting community associations considerably. 
Despite the many alternative solutions that have been developed over the 
years, only the public postal network can deliver mail in every part of 
Canada at a reasonable cost. Even in Abitibi, in the northern part of my 
riding, the mail is delivered with efficiency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that it is not easy at this time to introduce special 
legislation in Parliament, but during the strike and before it started, 
the government was determined to let the parties arrive at a negotiated 
settlement. I have always considered that a collective agreement would 
be the best solution for postal employees, for Canada Post customers and 
for all Canadians. The federal government gave Canada Post and the union 
ample opportunity to arrive at an agreement, but things always ended in 
deadlock. Now we have before us a special law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the strike, there is one thing that I greatly appreciated on 
the part of the Government of Canada, and that is that it did not use 
strikebreakers. Strikebreakers were used last time and it was rather 
difficult in all sectors in Quebec. We all know that the province of 
Quebec has special legislation prohibiting the use of strikebreakers, 
and labour relations are no worse off because of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last Friday, I was on the picket line in my riding in Val-d'Or 
and Amos.  I met unionized workers.  When questioned, they all say 
they support the national union.  It is the national union that 
runs things, even if we look at the collective agreement, which I 
have in my possession.  I will put it on my desk because, as my 
adversaries will tell me, I am not allowed to have props.  The 
agreement is 541 pages long.  Find me a union in Abitibi that has 
an agreement 541 pages long.  There may be only two in Canada: at 
the CBC and at Canada Post. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know that Canada Post employees work very hard.  We are 
trying to come up with an agreement, a solution for the 
well-being of our employees.  One thing the strikers did very 
well was deliver the provincial, municipal and federal pension 
cheques. However, things are at an impasse at the moment.  Many 
families have yet to receive their cheques.  There are delivery 
delays at the distribution centres.  But, we are trying our level 
best to reach an agreement to put an end to it.  The only way to 
do so is to introduce this bill, because businesses in 
Abitibi—Témiscamingue have been badly hurt by the strike. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada Post Corporation wants to redesign the daily route 
of each letter carrier in order to deliver more mail with fewer 
employees.  When I travelled around the big riding of Abitibi, a 
number of people said that this aim was legitimate.  We know that 
the major issue at the moment is redefining the issue of mail and 
letter carriers' routes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the union, the reaction was very different.  It is 
calling for more permanent positions to give job security to the 
greatest number of union members. 
With new technologies like the Internet and e-mail, we know what large 
banks are doing in Canada and Quebec. We know what cities, telephone 
companies and businesses are doing. Even hospitals have experienced, on 
the union side, lots of cuts. Unionized workers do have a right to put 
pressure on to improve their situation, but we have reached a point 
where solutions need to be sought and the only solution is to enact 
special back-to-work legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am asking only one thing. We know that we have good postal 
workers in Abitibi. They meet many seniors on their run. 
I hope that, after this bill is passed and work has resumed, there will 
be good relations, especially with the good collective agreement they 
already have. Improvements are required in certain areas. I realize 
there is possibility jobs may be cut here and there across Canada, but 
I hope there will be no cuts in my riding because we need these people 
to deliver our mail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public wants to know what is what. In 1996, a commission was 
set up. In his report, Commissioner Radwanski said savings of between 
$100 million and $200 million a year could be made just by reviewing the 
541-page collective agreement, without imposing privatization or 
disproportionate pay cuts on the workers.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main issue is not excessively high rates of pay. Payment for 
time not worked remains a major cost to the corporation. For example, 
letter carriers get paid at a higher rate for hours worked in excess of 
their normal week, such as in December, but are paid for 40 hours in the 
summer, even if their days are shorter. The public may not be aware of 
these considerations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada Post pays its letter carriers for transportation and time 
required to have lunch at their home base. I could mention several other 
examples, such as the replacement of an employee who is not at work. In 
order to become efficient, the Canada Post Corporation wants to be able 
to change the itinerary of its letter carriers and find internal 
solutions. 
The flexibility required by Canada Post means there will be fewer jobs 
and perhaps fewer contributions paid to the union. The union estimates 
that 4,000 of its current 45,000 members will lose their job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We understand why the union is fighting hard to oppose the demands 
made by Canada Post. As a former union president, I am aware of what is 
at stake. I hope that, when they go back to work, these employees will 
maintain good relations with the public and with Canada Post.

it is patently clear that the two sides cannot and will not reach

</I></B></P><P align=left>Many postal workers themselves are fed up with this drawn out 
dispute.  Many of them welcome this legislation because, let us be 
honest, postal workers too are affected financially by this strike. 
They will also tell you that the union is asking for too much in 
the present economic context 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this regard, a recent article in <I>Les Affaires</I> stated that 
the issue in the postal dispute is the flexibility Canada Post must 
have to become competitive and not pass on unwarranted costs to its 
clients. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This article also quotes Gordon Ritchie, former deputy chief

intends to do away with 4,000 jobs.  Just now, our other hon.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The other colleague could not answer my question, but this one 
looks a bit more sincere, having been a union president. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it that the government has not only presented a bill to 
send the parties to conciliation, but has also hamstrung the 
mediator and lowered employees' rates of pay to less than what had 
been negotiated?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as I was 
saying just now in my speech, which lasted perhaps five minutes, 
the union feels that it would lose 4,000 of 45,000 jobs existing as 
of now.  We know that there will be a mediator-arbitrator, but we 
know as well that, in the bill as introduced, no employee will lose 
his or her job today, even after the return to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as rates of pay are concerned, the bill speaks of their 
being spread out over three years: 1.5%. 1.75% and then 1.9%.  At 
the negotiating table, we do not know whether it was 8% or 9%.  We 
do know that they were asking for 11%, while at the moment they 
have over 3% for the cost of living. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We still wish to improve the employees' pay, but with the 
mediator-arbitrator who is to be appointed in order to find a 
solution satisfactory to both parties, one never knows.  At this 
point, it is possible after the year 2000, but for the next 3 years 
it is firm.  People can always catch up after the three years, 
though.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will 
share my time with other Bloc colleagues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday, we finally witnessed a long awaited moment. The minister 
responsible for the Canada Post Corporation introduced Bill C-24, an act 
to provide for the resumption and continuation of postal services. I say 
“awaited” because the way things were evolving, all those who sit in 
this House could see it coming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation before us forces some 45,000 Canada Post employees 
to go back to work, while also depriving them of fundamental rights, 
such as the right to negotiate working conditions that will give them 
satisfaction in their job while also being beneficial to their employer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To put it simply, the dice were loaded. The Canada Post Corporation 
knew that it could count on special legislation from the minister 
responsible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Remember the memo by the Canadian Direct Marketing Association 
made public by CUPW on August 7. According to the memo, Canada Post had 
received assurances from the minister responsible that, should a strike 
occur, the government would pass back to work legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bloc Quebecois members believe that, in this context, the deadlock 
in the negotiations is the result of the bad faith displayed by the 
Canada Post Corporation. This is why we say from the outset that we 
disagree with Bill C-24. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not so much the labour minister, but the minister responsible 
for the Canada Post Corporation who is to be blamed in this whole 
episode. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebeckers and Canadians must know that the minister responsible 
for Canada Post undermined the negotiations. For example, he said, on 
November 18, when both sides had undertaken exploratory talks, that the 
union was uncompromising, that it would be to blame should privatization 
occur, and that the government had the right to resort to special 
legislation. Enough is enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A brief look at what is at stake shows that, generally speaking, 
the union is asking for greater job security. This means converting 
overtime into permanent jobs. 
In this regard, it is interesting to note that the union agreed to 
reduce by half, from 3,000 to 1,500, the number of permanent jobs it 
wants to see created. The other union demands are: extending door to 
door postal services, a cost of living increase, plus a pay raise and a 
work contract for a period of 18 months to 2 years. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1350"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT45"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada Post, for its part, wants to cut salary costs by some 
$200 million, which amounts to cutting 4,000 jobs.  It is offering 
to create 500 permanent positions rather than the 1,500 sought by 
the union.  The government is missing a golden opportunity to 
create jobs, not vulnerable jobs, but permanent jobs and to spread 
the wealth among people who want to work.  We must not forget that 
Canada Post is not running a deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is more, Canada Post is offering a salary increase over 
three years, with 1.5% the first year, 1.75% the second and 2% the 
third, plus the cost of living index. 
With its bill, the government is imposing salaries that are lower 
than those in the latest management offer of November 17, which 
proposed the same increases but six months earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were never given any indication that the employer was 
making concessions on its demand that it recover $200 million from 
salary costs.  Bolstered by various interventions by the minister 
responsible for Canada Post, the corporation's management held the 
line while it awaited the special legislation introduced by the 
Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-24 is therefore the result of abortive negotiations, in 
which the bargaining process did not follow its usual course.  Had 
it done so, it would have been cemented by an agreement negotiated 
solely by the parties, as the Bloc Quebecois has called for since 
the outset. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc has always upheld the principle of free negotiations 
and it continues to do so.  My colleagues and I are, however, aware 
that as things stand now the two parties are at an impasse.  The 
situation is not surprising given that Canada Post is a subsidiary 
of the Liberal Party of Canada, the place where senators are 
appointed when there is no place for them in the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why the Bloc will be proposing a series of amendments 
when the House sits in committee of the whole.  These amendments 
aim primarily at hastening the end of the dispute so as to improve 
labour-management relations, which were sorely tested, and to 
resume postal services to Quebeckers, who are waiting impatiently 
for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The clauses the Bloc has difficulty with are clauses 9, 12, 8, 
10, 15 and 17. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 9 sets out the principles guiding the mediator-arbitrator 
in reaching his decision. 
Specifically, it says that the mediator-arbitrator shall be guided 
by the need for terms and conditions of employment that are 
consistent with those in comparable industries in the private and 
public sectors and that will provide the necessary degree of 
flexibility to ensure the short- and long-term economic viability 
and competitiveness of the corporation.  The Bloc Quebecois 
condemns these guidelines binding the mediator-arbitrator, because 
they represent an amendment to the Canada Post Corporation Act, 
which refers to a self-sustaining financial basis rather than 
competitiveness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With clause 9, the Minister of Labour is clearly indicating that 
Canada Post must be run like a private business.  This is at 
considerable odds with the public service character provided for 
under its own legislation, the Canada Post Corporation Act.  The 
Bloc Quebecois therefore asked the government to give serious 
consideration to an amendment whereby the mediator-arbitrator 
must instead be guided by considerations consistent with a 
self-sustaining public service, as set out in Canada Post's 
incorporating statute. We already have the government's assurance 
that this amendment will be approved and that it will have a 
mitigating effect in the context of arbitration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 12 sets workers' rates of pay for the new agreement. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1355"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT47"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT47"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1355

<A HREF="#LINKT46"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois feels that the government could have left 
the salary issue in abeyance so as to give the union an opportunity 
to present its arguments to the mediator-arbitrator.  This is why 
we are asking the government to amend clause 12 and give unions at 
least the rates of pay contained in the employer's last offer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clauses 8 and 10 make provision for the government to appoint 
the mediator-arbitrator.  The Bloc rejects these clauses, being of 
the opinion that it is up to the government to see that unions are 
consulted.  This, in our view, is a prerequisite to any real 
mediation that would be acceptable to everyone, because it would be 
someone above all suspicion, someone respected by all the parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 15 also poses a problem.  It states that the government 
will pass on the mediation bill to both parties.  This strikes us 
as seriously wrong, given that the government played a primary role 
in the dispute now dragging on.  The Bloc Quebecois feels that the 
government must pay the cost of the mediation it is imposing, and 
that is why we are asking that clause 15 be deleted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 17 sets the fines for those who contravene the 
legislation.  A rapid calculation shows that it could cost the 
union up to $50 million a day to break the law.  It is 
understandable— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> That was very interesting.  Unfortunately, we

the hundreds of kilometres of drainage ditches that criss-cross 
the area.  For generations now, provincial and municipal 
authorities have routinely cleaned these waterways of silt and 
debris so that flooding is reduced and disruptions to streams and 
habitat is kept to a minimum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But now the Department of Fisheries and Oceans seems intent on 
wreaking chaos on our region.  DFO is now describing routine 
ditch maintenance as harmful alteration of fish habitat and has 
suddenly demanded compensation from farmers and the municipality. 
It wants a professional review every time a waterway is cleaned 
and describes even seasonal streams as fish bearing waters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, DFO is risking the lives and livelihood of people in 
our region, risking the habitat of the very fish it is supposed 
to be protecting and doing it in a way that makes timely 
co-operation impossible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding of Fraser Valley, the riding of Langley—Abbotsford

to step in and direct his officials to stop confronting and start

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan—Shuswap, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the first duty of any government is to protect its 
law-abiding citizens.  Instead neither the province nor the 
federal government made sure that the men who went underground to 
mine coal at Westray came home safely each day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the book <I>The Westray Tragedy</I>, CANMET 
recommended a more in-depth evaluation of the project.  Over 100 
men previously killed in the Foord coal seam should have been 
reason enough for governments to be extra cautious about Westray. 
So why did the federal government suddenly give its stamp of 
approval through loan guarantees?  If the federal government had 
no worry for the safety of citizens working at Westray, why did 
it not even ensure that its investments could be recovered 
through long term safe and profitable operation of the Westray 
mine? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report released yesterday reveals a chain of obvious 
preventable safety problems.  As project financier, Ottawa must 
share the blame for turning the federally assisted job project 
into a tomb, a mine so unsafe that 11 bodies have yet to be 
recovered, and a whole region in Nova Scotia remains in mourning.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Sheila Finestone (Mount Royal, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, a 
recent trip to the Middle East with the foreign affairs minister 
gave me occasion to see firsthand the devastation caused by the 
use of anti-personnel land mines, particularly to our 
peacekeepers and innocent children. Unlike other military 
weapons, land mines lie in wait buried in the ground for innocent 
unsuspecting victims, killing and maiming every 22 minutes every 
day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Ottawa round tables are planning the substance for concrete 
measurable actions to secure limbs, lands and lives.  Ottawa is 
hosting more than 120 countries today ready to sign a treaty 
banning the use, production, transfer and stockpiling of 
anti-personnel mines, as well as to destroy existing stockpiles 
and to demine within 10 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All countries will have to co-operate with a compliance regime. 
The Canadian government and NGO organizations aim for a total ban 
of these mines.  We must mobilize not simply to sign the treaty 
but to ratify it, to give aid to victims and proceed to demine, 
stopping these crimes against humanity.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When Lucien Bouchard condones Jacques Parizeau's statement about 
the ethnic vote in the last referendum by saying that his predecessor 
deserves respect, that he is a great democrat, it is true that there are

to divide Canada, but they also want to divide Quebec into classes or 
even into castes.

of citizens: first class citizens. Did you get that? 
In Quebec, we only have first class citizens.

this week when we are talking about Kyoto and the need to reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions, it is important for the government in 
particular to remember the role that a revitalization of rail 
transportation in this country could play in the reduction of 
greenhouse gas emissions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge the government to take seriously many of the 
recommendations that were made a couple of weeks ago by the 
Railway Association of Canada.  I do not agree with all of its 
recommendations but it certainly made some that the government 
should take very seriously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the most useful ways we can combat greenhouse gas 
emissions in this country is to revitalize rail transportation, 
both on the freight side and the passenger side, and to 
reregulate our transportation system to favour rail 
transportation.

has just died. Recruited in the early sixties by the key players of 
Quebec's quiet revolution, he became an economic adviser to René 
Lévesque. Under Mr. Lévesque's leadership, Michel Bélanger initiated the 
bold plan to nationalize electricity.

1989.

Mr. Bélanger was a staunch federalist, but he did not hesitate to refute 
the comments of those who used scare tactics when talking about the 
economic risks relating to sovereignty.

call upon the Minister of Finance to earmark more money for

billions in transfers to the provinces which has directly 
resulted in higher tuition for students all over Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Last month the environment minister met with her counterparts

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the federal government has had three positions in the

</I></B></P><P align=left>Another reason they are upset is that the federal government has 
steadfastly refused to articulate its view on what this Kyoto 
deal will cost.  Other people are sharing their views on the 
cost.

every man, woman and child.  BCNI estimates the Kyoto deal could 
cost a 2% to 3% reduction in GDP but the government will not say 
what its cost estimate is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is for the Prime Minister.  Exactly what is the

Kyoto?  Does he think that this level of cost is acceptable?

successful in developing new technology and exporting that new 
technology to the world.  We are a great exporter of energy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are dealing with the possibility of getting credit for some 
of the things we are doing.  For example, we are cleaning gas in

to get credit for that.

position was in Rio. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the member for Sherbrooke went to Rio it was all photo

nothing.  That was because there were no real consultations

unrealistic targets.  There was no plan to pay.  There was no

increased, which is good news.  The greatest increase, of course, 
has been in the province of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we are already doing with the minority language program, we

“Send them another cheque”.  The ability to speak French is not 
dependent on a cheque, but on the desire of each and every 
Canadian, and the language has survived for 100 years.  Now that we 
have the institutions, we must continue with them, we must work 
together within a united Canada to build them.  We are well placed 
to build up French throughout the country.

<P><A NAME="LINK114"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the industry minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The banks have spent millions to plant one question.  Can a bank 
change?  It turns out the question should be can a bank count. 
The federal government, through small business loans, funnelled 
$6 billion in risk free loan business to the banks.  The 
government claims to get 37 jobs for every $1 million lent 
because that is what the banks tell it.  The auditor general has 
revealed that the actual count is a paltry seven jobs per $1 
million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the minister end this risk free ride for Mr. Banker and

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, not only does the leader of the NDP profoundly 
misunderstand the program.  She does not recognize the fact that 
the Small Business Loans Act is currently helping 30,000 small 
businesses in Canada acquire access to capital, one of the 
fundamental concerns the small business community has brought to 
our attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Day after day the small business community is creating the very 
kinds of jobs the leader of the NDP claims to want.  Why does she 
not wake up and realize that this is a program that works? 
<P><A NAME="LINK116"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, we are 
talking about a free ride for the banks, not small business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general found that the Atlantic Canada Opportunities 
Agency is mathematically challenged as well.  ACOA apparently 
cannot count how many jobs it has created and maintained either. 
Instead it has fun with figures by assuming incredibly that each 
job lasts 10 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the minister responsible for ACOA stop boasting about 
assumed jobs and start working with Atlantic Canadians to set 
targets and achieve targets for an increase in real desperately 
needed jobs.

Secretary of State (Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency),

latest report the auditor general explicitly acknowledges the 
progress that has been made by the agency.  I am delighted to be 
able to stand behind that.

has gone through a long series of dialogue with all of our 
partners in this country, including the provinces and 
territories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we met in Regina, the provincial and territorial minister 
counterparts said that they recognize Canada needed flexibility 
when we went to Kyoto, that as a member of the international 
community we had to negotiate a convention and that it was in 
everybody's best interest in Canada that we are at the table and 
that we have a successful agreement in Kyoto. 
<P><A NAME="LINK121"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
glad to hear from the minister that she is in favour of dialogue 
because I would like to encourage some dialogue between her and 
her colleague from natural resources today, and I will ask the 
Prime Minister to help them dialogue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She stated in a radio interview this morning that Canada's 
commitment in Kyoto would be legally binding and in a direct 
contradiction her colleague from natural resources said  “When 
our Canadian implementation plan is sufficiently mature, we will 
turn the page to formal ratification in Kyoto”.

that is followed here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, the parties have to arrive at a consensus in Kyoto 
about the commitments to which they are prepared to make legal 
obligations.  Then there is the signature process.  Then there is 
a ratification process.  Then there is a coming into force 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So what the Minister of the Environment has said and what I have

Justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday in Saskatchewan the judge bypassed the law of 
Parliament saying in the Latimer case that Canada's murder laws 
are all wrong.  The situation begs some signal of intent from the 
justice minister.  Does the Criminal Code have meaning or do 
judges just select terms to their liking?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General

</I></B></P><P align=left>As the hon. member knows, I cannot comment on that specific 
case.  It is up to the Attorney General of Saskatchewan to decide 
whether any appeal is to be commenced in that particular case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I do want to acknowledge for everybody here in the 
House that Mr. Justice Noble acknowledged the exceptional

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster—Coquitlam—Burnaby,

legal vacuum from this Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Disabled groups fear this new loophole in the law will take 
Canada down a slippery slope of devalued life.  What does the

meaningful Criminal Code?

of Canada, Lib.):</B>  As the hon. member should be aware, nothing 
that Mr. Justice Noble said yesterday impacts on the provisions 
in the Criminal Code that deal with second degree murder.  There 
continues to be a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday counsel for Mr. Latimer argued that in the 
circumstances of that particular case the imposition of that 
punishment would constitute cruel and unusual punishment. 
However, Mr. Justice Noble made it plain that his decision was 
specific and those provisions of the code in question remain in 
full force and effect.

Agency reviews periodically all the regulations.  It has

Mr. Speaker, to the contrary.  What the CTA regulations intend to

a water treatment plant at $26,000.  When the Canadian 
taxpayers got the bill it was for $2.3 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given that the final cost of this project is about 100 times the

were adequate for the purposes?

north of it.  The river has aluminium in the water and the first 
nation had decided it would not accept water from that source. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result, and I think fairly so, the community, for the 
safety and security of its people, decided that it needed a new 
water source.  Indeed we worked with them to find an alternate

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Fred Mifflin (Minister of Veterans Affairs and Secretary 
of State (Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency), Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, today it is both an honour and a privilege, though a sad 
one, for me to pay tribute to a good friend, a truly remarkable 
Canadian, the Hon. John Whitney Pickersgill, or Jack as he was 
known to many of his colleagues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His passing last month marked the departure of an extraordinary 
individual.  Jack Pickersgill was an exceptional politician, a 
devoted public servant and an avid author and historian.  His 
outstanding talents and notable achievements all constitute part 
of the rich legacy he leaves for Canada.  Admired for his 
integrity, his intelligence and his impeccable sense of social 
justice, he served four prime ministers with great distinction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His unwavering commitment to Canada was reflected in every 
challenge he rose to accept.  Whether serving in government as an 
honourable minister or as a member of the official opposition in 
his colourful role as a member of the four horsemen, Jack 
Pickersgill was highly respected by his colleagues within the 
Liberal Party of Canada and outside of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an author and historian, his written works are insightful 
pieces which will long remain valuable reference materials for 
all Canadians.  His exemplary sense of social responsibility in 
hand with his keen intellect has proven instrumental in 
developing many of—

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I invite you, colleagues, if you have other meetings, especially 
during the time of tributes, that you carry on the meetings 
outside of the House.  I apologize to the member for 
interrupting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Fred Mifflin:</B>  Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  I appreciate 
your intervention.  I thought it was most appropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would go on to say in respect of the Hon. Jack Pickersgill 
that while his influence was in virtually all aspects of policies 
and politics, I think it is important that success to him would 
appear to have been measured in large part by those 
accomplishments he could achieve on behalf of all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a mark of the man and a solid indication of his values 
that, despite the power and influence he possessed, there were 
two accomplishments of which he was exceptionally proud.  One was 
the provision of unemployment insurance for fishermen.  The other 
was the provision of a place in Canada for 35,000 Hungarian 
refugees who became exemplary citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On that note, as we take this opportunity to pay tribute today 
to Jack Pickersgill, it is imperative that we acknowledge his 
unfailing commitment to Canada.  During this period in our 
history when we are being asked to reflect on the question of 
unity, let us learn from Jack's devotion and his strong belief in 
a better future to rededicate ourselves to ensuring a nation 
strong and indivisible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having worked steadfastly to help build many of the institutions 
that Canadians enjoy today, let us also take a moment to give 
thanks and recognize these contributions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On a personal note, I am extremely proud to have known him as 
you have, Mr. Speaker, and am honoured to have considered him a 
dear friend.  We did not spend a lot of time together but the 
moments we did spend were precious.  His larger than life counsel 
and his advice were always beneficial; his wit and his wisdom 
always inspirational. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the privilege that we both have had to serve the people of 
Newfoundland in Parliament, he in Bonavista—Twillingate and I in 
almost a mirror image of that riding, 
Bonavista—Trinity—Conception, I know that Newfoundlanders and 
Labradorians in particular will always have for him a special 
place in their hearts.  The public contributions he made during 
his lifetime were remarkable.  His personal impact on those whose 
lives he touched was equally as significant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recall the first time I saw him as a young boy, observing him 
through the picket fence on the grounds of the Orange Lodge in 
Bonavista as he campaigned in the early days with Joey Smallwood. 
Even then I was struck by his commanding presence and his lasting 
and reassuring smile. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While Canada mourns the loss of an exceptional leader whose 
indelible mark has been left on the national stage, let us give 
thanks for Jack Pickersgill and for his tremendous legacy. 
Dedicated to his constituency and committed to his country, the 
personal and public achievements of Jack Pickersgill are the 
pillars upon which this nation has been built. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By way of conclusion, in his book <I>Seeing Canada Whole</I>, he 
describes his family values this way “The friendship of our 
children for their parents and for each other has been a great 
reward for Margaret and me.  Despite two great wars and some 
personal sorrows, mine has been a happy life.  The half century 
of living with Margaret has been the supreme experience of this 
happy life”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Jack will always be remembered as a rare Canadian treasure.  To 
his widow, Margaret Pickersgill, and to their family, I am sure 
that all our colleagues join me here, in the Parliament that he 
so loved, in expressing our heartfelt condolences.

too rise today on behalf of the Official Opposition to recognize 
the years of public service of Jack Pickersgill.  He lived from 
1905 until 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member from Newfoundland just made reference to Jack 
Pickersgill and the book that he wrote, <I>Seeing Canada 
Whole</I>.  It is amazing to think that Jack Pickersgill was born 
in Ontario, grew up on a farm in Manitoba and then later served 
in Parliament from a riding in Newfoundland.  Maybe he really did 
see Canada whole. 
He served under and was an adviser to three Liberal Prime 
Ministers, Mackenzie King, Louis St. Laurent and Lester Pearson. 
He also worked with and against, I suppose, and helped 
orchestrate the downfall of John Diefenbaker in the 1960s.

Jack Pickersgill, who passed away on November 14. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Born at Wyecombe, Ontario in 1905, Mr. Pickersgill enjoyed a 
long and fruitful career on the Hill.  He entered politics in 1937 
as a secretary in the office of the Prime Minister of the time, 
Mackenzie King.  He also served under Louis Saint-Laurent, who 
appointed him as Clerk of the Privy Council in 1952 and Secretary 
to the PMO. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1953 he moved from behind the scenes into an elected role 
as the MP for Bonavista—Twillingate, Newfoundland, the riding he 
represented until his resignation in 1967. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During his parliamentary career, Mr. Pickersgill held the 
positions of Secretary of State and Minister of Immigration.  From 
his time in opposition from 1957 to 1963, we owe the axiom that one 
should never ask a question without already knowing what the answer 
will be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the Liberals' return to power in 1963, he became Minister 
of Transport until he left the House of Commons to assume the 
presidency of the Canadian Transport Commission, where he remained 
until 1972. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of myself and my colleagues in the Bloc Quebecois, 
I want his family and friends to know that they have every reason 
to be proud of all his accomplishments during a long and fruitful 
political career.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, on 
behalf of our party I would like to say a few words in tribute to 
Jack Pickersgill who passed away recently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As was mentioned before in the House, he was a very unique 
individual.  Born in Ontario, raised in rural Manitoba and member 
of Parliament from the great province of Newfoundland. He was a 
very versatile person, a scholar, a public servant, a Prime 
Ministerial aid, an author, a cabinet minister and a very 
effective opposition parliamentarian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He did not seek re-election in 1968 when I first came to the 
House, so I did not have any personal experience at seeing him 
perform in the House of Commons.  However, when I arrived here I 
heard many stories about the effectiveness of Jack Pickersgill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suppose he was in the category of many of those extremely 
interesting parliamentarians of the 1950s and 1960s.  I think of 
John Diefenbaker, Paul Martin, Senior, Tommy Douglas, Real 
Caouette and Jack Pickersgill, all very effective 
parliamentarians, the like of which we do not see often today in 
the House of Commons.  They were members of the pre-television 
age in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was very effective in bringing Newfoundland into 
Confederation and became a very close friend of the first premier 
of that province, Joey Smallwood.  He was an effective and 
passionate cabinet minister and perhaps his reputation is best 
known as an opposition parliamentarian when the Liberal Party was 
defeated in 1958 and 1963.  He was a member of the so-called four 
horsemen, or the original rat pack in the House of Commons, and I 
understand that he often sparred with Prime Minister John 
Diefenbaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is with a great deal of respect that I offer my condolences 
today on behalf of the New Democratic Party to his widow, 
Margaret, and his family.  He made a tremendous contribution to 
Canada and the House of Commons.  As did Stanley Knowles, Jack 
Pickersgill really loved this place and all that was best about 
it.  With that, I want to extend our condolences.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, in 
joining with other parties in the House today, I want to also 
extend to Mr. Pickersgill's family, his wife, his children, his 
grandchildren, my personal condolences and the condolences of our 
party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anyone familiar with the history of Canada and the history of 
the House of Commons knows that Mr. Pickersgill was a giant.  He, 
like all of us in this place, was a partisan and it should be 
stressed that he enjoyed partisanship and every dimension of it. 
I say this as a Progressive Conservative who represents a 
political party that was on the receiving end of that 
partisanship throughout his career. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many members in this place know the distinguished writer Doug 
Fisher. He is a very distinguished member of the press gallery, 
someone who himself was a member at one point and sat in the 
House of Commons.  Mr. Fisher called him “the liveliest, most 
cunning and partisan politician I have observed”. What a 
compliment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that light perhaps I might observe the admission that Mr. 
Pickersgill made in his own autobiography that his middle name 
was Whitney.  His middle name was given to him in commemoration 
of the Tory premier of Ontario, James Pliny Whitney who swept to 
power in Ontario in the year of Mr. Pickersgill's birth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Pickersgill not only practised politics, he wrote about 
them.  I have particularly noted his account of the revival of 
the Liberal Party, a book he wrote entitled <I>The Road Back</I>. 
Apart from the story of the rebuilding and renewal of his party, 
one is struck by the wonderful material that Mr. Pickersgill and 
his contemporaries on both sides of the House also provided for 
many of the great political cartoonists in Canada in that period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his last book <I>Seeing Canada Whole</I>, he summed up his 
public and private life. The title therefore has great meaning, 
seeing Canada whole.  He played an important part in the entry of 
Newfoundland and Labrador into Confederation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of his life, Mr. Pickersgill was still working 
passionately to help Canada keep whole with his active support in 
particular of the Meech Lake accord.  In fact he joined with the 
Hon. Robert Stanfield to urge adoption of this accord in 
testimony that he offered in front of the Senate of Canada. This 
testimony will forever remain a very significant part of the 
public record in this country. His defence of his position in his 
book is instructive and an inspiration to those who do not know, 
or easily forget or sweep away what has been the history of this 
great country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How did he see his own parliamentary career?  His assessment is 
that he achieved a few things, or at least contributed to a few 
things that he felt may not have happened otherwise.  One was the 
provision of unemployment insurance for fishermen.  The other one 
was the provision of a place in Canada for 35,000 Hungarian 
refugees who became exemplary citizens.  He also said, “I was 
never bored by Parliament.  I would try again”.  If only we 
could have persuaded him to run again, I am sure he would have 
been elected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His assessment though is far too modest.  I think we all 
recognize today that Canada has truly lost a giant.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>POSTAL SERVICES CONTINUATION ACT, 1997

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-24, an 
act to provide for the resumption and continuation of postal services, 
be read the second time and referred to a committee of the whole.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réjean Lefebvre (Champlain, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
rise in this House today to speak on Bill C-24, an act to provide for 
the resumption and continuation of postal services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the outset, let me say that the hon. members have to vote on 
Bill C-24 today because of the incompetence of this government. Let me 
explain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When negotiations started, in April, we suspected the government's 
intentions with regard to Canada Post. The Radwanski report on the 
future of the Canada Post Corporation, tabled in October 1996, hinted at 
what the government's priorities were concerning the future management 
of the corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report is clear. It reads, on page 4, and I quote: “Canada Post 
is operating under the constraints of a collective agreement whose 
provisions, particularly with regard to pay for time not worked, 
flexibility and job security, are completely out of line with the new 
realities of today's workplace. The financial consequences of these 
provisions pose a serious threat to the eventual viability of the 
corporation and hence to the future of all its employees.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the basis on which the government plotted its course of 
action in the postal dispute. From then on, everything became a matter 
of cost-effectiveness. In co-operation with the corporation's senior 
management, the government set targets in terms of cost-effectiveness 
and commercial results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These were easily agreed to since the government had made sure to 
appoint its friends to the board. 
Everyone knows that the president today is none other than the hon. 
André Ouellet, former Minister of Foreign Affairs in the Liberal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So there was no problem digging into the Canada Post surplus to 
reduce the federal deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, such an objective could not be achieved without cutting 
jobs, without reducing employee benefits, without reorganizing the work 
done by letter carriers, and I could go on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is exactly the result sought and achieved with the 
introduction of Bill C-24. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Events started to unfold more clearly as soon as the postal 
workers' collective agreement expired last June. The government's 
strategy was simple: let things drag on, make sure that negotiations are 
going nowhere and push the postal workers to strike just as the holidays 
are approaching. 
At this time of the year, it is easy for the government to justify the 
early introduction of special back to work legislation, and that is what 
it did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the minister responsible for the Canada Post Corporation, the 
agenda has been set since last August. The Canadian public knows today 
that the minister stated that the strike would be short and that back to 
work legislation would be quickly introduced. It was at a meeting held 
last August 6 with the president of the Canadian Direct Marketing 
Association and other large mail users that the minister revealed his 
intentions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not inventing anything. The details of that meeting are 
clearly set out in a memorandum released by the postal union at a press 
conference in September. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, the government and especially the minister found 
themselves in an embarrassing situation when the content of that 
memorandum was revealed. 
There is no doubt about that. In fact, on September 8, the national 
union president sent a copy of this memorandum to Prime Minister Jean 
Chrétien. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The union had provided proof that there was collusion between the 
government and the large mail users. That is outrageous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The large mail users are already benefiting from the lowest postal 
rates in the world. To preserve these benefits, they supported the 
government so that it would reduce salaries and benefits for postal 
workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister responsible for Canada Post even prepared for a 
parallel service to deliver government cheques. 
Again, according to the famous memorandum made public by the union, the 
minister even declared that “this time, the social benefit cheques will 
not be delivered by postal workers during the strike, but by another 
unidentified delivery service that has already concluded an agreement 
with the government”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government backed down on this when this other tactic intended 
to put pressure on the negotiators was revealed.

<A HREF="#LINKT64"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To cover up its mistake, the government finally accepted the 
offer sent by the union of postal workers to the minister 
responsible for Canada Post on August 7.  A few days before the 
strike, it half-heartedly came around. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has become obvious that the parties to the dispute are 
still far apart.  But the evidence is there that the government 
bears a large share of responsibility for the breakdown in 
negotiations.  The minister responsible for Canada Post promised to 
pass back to work legislation so as to put a wrench in the 
bargaining process.  Well, he kept his promise. 
We now find ourselves debating Bill C-24, the result of this 
collusion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, the government has demonstrated its incompetence 
and lack of resolve.  It has shown a complete disregard for the 
right to strike provided for under the Canada Labour Code, by 
forestalling any chance of successfully negotiating a real 
collective agreement.  The government did everything it could to 
shift the blame for this strike onto the union.  The Minister 
responsible for Canada Post said so himself.  This is what it says 
in the memorandum from the Canadian Direct Marketing Association. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the Bloc Quebecois asked the government on numerous 
occasions not to interfere in the postal dispute.  It was up to the 
two parties to negotiate a new work contract.  Through its repeated 
interference, the government has made a mess of things.  The 
government should not kid itself. 
The upshot of Bill C-24 will be unhappy people and considerable 
dissatisfaction on both sides. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of the road, the deterioration in postal service 
will once again hurt the public.  There has even been talk of civil 
disobedience by postal workers.  We have the government to thank 
for this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consideration of Bill C-24 shows clearly that the government 
has chosen to favour the employer's objectives over those of the 
union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada Post Corporation is going to become a cash cow for the 
government.   The bill represents much more than the end of a 
strike.  It is also an insurance policy guaranteeing that the 
corporation will also be a increasing source of revenue for the 
government's consolidated revenue fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no getting around it, the government has put itself 
in a conflict of interest situation in the negotiations. 
Now, it will make huge profits of $200 million over five years through 
the corporation, thanks to the savings that will result from 
implementing of Bill C-24. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois is in favour of resolving labour disputes 
through negotiation. Imposing working conditions through special 
legislation does not solve the basic issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree that the postal strike has a devastating effect on the 
country's economy. Businesses, particularly small and medium size 
businesses in Quebec, are deeply hurt by the lack of postal services. 
Customers are late paying their bills and suppliers do not get the money 
owed to them. The strike has cost millions of dollars. All this would 
not have happened had the government acted in good faith and had it not 
interfered in the negotiations. The government planned the outcome well 
in advance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all these reasons, the Bloc Quebecois is opposed to Bill C-24, 
which forces postal employees to go back to work, in spite of their 
legal right to strike.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the railroads had a lot of contracts in the fifties, 
sixties and seventies which ended up with very high rates of pay 
and other union-type clauses in them.  This has resulted in rail 
lines in Manitoba being abandoned due to the high cost of 
operation. The postal service has to ensure that it does not end 
up in the same situation of pricing itself out of the market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask Bloc members to advise me and other members of the 
House how long they would have allowed this strike to continue. 
Indefinitely?

interests, at the expense of the workers.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government 
Services, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in spite of the unfortunate circumstances 
that led to this debate, I want to tell you how proud I am to be the 
minister responsible for the Canada Post Corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada Post is one of our country's most important institutions. It 
was among the first departments to be established after Confederation, 
in 1867. Afterwards, it evolved in harmony with Canada and kept pace 
with it, while also being a reflection of our nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada Post Corporation delivers 11 billion items of mail every 
year to the 12 million addresses in its register, thus acting as a link 
between us and between our communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some small communities in our great northern regions are totally 
dependent on postal services, not only for mail, but also for the 
delivery of drugs, food and other products essential to their survival. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada Post, which became a crown corporation in 1981, is now the 
fifth largest Canadian business, with sales of $5 billion and more than 
54,000 employees. The cost of a stamp to send an ordinary letter is the 
second lowest in the world, and it is frozen for the next two years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The service provided by Canada Post is often criticized in our 
country, but it compares very favourably to that of all other postal 
administrations in the world. Still, our postal service, like our whole 
society, is going through a period of intensive changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Faced with the massive expansion of new technologies such as fax 
machines, electronic mail and the Internet, Canada Post must make 
changes or else it will disappear. What used to be the raison d'être of 
the postal service, namely mail delivery, now accounts for only 55% of 
the corporation's activities. 
Nowadays, 45% of all Canada Post operations are based on modern and 
competitive products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is this approach, this modern vision of our postal services 
which led to the labour dispute we are dealing with today.  Normally, 
seven months of negotiations and three resourceful mediators and 
conciliators working on the issue should have produced the agreement we 
were seeking.  This is what happens in more than 95% of all labour 
disputes in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is even more surprising is that the Canada Post Corporation 
has signed agreements with its three other employee unions.  Why is it 
that things are always so difficult with the postal workers and letter 
carriers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After spending months carefully studying of this situation, I must 
say that the Canadian Union of Postal Workers refuses to recognize some 
undeniable facts. 
The best case in point is the possible privatization of the Canada Post 
Corporation.  I said it, I repeated it in all languages and I say it 
again:  Canada Post is not for sale, not today, not tomorrow and not in 
any foreseeable future.  Both former ministers repeated it over and over 
again.  In spite of all that, the union keeps on frightening its members 
and the public with this threat of possible privatization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This decision was not made lightly.  It was confirmed by the 
government last April, after a complete review of the terms of reference 
of the Canada Post Corporation. Public hearings were held in all regions 
of the country and then a complete report was issued.  The conclusion 
was very clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a country such as Canada, whose landmass is so great and 
population so widely dispersed, no private system will ever be able to 
provide a universal service for a reasonable price.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the last ten years, the Canada Post Corporation has not 
received any public money and we have to make sure it never again 
becomes a burden for the Canadian taxpayer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the government decided, last spring, to give the corporation 
the means to ensure its long term viability. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last April the government directed Canada Post to offer 
Canadians universal postal service at a reasonable price, 
institute more transparent reporting and the highest standards of 
business practice, achieve financial performance consistent with 
the private sector regulated monopolies, continuously improve 
letter mail and retail service especially in rural Canada, 
respect stamp price freeze for two years and then maintain stamp 
price increases below inflation, ensure no cross-subsidization 
from exclusive privileged products, create an ombudsman position, 
and recognize these principles in labour negotiation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada Post has already moved on many of these items.  It has 
opened its books and published its annual report.  It has 
appointed an ombudsman and it has demonstrated that there is no 
cross-subsidization between its exclusive products and the 
competitive ones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the past several months Canada Post has also committed 
significant resources to transforming and improving postal 
service in rural Canada.  The result will be faster, more 
reliable and more predictable service in rural Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Beyond these specific initiatives there is an urgent need for 
the corporation to address service improvement at a more basic 
level.  This is why it has become a key factor in the current 
negotiations.  In its current form the collective agreement is a 
major barrier to making the service improvements customers are 
demanding from Canada Post. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In an independent evaluation, Gordon Ritchie, well known as the 
deputy chief negotiator of the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement, 
said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Union of Postal Workers has been remarkably 
successful over the past 23 years in arrogating to its members 
the lion's share of economic rents from the Canada Post monopoly. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recent polls show that around 85% of Canadians believe that 
Canada Post employees generally have good working conditions 
especially with regard to pay and benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ritchie came to this conclusion: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The existing Canada Post Corporation collective agreements 
constitute what is arguably the most uncompetitive and 
inefficient labour agreement currently in place in any 
jurisdiction in North America. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also specified: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Excessive wages are not the main problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pay for time not worked is an even more substantial direct cost 
burden. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most costly provisions over the long run are probably those 
restricting the Canada Post Corporation's ability to terminate, 
to redeploy or to employ more efficiently its huge workforce. 
</UL>
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is precisely what is at the heart of the present dispute. 
Canada Post must be able to adjust its work force to its needs.  Let me 
illustrate this point with a concrete example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last spring, the corporation started a reassignment process for 47 
of its Toronto employees who were surplus by following to the letter the 
provisions of the collective agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a very complex process whereby employees can apply, 
according to seniority, for vacant positions.  After seven months, the 
corporation had managed to reassign four of the 47 employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Still according to the established process, management will be able 
during the next few months to reassign the others to vacant positions. 
This staff movement will have, in the end, involved hundreds of 
personnel. 
And altogether it will have taken a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, in most cases the reassigned employees need training to 
perform their new duties, which means their productivity is lower for a 
long time.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, the yoke in which the management of Canada Post must 
work involves operating costs that have a considerable impact on the 
competitiveness of the corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current collective agreement that binds Canada Post and the 
Canadian Union of Postal Workers contains dozens of clauses that are 
equally inconsistent with the competitive world in which the corporation 
must operate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is only for this reason that the bill before us today requires 
the mediator-arbitrator to “be guided by the need for terms and 
conditions of employment that are consistent with those in comparable 
industries in the private and public sectors and that will provide the 
necessary degree of flexibility to ensure the short- and long-term 
economic viability and competitiveness of the Canada Post 
Corporation”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also ask him to take into account that the corporation must, 
without resorting to undue increases in postal rates, perform 
financially in a commercially acceptable range, operate efficiently, 
improve productivity and meet acceptable standards of service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Employee pay and benefits account for 63% of Canada Post's 
operating costs. The most surprising thing is that too much of this goes 
to unproductive employee activities. But this should not in any way be 
seen as blaming Canada Post's employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, the vast majority of them are devoted and qualified 
workers. Rather, the flaw comes from an obsolete system that badly needs 
modernizing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, every day, the 16,000 letter carriers spend an average 
of 16 minutes on a bus or in a taxi to go back to their depot at lunch 
time. They do not have the right to eat on the road, even though this 
would suit them better. Their collective agreement forbids it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we only allowed those who use a motor vehicle to eat on the 
road, the corporation could save $8 million a year. But this is not 
allowed either by the current collective agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On September 15 of this year, the Post Canada Corporation submitted 
a comprehensive offer to the union. 
In exchange for concessions on human resource management issues, Canada 
Post has offered pay increases of 1.5% for each year in the contract, 
the creation of 500 full time positions and the preservation of full job 
security for those who already have it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few weeks later, in order to prevent a strike, Canada Post waived 
some of its demands, improved its pay increase offer and accepted a 
union demand on overtime carrying a cost of $35 million a year. The 
union refused again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said earlier, this labour conflict is in a class of its own. 
As the labour minister has so ably demonstrated, the Government of 
Canada has done everything it could to create a climate conducive to a 
negotiated settlement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Three experienced mediators and conciliation officers have helped 
the parties with all their skill and expertise. We have given the 
bargaining process every opportunity, but all to no avail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime, hundreds of small businesses have experienced 
difficulties. Hundreds of men and women have lost their jobs. Dozens of 
charities have been deprived of their principal means of collecting the 
donations they need for their activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have received personally over 2,000 messages from postal service 
users throughout the country begging the government to step in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This strike has already been the cause of major damage to our 
economy and our social fabric. That is why we had to resort to back to 
work legislation. We are not doing it lightheartedly but because we feel 
this is our responsibility. We acknowledge this is not a perfect 
solution. This conflict, like previous conflicts, will leave scars. 
Many customers will not go back to Canada post. In the absence of postal 
services, they have found alternatives, and often permanent ones. That 
is what have done for over a million recipients of our various social 
program benefits who have chosen direct deposit in the last few months. 
Those postal revenues are lost forever.

</I></B></P><P align=left>To prevent such conflicts in the future, mentalities must 
definitely be changed and more efficient mechanisms developed to manage 
labour relations at Canada Post. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why, in the next few months, I intend to undertake serious 
research to find instruments better suited to the realities and 
imperatives of the Canadian postal system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some progress is already obvious. For the first time in history, 
Canada Post completely suspended its operations and did not use 
replacement workers. This is a first step in the right direction. Many 
others will be needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime, I urge all my colleagues to support this 
legislation for the speedy resumption of postal services, which will 
greatly help our small businesses, our charities, and all Canadians. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Questions and 
comments.  I would ask hon. members to keep their questions and 
responses short as there is quite a lot of interest. 
<P><A NAME="LINK204"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I guess you 
could see right into my mind as I have many questions for the 
minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First I would like to comment on the fact that in his speech the 
minister stated that there was an openness in the accounting of 
the post office and that there is no evidence of 
cross-subsidization between regular first class mail, ad mail and 
the Purolator courier business.  As a matter of fact, that is not 
accurate. The books of Canada Post do not clearly show the 
separate accounting of those arms of the post office. 
Consequently, the statement the minister made is really not 
accurate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to ask the minister to comment on a second 
point, one of process.  It is very intriguing to me that after 
weeks of hesitating to intervene, now the government has gone 
overboard and intervened to the point of stating wage increases 
and the dates they are effective.  That is wrong.  Back to work 
legislation should say that there may not be a strike until there 
is an agreement and then there should be a mechanism to force the 
parties together with a mediator or arbitrator which should be 
binding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the minister has time, I would also like to know about any 
long term plans they have, which I doubt, after this thing is 
settled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano:</B>   Mr. Speaker, I do not think the 
time of the House would allow me to prove to the hon. member that 
there is no cross-subsidization. Definitely I will send him the 
appropriate documents so he can see them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of future plans, I stated in my speech that after this 
thing is over, and naturally this is not something anybody takes 
pride in but we have to restore the service. There is nothing 
new, as a lot of people know.  In the past when trying to 
modernize the system, management and labour relations at Canada 
Post have been very turbulent. We have to go to the root of the 
problem and definitely look at it in a different way which we 
have done.  The last strike was in 1991.  Each time the 
government gives a mandate to make sure that Canadians can rely 
on a universal postal service, the union reacts differently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope once the Minister of Labour appoints a mediator that we 
can have normal relations which we have always sought to have 
with the administration of Canada Post. As I said, I will 
research other ways, other avenues so that the next time around 
Canadians will not be faced with what they have had in the past 
13 years.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réjean Lefebvre (Champlain, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, according to the 
minister, they will make $200 million a year in profits. Will the 
minister stop at $200 million or will he be greedy and go up to $300 
million or $400 million?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are the minister and the corporation not willing to invest 
these hundreds of millions of dollars to provide more services to the 
public and to maintain a healthy relationship between the corporation 
and its employees? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano:</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened to the speech made 
by the member earlier. Unfortunately, the member wants to see only one 
side of the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's mandate is clear. The government wants a 
commercially viable corporation. Yes, we want Canada Post to make 
profits to pay for its employees' salaries and to continue to provide 
Canadians with reasonably priced services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member is forgetting to indicate that the government has 
decided not to close rural post offices because we want all Canadians, 
wherever they live, to receive the same level of service as those who 
live in urban areas. He should also note that we have told Canada Post 
it cannot increase the price of stamps for the next two years. This is 
so Canadians do not have to pay for an increase in the cost of postal 
services. 
After two years, the corporation will be allowed to increase prices by 
less than the inflation rate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course this is a government decision. We could have made another 
decision. We made this one because we want to guarantee universal postal 
services in Canada, from coast to coast. We think this mandate will help 
us reach that goal. We are asking employees to sign, as did three of the 
four unions at Canada Post. We are asking the Canadian Union of Postal 
Workers to sign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, we reached a deadlock and had to bring in 
back-to-work legislation, but we would like the parties to sit 
down and look for solutions so that Canadians can continue to 
enjoy postal services that are among the best in the world. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK206"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
listened very carefully to the minister's speech. I am glad to 
say that at least in some of the preamble in the early part of 
the speech there were things I was very pleased to hear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, there is a recognition that Canada Post is actually doing 
a very good job in delivering unbelievable quantities of mail 
across the country.  Productivity has increased. Mail delivery 
access to individual homes has increased 30% and profits are up 
to $112 million. Given there was an increase in productivity and 
an increase in profits, Canada Post Corporation saw fit to offer 
a reasonable wage increase during the negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question to the minister would be how can the government 
justify in the legislation we are dealing with today the fact 
that the wage offer that will be bound in this legislation is 
actually lower than the wage offer Canada Post had offered its 
employees during the rounds of bargaining?  Can we get a comment 
from the minister to that effect, please. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano:</B>  First of all, Mr. Speaker, if the 
member looks at what is in the bill, it is very close to the 
final offer Canada Post made to its employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me address that issue and I thank the member for giving me 
the opportunity on how the offer came about.  This was an offer 
from Canada Post.  The House will recall very well that the union 
was saying in those days that they would go on strike illegally. 
Hearing those rumours, most of Canada Post's customers were not 
putting their mail in the boxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The president, Mr. Clermont, called Mr. Tingley and said, “The 
volume of business is melting like snow in springtime.  Maybe we 
should sit down and try to solve this because, yes, we are going 
to lose our shirt at Canada Post, but your members might lose 
their jobs”. That is why Canada Post went to the negotiation 
table in good faith and gave some concessions to the union that 
it was asking for before and made a better financial offer. Again 
the union turned it down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since that offer, Canada Post has lost $17 million a day.  If we 
count the number of days of the strike and if we count the loss 
that Canada Post incurred two weeks before because of the rumour 
that there would be an illegal strike, the financial loss is 
greater than anything that could be in this bill we are talking 
about today. 
<P><A NAME="LINK207"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean Dubé (Madawaska—Restigouche, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
if there is one thing we can say today to the hon. minister, it 
is that it is about time.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Millions of dollars have been lost by charity groups, businesses 
and others who are a vital part of our society.  What do we say 
to these people? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. minister mentioned that he will start discussions for 
different mechanisms to avoid this in the future.  I ask the 
minister who will participate in these discussions, government, 
unions, business, charity groups?  Does his department have any 
ideas of different mechanisms that he would suggest can be put in 
place? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano:</B>  Mr. Speaker, as I said in my 
speech, I would like to look at the situation.  We need to 
research.  If I had a solution that I would be sure would work, I 
would have announced it today.  What I want to ask after we 
restore service to Canadians is different. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the member for his question.  Not only the minister and 
his officials but there are Canada Post officials, the union and 
other businesses, big and small, and researchers, people in the 
universities who look at postal relations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a situation where 55% of the business of Canada Post is 
a monopoly and 45% competes directly with private sector 
businesses. The question we have to ask ourselves is should we 
continue?  How do we balance that 45% and 50%?  Should we have 
the right to strike and a monopoly?  What about the competition 
with the private sector? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a very complex question.  I hope to ask some experts of 
different backgrounds and have them propose some solutions which 
we can implement.  Then the next time the collective agreement is 
ready to expire we can have a negotiated settlement and not a 
recourse to disruption of services that is very costly. Canadians 
like their Canada Post services all across the country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I realize I have only a few minutes.  There are just a few points 
I would like to make. How much time do I have Mr. Speaker?  I 
thought I had only a few minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The member is 
correct.  The debate concludes in three minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  What I wanted to do, Mr. Speaker, was 
reflect on the irony that back to work legislation sometimes 
brings to this place.  It seems to me, having been through a 
number of these back to work legislation debates, that Parliament 
is both at its worst and at its best in these back to work 
debates. It is at its worst because we see a tendency on the part 
of the government to want to bring out the heavy procedural 
artillery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government was prepared yesterday to move a motion, Motion 
No. 8, which really amounted to a form of super closure.  On 
reflection, all opposition parties and perhaps even the 
government, would want to reflect on the ultimate receivability 
and appropriateness of such motions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have ordinary procedures for dealing with legislation, 
ordinary procedures which provide for various forms of time 
allocation and agreement among the parties.  Yet when we get into 
a situation of back to work legislation, all of a sudden all of 
that is suspended. What was sad yesterday was that certain of the 
opposition parties were willing to let their rights be trampled 
in this way without so much as even asking for something in 
return. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We objected but we were in a position where we were trying to 
come to an agreement with the government in order to make sure 
that this back to work legislation, as unacceptable as it is, 
would be better than it might otherwise have been had we not 
entered into negotiations with the government.  We have an 
understanding that a certain amendment of ours with respect to 
the mandate of the mediator-arbitrator will be accepted when we 
get to committee of the whole.  The legislation as a result will 
be much fairer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That does not take away from the fact that Motion No. 8 as it 
was presented and ultimately carried by the government is a form 
of super-duper closure to which all of us should take great 
offence.  Not enough offence was taken yesterday in the context 
of what went on.

<A NAME="LINK211">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That Bill C-24, in Clause 8, be amended by 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(a) replacing line 39 on page 3 with the following: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“subject to subsection (1.1), the Minister shall after the 
coming” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b) adding the following after line 45 on page 3: 
</UL></UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“(1.1) The Minister shall, in so far as it is possible, 
appoint a mediator-arbitrator who is satisfactory to the 
parties”. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I may, I will take a few minutes to go into 
a little more detail on the reason for this amendment we in the 
Bloc Quebecois wish to move, which requires the mediator-arbitrator 
to be satisfactory to both parties, that is labour and management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is self-evident that there are still many question marks 
about the pseudo-negotiation that has taken place in recent months, 
and in particular in recent weeks.  Has there really been any true 
negotiation?  This is all the more the case because we find some 
rather surprising things in sections 15 and 16 of the Radwanski 
report of October 1996.  I will quote that report if I may. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recommendation 14, the report says “That the government 
direct Canada Post Corporation to bring its labour costs under the 
collective agreement into line with the realities of the 
contemporary Canadian workplace, through good-faith bargaining in 
the 1997 contract negotiations”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This report already shows a tendency to legitimize the action 
of Canada Post for a hardening of attitude toward labour, and hence 
the necessity, in my opinion, for a mediator-arbitrator who is 
satisfactory to both parties, as I call for in my amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recommendation 15 of the 1996 Radwanski report reads as 
follows “That in the event of a failure of the collective 
bargaining process to achieve the necessary adjustments without 
service disruption, the government be prepared to take appropriate 
action to protect the immediate public interest and ensure the 
long-term financial soundness of a strategically repositioned 
Canada Post Corporation”. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1650"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT75"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT75"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1650
<A HREF="#LINKT76"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT74"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, recommendation 15 provides clearly that the government 
must be ready to demand, as soon as the union takes democratic 
action—because the right to strike is an acquired right and it 
is a democratic act to exercise it—home delivery service in 
urban centres providing letter carrier delivery, subject to the 
availability of resources, after giving priority to improving the 
speed and reliability of delivery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, having accepted the Radwanski report in October 1996, 
Canada Post latched onto recommendations 14 and 15 to create the 
appearance of negotiations.  Subsequently, the statements by the 
Minister of Public Works were tendentious and surprising, to say 
the least, given that a responsible minister should want the 
parties to come to an agreement.  What did he say?  He said, rather 
than remain neutral, that the union was pretending to negotiate. 
He also said that there were many good reasons for the union to 
strike for more, and that it just wanted to strike. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Name me one worker, unionized or not, who wants to picket for 
weeks and lose his pay.  This is quite surprising from the 
minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, given the minister's statements and recommendations 
14 and 15 of the Radwanski report, it seems to me that, if we are 
to be honest and objective, we must have a mediator-arbitrator 
acceptable to both parties.  In addition, we heard about what I 
would call dubious support from the Canadian Direct Marketing 
Association.  These are the people that deliver <I>Reader's Digest</I>, 
and other publications.  It gets a preferential rate.  Canada Post 
is a partner in this company.  Is it in conflict of interest then? 
So it was rather dubious for Canada Post to be giving Direct 
Marketing preferential rates and then asking it to give it support 
publicly as it opposed the potential strike by the union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did Purolator also sign an agreement, and quickly I would 
add?  Canada Post owns 75% of it. 
Did Canada Post place itself in a conflict of interest position by 
signing immediately and quickly with Purolator, which offered reasonable 
terms, and slowing down the negotiation process with its own workers 
because in the event of a strike it had access to a service that was 
cost-effective, as it was 75% owned by the corporation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why was the 1995 collective agreement signed before the previous 
one expired and why was it impossible to even sit at the table to 
negotiate this one? This is incredible. We must ask ourselves serious 
questions about Canada Post and its approach, hence the need of a 
mediator-arbitrator mutually agreed on by both parties, as suggested in 
my amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has also been rumoured that the government might possibly ask 
the Canada Post Corporation to pay $200 million a year in dividends. 
There have been such rumours. 
This hinders the process or can give the impression that there is a 
government-Canada Post coalition to go for these dividends at the 
expense of the workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These reasons prompted me to suggest and truly hope that the 
selected mediator will be acceptable to both parties, bearing in mind 
that the Canada Post Corporation is not there to make profits. Its role 
is to provide a service, and the money it makes should be used to create 
jobs through delivery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that, for some time, like some sectors in the Sorel area, 
any new postal sector no longer benefits from mail delivery service. 
Super mailboxes are used instead. There are also contradictions: in a 
small town like Saint-Joseph-de-Sorel, with a population of 2,000, mail 
delivery services are provided, while in a city like Nicolet, with a 
population of 7,000, there are none. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why not use the profits generated to expand services, serve the 
public better and ensure at the same time that jobs are created for our 
children? What is the point of eliminating interesting jobs? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1655"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT76"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT76"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1655
<A HREF="#LINKT77"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT75"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>So in its struggle the union is not necessarily fighting for the 
protection of its own interests. In fact, this struggle is to prevent 
Canada Post from challenging the workers' acquired rights. In fact, it 
is a struggle for the right to work full time instead of part time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what they are fighting for, and it is not only the postal 
workers who are benefiting, because they are the standard bearers for 
all workers in crown corporations and also in quasi-public corporations. 
They are in fact preventing Canada Post from falling apart by forcing it 
to continue to provide complete, personalized services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen post offices closed down, we have seen the super 
mailboxes. How far will this go? They want to eliminate part of letter 
carrier services. How far do they want to go? What is the future of 
Canada Post? It will become an organization whose profits are handed 
down to the government, as was done with unemployment insurance, and 
then they will develop a technology that does nothing for job creation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A fair arbitrator chosen by both parties is required. This is 
necessary because we have heard all sorts of messages during these 
so-called negotiations, including that $1 million is saved for each 
minute that is taken from postal workers. All sorts of numbers have been 
thrown about, but Canada Post has not stopped directly attacking service 
to the public, a direct and full service, which is essential. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The consequences of the lost of jobs on small regions, in Quebec as 
elsewhere, are extremely significant. 
When there are five or six employees in my region, and then this group 
is cut to four, that is one job less for the young people who want to 
live in that region. But that is not the only job. Dozens of jobs could 
be created for young people in our towns, or communities, instead of 
concentrating the money in automated sorting centres which in fact 
provide poor service to the public with five-day delivery, instead of 
the one-day service we had before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I would like to say that the choice of a 
mediator-arbitrator could allow this Parliament and its members to show 
on whose side they are. Earlier, the member for Abitibi, instead of 
defending the workers—a former union leader, and the member for Anjou, 
a former union leader of the CEQ—voted for the bill. It is incredible 
to vote for such a bill and to say “they are well paid”. But what do 
they want in their regions? Part time jobs paying $6 or $7 an hour? 
We want good paying jobs because it is with such jobs that car dealers, 
restaurant owners and businesses can sell their products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What Canada Post is doing is distributing money. It should be 
remembered that Canada Post does not have a deficit. At the moment, it 
is showing a profit. This profit should therefore simply be distributed 
in the form of services to the public and of job creation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I am not afraid to state outright today, in conclusion 
to the amendment I am proposing, that I am on the side of my region, I 
am on the side of full time jobs and I am on the side of plain common 
sense.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government 
Services, Lib.):</b> Mr. Chairman, I would like of course to correct somewhat 
the comments made by the hon. member for Richelieu. Given his 
experience, the member should not make statements which I would call 
gratuitous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I never said that I wanted to make the union look bad. At the time 
I met the Canadian Direct Marketing Association, I also met the union 
leaders. I told them clearly that I recognized their right to strike. In 
fact, the member should realize that, for the first time in the history 
of the Canada Post Corporation, we have a strike with no violence on the 
picket lines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Louis Plamondon:</b> It is not because of you, but because of the 
postal workers. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1700"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano:</b> Mr. Chairman, indeed, but the Canada Post 
Corporation did not hire replacement workers, even though it had the 
right to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem on that side is that the Bloc Quebecois and the New 
Democratic Party have no objectivity and believe every word union 
leaders might say. They are at their mercy. I never made the comments 
attributed to me by the hon. member. I always defended the workers' 
right to strike. Postal workers have the right to strike. I also said 
that we must protect the interests of all Canadians, not just those of 
some like the unions and the large corporations. This is what we are 
doing today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, before making gratuitous statements or putting words in my 
mouth, the hon. member for Richelieu should be very specific and he 
should prove his claim, instead of relying on hearsay or on comments 
made by others. In this House, we must report things accurately, not 
rely on hearsay or on comments that others may have made. I hope the 
hon. member will have the courage to admit that what he reported in this 
House was actually said by others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Louis Plamondon:</b> Mr. Chairman, I do not want to start a 
debate on this, but I would simply like to say to the minister 
that, if he had listened to the news on television, he would have 
heard himself saying that the union was pretending to negotiate. 
That is plainly what he said on television. 
<P><A NAME="LINK213"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les 
Basques, BQ):</b> Mr. Chairman, the debate on this clause is proof that 
our amendment is a good one.  It says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(1.1) The Minister shall, in so far as it is possible, 
appoint a mediator-arbitrator who is satisfactory to the 
parties. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to note that, in the initial bill, it is the 
minister who does the appointing in a dispute, without saying who 
is wrong or right, whether it is the union or the employer.  The 
basic principle is that the first job of the 
mediator-arbitrator—not just an arbitrator, but a 
mediator-arbitrator—we see this in subsection (2) of the clause, 
is to endeavour to mediate all the matters referred to in 
subsection (1) and to bring about an agreement between the 
parties on those matters. 
It is therefore very important that justice appear to be done, that 
those who come to the bargaining table, on both the employer and 
the union sides, feel they are able to put a minimum level of trust 
in the person appointed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois' amendment basically makes a lot of good 
sense.  I think the government should receive it in this spirit. 
The purpose of the amendment is not to win a battle against the 
government, but to ensure better conditions, better labour 
relations in a milieu that has had a very troubled past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The past history of Canada Post must be remembered.  There 
have been difficult periods  In 1995, there was almost model 
bargaining.  I went to Kanata, not far from Ottawa, with the 
president of the union and the negotiator, Philippe Arbour, to try 
to persuade the municipality to adopt mechanized services for 
letter carriers. 
This is not the stand unions usually take. It is a stand that would help 
people find a job and develop it in order to improve the quality of the 
service provided. So, the mediator-arbitrator appointed at this stage 
should try to define the working conditions. He should bring the parties 
to an agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier, when the minister spoke, I just listened to what he had to 
say. By taking part in this debate, I want to ensure the best 
relationship possible between the two parties and I think the government 
is wrong in not addressing the substance of the issue. In committee of 
the whole, we are trying to come up with the best legislation possible 
because Canadians and Quebeckers alike want their postal service back, 
but a postal service that works. If the government is unable to take 
this issue seriously, we can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us go back to the purpose of the amendment. The amendment is to 
simplify the legislation, where it says that the minister shall appoint 
a mediator-arbitrator. We agree that the minister can appoint the 
mediator-arbitrator, but we think that, as much as possible, the 
appointee should meet with the approval of the two parties involved. We 
just want to ensure the best conditions possible. We are also taking 
clause 9 into consideration. We have showed what is most important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a question and comment period. Unless I 
am mistaken, during this debate, every hon. member can have the floor 
and the others should listen to his arguments without trying to dispute 
them while the member is on his feet.

the Canada Post Corporation as if it were a private business. Doing away

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):</b>  Mr. Chairman, I 
would like to speak very briefly to this amendment which would 
put in place final offer selection arbitration to address the 
matter of pay schedules rather than having it done through an 
arbitrary manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly when these matters arose in the House and during 
question period when we questioned the Minister of Labour, he 
stressed the need to have a negotiated settlement.  We agree with 
him.  We think a negotiated settlement far surpasses an imposed 
settlement any time.  However, we also believe the use of final 
offer selection arbitration is a tool that can be used equally by 
both sides and is a very worthwhile tool that can be used in 
instances like these without having to use this method of back to 
work legislation, a method, I might add, that has come to be 
counted on by labour and management.  It is less than a perfect 
situation at any time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Jim Gouk:</b>  Mr. Chairman, I will just add very briefly 
to that.  Contained in this amendment on final offer arbitration 
is a specific mechanism for the selection of what would be an 
arbitration panel.  We will not go into all the details as it is 
available here and the vote on it will be deferred until 6.30. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was mentioned in debate today.  It provides a very specific 
mechanism for the selection of one arbitrator from the union 
side, one arbitrator from the Canada Post side and one jointly 
selected to be the third member and chair of the panel.  It also 
provides very specific timelines in order to have the parties 
make their presentations.  It also provides a mechanism for the 
panel to make a decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, if any member wants a detailed reading of it, I would 
be happy to show them a copy between now and 6.30.  It is also on 
file with the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>The Assistant Deputy Chairman:</b>  The amendment is three

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</b>  Mr. Chairman, we 
have been hearing a lot about this whole issue of final offer 
selection in the last couple of weeks.  I think virtually 
everybody who has risen to speak on it first prefaced their 
remarks by saying there is no substitute for a freely negotiated 
settlement.  I think we are all in agreement on that, even the 
mover of this amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole idea of final offer selection is a choice that some 
people make in the course of labour management negotiations and 
it has its place in a very limited application.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As such, even in this round of bargaining, had the two parties 
agreed that it was a suitable way to resolve the issue they could 
have opted for it at any time in the process.  Both the Canada 
Labour Code and the collective agreement in effect have 
provisions that if the two parties agree they may settle their 
outstanding issues by any type of binding arbitration.  Final 
offer selection is only one of those types of binding 
arbitration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have personally used final offer selection as a union 
representative in the province of Manitoba.  Final offer 
selection was law in that province for six or seven years.  The 
NDP introduced it.  It survived four or five years until the 
Filmon government was elected and then it was chucked out.  As a 
union representative in the dozens of union negotiations I 
conducted we may have used it three or four times.  In a limited 
application we see its use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole premise is that when we have narrowed down all the 
outstanding issues to a couple of simple straightforward issues 
like money possibly the two parties could see fit to use it. Even 
in the province of Manitoba it was optional.  Either side could 
make application to the minister to solve its outstanding issues 
either 60 days prior to a strike or 90 days after a strike. 
Those were the windows during which we could opt for this FOS. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>United Food and Commercial Workers Union used it a lot.  CUPE 
was vehemently opposed to the idea.  The steelworkers played with 
it as did the carpenters union.  I might have used it a maximum 
of five times over the course of seven or eight years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Final offer selection had its origins in pro baseball and it is 
still used there.  After the union negotiated all the outstanding 
issues except for money and the two parties still did not have 
the monetary package resolved, the employees put in their final 
offer and the employer puts in its last offer.  The arbitrator 
can choose one or the other but not a combination of both.  There 
is no cafeteria style shopping here.  It is one or the other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should try to transpose that into the type of bargaining we 
see at Canada Post.  Anybody with any sense of or any background 
in labour relations would see immediately that there would be 
pandemonium.  It simply could not be done in negotiations that 
involved a complex set of rules of work or issues the current 
round of bargaining has been bogged down in.  There is simply no 
way in the world that FOS would be useful, which is why the very 
experienced people at the table have chosen not to exercise their 
right to settle this round of negotiations with final offer 
selection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To follow the recommendation put forward in this amendment and 
to institutionalize FOS so that all negotiations from hereon 
forward will be resolved by FOS would be absolutely ludicrous. It 
indicates to me a lack of knowledge of the subject.  It is as if 
somebody stumbled on a new idea and decided to give it a whirl. 
There is media attention so the idea is being milked over and 
over again until most of us on this side of the House are sick of 
hearing about FOS.  If I never hear the word again it will be too 
soon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I speak very strongly against any such introduction.  The only 
latitude we would see necessary in the Canada Labour Code would 
be in the ability of the two parties, should they see fit, to 
conclude their negotiations through the process of binding 
arbitration.  One of those offers may be final offer selection.

Basques, BQ):</b> Mr. Speaker, I will try to be as brief and as concise 
as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those listening, so that they may understand properly, the 
final offer means that the union and management sides each make an 
overall proposal, and the arbitrator, or in this case the 
arbitration board, decides which of the two will be accepted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the public sector, this means that things are greatly 
distorted from the start, because the union members will want to be 
sure that their final offer as possible is accepted. 
This exerts terrible pressure and so, finally, the union offer 
contains virtually nothing, to ensure it will be accepted.

of time ahead.  Nobody is talking about cutting the salary of the 
chairman of the board at Canada Post if no agreement is reached, 
nor of its executive director.  If such a situation existed in the 
bargaining process, perhaps agreement would be reached more 
quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The final offer, particularly in the clause we have before us, 
is a nebulous and complicated matter, and one which create new 
labour relations law. 
I believe that we should make sure that special legislation does not 
create a precedent which could be applied to other sectors and 
systematically lead to interpretations which would harm good labour 
relations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am dealing with clause 9, which is a key clause. I hope that the 
House will come up with an amendment to clause 9 because as it stands 
now, if we have final offer selection on top of it, it would amount to 
telling the arbitrator or the arbitration panel “Now you are going to 
manage this whole thing, and look at it as if it were a private company, 
a totally private firm, and at the same time you will be looking for the 
best way to settle the dispute”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This would mean that to reach a settlement the union would have to 
accept working conditions similar to those in the private sector. We saw 
this kind of struggle at UPS in the United States. 
The union won because it convinced people of the need for regular 
workers, and permanent jobs. But with final offer selection, the union 
and workers involved would have been stuck with unacceptable conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To conclude, the Reform Party's proposal may have been made in good 
faith, but in my view it is unacceptable because it is too vague and it 
does not provide both sides with a level playing field.

Quebecois has moved an amendment to this clause that provides that the 
arbitrator must maintain the parameters for a public service that must 
finance itself, which are currently set out in the incorporating act of 
Canada Post. The parameters provided by the minister to the arbitrator 
in the bill give him no choice.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada Post must be managed as a private business with terms and 
conditions such as the ones imposed on the private sector, while Canada 
Post is a public service under its own act. This wording shows that the 
government is asking the arbitrator to pursue the same objectives for 
negotiations as Canada Post, that is no increase in postal rates while 
reducing the costs to Canada Post. However, the only area where such 
reductions are possible is in manpower. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The corporation has been admitting since the beginning of its 
negotiations that its objective is to recover $200 million on its 
manpower costs, which means the abolition of 4,000 positions. This 
indication from the government is not made at random. 
Indeed, the government expects that Canada Post will provide it with 
dividends of about $200 million in the next few years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thus, when the government has the choice between creating jobs and 
increasing its capital, it chooses its own financial interests at the 
expense of workers. We have seen this choice being made in other areas 
such as unemployment where, at the expense of the unemployed, the 
government has been raking in money by the billions. We must also 
remember the famous rail strike. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Pat Martin:</b>  Mr. Chairman, more than any other clause 
I think in the legislative package that caught everyone's eye and 
that everyone was immediately drawn to was clause 9.  There was 
very broad agreement among our caucus that this clause had to be 
amended in order to make the legislation fair, to not tie the 
hands of the arbitrator and to result in any kind of settlement 
that might have a lasting resolve to try to put back together the 
shattered labour relations environment at Canada Post. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have put forward amendments to the legislation that we 
believe would still meet the goals of the government when it puts 
forward this language, but take away some of the language that we 
felt was overtly partisan or one-sided. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had strong feelings that the arbitrator, if bound by the 
original legislation, would have no option really in bringing 
down their ruling.  They would have no opportunity to consider 
all the normal factors that an arbitrator should be bound by 
because there would be a preconceived outcome to the arbitrator's 
role by some of this language. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, some of the language that we particularly objected 
to was the original language in clause 9(a)(i) where Canada Post 
would be bound to perform financially in a commercially 
acceptable range. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At first reading, that seems like a fairly innocuous statement. 
In actual fact, it would be an enormous policy shift for Canada 
Post in terms that it would be now bound.  First of all, it is 
too vague because it does not say what sort of comparison, what 
is commercially viable.  Second, it would be bound to a different 
way of conducting business forever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our feeling was that if the government is interested in changing 
a mandate of Canada Post or changing the Canada Post Corporation 
Act, it should be done through the front door with amendments 
moved to the Canada Post Corporation Act and not through the back 
door with back to work legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This clearly went beyond what was necessary to get the employees 
back to work or to settle this round of bargaining.  In fact, it 
read like a wish list for Canada Post. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment that we are putting forward would still address 
all the legitimate concerns of the architects of this original 
clause but in a far more balanced way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would suggest that the real goal here is that the 
mediator/arbitrator shall be guided by the need for terms and 
conditions of employment that are consistent with the Canada Post 
Corporation Act and the viability and financial stability of 
Canada Post, taking into account that Canada Post Corporation 
must without recourse undo increases in postal costs, operate 
efficiently, improve their productivity and meet acceptable 
standards of service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That really sums up what the goals and objectives should be for 
a well-run organization bound by the parameters of the existing 
Canada Post Corporation Act.

always a pleasure to speak under your supervision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wanted to say that this is a very important amendment because, if 
we go for the status quo, this is purely and simply neo-liberal waffle 
about efficiency without any reference to the true nature of the 
corporation. Believe it or not, the initial wording of this provision 
did not even mention—what gall, and I can see the House leader nod in 
approval—that it was a public service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is at issue today, which this amendment brings into focus, is 
of course that one can be unionized and at the same time believe in 
productivity. 
One can be an efficient unionized worker, a unionized worker who 
believes that sound labour-management relations are required if we want 
things to go well in the workplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Productivity does not come out of thin air. It comes with 
motivation in the workplace. To be committed to one's work, one needs to 
feel respected. In turn, this requires that one's day-to-day working 
conditions be negotiated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This particular amendment, put forward by both the Bloc and the NDP—and 
hopefully others will support it too—very clearly states that, 
in order for this productivity to be achieved, there have to be sound 
labour-management relations. Labour-management relations may be 
considered as an acceptable requirement. We are saying that how the 
mediator-arbitrator makes decisions and brings both parties together 
will have to be a clear objective. 
It is important that we, as parliamentarians, have the courage to say 
and to reaffirm this. That is what this amendment encourages us to do.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu, BQ):</b> Mr. Chairman, I will be 
brief. I want to say a word on the amendment proposed by the NDP, 
in co-operation with the Bloc Quebecois. We are proposing this 
amendment following meetings with union negotiators who are 
concerned about the current wording of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are concerned about the concept of private corporation, of 
business venture, since the raison d'être of Canada Post is to provide 
to the public a service that is meant to be very personalized, direct 
and efficient, with the help of its employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A short while ago, after my first speech, I received a telephone 
call in my office from a postal worker in Edmonton. He wanted to thank 
the Bloc Quebecois for defending his interests. 
His first name is Ron. He told me “I voted for the Liberal Party the 
last time, but I wonder how its members, given what they were saying 
back then, can now introduce this legislation, which follows the same 
pattern as the negotiations did”. By this he meant that the negotiations 
were biased from the beginning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government introduced a bill, supposedly to restore a public 
service, but the mediator's objectivity is already tainted, first 
because the government is appointing this person alone, instead of doing 
it through a consultation process and, second, because the mediator's 
mandate under clause 9 is in contradiction with the corporation's 
fundamental role. This is why the amendment must absolutely be supported 
by all the parties, to do justice to Canada Post employees, but also to 
reflect the corporation's actual role.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and

that we understand exactly what this amendment means. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I understand that the union—and it was confirmed by the 
Bloc member who just spoke—asked the NDP and the Bloc to put 
forward this amendment because of fear.  I have said it many 
times.  The union has the fear that in the government's back 
pocket is the idea that it will privatize Canada Post.  I repeat 
that the government has no intention of doing that.  In French, 
in English and in Italian, the answer is no.  I hope that is 
clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it takes this amendment to have that assurance, then I am 
willing to accept the position of the Minister of Labour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also note what the amendment adds.  Yes, they put 
together certain words and then they added “consistent with the 
Canada Post Corporation Act”, which is perfectly agreeable, 
“and the viability and the financial stability of Canada Post”, 
taking into account all the other lines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My English may not be good, so I will read it in French.  In 
French it says: 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<“consistent with the Canada Post Corporation Act and the viability 
and financial stability of Canada Post”. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Stability and financial viability for me means that any 
business, crown corporation or enterprise, to be financially 
viable and stable has to make a profit.  Sometimes there are good 
days and sometimes there are rainy days.  When a business does 
not make a profit, it needs the profit which it made the year 
before to ensure that the service will continue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want Canada Post to exist for years to come.  It was the 
first institution in this country.   We want it to continue to 
exist for a long time.  We believe that Canadians should receive 
mail from coast to coast to coast.  They should have a universal 
service and pay the same price wherever they live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with this amendment.  However, financial stability and 
viability means that Canada Post has to be commercially viable. 
That is what the government did and what was mandated by the 
government. We told Canada Post very clearly that it had to 
freeze the price of stamps for two years and after two years it 
could increase it below inflation.  We said not to close any more 
rural post offices.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe Canadians in rural communities have the right to a 
postal service. It is the only Canadian identity in those 
communities and we believe in that. In order to keep those 
services, we want improvements. For example, maybe the hon. 
members do not know but there was always this trouble that in a 
small community mail gets sorted in a big city before it comes 
back to be delivered in the small town.  We changed that.  Now 
the local mail is sorted locally and it is being delivered 
locally without going to the main city. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada Post is making improvements because it believes and we 
believe in service.  With this amendment that the government 
accepts, I hope the union and the NDP and the Bloc realize and 
take away this notion of privatization which does not exist. I 
said it clearly.  The government said it clearly.  And my 
predecessors have said it very clearly.  I hope that with that it 
is clear.  However it is also clear that Canada Post has to be a 
viable and stable corporation to serve Canadians.  Therefore it 
has to make profits.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu, BQ):</b> Mr. Chairman, I just want 
to say that hearing the minister speak as he has just done pretty 
much confirms what I said at the beginning of my first 
intervention, which is that he takes himself for the President of 
Canada Post. 
<P><A NAME="LINK238"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les 
Basques, BQ):</b> Mr. Chairman, I do not want the debate on this issue to go 
on forever, but I would like simply to point out one thing. This is not 
a vote that was accepted by the Bloc Quebecois because the unions 
requested it, it is an amendment that is being moved. The government 
recognizes this by voting for the amendment, because if this was just an 
issue of union position, the government would be against it. Therefore, 
the government recognizes this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the two components of the amendment are considered, it is 
obvious that the government had not provided for such a change in its 
bill. If there had not been a proposal from the NDP and our support to 
ensure its understanding, I do not think that the government would have 
accepted it, and I congratulate the government today for having accepted 
it. But it should also be remembered that there are two components. 
It is said that the negotiations must be carried out in 
accordance with the Canada Post Corporation Act, and by taking 
into consideration the need for efficiency, for an increase in 
productivity, and for application of standards, but also the 
importance of good labour-management relations between Canada 
Post and the union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In all this, it is not just an issue of unionism, it is not just an 
issue of management. For several years, people at Canada Post have been 
trying to build new labour relations. There have been experiments with 
a schedule to the agreement whereby mail delivery could be done by 
vehicle, and the postal workers' union has repeatedly requested that 
these measures be implemented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like the minister, I would like to emphasize that we have succeeded 
in saving rural post offices by reversing the Conservatives' policy of 
unscrupulously shutting down rural post offices. 
But this is not to say that in the bill that we will be voting on today, 
it is quite normal that negotiations be carried out under the Canada 
Post Corporation Act and not according to the rules of the market. I 
think this is a victory not only for unionized workers and the union, 
but also for the employer and for every Quebecker and every Canadian, 
and I hope that with this, we will have a postal organization where, 
after the results of the negotiations, the environment will be 
increasingly better.

clarification and what we are asking for is a clarification that 
the fundamental purpose and the fundamental role of Canada Post 
is to serve Canadians by providing first class mail service, not 
as a cash cow to the federal government. The point is not to make

introduced and the mandate went out to make money through Canada 
Post.  Ever since that mandate was initiated some of the major 
problems began, and I know my friend the minister would nod in

Commons, Lib.):</b>  Mr. Chairman, I would just like to add a few 
words in support of what has been said by my cabinet colleague, 
the minister responsible for Canada Post. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have just heard something said across the way that I do not 
believe relates to reality.  First, the amendment we have before 
us speaks of the financial viability of Canada Post.  It speaks 
of principles such as productivity, operating efficiently, and so 
on. This could apply to any corporation.  My colleague has stated 
very clearly that by financial stability and viability the 
government means that Canada Post must operate in a manner 
consistent with comparable industries in the private and public 
sectors. It must operate that way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the reality. Seven years ago Canada Post was not 
operating in the competitive sector as it is today, not because 
we have changed anything but because society has changed.  Fax 
machines, telecommunications equipment, the Internet, electronic 
transfer of data and finances, and so on are a reality.  We must 
all operate with that in mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to add that Canada Post must have sufficient 
flexibility to manage in a competitive environment. If it does 
not, it will lose customers to other businesses. Obviously it has 
to operate that way.  Then of course if it does lose business to 
other enterprises, jobs will be lost and nobody wants that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to do all this, any corporation has to make an 
acceptable financial return on equity.  I heard a colleague 
across the way refer to Canada Post as a cash cow when it makes, 
I believe, something less than 2% return on equity.  Is that a 
cash cow? My colleagues who are learned in accounting would say 
that anything less than approximately 10% return on equity would 
not be a very profitable business.  Obviously a 2% return on 
equity is certainly not a cash cow by anyone's definition and 
certainly not by mine. Additionally the arbitrator will have to 
be guided by the instructions given by the government for the 
corporation to be profitable when he performs his duties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I for one and I am sure all of my colleagues expect that Canada 
Post will be working in a financially sound manner so that it can 
provide valuable services to Canadians in the long term from here 
on in.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 4 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That Bill C-24, in Clause 12, be amended by replacing lines 33 
to 39 on page 5 with the following: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“12. The collective agreement shall also be deemed to be amended by 
increasing the rates of pay in effect as of February 1, 1997 and 
set out in Appendix A to the collective agreement by 1.5% effective 
August 1, 1997, by another 1.75% effective August 1, 1998 and by 
another 2% effective August 1, 1999”. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said: Mr. Chairman, our amendment simply aims at ensuring that 
what is in the legislation is the best offer from management that was on 
the table when negotiations ended. 
For example, this means that the 1.5% increase would be effective 
February 1, 1997 instead of February 1, 1998, the 1.75% increase would 
be effective August 1, 1998 instead of February 1, 1999 and that the 2% 
increase would be effective August 1, 1999 instead of February 1, 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, we want to ensure that the rate increases provided 
for in the special legislation are those that management was willing to 
offer to the union. In the present government proposal, the rate 
increases are lower, which seems unacceptable to us and which does not 
demonstrate a will to create a good labour relations climate. We must 
understand these people. All the offers we are talking about are lower 
than or equal to the inflation rate, and I think, in this regard, there 
was some ground to be made up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We think that, if management saw fit to put these offers on the 
table, they should be considered at this point. In addition, the next 
amendment, brought forward by the NDP, will serve as a complement to our 
amendment, if it is accepted, so as to ensure the rate increases 
provided for in this legislation are the best that could be negotiated 
with the consent of both parties.

Chairman, very briefly I have two points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, I am having a little trouble understanding why in 
changing the dates of implementation they are going back to 
several months before the contract expired.  That one frankly 
confuses me a little.  It is irrelevant in my point of view 
because we are fundamentally opposed to legislating a settlement 
when there is an arbitrator placed in there.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The arbitrator is being told let these people negotiate, let 
them settle if they possible can.  If they cannot then the 
arbitrator is empowered to make those settlements.  If the 
government does not trust its arbitrator, it had better make a 
different choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, if there is an arbitrator, this does not allow them to 
continue negotiations on the very important question of wages. 
Second, if they cannot reach a decision, it should not be the 
government making an arbitrary decision on a corporation it owns 
any more than the union should be able to arbitrarily decide how 
much of a raise it will get and the company not have any 
response. If it cannot be done by negotiation, it should be done 
by some form of arbitration.  That is the reason we are opposed 
to this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Pat Martin:</b>  Mr. Chairman, I will speak very briefly 
on this because the amendment that we are going to speak to next 
that was put forward by the NDP is very similar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We find it very easy to agree in principle with the hon. member 
from the Bloc Quebecois who put forward the last amendment.  We 
too believe that the least the workers should be offered in this 
legislative settlement should be the offer which was last made by 
Canada Post and was left on the bargaining table when the 
bargaining collapsed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To add to that, and you will see when we speak to the next 
amendment, our feeling is that while we believe the Bloc 
Quebecois is correct in its analysis, it should be the floor but 
it should not necessarily be the ceiling.  It is almost merging 
these two resolutions.  We should be merging the idea put forward 
by the Reform Party with the idea put forward by the Bloc. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The arbitrator will be free to choose a wage somewhere between 
the last offer from Canada Post and the last position of the 
union.  It would give them a range to choose from.  It would give 
them a scope the arbitrator could draw from.  We believe that 
would be the best resolve to the whole matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>The Deputy Chairman:</b>  Hon. members, I understand that it 
is not the Chair's purview to do anything but guide the debate.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu, BQ):</b> Mr. Chairman, you will agree 
however that some of the amendments seem more crucial than others and 
this one, since it deals with wages, seems important enough to warrant 
a fairly close examination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been a member of this House for 13 years and I am stunned to 
see that a special bill could be introduced and include lower rates of 
pay than what the employer, Canada Post, has proposed during the 
negotiations. That is where the problem lies. 
It is unacceptable and I am not surprised to see my Liberal colleagues, 
Mr. Charbonneau, Mr. St-Julien, Mr. Coderre—we can name them since we 
are in committee of the whole—remain quiet on this issue and refrain 
from voting or speaking in support of the postal workers in their own 
ridings, to tell them “Yes, the crown corporation did made a 
proposal.” 
It was the lowest offer the management could come up with, but still, in 
the bill it introduced, the government took it away from the postal 
workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier, Minister Gagliano said that he was being unbiased, but in 
the speech he just made, he spoke just like he would if he were 
president of Canada Post and he is taking a tougher stand than the 
president of Canada Post by offering less to the workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why this amendment, coupled with the NDP amendment, would 
be fair to the workers and still be in line with what Canada Post 
proposed during the negotiations. After all, the government cannot be 
allowed to cut even further after tampering with the bargaining process.

We cannot increase— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Louis Plamondon:</b> On a point of order, Mr. Chairman. Is the use

cloudiness. One sure thing, Mr. Chairman, is that when you consider the 
facts, nobody can take offence from those words. The fact is that when 
we deal with a government bill based on Treasury Board guidelines, the 
government cannot give more than what it is ready to give in its own 
negotiations. That is the first point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second point is that the union has been offered 2% in a 
settlement proposal and that it has rejected it. That should also be 
taken into consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most important thing for us is that we should pass this bill as 
quickly as we can because businesses in Quebec are losing $54 million a 
day because of this strike. Charities that should receive millions of 
dollars through the mail are not getting anything. 
We should stop listening to that broken record of Bloc recriminations on 
behalf of the unions and take a cold hard look at the real situation. We 
should not only reject this amendment but also go on to consideration of 
the following clauses. 
<P><A NAME="LINK248"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst, NDP):</b> Mr. Chairman, I will try to 
be brief enough because, as you said, we have several amendments to look 
at before 6:30 p.m. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This afternoon, some were talking about people with experience in 
negotiation. I can tell you that I have been involved in collective 
bargaining since 1979. Every time we returned to the table after we had 
reached a goal where we could have a collective agreement and a wage 
increase had been put forward by the employer, it was fine. But when we 
returned to the table only to realize that they took some away, it was 
more often than not that they were negotiating in bad faith. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, when a government refers the negotiation to an arbitrator 
without giving us the assurance that they will bring about a collective 
agreement for our postal workers, I think they are missing the boat. 
Again they tell us they are not involved in the negotiation. With this 
motion they show that they are involved in the negotiations and that 
they do not want Canada Post to give anything to their workers.

it very unusual that the Bloc would put forth a motion which 
would support a legislated settlement as far as the money is 
concerned. Of course one would expect them to say that it should 
be negotiated and I would agree with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it gets to the point where we have to legislate an 
organization back to work and appoint an arbitrator, then we 
should allow the arbitrator to make these decisions.

we said was very reasonable and I know he can be reasonable when he 
wants to. One has to catch him at the right moment.

offer lower than what the Canada Post Corporation, which is supposed to

the real priority for the government—and I believe the members

This is the main guideline, the leitmotiv of the government. This is and

Quite simply, they never could reach an agreement on wages.  The 
increases provided in the legislation are in line with the 
collective bargaining set amounts in Canada and compare 
favourably with the current rate settlements for other public 
sector agreements.  In fact, they are slightly higher than the 
settlement for the third quarter of 1997.  That is fair for CUPW

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP)</b> moved: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That Bill C-24, in Clause 12, be amended by replacing lines 33 
to 39 on page 5 with the following: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“12.  The collective agreement shall also be deemed to be 
amended by increasing the rates of pay by amounts to be 
determined by the mediator-arbitrator, provided that the 
increases be not less than the most recent offer of the Canada 
Post Corporation and not more than the last proposal put forward 
by the union.” 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Chairman, this amendment is so close in substance 
to the amendment moved by the Bloc Quebecois that it really does 
not warrant entering into a major debate.  The only qualifying 
statement that differentiates this from the Bloc's original 
amendment is that we are suggesting that the arbitrator's 
legislated settlement be no less than the last offer from Canada 
Post and no more than the last demand from the union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would give the arbitrator a range within which to choose.  We 
believe that is in keeping with the role of an arbitrator, who 
should have a free hand, who should be able to look at the market 
conditions and the profitability of the corporation to find a 
compromise position between the company's last offer and the 
employee's last demand for a wage increase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would hope that the Bloc Quebecois members would be able to 
see fit to support our amendment.  By the same token, other 
members should be able to see the basic issue of fairness here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The previous speaker, the member for Burnaby—Douglas, raised 
the issue that it really makes us wonder, when this offer is such 
a small amount lower than the last offer left on the table, if it 
is not sheer malice or if it is not mockery or trying to rub the 
employees' noses further into the ground.  Kick them while they 
are down.  That is the only reason we can think of for an offer 
which is one-tenth of one per cent in the third year lower than 
the last offer from Canada Post.  That much we would think would 
be corrected automatically just out of good faith.  It amounts to 
pennies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of substance here is that the starting date for the 
proposed wage increase has been moved ahead by six months.  That 
amounts to a lot of money.  By the calculations of the Canadian 
Union of Postal Workers it amounts to $8 million per year. 
Compounded over three years, I believe the figure is in the 
neighbourhood of $25 million to $27 million.  Less wages will go 
into the pockets of the employees during the lifetime of the 
collective agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is massive.  It is simply taking advantage of a bad 
situation.  If the employer was prepared to put that money into 
wages when bargaining fell apart, surely that money had already 
been allocated for that purpose and is readily available.  They 
are harvesting that money out of this unfortunate situation, 
taking advantage of a bad situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would appeal to the other parties to support this amendment. 
We believe it will answer the concerns of all parties on our 
side.  It answers the Bloc's original concern that it should be 
not less than the last offer.  It answers the Reform Party's idea 
that the arbitrator should have a free hand in ruling what the 
wage increase should be.  We have pulled those two ideas together 
into one composite amendment which we are suggesting is the 
fairest position.

by Canada Post”.  I have trouble understanding hon. members such as

employees is being taken away.  This is money that will not end up 
in our ridings, and in your ridings, because that is where postal 
employees and mail carriers spend their pay, in their region. 
So this is money being taken away from all of the regions of 
Canada, which they prefer to leave in the accumulated funds of 
Canada Post, which as I said earlier makes a profit of over $125 
million.  This petty amount of $20 million will do nothing for it. 
The corporation is already profitable, and its role is not to make 
money but to get the mail delivered properly, while respecting the 
men and women who work for the corporation and assuming that 
responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am appealing, therefore, not to the generosity of all hon. 
members, but rather to their common sense, in voting in favour of 
the amendment on which my hon. NDP colleague has spoken, as well as 
my hon. colleague for Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les 
Basques, who spoke on the first.  These two amendments are very 
much complementary and would result in the offer that has already 
been made to the postal employees and letter carriers during the 
negotiations being made the minimum in the bill. 
As I said, never in 13 years have I seen a bill that was going to 
be tabled to force a return to work which contained less than what 
the negotiations had partially arrived at.  I am therefore 
appealing to the common sense of all hon. members in this House 
that they may understand this situation and back the amendment

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Jim Gouk (West Kootenay—Okanagan, Ref.):</b>  Mr. 
Chairman, we do not like the Bloc's amendment because, as we 
said, it is legislated settlement.  In the case of the NDP's 
amendment, it is moving a step closer but it is like straddling a 
fence and we all know what happens if that is a picket fence and 
your legs are little short.  We think there is still a problem 
with that. However, it is a move in the right direction and if we 
have to choose the best of two bad choices then that would be the 
better, no question.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi, Lib.):</b> Mr. Chairman, I listened very 
carefully to the Bloc Quebecois member. He talked about backstabbing. We 
have seen people in this House, such as Lucien Bouchard, stab others in 
the back. These people are now elsewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look at the member opposite who just arrived from Florida, who 
was not here during the strike, and who is now telling us that we do not 
do anything in Parliament. MP Louis Plamondon, who went to Florida and 
came back with a nice tan, accuses us of stabbing strikers in the back, 
but I want to tell him that we talked to workers on the picket lines. 
People want—and I checked this afternoon with my constituents in the 
riding of Abitibi—postal services to resume. Community groups want 
postal services to resume. So do small and medium size businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But we are telling union workers in the Abitibi—Témiscamingue 
region that they do a good job, that they have always done a good job. 
I realize they follow the instructions given by their national office in 
Ottawa or Toronto. We can see in a 541-page tome that, since 1981, the 
union stewards have always been the same. They are here on this page. 
There is no one from the Abitibi—Témiscamingue region in this chapter. 
There is no one, on page 29 of the collective agreement, representing 
the province of Quebec. Since 1981, it has always been the same people 
who have represented the union. Think about it. Think about the fact 
that our people, the union workers, are protected at Canada Post by a 
collective agreement that is 541 pages long. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member talks about backstabbing. I realize that he is not even 
a hunter. But here is one who has already stabbed the Conservative Party 
in the back. I want to tell you that we want to have good relations with 
our workers, who have always served us well. 
I support the bill. I spoke this afternoon and my opinion will not 
change.

bill before us. We are here today to pass legislation, back to work 
legislation restoring appropriate labour-management relations, as 
quickly as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two requirements: that the act be the best possible and 
that it be passed as soon as possible. Those are the objectives and 
criteria applicable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To have two objectives like these requires that the best possible 
conditions be provided for in this bill. When we ask that the management 
negotiation proposal be what appears in the legislation, it is no 
secret, it does not take a rocket scientist to understand why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. St-Julien should understand this concept. It is the management 
proposal, the very proposal made by management, that we have put forward 
in our amendment. I listened to the hon. member for Abitibi earlier and 
put up with what he had to say. He said among other things that those 
selected to represent the unions, because they have been in the same 
position since 1981, are not the right people to do the job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Réal Ménard:</b> Shame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Paul Crête:</b> This is an insult to all union officials. It is 
also an insult— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Denis Coderre:</b> Don't choke. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Paul Crête:</b> It is also an insult to all members of Parliament 
who have been sitting here for years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude on this. We have a duty to produce the best 
possible piece of legislation, and I would really like Mr. St-Julien to 
refrain from participating in the rest of the discussion so that we can 
end up with something reasonable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Some hon. members:</b> Hear, hear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>The Chairman:</b> Order, please. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les

the rules of the House on this. 
<P><A NAME="LINK261"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Denis Coderre (Bourassa, Lib.):</b> Mr. Speaker, I have been 
insulted today. I have been insulted because the people from the Bloc, 
which is being paid and financed by unions, are telling me that I am 
stabbing workers in the back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Paul Crête:</b> And who is financing you? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Denis Coderre:</b> There are people who go to Florida, but me, I go 
to my riding and I work there. What are the people telling me? That they 
are losing money. There are companies who are forced to tell their 
workers to stay home because these people do not want to listen to 
reason. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Paul Crête:</b> Come and try this where I live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Denis Coderre:</b> There is no doubt that this special legislation 
has to be adopted as quickly as possible. It is time that we stopped 
listening to the same union song and that people stopped talking about 
knives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Personally, I have chosen to help the companies, I have chosen to 
help the citizens. 
I have chosen to help the charitable organizations. I have chosen to 
help my fellow citizens because people are losing money. I have decided 
to help the Salvation Army. I have decided to help Enfants Soleil. I 
have decided to help all these people because they are really losing 
money. I have decided to help those who rely on the holiday season to 
earn a living. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing is certain, when I hear members talk about knives and 
about stabbing, I do not know where they come from, but we have nothing 
to learn from the likes of them. We must reject this amendment because 
the union bunch on the other side, what they did is to refuse a 
settlement. We gave them a settlement, and they refused. This is a 
government law. We must follow the rules of the Treasury Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If these people fail to understand anything, it is because they 
fail to understand their fellow citizens. Instead of going to Florida, 
Mr. Plamondon should be going to his riding. 
Instead of talking about stabbing, the member for Richelieu should go 
speak to his fellow citizens, and he would see that 76% of the people in 
all ridings support the government, which has decided to bring in 
special legislation because we have chosen to be on the side of the 
citizens and not to be paid by the unions and to play their song. That 
is the problem, Mr. Chairman.

</I></B></P><P align=left>However, this particular bargaining dispute is not just impacting— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>The Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. I know that all hon. members 
will want to hear the minister, so perhaps we could just wait 
until members have cleared out of the Chamber so we can all hear 
the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Hon. Lawrence MacAulay:</b>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have 
the opportunity again to speak on Bill C-24, the postal services 
continuation act, 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have indicated to hon. members, I regret having to initiate 
legislation proceedings to bring about the resolution of a labour 
dispute which the parties were fully capable of settling 
themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, this particular bargaining dispute is not just 
impacting on the two sides involved in the conflict but is also 
having a serious effect on Canadian businesses, charities and 
members of the public who rely on the mail for their livelihood 
as well as people who depend on it for their link to family and 
friends. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has not been insensitive to these concerns. 
Contingency plans have been put in place for the distribution of 
social benefit cheques in order to prevent financial hardship for 
those who receive these cheques.  I would like to stress that the 
importance of this arrangement was also recognized by Canada Post 
and the Canadian Union of Postal Workers and they agreed to a 
process for delivering these cheques in the event of a work 
stoppage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government takes its role as protector of the public 
interest very seriously.  Canadians are clearly suffering because 
of this prolonged labour dispute so it was necessary for the 
government to intervene to bring about an end to the work 
stoppage and restore regular postal service to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the circumstances which led to the introduction of this 
legislation have been discussed during debate on this bill, I 
would like to review some of the events at these collective 
bargaining negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada Post Corporation and the Canadian Union of Postal Workers 
have been involved in negotiations in an attempt to arrive a new 
agreement to replace the one which expired on July 31, 1997.  The 
contract covers some 45,000 postal workers and letter carriers 
across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is worthy to note that the parties had been able to negotiate 
this previous agreement at the bargaining table without resorting 
to work stoppage action or without third party assistance.  Given 
that the parties entered into intensive negotiations well in 
advance of the expiry date, there was every hope that a new 
agreement would be achieved again without a strike or a lockout 
action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When direct talks broke off between the two sides and a notice 
of dispute was filed with my department, I assigned two 
conciliation officers to the dispute in an attempt to resolve the 
issue separating the parties from a settlement.  Conciliation 
proceedings took place during the last half of August and early 
September.  Despite the efforts of the conciliators, the parties 
remained deadlocked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On September 15 the employer submitted a global offer to the 
union but the offer was rejected by CUPW some three days later. 
On October 7, I appointed Mr. Marc Gravel, a well respected 
labour relations neutral from the private sector, as conciliation 
commissioner in this dispute.  Mr. Gravel began meeting with the 
parties on October 14 but by the end of the month indicated to me 
that he was having little success in moving the parties toward a 
settlement of their differences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Gravel suggested that the threat of work stoppage was needed 
to bring about appropriate pressure to bear on the negotiating 
process and, at the same time, suggested that I make the services 
of the federal mediation and conciliation services available to 
the parties in any further talks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following discussions with the two parties, I appointed the 
director general of federal mediation and conciliation services, 
Mr. Warren Edmondson, as a mediator in the dispute on November 
24. 
Mr. Edmondson immediately entered into intensive mediation 
sessions with the employer and union in an attempt to break the 
logjam and get the negotiations back on track.

<A HREF="#LINKT103"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following some four days of meetings with the parties, Mr. 
Edmondson reported to me that the prospect of a resolution was 
remote and that the parties were not prepared to demonstrate the 
flexibility required to reach an agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having given the collective bargaining process every possible 
opportunity to work in this situation, and faced with a work 
stoppage creating serious economic hardship for Canadians, I 
decided to introduce legislation to bring about an end to the 
strike and ensure that a collective agreement was put in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation before hon. members will bring about a 
resumption of regular postal services and provide for the 
appointment of a mediator-arbitrator to resolve the issues 
remaining in the dispute between the two sides, with the 
exception of the issue of wages and the duration of the contract. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation includes the guiding principle to assist the 
mediator-arbitrator in carrying out his or her assigned mandate. 
It requires that the mediator-arbitrator be guided by the need 
for the corporation to meet productivity and service standards 
necessary to provide Canadians with a nationwide postal service 
which they can rely on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As amended in second reading, the guiding principle also 
requires that the arbitrator be guided by the need to ensure 
viability and financial stability for the corporation. I would 
like to set out what the government means by viability and 
financial stability for Canada Post in this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the government does not want to privatize Canada Post, and 
this is why we agreed to the amendment in second reading, it does 
intend that Canada Post operate in a manner that is consistent 
with comparable industries in the private and public sector. 
Canada Post must have sufficient flexibility to manage in a 
competitive environment.  Also very important, it has to be 
profitable in accordance with the Financial Administration Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The arbitrator will have to be guided by the instructions given 
by the government for Canada Post to be profitable when he or she 
performs their duties.  He or she will have to interpret that 
instruction and to assist the arbitrator in doing so, the parties 
will be able to submit evidence, present witnesses and documents. 
He or she will balance these instructions given to the 
corporation by the need to take into account the importance of 
good labour relations management between the corporation and the 
union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Good labour-management relations are essential to the operations 
of a modern and vital postal service. Like all modern 
businesses, the corporation requires the co-operation of its 
employees to meet the challenges of the changing workplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issues which are highlighted in the guiding principles are 
issues which are routinely taken into account by arbitrators who 
are being asked to decide the terms and conditions of employment 
for employees in a bargaining unit. In this legislation the 
factors to be taken into account by the mediator-arbitrator were 
expressed in writing to provide greater certainty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provisions for the appointment of the mediator-arbitrator 
rather than an arbitrator will give the parties one more chance 
to settle as many issues as they can in the mediation prior to an 
arbitration decision being made on outstanding issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The process of mediation followed by arbitration encourages the 
parties to settle their own differences rather than having a 
third party decide their terms and conditions of employment. The 
more issues that can be agreed to by the parties on their own, 
the more chance there will be for productive labour-management 
relations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I strongly believe the government's action in this dispute will 
reflect the will of the majority of Canadians. We fully support 
the principle of a free collective bargaining process and we gave 
this system every chance to work properly. 
It was only when there was obviously no chance of a negotiated 
settlement that the government intervened to end a work stoppage 
which Canadians clearly wanted to be over.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I repeat that I am a firm believer in the collective bargaining 
process and I take no satisfaction in having to bring this type 
of legislation to the House.  However, in addition to supporting 
the rights of the employees and the union under the provisions of 
the Canada Labour Code, I also have a responsibility to ensure 
that the economic well-being of the country and the health and 
safety of its citizens are not adversely affected by lengthy work 
stoppages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that the current dispute within the postal service 
is a situation that falls into this category and must be resolved 
for the good of all concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-24, the postal services continuation act, 1997, brings 
about a resumption of postal services to Canadians. It provides 
for a dispute resolution mechanism in the form of a 
mediator-arbitrator to resolve the issues remaining in the 
dispute between the employer and the union with the exception of 
wage increases and the duration of the agreement, both of which 
are implemented in the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill outlines the guiding principle for the process that 
balances economic and service related targets for corporation 
with the need for good labour-management relations. I thank 
members on both sides of the House for their frank and 
constructive debate on this legislation today.  I would ask for 
their support for this bill so we can get the mail moving again 
in Canada. 
<P><A NAME="LINK294"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):</b>  Mr. Speaker, we are 
on the eve of getting the mail moving again.  This is an 
opportunity for me to share a few thoughts with the minister and 
Canadians in general.  It was good to hear the minister say that 
he supports the collective bargaining process.  He has told us 
that over and over again, so I guess that is his position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also said that he takes no satisfaction in having to bring in 
legislation of this type.  There is a point on which the minister 
and I can agree.  Although we as a party asked to get the mail 
moving again, this seemed to be the only method left to get the 
mail moving and we reluctantly support this sort of thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe there is no need to have to legislate back to work 
for work stoppages, in particular in areas where there is no 
alternative.  There is no alternative to the post office.  If you 
put first class mail out to be delivered it will be delivered by 
the post office. Nobody is running in competition with the post 
office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where a monopoly exists we have to come up with a mechanism that 
settles these disputes without a strike or a lockout.  The 
Canadian public simply cannot withstand this kind of blow. People 
have phoned our offices repeatedly to tell us how much money they 
are losing and that they will have to lay off employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are concerned that every time this happens, Canada Post is 
losing another slice of the market share.  Not everybody has 
access to the Internet, e-mail, faxes and so forth.  Every time 
there is a disruption in the service of first class mail, people 
start to look for alternatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A good case in point is a local newspaper back home.  It is a 
member of the weekly newspaper association that has been 
publishing for the last 50 years in my hometown.  Every week it 
mails out its papers to the outlying areas.  It is an ad journal 
with no subscription rates.  It simply goes out to every 
household in the coverage area and is paid for by the 
advertising. 
I spoke with the editor of that paper just recently and he said 
that his postal costs were about one thousand dollars a week.  As 
soon as this postal disruption was talked about, as soon as there 
was a lot of chest thumping and we knew that there was going to 
be a postal disruption, this editor set the wheels to deliver his 
paper without Canada Post.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What they actually came up with was a distribution system where 
they had news boxes at convenient points all through their 
circulation area that would be stocked on the same day that the 
paper was printed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everybody now is going to get their paper on the same day 
whether they live in the town that the paper is printed in or 
whether they live in an adjacent town or somewhere in between in 
a rural area.  They will all get their paper the same day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most significant thing is that besides the fact that it is 
going to cost him half of what it did through Canada Post, $500 a 
week as opposed to $1,000 a week, this editor has no intention of 
going back to Canada Post once the mail has resumed. I think that 
is a shame because there is another slice of market share that 
Canada Post has lost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things that was very hotly contested during all of 
these labour talks was the fear of lay-offs in their jobs.  CUPW 
kept saying that they were— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Pat Martin:</b>  On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, I am 
not usually a really big fan of what the Reform Party has to say 
but I think everybody in this House deserves the courtesy of at 
least having representatives on the other side here to listen to 
the arguments no matter what the merits of those arguments are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even with that member going back to his proper seat, we have a 
lack of quorum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</b>  Is the hon. member

Resuming debate. 
<P><A NAME="LINK295"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):</b>  Mr. Speaker, as I 
was saying, one of the most contentious issues was that CUPW had 
alleged that Canada Post wanted to lay off a good number of 
workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suspect that losing the market share is going to hasten that 
kind of activity.  If we cannot maintain the market share of 
Canada Post, there will be less work to do and as a result there 
will be fewer people working at Canada Post.  It only follows. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the anecdote that I shared regarding my local paper is 
one instance in one constituency in one province of Canada.  I am 
sure it can be multiplied by a good many times because other 
people will say that we are losing too much here, that it is too 
much of a risk with these constant interruptions in the postal 
service and therefore we will go to alternatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a sad state of affairs.  We should have a good, strong, 
viable postal service in Canada so that when a letter is dropped 
into the slot, it is guaranteed that it will be delivered 
anywhere on the globe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, that is what we have had in the past and I do not see 
any reason why we could not have it in the future.  The fact that 
we are here today debating to put the postal workers back to work 
and to reinstate the postal service tells you that there is 
something wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had to do this before in the last ten years.  We had to 
do it at least two other times.  Why do we continue to legislate 
them back over and over again? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need a system put in place that is going to resolve these 
things before they come to the work stoppage position and really 
harm innocent bystanders, people who really have no say in who 
goes to work and who does not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have put forth resolutions in this House, amendments to this 
bill, to use the final offer selection system by which, very 
basically put, the two sides will put forth the things that they 
do not agree on.  They will agree to an arbitrator who will 
choose all their final positions or all the other final 
positions, one or the other.  There is no compromise position in 
between. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have said before in this House, I believe that that is a 
tool that could be used effectively by labour and by management. 
I do not think it weights one side of the scale more than it does 
the other side.  I believe that that is what we njeed to have as 
far as labour legislation in this country is concerned.  We need 
to have a balance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we have the scales tilted too far to one side, then certainly 
there is going to be an undue advantage for that side. Therefore, 
this is a system that, if used to its ultimate, will not be used 
at all because the people who have it there as a tool to use will 
bargain very earnestly knowing that this is the legislated final 
step. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If they do not arrive at an agreement on their own, they will be 
compelled to go to this final step which really takes the 
decision out of their hands.  I am sure that all parties would 
like to come to a negotiated settlement. 
However, I believe that final offer selection is a tool that 
could be used equally by each party.  It would help in the 
negotiating process. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1955"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT107"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are people who would argue that final offer selection 
takes away the right of these people to strike.  I do not think 
it does.  If we asked most people out on the picket line if they 
enjoy striking, they would say that they do not enjoy striking 
but feel compelled to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everybody likes stability.  Everybody likes to have some control 
in their lives.  When their paycheques stop and they are out on 
the picket line, it is not very pleasant especially in this 
November and December weather.  I am sure those people would 
rather be gainfully employed and picking up their salaries just 
as they have for the past number of years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that what we are doing today takes the right to 
strike and to lock out away from these people more than final 
offer selection does.  By mandating these people back to work we 
are saying that they do not have the right to strike, that they 
were on strike for nine or ten days but that is over with now and 
they have to go back to work.  If they do not go back to work 
they are breaking a statute of Canada which is very serious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We agree with the minister when he says that he takes very 
little satisfaction or no satisfaction in having to bring in back 
to work legislation.  We agree with that.  Something has to be 
done.  We have to get the mail moving and it is obvious that the 
negotiation process was not going to get it moving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We and everybody agree that the best solution is a negotiated 
solution.  If the parties negotiated, they would all feel that 
they had a hand in it and that they were parties to the decision 
rather than having to throw everything up in the air and having 
the decision mandated by someone else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was very much surprised to see that the minister and his 
department would include the pay scales in this bill, that they 
would have the increases mandated.  I was surprised to see a 
Liberal government bring this in.  I was also surprised to hear 
some of the more left wing parties agree to this.  They agreed to 
this idea in principle but amended it and juggled the figures a 
little.  The NDP and the Bloc agreed to this mandated settlement. 
That really surprised me.  I always thought they were the 
champions of labour and that they would want a negotiated 
settlement.  We do too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We think that part of the bill should have been removed.  We 
suggested that and put forth amendments to that effect.  I 
suppose the government in its wisdom and certainly in its numbers 
held sway and said whether the bill would live or die. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How has the last nine or ten days affected average Canadians? 
They have not received their newspapers through the mail. They 
have not received their cheques.  Although we have had assurances 
from Canada Post that the old age pension cheques would be 
delivered, I had telephone calls from my constituency this week 
from some people who said that a lot of people on their block got 
their pension cheques but they did not get theirs. They say that 
it is December 1 and they do not know what to do.  What can I 
say?  How can I check it out for them since the post office is 
not working?  All we can tell them is that their cheques were 
issued from Ottawa and we have no way of knowing where those 
cheques are gone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The strike has had an effect on pensioners on a fixed income who 
depend on their pension cheques. 
Certainly I am not implying that seniors are living hand to mouth 
and pension cheque to pension cheque but they like to see it 
arrive on the regular day.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The post office in the smaller centres is sort of a social 
centre in the community.  It is a place where you meet your 
neighbours.  In a small town it is a place where you meet your 
business associates.  Not everybody regularly attends the chamber 
of commerce meetings but they often attend the bank and the post 
office.  They bump into their business associates and compare 
notes and talk about any manner of things. Of course when the 
post offices are closed that social aspect of the community is 
not there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not to mention the fact that charities at this time of the year 
are really dependent on the Christmas season for their biggest 
fund raisers. They raise about 80% of their funds in the month of 
December. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know our political party likes to try to raise funds in 
November and December because it is getting close to tax time. 
Generally people have their end of year approaching and they have 
their finances pretty much in order.  A lot of people budget a 
certain amount to give to charities and they do that usually in 
the last month of the year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased to see that the post office is going back to 
work.  I hope it goes back very quickly and that all the talk of 
civil disobedience is just that, talk.  I know that we have many 
very dedicated people in the post office workforce who pride 
themselves on doing an excellent job of delivering the mail 
through all sorts of conditions.  I can hardly wait to get the 
mail system back to its normal condition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Labour has a great opportunity, one that perhaps 
has not been offered to other ministers of labour and that is to 
adopt and institute the final offer selection arbitration 
process.  This process, as I have said many times in this House, 
is a great tool, one that would prevent the damage done to 
innocent third parties that have no control over these labour 
disruptions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Oftentimes these labour disruptions are about power and there 
are struggles.  I do not know that this particular instance was a 
power struggle but the possibility for that is always there.  For 
third party persons who simply are users, constituents of the 
system, to be damaged by this to the effect that they have been 
during this postal strike is simply not fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hear a lot of talk about fairness in this House and about 
balance.  That is exactly what we should be striving for. 
Fairness and balance.  I think the Canadian public, the consumers 
of the services of the post office deserve fairness and they 
deserve balanced legislation to make sure that that fairness is 
assured. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the last two weeks 30 million Canadians have been denied the 
postal service.  Within a matter of a few days I am very hopeful 
that we are going to see the resumption of those services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could probably continue and make several other points but time 
is running short.  I look forward to hearing what my colleagues 
have to say.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</b>  Excuse me, please. 
The hon. member for Trois-Rivières has asked for unanimous 
consent to split the time three ways, 10 minutes each.  This is 
the first 40 minute round.  Does the hon. member for 
Trois-Rivières have the unanimous consent of the House? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Some hon. members:</b> Agreed. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Yves Rocheleau:</b> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues for their 
understanding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is with pleasure and with a sense of duty that I rise today, as 
labour critic, to take part in this very important debate in the history 
of labour relations in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it is also a sad moment in the history of labour relations 
in Canada because of what we have seen today and in previous weeks about 
the way this matter has been handled. The government should be ashamed 
of what it has done, particularly through its public works and 
governmental affairs minister, nipping in the bud the negotiations that 
started a few months ago between both parties. Members will recall that 
the minister candidly admitted that the government would legislate in 
the event of a strike by postal workers, thereby making these 
negotiations meaningless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, what we witnessed is a sad masquerade, made even worse 
by some disgraceful actions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A brief review of recent events: a call for reduced use of the 
postal service as the strike deadline approaches, lay-offs because 
of the reduced activity, an announcement of Canada Post's desire to 
cut more than 4 000 positions, violent behaviour by one of the 
management team and an attack on a union negotiator, announcement 
of a lock-out, etc.  A sad record indeed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I shall now address the more specific question of the vicious 
overall character of this government's strategy and actions, the 
government of a sovereign country called Canada where we are 
witnessing what I would call orchestrated action against the 
unionized class, the entire middle class, everywhere on this 
planet, in order to diminish the role of the state, to dismantle to 
some extent all the mechanisms with which we have equipped 
ourselves in order to better share the wealth, and within which we 
give an obvious framework to the privatization of the principal 
services of the state. 
You will have understood that I am referring to clause 9, which I 
shall read: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>9. The mediator-arbitrator shall be guided by the need for 
terms and conditions of employment that are consistent with 
those in comparable industries in the private and public 
sectors and that will provide the necessary degree of 
flexibility to ensure the short- and long-term economic 
viability and competitiveness of the Canada Post Corporation, 
taking into account 
</UL><UL><UL>

without recourse to undue increases in postal rates, 
</UL></UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(i) perform financially in a commercially acceptable range,

</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b) the importance of good labour-management relations between 
the Canada Post Corporation and the union. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an orchestrated operation, in Canada as in France, as 
in Germany, as in Italy, and everywhere else in the West, to ensure 
that those who have done well for themselves, particularly by 
unionizing workers and salaried employees, are now seeing their 
powers, their advantages, systematically diminished.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to share with you the remarks that appeared 
yesterday in <I>Le Monde Diplomatique</I>, written by a European of 
substance, Ignacio Ramonet.  He wrote the following in this paper, 
and his remarks are very relevant to what is happening here, with 
everything orchestrated in my opinion.  That must be said so that 
finally a debate may be held in the West, indeed worldwide, soon, 
to make economic progress synonymous with human progress. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I quote Mr. Ramonet: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Financial globalization has created its own government. 
A supranational government with its own machinery, influence 
networks and means of action. 
I am talking of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the 
World Bank, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and 
Development (OECD) and the World Trade Organization (WTO). 
These four institutions speak with one voice—echoed by 
almost all of the major media—in exalting “market virtues”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This world government is a power without a society, that 
role belonging to the financial markets and giant corporations 
it represents.  The effect of this is that real societies have 
no power.  The situation continues to worsen.  As the 
successor to the GATT, since 1995, the WTO has acquired 
supranational powers and is out of reach of the controls of 
parliamentary democracy. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>And I said parliamentary democracy. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once seized of an issue, it can declare national labour, 
environmental or public health legislation “contrary to free 
trade” and call for their repeal. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the scenario we are facing here in this House. 
Fortunately, the opposition parties have formed a fine coalition of 
the New Democratic Party and the Bloc Quebecois.  This means we can 
bring an element of humanity to clause 9 by pointing out that 
Canada Post, for as long as it exists in Canada in this form, is a 
public service with a logic, a consistency and the expectations we 
might have of a public service with all its strengths and 
weaknesses and constraints and not a private enterprise with its 
own internal logic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to emphasize here the role of my colleague from Champlain 
who has done such outstanding work today. He succeeded in uniting all 
our forces in making this government listen to reason because it was 
embarking with indifference and cynicism on the road to neo-liberalism 
which is making the poor poorer and the rich richer. So if there are 
people who are not doing too badly, it is not by the grace of God or the 
Virgin Mary, it is because they succeeded in unionizing. It is through 
a great struggle that they won the right to unionize; such a right was 
never given to them, they always had to fight for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must condemn measures as cynical as those we are seeing today in 
order to protect what we have here in Canada, in Quebec, in America, in 
the West, where the union movement is concentrated, because we know that 
everywhere else, we cannot even speak in terms of unionization, because 
the situation is so bad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is essential that the people and organizations such as unions 
which ensure a better distribution of wealth always have their say and 
that the debate is increasingly public, open and vigorous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because wealth is not evenly distributed, we have to ensure through 
the unions, through the governments, including those in Quebec and in 
Canada who have received a mandate and assumed their responsibility to 
distribute the wealth, that this will continue and that we understand 
that it is not by keeping the wealth in the hands of multinationals, in 
the hands of supranational corporations that make sovereign states 
powerless that we can achieve human progress. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has to be in fact a better distribution of wealth, and tax 
shelters should be questioned and tax havens eliminated. This is a 
shameful process that allows those among us who are more fortunate to 
literally laugh at low wage earners, at the people who dutifully pay 
their taxes, because of all sorts of manoeuvres that the auditor general 
has condemned here in Canada, even if attempts were made to prevent him 
from speaking out in the finance committee, as I saw with my own eyes.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</b> Mr. Speaker, this bill has 
caused quite a stir, particularly across the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, for the benefit of those who are listening, I would like 
to get back to the facts. There is no denying that, for many individuals 
and small businesses, this is an inconvenience. Small businesses that 
rely on cash flow and had to negotiate lines of credit did run into 
problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to explain what happened. The fact of the matter is 
that Canada Post is basically a corporation where labour-management 
relations are poor. When labour-management relations are poor in any 
corporation, whether public or private, clients, whoever they are, may 
run into problems. I have seen the union try to resolve problems. I 
would have liked to see the Canada Post Corporation do the same. 
I thought that the threat of a strike, at first, and the onset of the 
strike would bring them closer to a settlement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But when, like many of our fellow citizens, I saw on television the 
negotiators representing the employer manhandle the union negotiator, I 
figured something was not right. I was a trade unionist in my days, but 
I never saw negotiators on the management side do anything like that 
during negotiations. Never. They are responsible for helping to settle 
the differences, even if the interests of the parties they represent are 
poles apart. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I saw them go after the union negotiator, I suddenly lost any 
hope I may have had of seeing this dispute resolved other than from the 
outside. 
I deeply regret that postal workers are once again being legislated back 
to work. But I sincerely hope that their conflict and the aggravation 
caused to individuals and to small and medium size businesses will not 
have been in vain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why I am extremely proud of what the Bloc Quebecois has 
achieved in co-operation with the NDP. We negotiated with the government 
so that the act will be passed today, even though we are opposed to it, 
but with some changes to the mediation process. In the original bill, 
the mandate of the arbitrator was totally unacceptable for a corporation 
providing a public service. The most important aspects of this mandate 
are as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>9. The mediator-arbitrator shall be guided by the need for terms 
and conditions of employment that are consistent with those in 
comparable industries in the private and public sectors and that will 
provide the necessary degree of flexibility to ensure the short- and 
long-term economic viability and competitiveness of the Canada Post 
Corporation—

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>No mediator anywhere would be able to resolve a dispute under 
these guidelines.  All the conditions for privatization have to be 
created. And the first point was about performing financially in a 
commercially acceptable range.  This is completely inconsistent 
with a public service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government approved the amendment, a fact about which we 
are extremely proud, so that clause 9 now reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>9. The mediator-arbitrator shall be guided by the need for 
terms and conditions of employment that are consistent with 
the Canada Post Corporation Act 
</UL>
<which is an act establishing a public service, 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>and the financial stability of the Canada Post Corporation. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The service must operate on a self-sustaining financial basis 
and workers agree. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the Canada Post Corporation must, without recourse to 
undue increases in postal rates, operate efficiently, improve 
productivity, and meet acceptable standards of service, 
stressing the importance of good labour-management relations. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What this amendment gives a mediator-arbitrator is a framework 
for helping to improve labour relations.  With 45,000 workers, it 
is a strong union.  Do people know that 17,000 of these workers 
have part-time positions—out of 45,000, that is a lot of people, 
one third—and that, during negotiations, the union wanted to 
convert part-time positions into full-time ones in the interests of 
effectiveness and efficiency? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When one of the main problems in Canada is employment, is it 
obscene for a public service to be concerned with converting 
part-time positions into full-time ones? 
Some countries opt for that option in order to solve their employment 
problem. Is it obscene? Is it senseless? On the contrary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mediator-arbitrator will be able to take this into 
consideration. His mandate is to stand up to the employer. It is crucial 
in this case, since the minister responsible was, I am afraid, unable to 
maintain the proper balance to put both parties on an equal footing 
during the negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When one party can always say no, knowing that, in the end, the 
legislation will be on its side, there can be no negotiations. 
We have to acknowledge that even if the government is saying “Well, we 
gave the negotiation process a chance to succeed”, we know it is not 
true, because the minister kept saying “We will give them a few days and 
then introduce a special bill”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we should wholeheartedly hope for at this point, as 
Quebeckers and as Canadians, despite the dispute and the sad 
ending for the workers who must be terribly upset, is that the 
mandate of the mediator-arbitrator—and I hope the government 
will consult the union before appointing the 
mediator-arbitrator—will let him decide and make recommendations 
that will finally help to improve labour relations and the 
quality of the services at Canada Post. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From what I read, small and medium size businesses, who were 
most affected by the strike, do want postal services to resume, 
but they also want efficient services that meet their needs. 
The mediator-arbitrator will have the opportunity to follow up on this 
request by the public, by consumers and by small businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I am extremely happy that the Bloc Quebecois and the 
NDP chose the position they chose instead of saying “Yes, postal workers 
have to go back to work because of the pressure”. Yes, postal services 
must resume, but not under just any conditions, not with workers who are 
appalled, who feel they have been treated so unfairly that they will not 
be able to put their hearts into their work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether in the private or the public sector, the quality of service 
and the success of a business hinge on the workers.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Paul Mercier (Terrebonne—Blainville, BQ):</b> Mr. Speaker, I 
will start by showing that the bill we are discussing today 
constitutes a denial of the very concept of public service.  I will 
then go on to demonstrate that this bill also constitutes a denial 
of the right to strike. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, this bill constitutes a denial of the concept of 
public service.  The parameters the government wishes to impose 
upon the mediator-arbitrator in his negotiations with the workers 
reveal that the government has a somewhat curious concept, to say 
the least, of what a public service is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this connection, like the hon. member for Mercier before 
me, I will read another excerpt from clause 9, because it speaks 
volumes.  Under clause 9, the mediator-arbitrator shall take into 
account, and I quote: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(a) that the Canada Post Corporation must, without recourse to 
undue increases in postal rates, 
</UL></UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(i) perform financially in a commercially acceptable range— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say that, from the moment that a mediator-arbitrator is 
required to be guided by such a criterion, there can be no more 
talk of the Canada Post Corporation being a public service.  Its 
principal function is no longer to be a public service, but to be 
a profitable service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it were only that the government needed to ensure that the 
Canada Post Corporation was self-sustaining, but this is 
absolutely not the case.  The government wants Canada Post to 
bring in $200 million.  Delivering our letters and packages must 
be cost-effective, bring in money, as it would if it were a 
private company, and the target amount is $200 million. 
The Canada Post Corporation becomes a cash cow the government can 
milk as much as it wants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine what would happen if this principle of an obligatorily 
profitable public service were to become the rule.  VIA Rail would 
not exist.  It, like all passenger railway companies, cannot exist 
without subsidies and is even less likely to turn a profit.  VIA 
Rail would perish.  Imagine what would happen if municipalities 
were hit with this principle of profitable public service.  Imagine 
a police officer having to bring in fines worth $60,000 before 
being hired at $50,000.  Would that not be something? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I return to my quote earlier.  I go back to it, because Canada 
Post is supposed to achieve $200 million without undue increases in 
postal rates.  That is like saying that it is to achieve its 
objectives at a cost to its workers.  That is so obvious. 
And even if we do not like strikes, we have to understand that 
workers really have no other way to defend themselves against this 
real aggression. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know that this strike hurts businesses and individuals, 
and if there is one part of the bill we agree with it is the part 
about returning to work as quickly as possible.  However, what we 
absolutely do not agree with is having the negotiations involving 
the mediator-arbitrator conducted in the spirit of mercantilism. 
We cannot agree with that, and I, like my colleague for Mercier, 
are particularly proud that the NDP and we have come up with an 
amendment that will humanize this provision.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I now come to the second part of my speech, which will show that 
the bill before us is also a denial of the right to strike. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How could it not be the case, given that the dice were loaded 
from the beginning. The Canada Post Corporation has known since 
August that, should a strike occur, the government would 
immediately introduce back-to-work legislation to end it. Under 
these conditions, what does the right to strike mean? The act 
provides for this right, but the government makes sure that it is 
undermined, that it does not really exist, by saying “Ah, if 
there is a strike, we will take action to end it”. So, it is no 
longer a level playing field at the negotiating table. 
The government distorts the whole process, instead of applying the act 
and respecting its spirit. It is unbelievable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unbelievable, but it is not. In fact, it is not surprising at 
all. Canada Post is nothing but a creature of the Liberal Party. The 
president of Canada Post is a former Liberal minister. The corporation 
is full of former or current friends of the Liberals. So, what happened 
should not come as a surprise. The predominating aspect of all this is 
the—I was going to say incestuous, but let us simply say family— 
relationship that exists between the government and Canada Post. The 
government is the father figure, while Canada Post is the son. The 
father will protect the interests of the son, particularly since the son 
will bring in $200 million. So, it is all very normal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To conclude, let me quote Karl Marx, whose slightly fascist 
tendencies are well known. About the system which he called 
capitalist—now known as market system—Karl Marx said that 
power of any sort, be it democratic or authoritarian, always 
takes the side of the employer against the workers. He said that, 
but he was wrong, although one might be inclined to think 
otherwise given what is going on here today. He was wrong because 
there is a way to ensure it is not so, to ensure that, in a 
democratic system, power is not necessarily on the side of the 
employer. And that way is called social democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. André Bachand:</b> Like in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Paul Mercier:</b> The hon. member is taking the words right out of 
my mouth. I agree with him, that is the way the Quebec government 
operates and the way it will continue to operate when Quebec becomes a 
sovereign state. 
I do not mean to say that, in a sovereign Quebec, there will not be any 
disputes like this one but, if there is a dispute, it will not be dealt 
with in such a way that the right to a public service that is truly 
public and the right to strike and to use it, which are two pillars of 
democratic life, end up trampled like they have been in this case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</b> Resuming debate. The hon. 
member for Vancouver East. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You are splitting your time.  We are into 10, 10, and 5 minutes

is good that the Bloc Quebecois and the NDP stand in solidarity 
together in the House today to defend workers rights.  This has 
truly been an historic day in terms of back to work legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to speak on several aspects of the back to work 
legislation, Bill C-24.  I want to deal with the question of why 
the legislation became necessary in the first place.  Back to 
work legislation would not have even been contemplated if the 
government had the political will and the principle to make the 
collective bargaining process work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government were committed to Canada Post as a public 
corporation, we would not be here today debating this very 
draconian back to work legislation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we learn more about what has happened, what has really taken 
place in the last few weeks and months and now during the nine 
days of the strike, it becomes clearer and clearer that the 
minister and the government have had a secret agenda.  The 
direction of the government has been toward back to work 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that all of us as parliamentarians have 
heard the very deep concern from our constituents, from 
businesses, from pensioners, and from other Canadians who rely on 
the very necessary public service of Canada Post.  We understand 
those concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why has the situation deteriorated so badly?  Why are we now in 
a state of affairs where the government has rushed forward with 
back to work legislation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fundamental role and mandate of Canada Post are at issue. 
The government has created a financial and management crisis. 
When we look at the evidence we see that the government has 
demanded Canada Post to pay dividends or, let us say it, to pay 
profits.  This public corporation must pay profits of over $200 
million over five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This flies in the face of what the government said in 1990 when 
in opposition.  At that time it said that Canada Post should be 
instructed to generate only operating profits necessary to meet 
its own capital investment needs required to maintain and improve 
services.  That is what the Liberals said in 1990 when they were 
defending and supporting a public corporation, but now they have 
changed their tune. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To understand the government's real agenda is to understand why 
we are here tonight faced with the legislation.  My colleagues 
and I suggest that the government is setting the stage for 
further privatization.  It is deliberately setting the stage to 
allow Canada Post to be run into the ground. The government has 
demanded high profits and has already created a two tier system 
of mail delivery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, we have all witnessed the tragedy of Canada Post. 
It has closed over 1,700 public post offices in rural areas and 
175 public post offices in urban areas. We have already seen the 
massive privatization that has taken place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is deliberately destabilizing the credibility of 
the corporation to create a political environment to undermine 
Canada Post workers and to move forward on its agenda of 
privatization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the Canadian Union of Postal Workers have a 
legitimate interest to protect the jobs of their members and to 
secure full time work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it not strange that parliamentarians, including the members 
of the government, profess concern about high unemployment? 
Members of CUPW are fighting tooth and nail to retain jobs in a 
critical Canadian public service.  What do they get?  They get 
legislation that slams them, legislation that ties the hands of 
an arbitrator to force feed the government's agenda.  To add 
insult to injury the legislation imposes a wage settlement that 
is actually less than what was on the bargaining table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation is very draconian and has fines of $50,000 and 
even $100,000 per day.  We have to stop blaming workers.  We have 
to demand that the government act responsibly as an employer.  It 
has already shown that it does not care about pay equity after 13 
years.  Now it has abandoned collective bargaining as well in its 
drive to destabilize Canada Post at the expense of workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is essential for the government to seriously address the 
longstanding grievances of Canada Post and support the 
development of a positive labour-management climate designed to 
bring stability to the corporation and its workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The back to work legislation is draconian.  It is heavy handed 
and shows the government's real agenda.  Our amendment today has 
been a real effort to bring some fairness to the legislation.  In 
the final analysis we in the NDP reject the back to work 
legislation.  We support the rights of workers to collective 
bargaining and to strike.  We also support the development of a 
healthy public corporation and the best postal service for all 
Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</b>  Mr. Speaker, 
earlier at second reading I had an opportunity to speak for a few 
minutes.  I would like to pick up where I left off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was talking about how back to work legislation brings out both 
the best and the worst in parliament.  I never did get to talk 
about the best, but I would like to elaborate on the worst for a 
while longer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>An hon. member:</b>  It is a longer story. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</b>  “It is a longer story” as the member 
for Winnipeg Centre says. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I begin by congratulating the member for Winnipeg Centre on the 
fine work he has done today in successfully bringing a 
constructive amendment to fruition in the back to work 
legislation, Bill C-24. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He prevented the government from advancing the privatization of 
Canada Post in the guise of emergency legislation.  This is what 
the initial instructions to the mediator-arbitrator are all 
about.  They are trying to do indirectly what the government so 
far has not had the courage to do directly, that is to talk about 
the privatization of Canada Post which many believe is on its 
agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, when I talk about bringing out the worst in 
parliament I am really talking about the motion the government 
moved yesterday, Motion No. 8.  Because we were in the process of 
negotiating with the government with respect to the amendment I 
just mentioned, we decided not to oppose Motion No. 8 in the 
context of our discussions with the government about trying to 
get an agreement on the very important amendment we were putting 
forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All members of the opposition should be concerned about the 
nature of that motion.  Basically the government could have done 
it without opposition and therefore with the consent of the 
House.  It could have done it without the consent of the House. 
It could have been prevented from doing it on a particular day by 
25 members rising in their place.  It could have gone on to 
debate that motion until members of the opposition were 
exhausted, at which point the motion would have been voted on by 
the majority.  It would have been decided by the House, by the 
will of the majority and not by the consent of the House, to deal 
with all stages of the legislation in one day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means that the government has in reserve what might be 
called the parliamentary dictatorship clause.  We do all the 
other things we do here when we have first reading, second 
reading or send a matter to committee, as long as the government 
does not want to have it right away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not observed because it has to be observed.  On days 
like today and weeks like this week we learn that it is not 
something guaranteed in the way we do business around here.  It 
is just convention.  It is courtesy.  It is an optional process 
because when the government wants to do otherwise it can.  That 
is what should worry all members of this House, particularly 
opposition members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wanted to say earlier that I was surprised the Reform Party 
allowed its zeal for putting workers back to work to blind its 
members to the precedent that they were allowing the government 
to set by using once again this draconian standing order without 
any objection on the part of the Reform Party and without the 
Reform Party ever asking for anything in return. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see a parliamentary tragedy in so far as we all want to 
believe the Reform Party is sincere in its objection to the way 
the government sometimes abuses parliament.  Here was a cardinal 
abuse of parliament and there was nothing but silence on the part 
of the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand why the Conservatives were quiet because they 
brought in this standing order in the first place.  I believe 
this standing order was brought in, in 1991, by the Conservative 
Party. 
Perhaps they would have felt too embarrassed to get up and say 
that they really felt the use of this standing order was a bad 
thing because they created it.

<A HREF="#LINKT117"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the other things I do not understand is why the Liberals, 
when the Tories brought in this particular standing order, stood 
in their places in this House and decried it as a treacherous act 
against Parliament.  I do not know why the Liberals sought to use 
this particular standing order and why they feel no compunction 
about using the very thing which they so decried in previous 
incarnations, particularly in opposition incarnations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I meant by the best was what we saw today in committee of 
the whole.  Lots of members were present.  It was perhaps the way 
Canadians imagine Parliament, with every member in the Chamber, 
with amendments being debated and with the government actually 
having to talk to the opposition to arrive at some kind of 
compromise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case the Liberals felt, for whatever reason, that they 
wanted the approval of some opposition parties.  They did not 
have to deal with the Reform Party because they already had its 
members in their pocket.  However, for some reason or another 
they felt it was useful to have the NDP and the Bloc on side, so 
we were able to amend this legislation in a constructive way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is that not what Parliament should be about all the time, 
instead of having what is normally the case with a majority 
government, which is a kind of parliamentary dictatorship for 
four years until there is another election to decide which 
members get to be the collective dictatorship for the next four 
years? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what I meant by Parliament at its best.  Everyone is 
engaged.  The government has to relate in a real, not a pro 
forma, way to the opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is my concern at the procedural level, but I want to say a 
word in the time I have left to the matter at hand, the question 
of the actions of Canada Post and the government and the 
situation which the Canadian Union of Postal Workers members find 
themselves in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to address one particular thing, because obviously I 
cannot cover the waterfront, and that is the thing that we 
sometimes hear.  I have heard it from some members of Parliament. 
We hear it on the street.  We hear it here and there.  People 
say these guys are paid good money.  What are they complaining 
about?  How do they have the nerve to go on strike, to ask for 
more, to demand job security or to demand that the jobs which are 
already there be protected? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This country, the country which people like, the country which 
the United Nations rates as number one or number two over and 
over again, was built on decent wages.  It was not built on low 
wages.  Every time some Canadian fights to keep their good wage 
everybody should cheer them on.  They are fighting for all of us 
as we head down the road to a low wage economy which has been 
planned for us in the corporate boardrooms of this country year 
after year, starting with the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement, 
the NAFTA, the WTO and now the multilateral agreement on 
investment.  That is what has happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not doing our children and our grandchildren any favours 
by acquiescing to this, by saying we have to get more 
competitive.  That basically means that families cannot make ends 
meet on one income any more.  It is not just a question of wages 
being high or low, it is also a question of the social fabric of 
this country and the fact that families cannot finance themselves 
on one low income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many families can finance themselves on one decent income or on 
one high income, high income in the sense of high income for 
working people, the kind of unionized wages that have enabled a 
generation of Canadians to own homes, to put their kids through 
university, to have a new car once in a while and to have some 
recreational aspect in their lives.  All of that was not possible 
for the previous generation and now we are saying that it is not 
competitive and we do not want it any more.  We want to conform 
to a different global economic model in which we all have to 
scratch around like ants to make a living at the behest of the 
corporate elite who want us to take less and less both in terms 
of private wages and in terms of social wages.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP is here to say we do not buy it.  We do not buy when it 
is done to postal workers.  We do not buy when it is done to 
railroad workers.  We do not buy when it is done to anybody. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are all in this together; one group of people who have been 
paid well historically are attacked and asked to accept less and 
less, whether they are Department of National Defence employees 
whose work is being contracted out or transformed through 
alternative service delivery and other euphemisms, or paying 
people half of what they used to make, not in order to save 
money.  Sometimes it costs just as much to contract out.  The 
people who are doing the contracting out are raking the money off 
the top instead of it going to the people who used to receive the 
same amount of money in the form of decent wages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All this is wrong.  Canadians ought to be standing shoulder to 
shoulder with all Canadians who stand up to this notion that 
somehow we all have to embrace the low wage economy and accept 
the fact that we will not have time to staff the community clubs, 
the volunteer groups and all the other things that have been done 
by Canadians because they did not have to spend their whole life 
making enough money to make ends meet. They could count on a 
decent wage and time left over to look after their children and 
to look after their community.  We are losing that and it is 
because of legislation like this.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):</b>  Mr. Speaker, I will be 
sharing my time with my colleague for Richmond—Arthabaska. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All we can say today is: finally.  But we must also ask 
ourselves why it took the government so long to show a little 
leadership in the labour dispute with Canada Post. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On November 17, exactly two weeks ago, we asked the Minister 
of Labour what he was waiting for to introduce back-to-work 
legislation.  His answer was that we would do better to concentrate 
on what had already happened and what was in the process of 
happening, rather than on what might happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This response was very indicative of the laissez-faire 
attitude of the minister who has gotten us into the mess in which 
we now find ourselves. It was precisely because I took an interest 
in what had already happened and what was in the process of 
happening that I implored him to introduce back-to-work 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Negotiations began eight months ago in April.  They seemed to 
be deteriorating with each passing day and there was nothing to 
indicate progress.  If the minister had come back to earth, he 
would have seen that a postal dispute would have terrible 
consequences for many Canadians.  He would have acted accordingly. 
But he refused to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result, thousands of businesses have lost money and 
thousands of Canadians have had to put up with inconvenience and 
headaches that could have been avoided. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consider for example small and medium size businesses. Last 
Wednesday, the Canadian Federation of Independent Business released the 
results of a survey of its members. According to this survey, the postal 
strike was costing an average of $240 a day because of higher delivery 
costs, lost sales and late payments. It is estimated that total losses 
for small and medium size businesses are around $200 million a day. This 
is absolutely incredible. And the government did nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Christmas period is very important, even essential, for many 
mail order businesses, but it is also an important period for charitable 
organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These have experienced a dramatic drop in the money they raise. 
What is the government's answer going to be for these organizations who 
will not be able to do their work in their communities because of the 
Minister of Labour's lack of courage and because of the schemes of the 
minister responsible for Canada Post? There is not much that can be said 
about that, is there?

them by mail.  My children need their support payments to 
survive. The Canada Post Corporation, the Canadian Union of 
Public Employees and the Government of Canada are stopping me 
from meeting my obligations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The province of Ontario will deem me in arrears if/when I 
miss a payment.  Yet we did not receive anything from the 
provincial government directing us what to do in the event of a 
postal strike. All businesses had plans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government's Bill C-41 ensures that I will lose my 
driver's licence, passport, credit rating, ad nauseam, all 
because of their failures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Children starving, mothers struggling, being out on the street. 
Neither government or union care.  Why didn't they think about 
the women and children prior to the postal strike.  Why aren't 
they thinking about children and women? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure you will agree that this is a very telling letter 
which shows the wide impact of this postal strike on everyone, 
especially the least fortunate. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues also raised in the House the case of a man who could 
not purchase the insulin he required because he had not received his 
government cheque. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the nightmare stories do not end there.  In Newfoundland it 
seemed that the distribution process the department of human 
resources had set out was a miserable failure.  When recipients 
showed up at the distribution centre they were presented with a 
computer print-out which they had to sign to acknowledge receipt 
of their government cheques. That would not have been so bad if 
the computer print-out did not also contain the names, addresses 
and cheque amounts of every other recipient in that community. 
This situation has prompted the privacy commissioner to review 
and evaluate if a breach of the Privacy Act has indeed occurred. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did this happen?  There had been an agreement that the 
postal workers would distribute government cheques in the event 
of a strike.  However, the government ignored that agreement and 
proceeded with its own agenda. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most ridiculous in all this is that the minister knew, on 
Thursday, October 30, that the commissioner-conciliator was preparing 
his report and that a strike could legally start seven days later.  Even 
when he had the report on his desk, the following Tuesday, he chose not 
to do anything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather than introducing a preempting back-to-work bill more than a 
month ago, he chose to allow an interruption of Canadian postal 
services, which is harming businesses and charities, and inconveniencing 
millions of Canadians.  This is outrageous, especially since the 
solution was so easy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In October 1991, our government passed a law for the continuation 
of postal services. 
That law prevented a lockout or strike from hurting the Canadian 
economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also put into place a mechanism for dispute settlement which 
allowed Canada Post and the Canadian Union of Postal Workers to come to 
a negotiated agreement without the cost and pain of a strike.  In this 
case, because of the lack of leadership in the Liberal government, we 
had to wait until today for a solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is somewhat late for thousands of businesses and charities which 
have lost money.  It is also late for thousands of Canadians who rely on 
the post office and have suffered the consequences of the strike. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is regrettable that they should bear the brunt of the 
incompetence of this government.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu, BQ):</b> Mr. Speaker, I was surprised 
to hear the speech made by the member who just spoke, to see how he 
focused solely on the need for services without blaming Post Canada for 
not respecting its employees in these negotiations.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Several members raised this issue, especially NDP and Bloc members, 
and they showed that these negotiations were nothing but a farce. In 
fact, the dice were loaded before the negotiations even started, and 
they pretended to negotiate. We ended up with a dispute that we know was 
caused in part by the government. The minister's speech a few moments 
ago confirmed—he addressed the House as if he were president of the 
Canada Post Corporation—that there was collusion between Canada Post 
and the minister responsible, whereas the minister should have been 
trying to bring the parties closer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member put all the blame on the union who went out on strike 
and complained about services not being provided to the public. But I 
think he was rather lenient towards the government in his speech and I 
want to know what kind of work atmosphere he thinks will result from the 
fact that the rates of pay provided for in this legislation by the 
government are lower than what Post Canada had offered. With regard to 
salaries, Canada Post had offered more than what is provided for in the 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member not think that this is unusual in this kind of 
legislation? We must start from the offers that were on the table and 
ask the mediator to try to bring the two parties together, but not 
before the conciliation process begins with this new mediator appointed 
by the minister under this bill. Our motion to amend clause 8 of the 
bill so that the mediator can be chosen in consultation with both 
parties was rejected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So I ask the member if he would agree to recommend to the 
government that the mediator be appointed in consultation with both 
parties and that the rates of pay provided for in the bill be the same 
as those offered by Post Canada.

piece of legislation quite similar to the one passed in Quebec 
under Robert Bourassa.  In those days, they did not hesitate for 
a single second before putting him in jail with his two partners, 
Marcel Pépin and Louis Laberge.  He was incarcerated for twelve 
months because he had encouraged his followers to defy the law.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Mark Muise:</b>  Mr. Speaker, the true question here today 
is what the Canadian public, small and medium size companies and 
charities have suffered over the past weeks since the postal 
strike began.  That is my concern and that is why I made my 
interventions this evening. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK304"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. André Bachand (Richmond—Arthabasca, PC):</b> Mr. Speaker, first, 
a few comments, because throughout the day we have listened to what 
others had to say about the back to work bill before the House. It is 
with some reluctance that the Conservative Party will vote for this 
bill. I must say however that we will be consistent with the statements 
we have made in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will review the comments made by some hon. members from the Bloc 
and the NDP. For instance, the hon. member from the NDP who spoke before 
my hon. colleague said that we have a parliamentary dictatorship, that 
parties argue at election time to see who will get the parliamentary 
dictatorship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing is sure, the New Democrats have no chance at all of being 
part of this so-called parliamentary dictatorship. However, I would like 
to point out that they are very closer to a proletarian dictatorship, 
something that does not seem to have worked in Europe. So, we have 
nothing to learn from the kind of dictatorship the NDP could propose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some have argued wrongly that Canada Post will become a cash cow, 
when this crown corporation should just break even. I would like to 
remind our friends from the Bloc that, in the province the Quebec, those 
very same criticisms are made every day about Hydro-Québec. But Hydro-Québec 
keeps increasing its rates and reducing its staff so that the 
Quebec government can benefit from higher dividends. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to be careful about the statements we make. We may be 
against the legislation before us today, we may be against a lot of 
things, but we have to be sure of ourselves when we give examples. For 
instance, some people said Quebec is the realm of social democracy, but 
let me remind my colleagues that successive Quebec governments, whatever 
their political stripe, have introduced since 1975 or 1976 the largest 
number of special back to work bills setting conditions of employment. 
The hon. member for Frontenac—Mégantic should know about that. The wage 
scales of teachers in Quebec have been frozen now for more than six or 
eight years. He should be aware of that. And it was a social democrat 
government that implemented the freeze. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That having been said, Bloc and NDP members have made a great deal 
of the amendment they managed to wrest from this dictatorial Liberal 
government, an amendment on clause 9 which we did not support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me remind them without demoralizing them too much that clause 
9 deals with economic stability the Canada Post Corporation must achieve 
without recourse to undue increases in postal rates. They should have 
listened to what the minister responsible for Canada Post had to say 
this afternoon. He made a commitment not to increase postal rates in the 
next two years and that the inflation rate would apply in the third 
year. Therefore, this clause does not mean anything. But I do not want 
to discourage them. That is part and parcel of parliamentary politics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The worst part in this bill and in the 1991 bill and all previous 
back to work legislation is that, as a matter of fact, the normal 
negotiating process did not take place. We do not need a strike to 
realize it did not take place. There is and there has been a big problem 
at Canada Post for years, for decades. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Several previous governments have tried to address this problem. In 
the past we had strikes and labour conflicts every year and a half to 
two years and a half or so, with postal workers and letter carriers 
taking turns. We tried to create one big union in order to have a better 
balance in the negotiating process. Unfortunately, it did not work out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this bill before us today, only one party has moved amendments 
to prevent this type of legislation from being needed again in the 
future. 
We had three amendments, including one on clause 21, but they did not 
get the support of government members, of Bloc members or NDP members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those amendments required the employer, Canada Post, and the union 
to start considering right away a new process for negotiating and 
ratifying the collective agreement. Those amendments have been 
criticized. But when the time comes to find a solution before the end of 
the next agreement, none of them will be around.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When we want to bring in real solutions, they are not there. We 
have brought forward solutions. However, it must be recognized that 
there is an imbalance in the negotiation process in that there is no 
negotiation process. In dealing with crown corporations, there is always 
that sword the government can dangle, special legislation from coast to 
coast. In the last 30 years, numerous special bills have been introduced 
by all governments, be they social democrats, white, red, blue, right 
wing or left wing governments. It has become fashionable to bring in 
special legislation. There have been cuts everywhere. Governments are 
now governing with special laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I remind the other parties, the people of the union as well 
as those of the Canada Post Corporation and the public that we have 
brought forward solutions to prevent strikes and special legislation, 
but our friends of the New Democratic Party and those of the Bloc 
Quebecois have opposed them. As for the Reform Party, its only proposal 
dealt with a small mechanism in the special law, a binding arbitration 
process applying to this collective agreement, but it says nothing about 
the future. Frankly, it is extremely disappointing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bloc members should stop playing holier than thou because their 
cousins in Quebec City are doing exactly the same thing. They should 
remember negotiations last year and this year. Before having the honour 
of being elected to the House of Commons, I was a mayor. The government 
sent us a bill. Whether it was right or wrong is not the question. 
It told labour and everybody else “Labour costs have to be reduced by 6% 
or we will bring in special legislation”. What kind of negotiating is 
this? This is not negotiating. The same thing is happening now with 
Canada Post. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we want to do today is put the process back on track because 
we in the Conservative Party know one thing, namely that we a have a 
labour code, we have a charter of rights and the right of association 
cannot be tempered with. However, when you deal with a service deemed 
essential to the operation of a country, province or area, one must look 
at the negotiation mechanisms. Maybe we should stop crying foul and sit 
down to find solutions. But our friends next to us, mainly on our left, 
but also on our right, do not agree that we can sit down and put the 
negotiating process back on track. 
We have witnessed everywhere, especially in the Asbestos area, a great 
improvement of labour relations. Why? Because of the setting up of a co-op. 
This example has occurred in a Quebec town. My friend from 
Frontenac—Mégantic knows all about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can take initiatives, we can be original, we can propose 
amendments, as we did. However we ask that others listen, open their 
mind, stop being partisan saying  “We support unions” or “We support 
employers”. This is not what it is all about. We support people. We 
support Canadians and Quebeckers. This is what the Conservative Party 
stands for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That having been said, I will conclude. Those who followed the 
debate heard the minister responsible for Canada Post declare that he 
will review the process and the mandate of the Canada Post Corporation. 
I invite everybody to keep a very close eye on the minister because he 
often makes promises he does not keep. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For our part, we will keep an eye on him. Bear with us, Mr. 
Speaker, through our critic for the Canada Post Corporation, we promise 
to bring you alternatives. We just hope that our friends in this Chamber 
will be willing to co-operate with the Conservative Party so that we 
never again have to see special back to work legislation brought in 
under conditions that do not please anybody.

to make a speech against Quebec. This is surprising because he should be 
talking about Canada Post.

including pay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the parliamentary game of procedures and amendments here 
today, however, it has been impossible for us to support this

negotiation, which also reflects what is being done elsewhere, as

<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK308"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Denis Coderre (Bourassa, Lib.):</b> Mr. Speaker, there are two 
sorts of laws.  First there are those the government proposes 
because it wants them, like those providing work, strengthening the 
social safety net or improving the justice system.  Then there are 
those that the government is obliged to adopt.  I think it is 
obvious to all the members at least on our side that this bill 
belongs in the second category. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I rise to speak today, because I think it is time to set the 
record straight.  We have heard all sorts of mud slinging from 
the members of the Bloc.  They tried to get at my colleague and 
friend the member for Anjou—Rivière-des-Prairies, who, by the 
way, beat a Bloc Quebecois member by over 10,000 votes. So I 
think that people are intelligent in the riding of 
Anjou—Rivière-des-Prairies.  If they elected him with a 10,000 
vote majority, and if they elected me with a 9,000 vote majority, 
that means something.  It also means they elected someone from 
Anjou—Rivière-des-Prairies with labour experience.  This is 
another plus for the Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing is certain.  I have nothing to learn from the likes 
of the Bloc Quebecois, these PQ champions of special legislation, 
of going back on a signature.  Remember 1982. If the member for 
Frontenac—Mégantic were a teacher, he would remember that the PQ 
government introduced a special bill, Bill 111, which repudiated 
the signing of collective agreements and cut his salary by 20%. 
That is a gang that works for workers.  Give me a break. 
If they say our minister takes himself for the President of Canada 
Post, I do not know whether they look like the union president, but 
there are certainly problems.  This special legislation was one 
hundred times worse than Bill C-24. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And to top it all, who was the chief negotiator at the time of 
Bill 111?  None other than Lucien Bouchard.  That must hurt.  So I 
have nothing to learn from them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, when we do not agree with the Bloc Quebecois, he 
begins howling that we are not defending Quebec's interests, 
believe it or die.  We are losing $54 million a day. 
Across Canada, including Quebec, charitable organizations have been 
losing more than $10 million a day. The Salvation Army, Jeunesse au 
soleil, these people who collect food and money to help the less 
fortunate could not get this money because of the postal strike. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not pleased with this strike, nor are we pleased to have to 
pass this special legislation. This is clearly a responsible government, 
which has let both parties negotiate during eight months with the help 
of our best mediators, in the person of Marc Gravel and Warren Edmondson—no 
one can say that Edmondson and Gravel are not good mediators, they 
are the best—but the parties did not come to an agreement. If I had 
to choose between our mediators and the Bouchard guys, I am sorry, but 
I think I would rather trust ours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I go any further, I forgot to mention that I will be sharing 
my time with my hon. colleague from Waterloo—Wellington. 
You did get that, but I wanted to make sure.

required at this time.

want. You want me to conclude? Fine. I can come back if you want. I can 
talk for a long time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing is certain: this government acted responsibly. It took 
its responsibilities. We believe in the right to strike. We believe in 
collective bargaining. We let the two sides have a go at it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do not get me wrong: I have nothing against the union or its 
members. I have absolutely nothing against the union or its members, but 
when I hear the Bloc lecturing us at every opportunity, I cannot accept 
it and I wonder who is working for who. I have a right to ask myself 
this question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When $54 million are lost every day, when charities are deprived of 
millions of dollars that are needed to help the poor, the government 
must act responsibly. 
When the public does not get the service to which it is entitled, the 
government must govern and take its responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If you do not agree with this, ask the public, ask all those who 
are watching us. The thousands of people watching us today will 
understand one thing. They will understand that members on this side who 
will vote for the special legislation are looking after the interests of 
Quebeckers and all Canadians. Again, I just realized why, in the latest 
poll conducted in Quebec, 54% support the federal Liberal Party, while 
30% support the Bloc Quebecois. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois may kick a big fuss, it may try to tarnish our 
reputation, it may talk nonsense, the facts are there and people who are 
watching us will judge for themselves. 
There are those who will be voting for this special law—it is not 
perfect, but one thing is clear, this 540-page collective agreement will 
be in effect. If you want me to read parts of this document, I could do 
so all night, but if the average person had such a collective agreement, 
he or she would be very, very happy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When someone can receive jackets, trousers, hats, caps, and shirts, 
when someone has five days off to get married and when his or her spouse 
has the same benefits—and I have nothing against that—these are the 
result of negotiations, and negotiations are a good thing. The special 
law, when it is passed, will be extending this collective agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They still have another chance. There is one vote remaining. I 
congratulate the member for Saint-Bruno—Saint-Hubert who had the 
courage to do what she believed in and who said “For me, this is not how 
it should be. 
I am on the side of the people and I support the special 
legislation”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I hear the member for Terrebonne—Blainville quoting Karl Marx,

fertilizer”.

is more proper with respect to this bill, which led the Liberal 
government to accept an amendment by the NDP, supported by the Bloc 
Quebecois, an amendment that the Liberals accepted to ensure that

the Canada Post Corporation.

the minister of public works who is also responsible for Canada Post, 
behind these phoney negotiations to arrive at this special legislation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we, in the opposition, tried to do is to ensure two things, 
the first being that the rights that are part of the tradition of Quebec 
and Canada in the area of labour relations be respected, and the second 
being that the public can receive postal services as quickly as 
possible. We should not forget that there could have been three, four or 
five days of debate in this House, but there was appropriate co-operation. 
I am not ashamed to explain this to the people in my riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is for the member for Bourassa. Should he not be 
congratulating the Bloc, the NDP and all opposition parties for 
the co-operation and the professionalism they have shown? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Denis Coderre:</b> Mr. Speaker, when a member is asking questions 
and is on the defensive like he is, when he has to resort to crisis 
management in his speech, I think I was right to speak the way I did and 
that, once again, the government was right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing is sure, we stood up for Canadians. I conducted a survey 
in my riding and 76% of the people agree with this kind of legislation. 
Of all those who called me, 76% said they agreed. There are even postal 
workers in my riding who told me they are eager to go back to work, that 
they understand and they will go back to work.

the member a question, but I will make a comment first. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think everybody in Canada knows that I am a unionist. I have 
worked hard for the workers of this country, especially those in my area 
which is economically disadvantaged. The member for Bourassa insulted us 
a while ago. He insulted the workers of this country when he insulted 
unions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would my colleague have the guts, the courage to stand up and 
apologize to the workers of this country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Denis Coderre:</b> Mr. Speaker, first of all, I want to recognize 
the work the hon. member has done because he is an honourable man. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Acadie—Bathurst is an honourable man. Those 
who know me know that, for 15 years now, I have been involved in public 
life and working for the workers. My father was a carpenter. I come of 
working-class stock and I have always stood up for the workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But when we put questions to workers instead of union 
representatives, we do not always get the same message. So, it is not 
because we do not agree with him that we are against unions or against 
union members. Surely this piece of legislation will help our citizens 
get their services back. It will preserve jobs and help the needy. 
<P><A NAME="LINK312"></A></P>

I would like to give the hon. member for Bourassa the opportunity to 
make amends for what he said this afternoon. He just stated that he has 
some respect for unions and union members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to remind the House of what he said earlier this afternoon. 
He said that the union refused a settlement. He said the employer came 
up with a settlement and the union turned it down, and that the rules of 
the Treasury Board must be applied. He added that it was time to 
introduce a special legislation— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</b> We are running out of time. 
Please, give a short answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Denis Coderre:</b> Mr. Speaker, again, it is too easy to quote 
things out of context. One thing is for sure, yes, it is true, a package 
deal was on the table that could have allowed these workers— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien:</b> Apologize. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Denis Coderre:</b> If it had been put to union members, they might

a responsible manner.

the event that they are not settled by mediation.  As specified 
in this legislation, the mediator-arbitrator's report along with 
terms and conditions established by this bill will form the basis 
of the new collective agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government had no choice but to act legislatively to 
restore regular postal service to Canadians.  The economic costs 
to Canadians of a prolonged work stoppage would have been 
immense. Thousands of Canadian business firms and their employees 
depend on the postal service.  A lengthy disruption in postal 
service would threaten the economic viability of those 
enterprises and thus place the jobs of those employees in serious 
jeopardy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Numerous Canadian charities rely on the mail service for support 
and donations at this time of the year.  Many of them receive 
most of their income during this Christmas season. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many Canadians count on the post office during this time of year 
as well to communicate greetings and good wishes to family and 
friends.  Despite the increased use of the Internet and e-mail, 
and despite the availability of efficient courier services, most 
Canadians still depend on the post office to send messages and 
parcels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to those who receive government assistance, while 
contingency plans have been put into place for the delivery and 
distribution of pension and welfare cheques, there is still the 
chance of non-delivery or delays which would cause undo hardship 
on recipients. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, there is the cost to the parties themselves of a 
lengthy work interruption.  Canada Post has been losing millions 
of dollars a day and the workers have been losing huge amounts in 
wages.  It is in no one's interest to see Canada Post Corporation 
brought to its knees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, the public interest requires that the federal 
government bring forward this legislation.  The public interest 
requires that the federal government end the economic hardship 
and uncertainty caused by this work stoppage.  The alternative, 
to let the work stoppage drag on indefinitely, was no alternative 
at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, and having argued the point for the general 
good that Bill C-24 is necessary, I would also express my great 
disappointment that the two parties were not able to come to an 
agreement on their own. As I stated at the outset of my remarks, 
back to work legislation always means a breakdown in the 
collective bargaining process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Collective bargaining is one of the great processes that we have 
established to help us resolve workplace disagreements in an 
orderly, democratic and peaceful way.  History and empirical 
research have shown that collective bargaining has been an 
effective tool for the promotion of both economic development and 
for social justice.  It is also a form of self-government which 
encourages the parties to devise their own responses to the 
issues which divide them.  For all of these reasons, collective 
bargaining is very important in this process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe that I am alone in thinking this way.  I am 
sure that most Canadians prefer to see negotiated settlements to 
labour-management disputes.  I am certain too that both Canada 
Post Corporation and the Canadian Union of Postal Workers would 
prefer to devise their own solutions in these issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would have liked to have seen more flexibility given to this 
process including in the wage area.  Further negotiation in this 
area by the two parties would have been desirable as opposed to 
the imposed wage settlement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some in the trade union movement and some in the New 
Democratic Party who would strongly criticize the government for 
bringing in this back to work legislation.  I can genuinely 
understand their position, but I would ask them at what point was 
the government supposed to act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Was it when Canada Post reached the point of no return 
financially? 
Was it when thousands of Canadian businesses went under and jobs 
were lost?  Was it when Christmas had come and gone and Canadians 
were unable to communicate with their friends and family?  Or was 
it when numerous Canadian charities had to start to lay off staff 
and were unable to meet the needs of the very people they serve?

</I></B></P><P align=left>As an objective observer would no doubt conclude, the parties 
had ample time to reach an agreement.  They also had ready access 
to the very able professionals in the Federal Mediation and 
Conciliation Service to help them in their efforts, but they 
obviously could not come to an agreement on their own thereby 
making the intervention of the government virtually inevitable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I note that the Reform Party, the party that always espouses 
less government, has been screaming for government intervention 
for some time.  Apparently, according to the Reform Party 
thinkers, less government is always a preferred policy approach 
except when Canadian workers are exercising their legal rights. 
Then it would seem that more state intervention becomes more 
apparent and more acceptable to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my view, both the official opposition and the New Democratic 
Party have failed to take into account all of the complexities of 
the issue.  They have failed to see that all the stakeholders 
have legitimate rights and concerns and that some kind of balance 
must be found.  That is what effective governing is all about. It 
is about taking everybody's legitimate concerns seriously. The 
government has done that and therefore I recommend passage of 
this bill.

the floor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Miss Deborah Grey:</b>  Mr. Speaker, we will let the boys 
carry on in the background. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to close the debate with some pretty serious thoughts and 
some pretty serious concerns about what we are facing across the 
country right now in terms of 31 million people being without 
postal service.  I am sure, with the noise going on behind me, 
that they have an equal number of concerns about the postal 
strike. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me make a few comments about some of the things the 
constituency of Edmonton North has been facing and talking about 
regarding this postal strike.   People were concerned that the 
postal strike would occur.  They were trying to make alternate 
arrangements for the delivery of mail.  They were trying to make 
sure their voice was heard and that Canada Post, which is a 
monopoly, was not going out into a strike situation.  We 
certainly hoped that as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party believes in the collective bargaining process. 
We believe in conciliation.  We believe in the mediation process. 
We were truly hoping that the situation would be resolved, that 
CUPW and Canada Post would get along, and that we would have 
good, sure, safe delivery of mail, especially in this Christmas 
season. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately that did not happen.  The member for West 
Kootenay—Okanagan asked for an emergency debate on the very day 
the postal strike happened.  We knew what would happen if it got 
into a crippling situation with mail right across the country. 
Government ministers such as the Minister of Labour would stand, 
as they did for days after in question period, and say “I will 
look after the collective bargaining process”.  That is exactly 
what made me and the people in my riding nervous.  We heard him 
say  “I am the one that will look after everything”.  It made 
the hair on the back of my neck stand up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two weeks later here we are with a postal strike that has cost 
an estimated $3 billion.  The government could have done this on 
the very first day.  It could have bargained in good faith.  It 
is just a terrible thing.  Maybe we should label the Minister of 
Labour the $3 billion man.  That is what it has cost.  They put 
this thing off and off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard last week that there would be a picket in my 
constituency office in Edmonton North by some CUPW workers.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those who worked with Canada Post were out on strike and they 
came to my office on Friday morning.  I phoned and spoke to their 
union representative and said:  “I look forward to talking to 
you.  I am not going to lock my door on you.  I believe your 
members have the right to protest peacefully.”  It was certainly 
a different scene than what we saw when the Prime Minister 
shouted down those people who were peacefully demonstrating at 
the APEC conference where the RCMP had ordered pepper spray in 
their faces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said to these union members: “Come into my office.  I would 
like to talk to you about this situation.”  They came in and I 
had coffee and Tim Horton's donuts ready for them and we had a 
really good visit.  I spent 45 minutes talking with them.  A 
couple of the union people said: “We think we should negotiate a 
settlement.”  I said: “I agree with you. We should negotiate a 
settlement.”  Unfortunately, both sides just were not able to 
come to any sort of an agreement.  I said: “There has to be a 
better way to solve this thing than having four strikes since 
1987; two in 1987, one in 1991 and another one in 1997.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not matter if the Tories or the Liberals are in power, 
it goes back and forth.  Basically, it is just the flip side of 
the same loonie.  Whoever is in power, the other side goes 
hysterical and says:  “You simply cannot do this.” Then the 
other side that is in opposition goes hysterical also. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has to be some long term solution so that we are not going 
to continue to face postal strikes for the next 10 or 15 years, 
if they are allowed to keep the monopoly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to ask the question: is there not a better way than the 
opposition and the government going crazy and then flipping 
sides?  There has to be a better way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We think that final offer arbitration is the way to go.  If 
someone happens to work for Safeway and goes on strike, and we 
believe that there is a right to strike peacefully, then we can 
always buy our groceries at the IGA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Maple Leaf meat processing packing plant in Edmonton is on 
strike right now.  We could buy wieners at Schneider's.  We have 
a choice.  But when Canada Post goes on strike, that's it, 
especially if you happen to live in rural Canada.  There are not 
a lot of options to delivery service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We say that there are places and times that are so important 
that final offer arbitration is when we should ask: “What is 
your bottom line, side A?  And what is your bottom line, side 
B?”  Then someone can come in and arbitrate that so that we do 
not get into a crippling situation such as we have again for the 
fourth time in 10 years.  It is an essential service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of people have fax machines, so they do not care if Canada 
Post is out on strike.  A lot of people do not have fax machines 
or modems on their computers, or UPS or Purolator service.  I 
have lived in places like that where the last thing one would see 
is a Purolator delivery service, which does cost extra money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The postal service is fundamental.  On the day that the strike 
was called, my colleague, our critic for the postal service, the 
member for West Kootenay—Okanagan, asked for an emergency 
debate.  It seems that just in the last 24 or 48 hours the 
government has decided that this is an emergency.  Surely to 
heaven it knew something was coming down the pike and we were 
going to have some serious problems before Christmas.  Of course, 
there is a huge bulk of mail that goes through at Christmas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When these people came to my office on Friday, I spent 45 
minutes with them. We discussed the situation and I told them I 
had heard from a tremendous number of people in my constituency 
that want the postal workers to return to work.  I was challenged 
about that by one of the union members who said that he did not 
believe me.  He thought they represented the majority of my 
constituents because they had brought a pile of letters with 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most of these people were not from my riding but those from 
Edmonton North came and said: “Okay, here you are.  We have the 
majority now. We must outweigh the number of phone calls and the 
number of people who have complained.  We represent the majority 
now and you as a Reformer are bound to vote the majority 
consensus of your constituents.”  I said:  “You are about 100 
here today”.  I have about 100,000 constituents and I certainly 
have not heard from all of them.  But I was challenged by the 
postal workers to ask: “How do you know if there is a majority 
here?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not long after their visit, I got the news that the government 
had introduced its back to work legislation somewhere around noon 
on Friday.  I thought there had been a change of heart by the 
government.  It has been on a rant for the last two weeks saying 
that it was not going to legislate them back to work.  Then all 
of a sudden it brought in legislation.

people think.  I will tell members how we know what 100,000 
people think.  We commission a scientific poll that by proof— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Some hon. members:</b>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Miss Deborah Grey:</b>  It is certainly a start to know what 
people think.  I challenge the members, who are howling, to stand 
in their places.  It is something that is scientifically balanced 
and reliable.  It is one measure we can use to make sure people 
have a chance to tell their MPs what they think.  I agree the MPs 
might be fishing or looking for some sort of result.  I would 
hate to think that any MP would try to skew results according to 
their little personal opinion or their party's stand.  Heaven 
help them if they go against that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commissioned that poll on Friday afternoon.  We went to 
tender.  We had a company that I had never commissioned any work 
with before.  It went to work as soon as Saturday morning 
arrived.  I commissioned the poll late Friday afternoon.  Members 
can chuckle or laugh, but I do not think it is funny that 
government members are having a yuck-yuck time with 31 million 
people out of work.  That is the important point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I wanted to find out what the people thought, I 
commissioned a scientific, balanced and reliable poll.  Here are 
the results, Mr. Speaker.  I know you will be interested in them 
as you and I are just about neighbours in Edmonton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Edmonton North constituents were asked one very simple question. 
It is pretty easy to try to skew some results if ones want such 
and such an answer.  I wanted an answer about the back to work 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Basically this is what we asked. “The government is proposing 
back to work legislation requiring Canada Post workers to return 
to their jobs.  Do you think they should be sent back to their 
jobs?  Yes or no”.  It was a pretty simple question.  Whether a 
Liberal, a Tory, an NDP or a Bloc, one could probably figure out 
the question.  It did not take up 20 minutes of people's time.  I 
think people get pretty tired sometimes of pollsters phoning 
around. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some 68% of the people in Edmonton North said back to work now; 
20.9% said no; and 11% said they were not really sure.  All they 
knew was that they were not getting any mail.  They were not sure 
and did not understand the process of back to work legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is kind of interesting that there would be such a ruckus on 
the other side of the House right now.  Are they decrying 
democracy?  Surely not.  The Tories would not giggle about 
democracy.  Surely not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Someone at the other end from Abitibi used to serve as a Tory MP 
and is now a Liberal MP.  He took his jacket off today and dared 
Canada Post workers to come on down for a fight.  Is that a 
really noble and democratic way to work around this?  What a 
pity.  What a pathetic, irrelevant thing to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather than getting into a fracas about whether we legislate 
people back from a strike, let us make sure we up front and do 
not get into that situation another four times in the next 10 
years.  We need final offer arbitration to make sure we do not 
get into these ugly situations again.  It is not a very nice 
situation for postal workers to be in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I talked with those 125 workers when they came into my office 
the other day.  They wanted to get back to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>An hon. member:</b>  Is that the scientific poll?
