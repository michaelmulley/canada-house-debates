Canadians are celebrating National Forestry Week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For over 70 years National Forestry Week has reminded us that our 
forests are vital to Canada's economy and way of life.  We should 
all take the time over the next few days to learn more about the 
important role played by forests in our economy and in our 
environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is our responsibility to ensure that our forests are managed 
responsibly so that future generations can enjoy the many 
benefits our forests provide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this time I would like to salute all those who work to 
protect our forests, including those in Oxford County who work in 
conservation and forestry.  Special mention should be made of 
those who maintain the Leslie M. Dixon Memorial Arboretum, the 
Brick Ponds Wetlands complex and the Oxford County forest.

take this opportunity to pay tribute Victor Koby, a constituent

provided business consultation advice to a Polish company 
involved in the manufacture of water heating systems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Koby assisted the company to develop a business plan 
encompassing marketing and professional development.   He also 
organized a three-day management conference to involve senior 
employees in the planning and decision making process.

his outstanding and selfless efforts to assist a company in 
coping with the new economic realities of the Polish economy.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the Mike Harris government is creating growth, opportunity and 
more and better jobs through tax relief.  Having already reduced 
income taxes by 30%, yesterday's budget delivered a plan for 36 
new tax cuts for families and businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Harris tax cuts are proof that it is possible to reduce the 
size of government while spending more on key priority programs 
such as education and health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bravo, Ontario.  By letting families and businesses keep more of 
their hard earned income, consumer spending is higher, confidence 
is up and economic growth is racing ahead of the national 
average.  What a contrast to the tax and spend status quo at the 
federal level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government's $10 billion CPP tax hike, combined with 
huge personal income and capital gains taxes is undermining the 
economy, stifling the entrepreneurial spirit and hurting 
families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But Ontario should take heart.  Its efforts are not falling on 
deaf ears here in Ottawa.  The official opposition is fighting 
for real tax relief at the federal level and we are going to give 
Canadians a chance at the next election to vote for Ontario style 
hope, growth and opportunity.

that I would like to say to the people of Swan Lake that they 
have our sympathy and support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure that the resilience and fortitude of the citizens of 
Swan Lake will see them through this crisis, but they should know 
that in their hour of need all Canadians, including those in this

is my pleasure to stand in the House of Commons today to 
congratulate the St. Catharines Collegiate Institute and 
Vocational School on its 75th anniversary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To celebrate this historic occasion the collegiate is hosting a 
reunion for the many thousands of students and teachers who are 
alumni of the school. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the collegiate first opened its doors in 1923 it was the 
only secondary school in St. Catharines.  Over the next 30 years 
everyone who attended high school in the city went to this 
school.  More than 20,000 students have walked the halls of the 
collegiate and grown up in the classrooms of this historic place 
of learning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the weekend of May 15 to 17 several thousand of these alumni 
are expected to return to the collegiate to celebrate its 
anniversary at a huge three-day reunion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very important event for the school and indeed for the 
entire community.  It is an opportunity to celebrate our youth, 
our past and our present, to celebrate the teachers whose work 
has inspired and guided our young people and to gather together 
to commemorate 75 years of education in St. Catharines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate the St. Catharines Collegiate Institute and 
Vocational School and send best wishes on this special 75th 
anniversary.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, members 
of the Canadian Union of Postal Workers have a legitimate concern 
that the arbitration process set up to settle their contract 
dispute with Canada Post has been irredeemably damaged by the 
arbitrator himself.  Remarks made by the arbitrator suggest that 
in advance of hearing the union's position he has already made up 
his mind on certain issues and leans heavily in favour of the 
corporation's position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Union of Postal Workers has asked the federal court 
to remove the arbitrator in view of its “reasonable apprehension 
of bias”.  From the beginning of this contract dispute there 
have been serious concerns that bargaining in good faith had been 
compromised by a government holding the threat of back to work 
legislation over the heads of the union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the fact that the recent remarks of the arbitrator, 
Justice Guy Richard, have totally undermined the credibility of 
the arbitration process, the NDP today urges the Minister of 
Labour to disqualify the arbitrator, give Canada Post a mandate 
to negotiate and allow the parties to get back to the table to 
negotiate a fair settlement through free collective bargaining.

of my constituents of Timmins—James Bay.  The forest industry, 
through pulp and paper and lumber, has created some 4,000 jobs in 
the riding.  It has helped to establish dynamic communities like 
Hearst, Kapuskasing and Smooth Rock Falls.  It has secured 
economic growth in the whole area.  Forests have also provided 
enjoyment through camping, hunting, fishing, hiking and 
snowmobiling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Forestry Association has proclaimed this week as 
National Forestry Week.  It is a time for us to reflect on the 
vital role forests play in our daily lives and the great benefits 
we have inherited from our forests.  However, is also a time for 
us to increase our awareness of the importance of preserving the 
health of our forests since they are equally important to the 
health of the local, national and global environment.

urged him to compensate hepatitis C victims infected before 1986.

compensated and not whether they should be compensated, and he 
has committed up to $200 million for pre-1986 victims.

affected.  They will follow the instructions of the House of

the Government of Quebec. 
<P><A NAME="LINK36"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr.

is prepared to negotiate expanded compensation for hepatitis C 
victims before 1986. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First the government refuses to take responsibility.  Then it 
refuses to put any more money on the table.  After the caucus

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr.

Harris did not break the deal.  He confirmed his commitment to 
compensation to victims between 1986 and 1990. Then he expanded 
that compensation to victims before 1986, and what kind of 
response does he get from the government?  Insults. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are the government's attacks on Premier Harris not really 
designed to scuttle these negotiations rather than to help the 
victims of hepatitis C?

</I></B></P><P align=left>On Friday the ministers of health of all the provinces had a 
telephone conference.  The president of that group, the minister 
of health from Saskatchewan, made a public statement on behalf of 
everybody, on behalf of everybody.  It was within hours that the 
Premier of Ontario disavowed the minister of health of Ontario. I

he has done bravely is said that there must be a new deal for the

Harris changing his mind Friday afternoon.  He has changed his 
mind more often than that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last summer he said no compensation for any victim.  Last March 
he joined with us in agreeing cash would be paid for 1986 to 1990 
and health care for the others. 
Last Friday he reaffirmed that.  Then he threw that position away 
for the reasons he gave on Monday. Mike Harris has changed his 
mind more than once.

</I></B></P><P align=left>While the government is toying with the idea of funding 
professional sports to the tune of millions of dollars, under

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski—Mitis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the

issue of funding for sports.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Hélène Alarie (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is 
for the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Very shortly, the Atlantic groundfish strategy will end, and 
thousands of people who depend on it are anxious about the 
future. Four months ago, the four Atlantic provinces and Quebec 
asked the Minister of Human Resources Development to take 
positive steps to reassure the people.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, these past four years, the 
Atlantic groundfish strategy has provided assistance to fishers 
and plant workers to the tune of $1.9 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The program will end in August 1998, and I can assure you that 
my cabinet colleagues and I are working very hard right now, 
based on the information available to us, to help those who will 
be living in an environment where, unfortunately, there are much 
fewer fish than we had hoped. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we do realize they are going through a tough time right

in Newfoundland alone, there are 30,000 workers affected, twice 
as many as in the Ontario automobile industry, does the Prime 
Minister not realize the social, economic and psychological cost 
of his inaction to those involved? 
<P><A NAME="LINK80"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we are so keenly aware of the 
importance of these 30,000 people in Atlantic Canada the hon. 
member referred to that we, as a government, established this 
strategy back in 1993-94. So we cannot be accused of not doing 
our job, quite the contrary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can assure you that we are being vigilant and that we have 
consulted closely with the communities and the provinces 
concerned. We have a good idea of the situation. We know this is 
a period of intense stress for many people right now. But the 
strategy will nonetheless end in August, and by then, we will be 
ready to act.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>TAXATION 
</H3><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK82"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, over 
the last three years the average family of four in Ontario making 
$60,000 has received about $3,500 in tax relief from the 
provincial government, but from the federal government they 
receive not even a thin dime, nothing.  In fact taxes have gone 
up on the federal level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it that the Government of Ontario understands that that 
money belongs to the taxpayers?  Why can it figure out but the 
federal finance minister does not seem to have a clue? 
<P><A NAME="LINK83"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, in the last federal budget 83% of Ontarians received an 
income tax reduction.  At the same time Ontarians of all classes, 
students and single mothers also received special tax credits. In 
fact it is one of the most substantial tax reductions in Canadian 
budgets for a long time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would put to the finance critic that the Reform Party's 
position is that no tax reduction should come until the deficit 
has been eliminated.  Is it now swallowing itself whole in 
supporting the Ontario government? 
<P><A NAME="LINK84"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, a 
Reform government would have balanced the budget three years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact of the matter is that since this government came to 
power it has hiked taxes 36 times.  Taxes are $6 billion higher 
than they were when the government came to power.  Suffice it to 
say, this government is the world champion when it comes to 
taxes, higher taxes than any country in the G-7 thanks to this 
finance minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When is the finance minister going to figure it out?  That money 
belongs to taxpayers, not to his greedy caucus and greedy 
cabinet. 
<P><A NAME="LINK85"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, first of all be very clear that the Ontario government 
has reduced taxes and it still has a deficit.  That is in exact 
contradiction to the Reform Party policy.

Because it is a shared body of water with the United States I 
have written today to Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to 
ask that we have a direct reference to the international joint 
commission that will rule on this matter.

not to accept a contract offer from Nav Canada.  The two sides 
are impossibly far apart.

wants to cut its costs by 17.5% over three years.  My question is 
to the Minister of Transport.  What contingency plan does he have 
in place to prevent a disastrous shutdown of the air traffic 
system in Canada?

Mr. Speaker, we regret very much that the air traffic controllers 
have rejected a settlement that has been negotiated by their

with the union representatives to look at other changes that can 
be made.

repeating in this House that, were it not for the federal

refused to take part.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>THE LATE MARCEL DIONNE 
</H3><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK126"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Coderre (Bourassa, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this past 
March a good friend of mine, the former member for Chicoutimi, 
passed away at the age of 66. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Marcel Dionne, a man of substance, a man of great importance to 
his community, a man of great commitment, is no longer with us. 
I feel that it is appropriate to pay tribute to him here today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was an MP from 1979 to 1984.  I met him for the first time in 
1983 when I was with the young federal Liberals of Quebec.  He 
was always closely involved with young people. He was an 
untiring worker for his community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to review some of his accomplishments for which he 
never really got enough credit because of the Conservative 
sweep in 1984. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, Marcel Dionne picked up on an old project of his 
predecessor, Paul Langlois.  He convinced the federal government 
to upgrade the port of Chicoutimi by removing some huge oil 
tanks.  Construction of the federal administrative complex of le 
Vieux Port was also part of this project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The port of Grande Anse, of growing importance in the 
development of the region's economy, was another of the major 
projects for which he was responsible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taking advantage of a visit to the Saguenay by then Prime 
Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau, Marcel Dionne managed to 
convince him of the need to undertake capital projects at CFB 
Bagotville for F-18 combat aircraft maintenance facilities. 
The base's future was guaranteed by an agreement with the 
American government on the NORAD defence system, signed by 
President Reagan and Prime Minister Mulroney in the early months 
of the Mulroney years, during the U.S. president's visit to Quebec 
City. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to his political career, Marcel Dionne was involved 
in a number of other areas.  He was president of the Saguenéens 
de Chicoutimi and of the Quebec major junior hockey league, as 
well as president of the Quebec potato growers federation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Originally from the Eastern Townships, Marcel Dionne moved to 
Saint-Ambroise in 1963 where he ran a potato operation for 13 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, almost immediately after he lost his seat in 
1984, Marcel was diagnosed with cancer. Still, he returned to 
work in the Eastern Townships.  He was a brave man who never 
gave up. 
At the time of his death he was an assistant commissioner with 
the Canadian Grain Commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two of the five Dionne children still live in the Chicoutimi 
area, a son Yves, who is a police officer, and a daughter, 
Carole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My most sincere condolences, on behalf of the government, to all 
of the members of the Dionne family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So long, Marcel.

with great respect that I rise in the House today to pay tribute 
to one of my peers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A native of the Eastern Townships, Marcel Dionne represented the 
federal riding of Chicoutimi from 1979 to 1984.  During his term 
of office, Marcel Dionne helped bring about a number of 
important achievements for his constituents such as the 
redevelopment of the port of Chicoutimi and the survival of CFB 
Bagotville. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was also active in his community.  He was the president of 
the Chicoutimi Saguenéens of Quebec's major junior hockey league 
and president of the Fédération des producteurs de pommes de 
terre du Québec.  He had also successfully battled cancer and 
was working as an assistant commissioner on the Canadian Grain 
Commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the Reform Party, I extend my deepest condolences 
to members of the Dionne family.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, on behalf 
of the Bloc Quebecois, I am pleased to pay tribute to Marcel 
Dionne who died on March 3 at the age of 66. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A native of the Eastern Townships, Mr. Dionne quickly became a 
member of the Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean community.  He represented 
the riding of Chicoutimi in the House of Commons from 1979 to 
1984 and held the position of Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I and my fellow citizens in the Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean area 
remember him as a very committed individual who spared no 
effort in promoting our region's socio-economic development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many people now recognize that he was a catalyst of important 
achievements for our community. 
Those achievements included the redevelopment of the port of 
Chicoutimi, in collaboration with the entire regional community 
and then MLA Marc-André Bédard.  This undertaking required that 
giant reservoirs be moved and the Vieux Port federal 
administrative complex built. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The port of Grande Anse, which is now a hub in the development 
of our regional economy, was one of the major projects to which 
the former member for Chicoutimi contributed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was also responsible for the development of CFB Bagotville, 
which required major investments for the maintenance of CF-18 
fighters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unfortunate I must say that he was never given credit for 
these major accomplishments because of the 
Progressive Conservative sweep in 1984, which denied him the 
opportunity to continue his excellent work in our region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to his very full career in politics, Mr. Dionne 
worked in various other fields. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before making a political name for himself, he headed a potato 
production company for 13 years.  He made a major contribution 
to modernizing agriculture in our region, enabling us to attain 
self-sufficiency in the production of potatoes in the early 
1970s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was active in his community as well, serving as president of 
the Saguenéens de Chicoutimi of the Quebec major junior hockey 
league and president of the Quebec federation of potato 
producers. 
At the time of his death he was an assistant commissioner with 
the Canadian Grain Commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the Bloc Quebecois I offer my sympathy to all the 
members of the Dionne family and my condolences to the people in 
the riding of Chicoutimi and our region whom he served so well.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour (Beauséjour—Petitcodiac, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I

Chicoutimi in the House of Commons, Marcel Dionne, who died 
yesterday at the age of 66 from a heart attack. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to his career in politics Mr. Dionne worked in 
various fields.  He was president of the Saguenéens de

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure 
to rise to pay tribute to my predecessor. Although we do not 
have the same political affiliation nationally, I think the fact 
remains that Mr. Dionne has been an efficient member of 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Marcel never liked heckling and off the cuff remarks, but he 
would set goals for himself and usually achieve them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I have tried to share with Marcel for several years is 
first and foremost the love of our region and passionate 
dedication to our riding. I recall that during the 1984 
election campaign a slightly negative article was written by a 
journalist from outside Quebec, which was somewhat unfair to our 
region and to the city of Chicoutimi in particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember how passionately Marcel set the record straight here 
in the House in order to restore the good name of our region 
and particularly that of our city, Chicoutimi, at the national 
level. He was successful because a correction was made in a 
national forum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Marcel worked hard on very concrete issues like the ones 
mentioned a moment ago by my colleagues. The port of Grande-Anse 
was indeed his greatest achievement. Also the base in 
Bagotville benefited from his repeated representations. Goodness 
knows how important it is in a region like ours to look after an 
infrastructure such as the base in Bagotville. Otherwise its 
role diminishes. We must therefore continually remind the 
government of the value of having in Quebec a facility as 
strategic as this one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the social level Marcel was heavily involved with a team 
that is massively supported by the people of the region and a 
great source of pride to us, les Saguenéens.  Then, of course, 
he was also the president of the Fédération des producteurs de 
pommes de terre. After coming to our region in 1963, he ran a 
potato operation which created a number of jobs and is a source 
of regional pride to this day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember that Marcel and I had differences of opinion on 
occasion.  I recall, for instance, that between 1981 and 1984 we 
did not see eye to eye about the old port of Chicoutimi where 
some housing was planned.  We did not agree on this concept, but 
it was the one that eventually won out after public 
consultations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He never held it against me.  On several occasions he told me “I 
think giving the river back to the people instead of building 
housing in the old port was the right way to go”. He recognized 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My most recent memories have been particularly of his courage in 
the face of his illness.  God knows, he met the challenge with 
great courage and for a long time seemed to have gained the 
upper hand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of my party and myself I express our 
most sincere condolences to his entire family.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CANADA LANDS SURVEYORS ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK165">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK166"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Anderson (for the Minister of Natural 
Resources)</B> moved that Bill C-31, an act respecting Canada 
Lands Surveyors, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK167"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Byrne (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Natural Resources, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to 
open debate on Bill C-31, an important piece of legislation that 
will transfer to the Association of Canada Lands Surveyors 
specific responsibilities related to professional standards of 
conduct, continuing education and skills development of Canada 
lands surveyors. I acknowledge the support of members and parties 
of this House as we proceed through this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anyone who has ever purchased a house or a piece of property is 
familiar with the important work of land surveyors.  Their job is 
to provide a detailed and accurate survey of the boundaries of 
the property for legal registration and for transfer of 
ownership.  The Canada lands surveyor is specially qualified and 
commissioned to conduct legal surveys on Canada lands, lands 
which the federal government holds and manages in trust for the 
people of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada lands include the Yukon and Northwest Territories, Indian 
reserves, offshore areas of Canada and the national parks system. 
Anyone who requires a survey of a boundary of Canada lands must 
have the survey made by a qualified Canada lands surveyor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I pay tribute to the tremendous contribution made by government 
surveyors both past and present. Dominion land surveyors, as they 
were known until 1979, literally opened up this country. Their 
stories are a part of our history.  In 1874 Great Britain 
transferred Rupert's Land and the Northwestern Territory to the 
Dominion of Canada.  The federal government needed land surveyors 
at that time to survey and subdivide the land for settlers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We just have to fly over western Canada to be familiar with the 
results of the incredible work accomplished in the 1880s when 
dominion land surveyors conducted what was probably the largest 
survey effort in history.  Their work made it possible for 
immigrants and settlers to obtain lands in Manitoba, Saskatchewan 
and Alberta.  We see the results of their labour in the straight 
as an arrow property lines. When hopeful miners flooded the Yukon 
territories during the gold rush in 1898, they found a dominion 
lands survey office already in business in Dawson where they 
could legally register their claims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More recently, members of the House have seen the work of the 
Canada lands surveyors in some of the legislation we have 
considered in the House:  the boundaries of the new national 
parks such as Vuntut National Park in the Yukon in 1994; the 
descriptions of the boundaries of land transfers affecting Indian 
reserves which appear as orders in council; even the boundaries 
of federal electoral districts.  These are accomplished by the 
Canada lands surveyors through the office of the Surveyor General 
of Canada Lands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the federal government, Canada lands surveyors are 
currently making massive and critically important surveys in the 
Yukon and Northwest Territories.  Several thousand parcels of 
land, some small and some large, involved in aboriginal land 
interests and land claims must be legally surveyed and recorded. 
This survey effort will help to define and shape the legal 
boundaries of the Canadian north.  It involves millions and 
millions of dollars and directly affects the lives of residents 
of these territories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have explained the historical and the present day role of 
Canada lands surveyors in order to demonstrate to this House the 
scope and importance of their contribution to the country.  These 
professionals are experts in property rights, land management, 
land registration and the survey system used in Canada lands. 
Their expertise is acquired through university education, 
continuing education through their professional associations, and 
through hands on experience in the field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To be granted a commission as a Canada lands surveyor, a 
candidate must first successfully complete a rigorous set of 
formal examinations and meet other requirements including basic 
work experience of at least two years.  Surveying is a knowledge 
based activity and as such demands a great deal of the people who 
seek the right to use the designation of Canada lands surveyor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1872 the Surveyor General of the Dominion, now Canada 
Lands, has had the responsibility for the board of examiners. 
This body establishes professional qualifications and standards, 
sets the examinations and grants commissions as Canada lands 
surveyors. Under the present legislation the board also oversees 
the professional conduct of the Canada lands surveyors but has 
limited disciplinary powers.

<A HREF="#LINKT19"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-31 will transfer responsibility for the board of 
examiners from the surveyor general to the Association of Canada 
Lands Surveyors.  The provisions proposed in the legislation are 
both efficient and appropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For a number of years now at the provincial level, 
self-governing professional associations have been managing the 
responsibilities which we are now proposing at the federal level 
be transferred to the Association of Canada Lands Surveyors. 
Self-governing associations relieve government of the day to day 
work of ensuring that the members of the profession achieve and 
maintain professional standards of practice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government of which I am a representative does not hand over 
such important authorities lightly or arbitrarily.  The 
legislation which we are now considering today touches the day to 
day lives of hundreds of thousands of people and concerns 
approximately one-half of the Canada land mass.  Thus for some 
seven to eight years the federal government has undertaken 
detailed study, consultation and dialogue with the Association of 
Canada Lands Surveyors, with various other associations and with 
other federal government departments who rely on the services of 
Canada lands surveyors.  This includes Parks Canada and Indian 
and northern affairs for instance.  Our intent is to accomplish 
the transfer in an orderly and responsible fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Association of Canada Lands Surveyors has been actively 
involved in preparing for this important role since 1990. 
Formerly established in 1985 as an independent multidisciplinary 
association, the association is the successor to the Canada lands 
surveyors professional affairs committee of the Canadian 
institute of surveying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are four principal areas of responsibility involved in 
this proposed legislation:  examination, admission, 
qualifications and discipline.  I have already spoken to some 
extent about the examination and admission processes which are 
under the auspices of the board of examiners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the proposed legislation the board of examiners under the 
management of the Association of Canada Lands Surveyors will 
continue to set rigorous technical and scientific examinations 
and issue commissions to successful candidates. What will change 
in this area however is the day to day management of the 
examination and accreditation process of the board of examiners 
which will be assumed by the association rather than by the 
Office of the Surveyor General of Canada Lands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an important recognition of the stature of the 
profession and gives the Association of Canada Lands Surveyors 
authorities similar to those practised by provincial 
associations.  Moreover the move is consistent with the 
government's commitment to improve the way government works by 
turning over to the private sector responsibilities in areas of 
activity that can be efficiently and effectively managed by the 
private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spoke earlier of the fact that surveying is a knowledge based 
discipline.  As the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Natural Resources, which is of course a scientific and knowledge 
based department, I am very particularly interested in the 
enhanced role the association will be playing in the skills 
development, training and continued education of the Canada lands 
surveyors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The demanding examination process ensures that Canada lands 
surveyors are well qualified at the time of receiving their 
commission and provide professional standards of service, but it 
is no guarantee that those standards are maintained over time. 
Under the proposed Canada lands surveyors act the association 
will have both the authority and the means to ensure that its 
members maintain their professional standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the key commitments made by the association in 
preparation for this legislation is to provide continuing 
education programs for its members.  Given the critical 
importance of lifelong learning and skills development in the 
knowledge based society and the new economy, this commitment by 
the association is particularly significant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The association has also committed to promoting the profession 
of Canada lands surveyor in order to ensure that there continues 
to be a pool of qualified Canada lands surveyors available across 
Canada.  There must be a sufficient number of these people 
working in the Yukon and Northwest Territories and near Canada 
lands across the country to provide quick efficient services at a 
reasonable cost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The association has already demonstrated its leadership in this 
area since 1990 by preparing videos and holding seminars across 
Canada explaining the survey legislation and the Canada lands 
surveyors examination process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fourth key area addressed by Bill C-31 involves discipline 
and complaints procedures and provisions which will be 
implemented by the association.  These new provisions and 
procedures significantly improve the current system and better 
protect members of the profession and the public and clients who 
call upon the services of Canada lands surveyors.

<A HREF="#LINKT20"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ninety-nine per cent of the people actively working in the field 
carry out their duties with full professionalism and respect for 
quality, standards and service.  Common to self-regulating 
professions is the ability to investigate complaints concerning 
performance and standards. As a result of Bill C-31 the 
association will be able to investigate complaints and to impose 
a range of penalties appropriate to the situation should fault 
occur.  This will both protect the public interest and safeguard 
the reputation and integrity of Canada lands surveyors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once this legislation comes into effect all Canada lands 
surveyors who want to conduct legal surveys on Canada lands will 
have to be members of the association and will be required to 
carry liability insurance. This will ensure that the association 
is in a position to monitor, govern and self police the 
professional standards and conduct of Canada lands surveyors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed legislation is carefully designed to preserve and 
maintain the integrity of the Canada lands survey system.  The 
Surveyor General of Canada Lands will continue to be responsible 
for the standards of property or legal surveys of Canada lands. 
Likewise the surveyor general will continue to be responsible for 
the standards of survey documentation submitted to the Canada 
lands survey records. Boundary commissions, descriptions of 
federal electoral districts, and surveys required by native land 
claims also remain under the jurisdiction of the surveyor 
general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The benefits of the profession to the clients and to the 
Government of Canada are clear.  With the provisions of Bill C-31 
in place, the standards of conduct required of Canada lands 
surveyors will be enhanced to the level already in place 
provincially.  Members of the profession will be assured that 
their fellow Canada lands surveyors have all met and continue to 
meet the high professional standards and requirements of the 
commission they bear so proudly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian public will have the assurance and protection of a 
self-governing professional association to whom they can turn 
with complaints and concerns about the professional competence or 
conduct of Canada lands surveyors whenever that may be necessary. 
The promotion of the profession by the association will encourage 
new recruits to join the ranks of the Canada lands surveyors 
ensuring that qualified people are available across the country 
to carry out these important surveys.  The government will have 
at its service a pool of professionals whose skills are 
continuously updated and current as we continue to shape and 
define the boundaries of lands we hold and manage in trust for 
the people of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I would like to thank hon. members for providing 
me with this opportunity to speak to this important bill, Bill 
C-31.  I also appreciate the level of co-operation which I 
understand exists in the House today in terms of the furtherance 
of this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams:</B>  On a point of order, Mr. Speaker.  There 
have been consultations between the parties. I think you will 
find that there is unanimous consent that we deal with all stages 
of Bill C-31 today, including second reading, committee of the 
whole and third reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Is the parliamentary secretary 
suggesting that there be unanimous consent to change the motion 
from second reading and referral to a standing committee to 
referral to committee of the whole?  Is that what he is asking at 
this stage?  The House will not adjourn until the bill has been 
adopted at all stages, is that what the parliamentary secretary 
is suggesting?  I am seeking clarification of what is being asked 
for at this point.  Perhaps we could proceed with this 
understanding for the time being and if there are specific orders 
to be adopted at a given moment we can adopt them. On debate at 
second reading, the hon. member for Athabasca. 
<P><A NAME="LINK168"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to join in the debate on Bill C-31, the Canada lands 
surveyors act.  The bill as the parliamentary secretary has 
stated transfers the responsibilities of the existing board of 
examiners for Canada lands surveyors to the Association of Canada 
Lands Surveyors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Association of Canada Lands Surveyors is a non-government 
association with mandatory membership.  In other words, one 
cannot be a Canada lands surveyor without having membership in 
this association.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As with any bill introduced in the House for second reading, it 
stirs an interest, a curiosity as to why it is introduced and 
what efficiencies or benefits Canadians gain from either the 
change in legislation or the new legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Upon inquiry and investigation this is kind of a curious 
situation with the Canada lands surveyors in that it seems to 
make perfectly reasonable sense to do what this bill proposes to 
do.  However, one has to wonder why now. Every province in Canada 
has for years had a professional association of surveyors, and 
the surveyor general assures me that the reason for this is it 
will provide better service to Canadians than the Government of 
Canada has been able to provide in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That raises questions as it has raised in previous times. If it 
is good for the country why did it take so long for this 
government to admit it and to get on with the business of 
introducing and passing the bill? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to go through how the bill will serve Canadians 
better.  First, it would transfer responsibility for developing 
and maintaining professional standards among Canadian lands 
surveyors from a federal agency to a non-government agency.  This 
non-government agency, the Association of Canada Lands Surveyors, 
will be responsible for designing and implementing a complaints 
and discipline process that the government itself does not seem 
to be able to put in place, or to maintain to the same degree at 
least, as this non-government organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently there does not appear to be any formal process to deal 
with complaints of quality of workmanship or professionalism of 
Canada lands surveyors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under existing legislation the board of examiners must prove 
gross negligence or corrupt practices to discipline a land 
surveyor.  Certainly those are pretty draconian measures and not 
an easy task to achieve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through the proposed changes, however, there will be very clear 
processes by which the complaints may be filed against individual 
surveyors.  These changes call for the formation of a complaints 
committee and a discipline committee, the latter of which will 
have the power to discipline a surveyor in a number of ways if 
proved negligent or incompetent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wholeheartedly agree with the creation of two committees.  We 
need to protect the good name of responsible and reputable 
surveys as well as the integrity of the Canada lands survey 
system.  As my colleague the parliamentary secretary pointed out, 
the Canada lands surveyors have a long and glorious history of 
service in Canada and certainly in opening up this country for 
settlement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the implementation of a formal discipline process will 
help us to accomplish the goal of maintaining that integrity and 
that reputation.  The complaints and discipline committees set up 
as a result of this transfer will have the power to discipline 
surveyors guilty of incompetence or professional misconduct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be very time consuming and costly for the federal 
government to design and implement such a process.  Therefore I 
was delighted to learn that through this transfer the association 
will assume financial responsibility for this process as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The association will not receive funding through the government 
but rather through the collection of membership dues from its 
member Canada lands surveyors.  Second, through the transfer of 
responsibilities this bill will result in the creation and 
operation of a practice review program that will ensure that 
Canada lands surveyors maintain professional standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lands surveyors will be required to continue to upgrade skills 
in order to ensure high quality and accuracy of surveys.  The 
practice review program will be fully funded by the association, 
as will the continuing education program through which surveyors 
can continue to upgrade skills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently each of the 10 provinces has professional associations 
operating in much the same way as the Association of Canada Lands 
Surveyors. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1550"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT23"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT23"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1550

<A HREF="#LINKT22"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like other professional associations, ACLS will have mandatory 
membership and similar standards to its sister associations in 
the 10 provinces.  The proposed changes mean that surveyors 
surveying on public lands, including land in Yukon and Northwest 
Territories, on Indian reserves and in national parks as well as 
in offshore areas, will be adhering to the same standards as 
surveyors elsewhere in Canada.  Surveyors across Canada will be 
expected to show the same level of skills and professionalism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support the government's efforts to eliminate and streamline 
government agencies.  This transfer would not eliminate but 
streamline the responsibilities of the legal surveys division of 
Environment Canada.  It would relieve this agency of the burden 
of setting and enforcing professional standards among Canada land 
surveyors.  The surveyor general would continue to establish 
standards for and manage surveys made under the Canada Land 
Survey Act.  The surveyor general will also retain custody of 
records of all such surveys. These changes will simply shift 
responsibly for the licensing and continual review of the 
performance of surveyors without infringing on the surveyor 
general's control over the surveys produced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such government downsizing and streamlining is purported to 
serve the interests of the Canadian public.  However, in 
reviewing the proposed act I wondered if this act would truly 
benefit the average Canadian.  The government has itself admitted 
that the introduction of this act was largely driven by the 
interests of the Association of Canada Lands Surveyors.  The 
association has been asking for this role for 10 years.  However, 
as history has shown, it is often the case that many professional 
associations act in the best interests of the professionals they 
represents rather than in the interests of the clientele the 
professionals serve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore I was interested in how this transfer would protect 
the interests of the average Canadian.  It is, after all, the 
average Canadian I was elected to represent.  In answer to this I 
found that the proposed changes would standardize the quality of 
surveying services received by all Canadians.  This act will 
establish the Association of Canada Lands Surveyors as a 
non-government professional association that adheres to similar 
standards as its provincial counterparts.  This means that 
residents in Yukon and Northwest Territories, Indian reserves and 
town sites within national parks will receive the same quality of 
survey service as Canadians living elsewhere in Canada. 
Approximately 450,000 Canadians residing on Canada lands will 
directly benefit from these changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This in itself does not positively reassure me that Canadians 
are being well served by the changes being proposed by this act. 
However, I am reassured by the fact that the professional 
association will not be completely autonomous of the federal 
government.  The association will be a self-governing body within 
federal jurisdiction.  Through this act the minister retains the 
power to take such measures as the minister considers appropriate 
to fulfill any objective of the association the minister is of 
the opinion the association is not fulfilling.  Providing the 
acting minister has the best interests of Canadians at heart, 
this clause can be used as a means of government intervention 
should the association fail to meet its obligation under this 
act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not uncommon for Canadians to engage in disputes over 
property lines.  Many Canadians do not notice the errors in the 
surveys of their land until they go to build a fence, pave a 
driveway or plant a tree.  Although this is only one small aspect 
of land surveying, it is my hope that this transfer of 
responsibility will raise the quality of surveys to a level 
whereby such disputes can be avoided from the outset by high 
quality surveys.  It is also my hope that ACLS will honour its 
obligation to the Canadian public by serving the interests not 
only of the member surveyors but of the Canadian public as a 
whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe this act, if properly implemented, will result in an 
association of responsible, professional and reliable surveyors 
equipped with the most current skills and knowledge. Therefore I 
and my party support Bill C-31.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst, NDP):</B> Madam Speaker, as the NDP 
critic for natural resources, I rise today in support of Bill 
C-31, the Canada Lands Surveyors Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is the result of five years of consultation and 
development. This consultation involved several departments, 
including Indian and Northern Affairs Canada, Indian reserves 
and lands that have been surrendered, land claims, the Yukon, 
the Northwest Territories, offshore regions, Heritage Canada, 
Parks Canada, Natural Resources Canada and the divisions 
responsible for petroleum, gas and subsoil and offshore mineral 
rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation is required because of existing gaps in the 
complaints and discipline procedure. 
It is also required to ensure that complaints are handled fairly 
and properly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill concerns surveyors working on Dominion lands, that is, 
lands in the Northwest Territories and the Yukon, aboriginal 
lands, national parks and offshore areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill will transfer to the Association of Canada Lands 
Surveyors responsibilities with respect to the granting of 
commissions, regulations and disciplinary measures applicable to 
lands surveyors of Canada. Until now, these functions came under 
the surveyor general at Natural Resources Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This will give Canada lands surveyors more voice in their own 
affairs.  They will be able to elect some members of the council 
which will be responsible for running the association. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently it is the Minister of Natural Resources acting through 
the governor in council who appoints members of the board of 
examiners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I have concern regarding certain sections of this bill. 
Section 12(1) stipulates: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>12. (1)  The president and vice-president of the association 
shall be appointed or elected in accordance with the bylaws. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe it is important that these two positions be filled by 
the people elected by the membership.  The positions of president 
and vice-president are key positions that will determine the 
direction the association will take. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For these reasons it is only logical that the membership 
determines who will run the association. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to note that this idea of self-regulation is not 
new. Provincial surveyors are all regulated by provincial 
associations. The proposed change reflects what has already been 
implemented in 10 provincial jurisdictions. In my province of 
New Brunswick, the surveyors' association was established in 
1954. As we can see, it works for the public and for surveyors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reforms such as this one often imply a loss of jobs in a 
government department. This is one of those rare situations 
where self-regulation does not involve any layoffs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that no one is directly responsible for managing the 
complaint and discipline processes shows how necessary this 
legislation is. Surveyors must be accountable for their actions 
to those who make use of their services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This self-regulation process also has its limits. Even though 
some responsibilities are transferred, the Minister of Natural 
Resources reserves the right to intervene if he is of the 
opinion that the association is not fulfilling its mandate.

<A HREF="#LINKT24"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I talked to surveyors in my riding, and they assured me that 
their interests will be adequately served by the Association of 
Canada Lands Surveyors. They referred to the New Brunswick 
surveyors association as an example of a self-regulatory body 
that works well. It is important that we listen to these people. 
After all, they are the ones who will be most affected by the 
changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the Association of Canada Lands Surveyors will be able 
to fulfil a role which, until now, had been completely ignored 
by the Department of Natural Resources. Since the association is 
made up of surveyors, it will be able to design and maintain 
proper training for its members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know how important it is to see that every group provides 
training for its members and ensures the renewal of its 
workforce. This legislation allows the Association of Canada 
Lands Surveyors to take over continuing education, to ensure that 
its members get the best possible training. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only adverse effect of this bill seems to be the increase in 
fees for permits and liability insurance. This increase will 
have to be borne by the surveyors, which means they will be 
passed on to the consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Except for this minor reservation, we should see pass Bill 
C-31 immediately. Canada's surveyors have waited five years for 
this legislation. The time has come to act. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK172"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean Dubé (Madawaska—Restigouche, PC):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, let me begin my comments by giving some background on 
Canada Lands Surveyors.  Canada Lands Surveyors performs surveys 
required for the legal transfer and registration of rights to 
real estate properties in Yukon, Northwest Territories, Canada's 
offshore, Indian reserves and Canada's national parks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently provincially regulated lands surveyors perform these 
functions in each province except for Canada's offshore, Indian 
reserves and national parks.  The Canada Lands Surveyors at 
present operates under the authority of the Surveyor General of 
Canada which is part of Natural Resources Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill will change this relationship, transferring 
responsibilities for the regulation to the Association of Canada 
Lands Surveyors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill would authorize the Association of Canada Lands 
Surveyors to be a self-regulating association with 
responsibilities for all aspects of commissioning Canada lands 
surveyors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would authorize the association to establish the 
standards of qualification, knowledge, skill, conduct and 
practice of Canada lands surveyors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, this bill would authorize the Association of Canada 
Lands Surveyors to grant commissions to persons who have acquired 
the appropriate educational qualifications and work experience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill will also give the Association of Canada Lands 
Surveyors the power to hear complaints and institute a discipline 
process concerning the conduct of Canada lands surveyors.  Some 
of these discipline powers would include the removal of licences, 
as well as memberships and commissions of Canada lands surveyors 
who have been found guilty of professional misconduct or 
incompetence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also requires Canada lands surveyors to maintain a 
membership in the association and a licence to practise in order 
to be able to perform surveys on Canadian lands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, this bill gives the Association of Canada Lands 
Surveyors the power to make regulations concerning professional 
examinations and professional standards for Canada lands 
surveyors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill also provides for the appointment of a board of the 
association.  The board would be comprised of five members.  The 
current board of examiners under the old act would become 
redundant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Natural Resources would make appointments to 
this board.  Remuneration for board members would be set by 
guidelines fixed by Treasury Board.  Members that would be 
required to travel to meetings of the board would have their 
living and travel expenses covered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Surveyor General of Canada will continue to manage surveys 
under this legislation, as well as establishing standards for 
those surveys.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also remaining under the authority of the surveyor general is 
the management and maintenance of the survey system and survey 
frameworks for Canada lands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Surveyor General of Canada will also retain control of the 
boundaries of Canada lands.  The custody and record of the 
surveys will also continue under the auspices of the surveyor 
general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservative Party views this bill as a 
housekeeping matter.  The possible exception is that the Minister 
of Natural Resources would make appointments to the five member 
board of the association.  With that in mind, we support in 
principle the thrust of this bill. 
<P><A NAME="LINK173"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
want to ask the member a question of clarification.  I thought he 
said that the board would consist of five members.  It is my 
understanding that the board would consist of the president, the 
vice-president, the past president and three members, the 
Surveyor General of Canada and two persons appointed by the 
government.  That is considerably more than five members.  I was 
confused by his explanation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have some concerns, this being a non-government organization, 
a professional organization that will be responsible to its 
membership, with an ex-officio member being the Surveyor General 
of Canada, about what the requirement would be for the minister 
to have two patronage appointment positions on the board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean Dubé:</B>  Madam Speaker, when I spoke of the five 
members I meant the five non-executive members.  With the 
executive members I think the hon. member's number is accurate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the patronage appointments are more in the area of 
five, not three, because the five directors that are to be 
appointed by the minister are certainly going to be, as far as I 
am concerned, patronage appointments. 
<P><A NAME="LINK174"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I listened to the debate of the previous three speakers 
but, as I understand it, we are not allowed to put questions to 
previous speakers.  However, I have some questions which I 
would like to ask the hon. member who just spoke. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada Lands Surveyors, as I understand it, is responsible 
for public domain lands of the Government of Canada, which 
include Yukon, the Northwest Territories, Indian reserves, 
national parks, offshore sites, national wildlife areas and 
migratory birds sanctuaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of Bill C-31 is to establish the Association of 
Canada Lands Surveyors as a self-governing association which will 
substitute its board of examiners to establish, under the Canada 
Lands Surveyors Act, the authority responsible for the 
examination, admission and qualifications of candidates for 
commission as Canada lands surveyors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have no hesitation in supporting this bill, particularly 
because this bill is an effort to transfer responsibility to the 
private sector.  I believe the private sector can better regulate 
its members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, this transfer will result in a cost reduction to 
the departmental budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important for us to define what a Canada lands 
surveyor is responsible for.  Can the member throw some light on 
what is the definition of the role of the Canada lands surveyors? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean Dubé:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank the member for 
being attentive to my speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I was a minister of the crown I could probably answer better 
what the member is asking.  I sort of agree with the member's 
comments, but I think his question would be better directed to 
government. 
<P><A NAME="LINK175"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
the member called this a housekeeping matter.  I would say that 
it is more in the nature of a motherhood issue that everyone 
could agree with.  Housekeeping, to me, says that we are cleaning 
up something that previously existed, whereas in this case we are 
building something. 
We are establishing for the first time legislation to give the 
Canada lands surveyors self-governing authority.  I would like a 
response to that comment.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean Dubé:</B>  Madam Speaker, I would like to thank the 
member for the housekeeping comment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason for that comment was to identify the patronage 
appointments that the government will be making. 
<P><A NAME="LINK176"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
would like to thank the member for Humber—St. Barbe—Baie Verte 
for his kind comments about lands surveyors because I am a lands 
surveyor myself and I agree with his comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member of a provincial lands surveyors association it gives 
me great pleasure to speak today to Bill C-31, the Canada Lands 
Surveyors Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Historically dominion lands surveyors, the predecessors of the 
Canada lands surveyors, had a special role to play in the 
development of this country.  They were issued commissions for 
the purpose of undertaking surveys of dominion lands.  The most 
obvious and enduring aspect of the work is the dominion lands 
survey system in western Canada which had its origin at the first 
principal meridian just west of Winnipeg and its first base line 
at the Canadian-American border. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The majority of the occupied land in the west is subdivided into 
one-mile squares which is the most noticeable feature from the 
air.  When flying in to any of the western airports we see that 
the land is laid out in a rectangular fashion.  It is very 
orderly.  Even satellite photos of the prairies show the DLS 
system of subdivision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The importance of surveys in the historic and future development 
of Canada is indisputable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surveyors were and remain Canada's explorers.  It was surveyors 
who not only subdivided but mapped this country's frontiers. 
They also established the borders of this country on the ground 
after the political decision was made to accept the international 
boundary as the 49th parallel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An interesting aside is that American surveyors usually ended up 
north of the British surveyors, or the other way around, when 
they made their astronomy shots to determine the exact parallel. 
Usually the decision was made to split the difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, surveyors are called on daily to resolve boundary 
disputes, leading to peaceful relations among members of the 
public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The prairies were surveyed during a few decades of intense work 
as the west was opened up for development and settlers poured in. 
Legislators of the time recognized the need for an orderly method 
of subdividing and conveying land to the settlers and also for 
setting aside the tracts of land reserved for Indians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The system was developed by Colonel J. S. Dennis and the bulk of 
the work was carried out for many years under the direction of 
Dr. Edouard Deville, Surveyor General. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the western territory was divided into provinces the new 
provinces assumed control of their lands and the survey of them. 
The task was undertaken by provincial survey associations which 
operated under provincial legislation.  The legislation provided 
the means by which the associations governed themselves.  They 
had the authority to elect their own councils, appoint 
educational and disciplinary committees and pass bylaws to ensure 
that a high level of competence and professionalism was 
maintained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the provinces land surveys are the responsibility of 
provincially legislated land survey associations.  All provincial 
land surveyors' associations are self-governing and accountable 
to the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through the years since provincial associations have been 
responsible for the maintenance and extension of the survey 
fabric within the provinces the only change the Dominion Lands 
Surveyors have had was incorporation in 1985 and a name change. 
Dominion Lands Surveyors are now officially known as Canada Lands 
Surveyors.  They remain without an elected national executive. 
They do not have an association directed professional examination 
committee.  They have no registrar nor do they have a discipline 
committee to investigate complaints and take action against a 
member found to be in violation of standards of professional 
conduct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation before the House today establishes the 
Association of Canada Lands Surveyors as a self-governing 
association with all of the powers and responsibilities that 
entails.  For instance, the association will now be able to 
establish and enforce the standards to qualify for the granting 
of commissions.  This means they will determine appropriate 
educational levels and standards of professional conduct and 
skill required both to obtain and maintain a CLS commission. 
Bill C-31 will enable the Association of Canada Lands Surveyors 
to create the necessary committees to investigate malpractice 
complaints and to establish discipline committees which will be 
empowered to conduct hearings and determine what disciplinary 
measures are appropriate in individual cases. This will advance 
the public interest.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the new legislation the association will be able to create 
a practice review committee charged with the responsibility for 
ensuring that those who are commissioned for the survey of 
federal lands maintain a high standard of professionalism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the same vein the new act will make it possible for the 
association to maintain a continuing education program for its 
members so that the public can have confidence that the surveyors 
engaged are well prepared for the task. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In line with other jurisdictions, the surveyor general has 
retained the powers necessary to ensure the ongoing integrity of 
the survey system.  He will continue to retain control of the 
technical standards for surveys.  These include ensuring that 
surveys comply in all respects with the Canada Lands Surveys Act 
and regulations, that the surveys meet standards for accuracy of 
the field work, proper documentation of surveys, including 
preparation of plans, and monumentation of the survey on the 
ground. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the many positive features of this legislation there 
remains one concern. We note that there is a provision for the 
minister to appoint two members to the governing council.  While 
we in the Reform Party endorse input from the public to ensure 
professional organizations act in the public interest, we have 
two concerns with this clause.  First, it does not 
specifically state that the members are to be lay persons and not 
professional surveyors who may also be members of the civil 
service.  This would defeat the purpose of this requirement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I 
do not mean to interrupt the hon. member while he is giving a 
good speech but there does not seem to be a quorum in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Call in the members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><I>And the bells having rung</I>:

quorum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derrek Konrad:</B>  Madam Speaker, I was talking about the 
possibility for patronage in this bill and I will continue in 
that line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we recognize that it would be impossible to legislate it, 
what a great day it would be if the Liberal government did not 
abuse the appointment process to reward loyal Liberal Party 
members, fundraisers, defeated candidates, friends of friends and 
that sort of thing. 
However, based on their recent record of patronage appointments 
we are not confident that this will not happen.

amendments.

Resources and the government but they really do not deserve 
credit for this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a land surveyor, I am aware of the years of effort by the 
associations to have this legislation drafted and introduced in 
the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most Canada lands surveyors also hold provincial commissions so 
they know the benefits of a self-governing professional society. 
Without their invaluable input this legislation would not have 
got off the ground. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation is not ground breaking.  It simply raises the 
Association of Canada Lands Surveyors to the same status as a 
provincial association.  It has taken the government years to get 
from incorporation to legislation.  Congratulations are due to 
the surveyors for their commitment to the creation of this new 
professional association.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
while we support this bill and the principle of what it is trying 
to achieve, there were some concerns with the bill.  I was hoping 
that the parliamentary secretary might address some of those 
issues.  The members opposite might have noted that there were 
only a few as we were going through it clause by clause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I question the wisdom or the need for the minister to appoint 
two lay people.  My colleague, who is a land surveyor, raised 
that question as well.  When the minister has representation 
through the Surveyor General of Canada on the council, why is it 
necessary and why is it desirable to have two patronage appointed 
lay people on that council as well?  I would be interested in 
hearing the government response through the parliamentary 
secretary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other point I wanted to raise is that we had some concerns 
with the power of a surveyor or a licence holder to have access to 
private land at any reasonable time as long as that person takes 
reasonable precautions to avoid damage during the survey.  It 
seems to me that that is a powerful provision in the bill. 
Perhaps the private landowner would be entitled to some 
protection for the entry, or that the surveyor would have to go 
through some process to gain access to the land, to assure the 
landowner that their interests in that land are protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wanted to raise those concerns on the record before this bill 
passed third reading.  I would be interested in hearing some kind 
of government response to those concerns.  We have not had that 
opportunity.  Unfortunately, I am not sure if we have enough 
government members present to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Is the House ready 
for the question?

Sir Wilfrid Laurier played in our history.

Day, his birthday, I am not asking the House to proclaim the day 
a statutory holiday, but rather a day of recognition for 
Canadians to mark an important milestone in our history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A true Canadian, Laurier was a skilful and pragmatic politician 
with a charismatic personality.  He was a dominant political 
figure of his day. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a French speaking prime minister, he was one of the builders 
of the nation, from prairie towns to the Canadian navy, in 1909. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>]

urbanization.  It was strengthened by the addition of two 
provinces and two million inhabitants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In designating November 20, it will pay tribute to Laurier's 
vision, his determination that Canadians regardless of their 
ethnic or linguistic background could work together toward a 
common goal, that of nationhood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Laurier pursued and consolidated the work of Confederation begun 
by his predecessors.  He was a true nation builder.  In these 
days of political uncertainty we can look to Laurier as an 
individual who embodied his love for Canada, his love for a 
united and prosperous country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We live in an era where our children have little appreciation 
for our history and for our roots as a nation.  Professor J. L.

disappearing.

<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill will help us recognize and promote our history.  The 
federal government has proclaimed several national days of 
recognition.  February 15 is National Flag Day.  We celebrate 
June 25 as National Aboriginal Day.  We have built educational 
programs around these days.  We have helped to expand the 
understanding and the importance of these days to Canadians but 
we cannot stop there.  We must mark those occasions in our 
history that are important to our nation's survival and to 
preserve the memories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In these times when our national unity is called into question, 
it is only through the dedicated efforts of concerned Canadians 
that we find occasions or situations which celebrate the very 
fact of being Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether by disaster as demonstrated by the ice storm of 1998, or 
by design as in the more formal declaration of national holidays, 
I believe we must find ways to come together to celebrate our 
very Canadianism. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Armed with a better knowledge of our history, we can promote 
national unity. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can define what it means to be Canadian.  We can help 
Canadians better understand their past.  My private member's bill 
is a further step in that direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians will judge what we do as legislators in part by how we 
treat and respect our past.  It is worthy to note that this bill 
which I put before parliament does not infringe upon provincial 
legislative authority or the Canadian Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms.  Rather, it seeks to enhance that which is truly 
Canadian, our common interests and sense of deep rooted history.

an individual who viewed himself as a Canadian both in terms of 
nationality and in terms of thinking.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Warren Bennis says that leadership is the capacity to translate 
vision into reality.  This applies to Sir Wilfrid Laurier.  As 
prime minister, Laurier was determined to create a nation that 
embodied many elements.  Laurier said of Canada: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our country is Canada.  Our fellow countrymen are not only those 
in whose veins is the blood of France.  They are all those 
whatever their race, whatever their language whom the fortunes of 
war, the chances of fate or their own choice brought among us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is anything to which I have devoted my political life, 
it is to try to promote unity, harmony and amity between the 
diverse elements of this country. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Laurier said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a Canadian.  Canada has been the inspiration of my life. The 
19th century was the century of the United States.  I think we 
can claim that it is Canada that shall fill the 20th century. I 
cannot hope that I shall see much of the development which the 
future has in store for my country.

the tradition of the past.

</I></B></P><P align=left>These words of Laurier are as relevant today as when they were 
first spoken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I read in the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> of May 3 that research 
collected by a group of federal bureaucrats shows the Queen and 
the Mounties were once central institutions.  They have found 
however that these institutions, and in addition the Canadian 
Broadcasting Corporation, no longer provide Canadians with a 
common sense of identity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It means, they say, that the federal government must strive in 
the coming years to refine a unifying vision for the country or 
risk its disintegration.  In the words of the policy research

cohesion and to take the country, intact and thriving, into the 
next century.

<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of this bill is to take into consideration the 
comments I have just cited. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Proclaiming November 20 a day of official recognition of Sir 
Wilfrid Laurier will in my view help Canadians focus on our roots 
and help Canadians appreciate the contributions of a visionary 
and leader such as Laurier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will be judged by how we treat our history.  We will be 
judged by whether or not we are prepared to honour political 
leaders such as Laurier as nation builders, as representatives

it gives me great pleasure to rise and speak to Bill C-369 to 
make November 20 Sir Wilfrid Laurier Day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We note that Sir Wilfrid Laurier was born on November 20, 1841 
in Saint-Lin, Canada East in Quebec.  It was Laurier's parents 
who first instilled in him the benefits of learning about both 
the French and English cultures.  They sent him to an English 
school in New Glasgow before attending the French language 
classical college at L'Assomption. He studied law at McGill and 
delivered his first ever French valedictory speech at this 
English speaking institution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His political career began formally in 1871 when he became a 
member of the Quebec Legislative Assembly. 
Three years later he was elected to the House of Commons.  He 
became the minister of inland revenue in 1877 under Alexander 
Mackenzie.  The Liberals became the opposition in 1878 when Sir 
John A. Macdonald returned to power.

</I></B></P><P align=left>He led the French Canadian protest against Macdonald's decision 
to allow the execution of Metis leader Louis Riel in 1885, and 
while not condoning Riel's action he gained national recognition 
in condemning the Macdonald government's mishandling of the 
northwest rebellion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I might say in parenthesis that I as a member of the Reform 
Party, having done some research on the issue of Riel, would find 
myself agreeing wholeheartedly with the position of Sir Wilfrid 
Laurier on that issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These actions established Laurier as a man of principle, a 
reputation which would stick with him throughout his political 
career.  He became leader of the Liberal Party in 1887 following 
Edward Blake's resignation.  He led the Liberals to victory in 
1896 and remained Prime Minister until 1911. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Laurier's achievements as prime minister are often cited as 
including the settlement of the west and the building of an 
effective transportation system.  During his 15 years as prime 
minister more than one million people moved into Manitoba and the 
western territories which became the provinces of Saskatchewan 
and Alberta in 1905. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Laurier said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a Liberal—I am one of those who think that everywhere 
there are abuses to be reformed, new horizons to be opened up, 
and new forces to be developed. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The idea of reform is fundamental to Laurier's liberalism.  He 
had a recognition that reform and compromise were necessary for 
national unity.  We as a party and the present day leader of 
Reform Party have acknowledged and recognized that Sir Wilfrid 
Laurier was one of the first reformers in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Laurier wanted to make changes and make changes in a very 
positive way.  He was not satisfied with the status quo.  We 
believe these fundamental principles still hold true today as we 
continue to search for new ways to reform the federation and lead 
Canadians into the 21st century in national harmony. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would agree with the hon. member for Oak Ridges that our 
national holidays help to educate Canadians of our history 
through which we find a shared pride in all things Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that we have a responsibility in this Chamber, and 
perhaps people of my generation have a responsibility to those 
Canadians going through the school system right now, to bring a 
focus on our Canadian ancestors.  Again I agree with the member 
for Oak Ridges that we need to have a greater knowledge of our 
history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also agree that in supporting the motion there is no need for 
there to be a national holiday because of the unnecessary cost 
that would be incurred by it.  However, with the stature of Sir 
Wilfrid Laurier, the contribution he brought to Canada and the 
fundamental ways in which he reformed many of the aspects of 
Canada, surely he should be noted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As heritage critic for the official opposition I am pleased to 
offer my support for Bill C-369.  I hope in the event the bill is 
passed that the Minister of Canadian Heritage finds a way to 
include Sir Wilfrid Laurier Day, November 20, on her next 
calendar.  I note she happened to miss Easter and Good Friday, so 
I am sure as she is making corrections on that calendar she would 
want to make this correction as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anything we can do in the Chamber or as Canadians to bring 
forward the contributions and the strength of our Canadian 
ancestors will do nothing but build a stronger nation.  As we set 
these people up, examine their lives and learn from them we can 
move forward strongly into the 21st century.

Ridges.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski—Mitis, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, on 
March 11, the member for Oak Ridges introduced two private 
member's bills.  Bill C-369 aims to have November 20 designated a 
national holiday in honour of Sir Wilfrid Laurier.  The aim of 
Bill C-370 is to have January 11 designated a national holiday in 
honour of Sir John A. Macdonald, the first Prime Minister of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before us today concerns Sir Wilfrid Laurier, the first 
French Canadian to be elected Prime Minister.  Laurier pursued a 
number of ideals, but the one he considered the most fundamental 
was that of a united and bicultural Canada. 
I invite you today to give thought to his action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Laurier was born into a family whose roots went back to the 
beginning of New France.  He was born four years after the 
arrival of the troops in 1837 and at about the same time that 
the government of the union, or Province of Canada, which, 
according to the recommendations of Lord Durham in his report, 
was imposed by the British on Canadians of the day, who are now 
Quebeckers.  The objectives of the 1841 government included 
punishing Canadians for the popular insurrection led by 
Louis-Joseph Papineau and assimilating them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Laurier's father felt that both cultures were vital to Canada's 
survival.  He sent Wilfrid to study in New Glasgow, where he 
lived with a Protestant family. 
After completing his classical studies at the Collège 
L'Assomption outside Montreal, he obtained his law degree from 
McGill in 1864. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The plan to build a Canadian federation dominated the politics 
of the day.  Laurier campaigned actively against this  plan with 
the Rouges and took part in the work of the national committee 
set up to examine the various plans for federation.  The 
committee's recommendations were overwhelming; in particular, it 
concluded that the plan should be put to the people.  During 
this period, Laurier even wrote that confederation would spell 
the death of the French race and the ruin of Lower Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite vigorous opposition, Confederation became a reality and 
Laurier was elected with the Rouges to Quebec's Legislative 
Assembly.  He was opposed to dual representation, as he felt 
that it signified the takeover by Ottawa of provincial 
jurisdiction. 
Laurier defended provincial autonomy, and the preservation of 
this autonomy would become for him the key to protecting the 
French fact in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was elected to the federal government in 1874 with Alexander 
Mackenzie's team.  In 1878, he found himself in opposition, 
where he would remain for 18 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1885, Laurier took the side of the Metis in Saskatchewan and 
of Riel.  It was in recalling the rebellion of the Patriotes 
that he said that there were times when the only course open to 
an oppressed people was insurrection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the House of Commons, he said that the real criminals were 
sitting across from him on the government benches.  It was 
Laurier's view that minorities would have faith in their 
government if they were treated honestly, and their needs were 
met.  He also held that patience and compromise were essential 
if violence in this country was to be avoided. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1888, buoyed by the support he had garnered in Quebec for the 
Liberals in the preceding election, in which, for the first 
time, the Liberals won a majority of seats in Quebec, Laurier 
became the leader of the Liberal Party of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1890, D'Alton McCarthy introduced a bill in the House of 
Commons calling for the abolition of French in the Northwest 
Territories.  Laurier saw clearly that this was part of a 
movement that would eventually reach Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his speech to the House of Commons, he said that this bill 
was a declaration of war against the French race and that the 
plan was clear, because the bill was designed to prevent French 
Canadians from speaking their language everywhere that it was 
used.  For him, the only way to protect Quebec was to defend 
provincial autonomy, even though the price to be paid was 
sometimes high in other regions of the country where 
francophones were in the minority. 
He approved an amendment making it possible to abolish the use 
of French in the Northwest Territories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1891, the Government of Manitoba introduced two bills: one 
abolishing the French language as an official language, and the 
other taking out of the hands of francophones the funding of 
their separate, Catholic schools. In 1895, the Privy Council in 
London, England, ruled that the federal government had the right 
to intervene to restore the constitutional right of 
francophones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Conservatives tabled a bill restoring the 
rights of the minority in Manitoba, but Laurier feared that, in 
reaction against the federal government's action, the other 
provinces would follow Manitoba's lead. 
He promised that, once back in office, he would find a solution 
that would satisfy the minority and serve justice in terms of 
equal rights, on which our Constitution is based.

was on their side, the Liberals led by Laurier filibustered to 
delay passage of the bill. A general election was called.

French-speaking Catholic over an English-speaking Protestant in 
spite of the fact that Laurier had opposed the bill to restore 
French schools in Manitoba.

Laurier-Greenway agreement was signed. This agreement provided 
that English and another language would be the languages of 
instruction in bilingual schools, wherever ten or more students 
spoke a language other than English. 
This therefore put all other languages on the same level as 
French.  According to historian Réal Bélanger, Laurier was 
laying the very idea of a bicultural Canada open to question 
with this  action.

Territories and Manitoba.  According to him, it would be up to 
the provinces to decide whether or not to make separate schools 
available.

the adoption of Ontario regulation 17, which to all intents and 
purposes abolished French language teaching in that province. 
The people of Quebec followed the struggle of the 
franco-Ontarians with emotion.  French Canadian solidarity with 
the francophones of Ontario even became the primary obstacle to 
recruiting French Canadians for the first world war. 
Laurier felt that he had given in enough to the anglophones.  He 
saw that aggression toward the minority was coming close to the 
borders of Quebec.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This debate was to be followed with the one on conscription. 
Laurier was against it, because he felt that, if it was Canada's 
duty to sustain the British Empire, that contribution needed to 
remain a voluntary one.

milestones: the massive immigration influx to the west, 
expanding trade, the country's economic growth, Canada's status 
in the British Empire.  He is credited with moving Canada from 
colony to nationhood.

made that sealed the fate of French-Canadian catholic minorities 
outside Quebec—Here, the illustrious leader lost some of his 
glory—The Anglo-Saxon character and mentality that prevails in 
9 out of the 10 provinces is partly the result of concessions 
made by this great man who, strangely, always claimed to be 
receptive to the aspirations of the minority dispersed across 
the country—The Arthabaska lawyer even inspired his 
successors, all the way to Pierre-Elliott Trudeau. To preserve 
Canadian unity according to the Anglo-Canadian way, these people 
resorted to the “small steps” strategy—In the end, that 
strategy often had a negative impact on the cause that these men 
thought they were defending.

pleasure to speak today to Bill C-369, which would establish Sir 
Wilfrid Laurier Day, November 20, as a national holiday to be 
observed throughout Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sir Wilfrid Laurier was born in Saint-Lin, Quebec, in 1841.  He 
was the son of a farmer.  He studied at McGill.  In the 1896 
election Laurier became our first francophone prime minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>National unity was of supreme importance to Laurier.  He saw how 
divisive the Riel and the Manitoba school issues were and he 
sought to reconcile the interests of French and English Canadians 
with his policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1885 Laurier supported Louis Riel as a French national 
martyr.  He vigorously supported the cause of the Metis leader 
and the need to unite the French and English in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting and important to me that in 1917 he opposed 
the process of conscription.  Instead he proposed a referendum 
and a continuous voluntary enlistment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sir Wilfrid Laurier believed in human rights.  He believed in 
protecting people's democratic rights.  As the hon. member 
opposite said, he was a nation builder.  He was an interesting 
and valuable voice in our country, of that there is no doubt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, do we need a day to commemorate him?  I think not.  I 
appreciate that the hon. member opposite finds Laurier an 
instructive and inspiring leader and I respect that fact, but I 
do not feel the need at this point in time to name a day after 
him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the member that Canadians should recognize their 
roots.  It is very important for us to draw strength from our 
roots.  We need to find inspiration and guidance from the people 
who came before us, but each one of us looks to different people 
for inspiration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have found inspiration in an early suffragette named Francis 
Beynon.  She was an early journalist in Winnipeg in the 1910s. 
She worked for the <I>Women Grain Growers</I>.  She worked for 
many years spreading information and communicating with isolated 
women on the prairies who lived on mile-wide farms and had no 
contact with anyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She taught them a lot about their rights.  She was very involved 
in the struggle to get the first vote for women.  When the first 
world war came along she fought very hard to get the vote for 
immigrant women.  That was not an easy battle because, 
unfortunately, there were a lot of women even in this country who 
were unwilling to allow foreign women to vote during the war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She took this important democratic stand.  I respect her for 
that.  It was not a popular stand.  She also fought against 
conscription.  I believe that she passed out of history because 
she did not take a popular stand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I respect and find inspiration in people like Francis Beynon.  I 
do not know whether I should suggest that we also have a Francis 
Beynon day, but I want to make the point that the inspiration in 
my life would not come from Sir Wilfrid Laurier, it would come 
from one of the early suffragettes who worked long and hard for 
some of the rights which I now enjoy in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other people might find inspiration in other places.  Another 
inspirational person might be Agnes MacPhail.  She was a 
political reformer, born in Ontario in the 1880s.  MacPhail was 
the only woman elected to the Canadian Parliament in 1921.  That 
was the first federal election in which women had the vote.  She 
served until she was defeated in 1940.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1943 she was one of the first two women to be elected to the 
Ontario legislature.  She lost her seat, but was again elected in 
1948.  She was also the first woman appointed to the Canadian 
delegation of the League of Nations where she insisted on serving 
on the disarmament committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, this was a very important woman in Canadian history.  She 
was a peacemaker and an inspiration to many women.  Perhaps some 
people would like to see an Agnes MacPhail day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Very recently I had the privilege of being part of an unveiling 
of a plaque for Portia White in Preston, Nova Scotia.  She was a 
very famous and inspirational black Canadian woman from my 
community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Portia White was the first African Canadian woman to win 
international acclaim as an opera singer.  She was a famous 
musician in our country.  She was born in a musical family and 
taught choir in a church.  She was a teacher and a community 
person who is remembered by thousands of people now scattered all 
over the country.  She has become well known as an inspiration 
for thousands of young black Nova Scotians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I too believe we should be celebrating our roots and our 
ancestors.  We should be helping young Canadians to find 
inspiration wherever they can.  I think it may be more 
appropriate, instead of having a day that represents one 
inspiration, such as Sir Wilfrid Laurier, to have an ancestor 
day.  We accept the fact that we all have ancestors who we gain 
strength from and we should try to recognize them in a public 
way.  I believe that would go a long way in encouraging us to 
gain strength from our roots and in helping us to understand our 
roots better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not agree that a Sir Wilfrid Laurier day is a wise option 
at this point in time.  I would instead suggest that we make it 
an ancestor day.

pleased to rise today to speak to Bill C-369, an act to amend the 
Holidays Act (Sir Wilfrid Laurier Day), and to make consequential 
amendments to other acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must admit that when I first saw this bill I thought it was 
just another example of Liberal partisanship, but then I noticed 
that the member had also introduced Bill C-370, an act to amend 
the Holidays Act to designate January 11 as Sir John A. Macdonald 
Day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday the president of the Canadian Museum of Civilization 
Corporation Board, Adrienne Clarkson, appearing before the 
Canadian heritage committee, illustrated the need to do more to 
encourage our youth to learn more about their country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A recent survey revealed very disturbing findings on our 
knowledge of history.  An alarming percentage of young Canadians 
between the ages of 18 and 34 who were surveyed could not say in 
what century Confederation took place or who we fought against in 
the first world war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Twenty-four per cent of university graduates did not know that 
our Constitution had been repatriated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to do more to help educate our students and in fact all 
Canadians about our rich history and heritage.  This bill is a 
step in that direction.  I would like to thank the member 
opposite for his continued interest in promoting the history of 
this great country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The PC Party wishes to see the great historical figures of our 
country commemorated and their exploits celebrated.  Let me be 
clear in saying that our party would not have a problem with 
amending the Holidays Act to include Sir Wilfrid Laurier Day to 
be commemorated on November 20.  We would support a day of 
commemoration, just as my colleague from 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough proposed a day of commemoration 
for our fallen police and peace officers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we do not support a paid holiday.  A holiday with pay 
does not guarantee greater awareness of key points in Canada's 
history and costs an excessive amount to the country's employers.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I am proud to note that Sir Wilfrid Laurier was the 
first French Canadian to become Prime Minister of Canada.  The 
Progressive Conservative Party of Canada has no objection to 
November 20 being designated Sir Wilfrid Laurier day and the 
Minister of Canadian Heritage being given the task of 
recognizing the contribution by Sir Wilfrid Laurier and other 
great Canadians to the development of this country.  However, it 
does oppose this day's becoming a mandatory paid holiday.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Aileen Carroll (Barrie—Simcoe—Bradford, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, many Liberals think of Sir Wilfrid Laurier as the real 
founder of the Liberal Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Canada's first prime minister, Sir John A. Macdonald, was 
in power the chief opposition to Macdonald came from two 
recalcitrant reform groups:  les Rouges of Lower Canada, a group 
of French speaking radicals whose chief target was the Roman 
Catholic church; and the Clear Grits, originally an assemblage of 
discontented Presbyterian and Methodist farmers from the area 
southwest of Toronto. While the Grits disappeared as an entity in 
the 1870s the term clung to Liberals and was still widely used a 
century later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Laurier was an attractive man, an elegantly handsome lawyer from 
a Quebec country town, eloquent, ambitious and sensitive.  Early 
in his political life as one of the young leaders of les Rouges 
he had realized that if his confrères were ever to gain office 
they would have to form an alliance with the English and at the 
same time soften their anticlerical stance by identifying 
themselves with a political program acceptable to the Roman 
Catholic church. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Laurier proselytized that these goals could be reached through 
stressing the liberalism of his party, demanding the separation 
of republican and anticlerical dogmas.  What he was saying to 
both races was that les Rouges could take a moderate approach 
compatible with the philosophy of William Lyon Mackenzie, the 
first Liberal prime minister, and Edward Blake, the only federal 
Liberal Party leader in Canada never to become prime minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He emphasized compromise and admiration for the liberal reform 
ideals that were then articulated by William Gladstone in England 
and that were to have a hold on the imaginations of Canadian 
Liberals for decades to come. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Laurier served four terms as Prime Minister, from 1896 to 1911. 
He taught us Liberals many of our greatest principles, including 
the most important: the need to find and maintain common ground 
between anglophones and francophones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals realize that Laurier won the 1896 elections because 
the Conservatives had lost sight of this fundamental principle 
of the Canadian federation. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For Liberals the lessons of Laurier's leadership went far beyond 
the French-English entente.  He buried dogmatism, abandoning the 
ideological rigidities that had plagued les Rouges and the Clear 
Grits.  He built his electoral strength on the organizational 
backs of Liberal provincial premiers, Oliver Mowat of Ontario, 
William Stevens Fielding of Nova Scotia and Andrew George Blair 
of New Brunswick. He brought them into his cabinet as power 
brokers for their regions.

party's commitment to free trade in order to appease the 
country's new industrialists.

minister of the interior, Sir Clifford Sifton, whose purpose was 
the settlement of the west.  He talked optimistically about the 
glorious future of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Laurier's successes were turned into principles that Liberals 
have followed for decades.  Despite some setbacks, Laurier on the 
whole skilfully walked the French-English tightrope throughout 
his years in office, balancing French Canada's racial fears and

</I></B></P><P align=left>Nearly a century ago, Sir Wilfrid Laurier predicted that “it is 
Canada that shall fill the 
20th century”.  When we look back at it, 
who could call him wrong?  The challenge before us now is to 
find a balance or a compromise among ourselves and among our 
many interests to make the 21st century Canada's as well. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sir Wilfrid Laurier believed immensely in his country.  He held 
strong views of what Canada could be or should be.  More 
important, he possessed vision for Canada and for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all of these reasons, it seems very appropriate to celebrate 
the beginning of the 21st century by amending the Holidays Act to 
honour this remarkable Canadian by designating Sir Wilfrid 
Laurier Day. 
<P><A NAME="LINK191"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Karen Redman (Kitchener Centre, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I rise today to speak in 
support of private members' Bill C-369, an act to amend the 
Holidays Act, introduced by my colleague the hon. member for Oak 
Ridges. The hon. member's bill would set aside November 20 in 
recognition of the contributions made to Canada by Sir Wilfrid 
Laurier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would we commemorate Laurier?  Many of us remember him from 
our early learning of history.  He has been described as the 
golden tongued Laurier, the seventh prime minister, the first 
French speaking Canadian to hold our highest political office, a 
man of breadth and a man of vision, a hero even among those who 
disagreed with him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Laurier travelled a vast and varied political road.  However, 
whatever we have come to associate with his name, he was first 
and foremost a true Canadian.  He stood for those key issues 
which remain close to the heart of all Canadians:  tolerance, 
national unity, and the continuing development and growth of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In preparation for today's debate I requested a copy of 
Laurier's maiden speech in this House from the library.  Some may 
be surprised to learn that it was delivered before the time of 
<I>Hansard</I>.  All that is available to commemorate his remarks 
are the comments people made about them and the excerpts in the 
paper.  Times certainly have changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although many issues of the day have changed beyond what Laurier 
could have imagined, others closely mirror the challenges that he 
faced during his tenure here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the challenges which he met, members of this House have 
also met.  He dealt with the question of denominational schools. 
This parliament has addressed that very issue.  Under his 
government two new provinces, Saskatchewan and Alberta, were 
added to Confederation.  We are currently working on the creation 
of Nunavut. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Laurier once said “I look forward to the day when Canada will 
have a population of 30 million inhabitants, of 40 million 
perhaps, and when its voice will weigh in the destinies of the 
world”.  Over 100 years later we are there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is admired around the world for its quality of life and 
its international role in peacekeeping and peaceful actions, most 
recently through the realization of our goal for an international 
ban on anti-personnel land mines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we as a country continue to develop our strength within 
our national borders and across international boundaries, as we 
move into the next century and the next millennium, it is fitting 
that we pay tribute to the last prime minister to lead Canada 
into a new century, and to face and meet the challenges that lay 
before our country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
am pleased to rise in support of the hon. member for Oak Ridges 
and his bill.  It is an excellent bill and one which is worthy of 
support by the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is one of the world's oldest democracies.  It was 
conceived in 1841 by LaFontaine and Baldwin in the context of 
some competing visions.  Canada is a great idea and sustains 
itself as a great idea by virtue of its visionaries.  It was 
conceived at the time when the competing visions were very strong 
indeed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a competing vision of being closer to the British 
Empire which my ancestors frankly supported.  People from British 
ancestry, British stock said that we needed a relationship that 
was closer to the British Empire. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand there was the emergent empire of the United 
States. It was quite a force in terms of its ability to attract 
people to populate the country and clearly was a force to be 
reckoned with and one of great attraction to many Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there was a third vision which was centred in Quebec.  It 
wanted its relationship to be much closer to the mother country 
on a colonial tie basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this maelstrom of visions emerged the vision of LaFontaine 
and Baldwin which led to the creation of Canada. Canada, being 
Upper Canada and Lower Canada, attracted in turn other provinces 
primarily from the Atlantic region and emerged from that in 1867 
as a nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has kept Canada together over these great number of years 
has been the visions of its leaders, particularly with Macdonald 
who brought the country together by virtue of a railway.  The 
railway made absolutely no sense from an economic standpoint.  It 
should have gone down through the United States and come back up 
into Canada.  The point of the railway was not to make an 
economic livelihood for people but was to unite the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly Laurier had visions such as that, visions which made 
for a country, nation building visions.  One of the strongest 
ones was with respect to immigration to the west, the population 
of the west.  It was an idea which allowed Canada to bring to its 
territory huge numbers of immigrants to populate the west, 
largely in response to the encroachments of people from the 
United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Around 1917 and 1918 over 400,000 people came to this country of 
six million at the time, something in the order of 7% or 8% of 
the population.  It is an incredible thought when we think of it 
in the context of our own immigration policy which strives to do 
1% of the population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly, Laurier resisted the encroachments of the British 
Empire, the attraction of being part of the trading agreement. He 
stuck out his political neck, shall we say, and tried to make 
distance between Canada and the British Empire. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support the hon. member's bill.  One of Laurier's speeches 
says “Although Caesar once said that he would rather be first in 
a village than second in Rome, I say that it is my ambition to be 
a citizen of a great country.  I look forward to the day when 
Canada will have a population of 30 million to 40 million 
perhaps, and when its voice will weigh in the destinies of the 
world”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That day has arrived. Therefore I support the recognition of 
that day.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jacques Saada (Brossard—La Prairie, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
am very pleased to take part in the debate on Sir Wilfrid 
Laurier's contribution to our history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had hoped to do so in a non political fashion, as a Canadian 
recognizing the contribution of an eminent Canadian to our 
history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, before beginning, I must make a quick correction. In 
her speech, a few minutes ago, the hon. member for Rimouski—Mitis 
said that the Canadians of the time were today's Quebeckers, 
when she referred to a well researched document which I respect, 
even though I do not share the views of its author. This is not 
quite accurate because, at the time, the term Canadians referred 
to all francophones in America, in Canada, and did not just 
include those we now call Quebeckers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some 12 or 15 months ago, I attended a meeting with history 
teachers and I asked them point blank who, in their opinion, had 
been the best Prime Minister in the history of Canada. The 
answer to such a question requires one to think for a moment. 
However, two of the teachers spontaneously said it was probably 
Wilfrid Laurier. I asked them why. The first answer that came 
from one of the teachers was Laurier's sense of compromise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes without saying that no political career can be perfect. 
Politicians face unavoidable obstacles. Their decisions may be 
arguable, but it is the spirit of compromise shown by Laurier, 
and by others, but particularly by Sir Wilfrid Laurier, that led 
to the building of a country which, while it may not be perfect, 
is nevertheless the envy of many. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada was built on compromise, on honourable compromise that 
was respectful of the other party. 
This is not just a philosophy or a concept: it is also reflected 
by concrete measures, such a equalization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many writers, musicians, artists and authors who did 
not get the recognition they deserved in their day. The same is 
true for— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> I am sorry to interrupt the 
hon. member, but I must leave the remaining two and a half 
minutes to the member for Oak Ridges.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Oak Ridges, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
thank the members who spoke to my bill today.  It does not ask 
for a statutory holiday but a day of recognition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues spoke of other very notable people who could be 
recognized.  The major difference is that Laurier was a prime 
minister and certainly the father of Canadian independence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is said that those who do not learn from history are doomed 
to repeat it.  If one does not understand the past one has no 
concept of the present and is unable to contemplate the future. 
By recognizing and promoting Laurier Day, November 20, is to give 
Canadians a sense of who they are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague has just said, the spirit of the country was 
built on compromise.  The spirit of the country was built by 
Canadians working together, the settling of the west, because of 
Laurier and because of men of vision.

inspiration.  By proclaiming November 20 we are able to point to 
this day and tell our young people how important Laurier was as a 
nation builder.  Then, as we go into the next century, we will 
have a good understanding of what it means to be Canadian, the 
glue that brings us together as a people.  That is extremely 
important.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>SENIORS BENEFITS 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK197"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean Dubé (Madawaska—Restigouche, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, on March 
17, I asked the Minister of Finance why he continued to 
discourage people from saving for retirement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I explained to the House that a number of financial experts were 
discouraging middle class Canadians over 50 from investing in 
RRSPs.  With the new seniors benefit, the money they save today 
will not make up for the tax they will have to pay later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is only one of the weaknesses in the seniors benefit the 
Minister of Finance announced over two years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many have been critical of it.  Here are some of their concerns. 
With current marginal tax rates, the recovery of 20% of income 
over $26,000 means that middle income seniors would have a 
marginal income tax rate of 60% to 70%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Middle income Canadians will no longer have anything to gain by 
saving for their old age.  Seniors choosing to remain in the 
labour market will discover they are keeping only 30% of their 
salary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the income of a couple entitles them to the benefit, the 
husband and the wife will each receive a cheque, but the wife's 
entitlement to a pension will depend on the husband's income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A study commissioned by the Canadian Real Estate Association 
also revealed that seniors who live alone and who have an income 
exceeding $31,000 will see their financial situation 
deteriorate, as well as couples with a total income of $26,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When there is an increase from the present situation, that 
increase will not exceed $120 a year in most cases. However, 
middle income seniors could lose from $3,000 to $7,000 a year 
compared to what they are getting under the present system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even middle income seniors who choose to stay with the old 
system will pay more taxes since the age credit and the pension 
benefit credit will be abolished when the new seniors benefit is 
implemented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, with the implementation of the seniors benefit, the 
Liberals propose to abolish the old age pension, the pension 
benefit credit, the age credit and the guaranteed income 
supplement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are still refusing to provide a thorough analysis of the 
impact of these measures on tomorrow's retirees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of encouraging individual responsibility, the proposed 
benefit will discourage everybody from saving for their 
retirement, except for the wealthiest people. It will also 
prompt a lot of seniors to get out of the labour force since 
they would keep only 30% of their salary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservative Party intends to force the 
government to fully disclose to Canadians the financial impact 
of the proposed seniors benefit. Canadians of all ages must 
understand the consequences of this new benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must prevent the government from destroying the foundations 
of our national retirement income system.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Byrne (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Natural Resources, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise in response 
to my colleague's intervention regarding the seniors benefit and 
the Canadian pension system at large. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has actually stabilized the nation's pension 
system in terms of the Canada pension plan.  As well we are 
moving forward in terms of the seniors benefit and providing 
security and access to income for seniors.  This is very 
responsible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the hon. member continued to discuss issues of partisan 
politics, I point out that the government actually stabilized the 
system after years of neglect under a previous administration by 
another prime minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is committed to developing the best policy for 
the public pension system and the whole retirement income system 
in Canada.  That is why we took time last fall to consult 
extensively with seniors groups, social groups and pension 
industry experts on the proposed seniors benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Meetings were held from coast to coast.  We listened carefully 
to the issues that were raised and to the concerns that were 
expressed.  We took time to consult with Canadians because it is 
important that the government be fully aware of the concerns and 
views of seniors.  The pension industry and other interested 
parties also have points of view that we took into consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have done that and now we are reviewing the proposal based on 
what we heard from Canadians.  That is the reason an announcement 
has been delayed on the seniors benefit issue.  We are making 
every effort to ensure that the concerns of Canadians are 
reflected in our proposed policy for the retirement income 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members on these benches are listening intently to different 
ideas and to different positions on the pension system and the 
seniors benefit.  I mention, for example, the member for 
Hillsborough who has done an admirable job working directly with 
the Minister of Finance on the issue as recently as today.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>HEPATITIS C 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK200"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (Charlotte, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
wanted to put a few more words on record with regard to the 
hepatitis C package. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know the federal, provincial and territorial health ministers 
are to meet next week to re-examine the package.  We know the 
package is flawed.  The government is very arbitrarily leaving 
innocent victims in an strict and totally artificial timeframe 
from 1986 to 1990 outside the package.  I believe we have to 
compensate all victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point I want to make this evening is simply in response to 
what the Prime Minister and the Minister of Health said today.  I 
am a bit concerned because I do not think they have learned 
anything from the debate that has taken place and the displeasure 
expressed by Canadians from coast to coast to coast for the 
package as it presently exists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are basically saying that they will not change anything. If 
one listens to today's language of the Prime Minister and the 
Minister of Health, that is exactly what they are saying. Why are 
they to meet with the health ministers if they are to stick to 
the original package?  What is to be accomplished by that type of 
stance? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister today tried to twist the words of the premier 
of the province of Ontario and his recognition of the problem. 
What I have in my hand is the letter that was sent to the Prime 
Minister yesterday by the Premier of Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to quote from the second paragraph of the letter.  The 
Premier of Ontario, Premier Harris, states “Ontario is committed 
to sharing assistance for pre-1986 victims on the same basis as 
the existing package for those infected between 1986 and 1990”. 
How much plainer can you be than that?  The Prime Minister today 
stood in the House and tried to twist the words of the premier, 
but those words are on paper.

<A HREF="#LINKT45"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am saying is that I think he has taken the most 
reasonable approach that we could possibly take.  He is 
committing dollars to innocent victims left outside the package. 
The Prime Minister is denying that.  He stood in the House today 
and denied it.  There is something wrong when the Prime Minister 
of Canada cannot accept responsibility for innocent victims and a 
botched plan on behalf of his health minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are being sacrificed by the finance minister.  The only 
person taking great pleasure in this package is the finance 
minister.  He sits over there with a big cheshire cat grin on his 
face every time we debate this.  Unfortunately it is politics 
being played out on the front benches of the Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The responsibility for Canada's blood supply system falls 
totally and completely at the doorstep of the federal health 
minister.  The federal government is responsible.  What I am 
asking it to do is to act unilaterally because, unfortunately, 
not all of the provinces are rich.  Not all of the provinces can 
afford to give more to that package. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I conclude I want to put this on the record.  Is the health 
minister willing to swallow himself whole to make this package 
work? 
<P><A NAME="LINK201"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Byrne (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Natural Resources, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, in response to the 
hon. member's comments regarding the hepatitis C package and his 
interpretation of the federal-provincial process involved in 
these particularly difficult negotiations, I simply would like to 
point out that if there has been any twisting of words it has 
been by the hon. member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What this House understands and what the people of Canada 
understand extremely well and very thoroughly is that it was the 
Government of Canada and this health minister that provided an 
opportunity for health ministers and premiers from across the 
country to come to the conclusion that where there was fault 
there should be compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me make this very clear.  While the hon. member from the 
Conservative Party holds up a letter from the Conservative 
premier of Ontario stating that now he has seen the light and is 
prepared to initiate an action, I would like the hon. member to 
stand and say specifically where the hon. premier was in the last 
12 months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While no other premier, no other health minister in this country 
was willing to stand to support a compensation package to bring 
the parties to the table, this health minister was.  This health 
minister, despite the objections of some, brought the parties 
together and came up with a deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That deal was signed and put in place by premiers and by health 
ministers from across the country, representing not just 
Liberals, not just Conservatives, but New Democrats, 
separatists—members from all parties and all walks of life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we have a change of heart.  We have members who are now 
suggesting they have seen the light and they want to twist the 
words of their colleague, the premier of Ontario.  We have 
nothing to learn from Mr. Harris or from the hon. members 
opposite.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>SHIPBUILDING 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK203"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, on April 2 in this 
House, I put a question to the Prime Minister about the 
implementation of a real shipbuilding policy. It was the hon. 
parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Industry who answered 
my question and I guess he will be the one answering again 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I then reminded the House that the Liberal candidates in the 
Quebec City area, including the Prime Minister's current chief 
of staff, had promised to hold a summit on the future of 
shipbuilding in Canada in the year following the election and 
coming into office of a Liberal government. 
Here we are in 1998, five years later, and no summit has been 
held. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member of the Standing Committee on Industry, I have 
suggested several times this year that the committee address the 
issue of a shipbuilding policy. I have written to the Prime 
Minister and asked questions in this House. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1750"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last time he appeared before the Standing Committee on 
Industry, the minister finally told me he might have done 
something in terms of subsidies but, since he has no intention 
of doing anything, he steered me off in a different direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary seemed to indicate in his response 
that all was well in the shipbuilding industry. Yet, the 
Canadian shipbuilding association, which represents Canada's 
leading shipyards, has been asking the government for a year to 
implement a number of measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, an improved export financing and loan guarantee program 
similar to the Title XI program in the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the exemption of new ships built in Canadian shipyards 
from Revenue Canada's current leasing regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, a 
refundable tax credit for Canadian shipbuilders and ship owners 
who enter into contracts to build ships or conversion contracts 
involving a change in roles, mid-life refit or major refit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, the elimination of the unilateral aspects of NAFTA which 
allow the Americans to sell new or used ships to Canada while 
denying Canadians any access to the American market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are but four measures. Others could also be taken. For 
example, in its 1997 budget, the Quebec government introduced 
tax credits for any type of shipbuilding and, 12 months later, 
extended these credits to drilling rigs. 
For the Lévis shipyard in particular, this is a very important 
niche in the market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I conclude with the hope that the parliamentary secretary will 
be able to provide me with more information.  What are the 
Liberal government's plans?  Does it plan to follow up on its 
1993 promise to hold a summit?  Or, failing that, could the 
Standing Committee on Industry or the Standing Committee on 
Finance study the matter, as Liberal delegates requested at the 
last Liberal Party convention here in Ottawa less than two 
months ago?  They too asked the government to do this, following 
similar requests by the premiers at their meeting in St. 
Andrew's last fall. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the parliamentary secretary: When the government will 
honour its promises? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK204"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am pleased that the hon. 
member for Lévis has given me the opportunity to speak on the 
subject of federal shipbuilding policy.  I appreciate some of his 
concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me first say that most Canadian shipyards are generally in 
good shape, providing repair and refit services and some new 
construction to the commercial marine market and government 
fleets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, Canada is only one of many players in shipbuilding 
internationally.  We must recognize that fact and ensure that our 
industry is geared to realistic market opportunities.  That is 
why between 1986 and 1993 the federal government spent nearly 
$200 million on an industry-led rationalization process.  The 
industry itself decided it was necessary to reduce its capacity 
so that the remaining shipyards could survive and remain 
competitive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must also stress that this government already has a 
shipbuilding policy.  It consists of support to the industry in 
the form of the following measures and the Minister of Industry 
has repeated them over and over in this House:  domestic 
procurement by the federal government for all its ship 
construction and repair requirements where it is feasible to do 
so; a 25% tariff on most non-NAFTA foreign built ships; an 
accelerated capital cost allowance of 33.3% on new ships built in 
Canada, which many other sectors have requested; financing 
through the Export Development Corporation for commercially 
viable transactions; and a favourable R and D tax credit system 
that encourages shipbuilders to keep pace with new technology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I work with various shipbuilding and repair companies.  I 
encourage them to become more and more competitive, but subsidies 
are not an answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, this government is now and always has been 
supportive of the shipbuilding industry and we will continue to 
encourage its development.

<P><A NAME="LINK206"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, since 1995 
Elijah Smith reforestation funds have been collected and 
deposited in the consolidated revenue fund but they have not been 
available for reforestation in Yukon.  The federal government has 
recognized that the process is not transparent or workable.  The 
President of the Treasury Board says that it is necessary to 
amend the Territorial Lands Act to establish a separate account 
in the Accounts of Canada for reforestation in Yukon.  It is 
unfortunate that it has taken so long to initiate this process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time Canada is in the process of devolving 
provincial like powers to Yukon.  Considering that the federal 
government proposes that the Yukon government assume 
responsibility for the administration and control of lands, 
forest, water and mineral resources, I call on the government to 
modernize the Yukon Act so it is consistent with the powers 
currently exercised by the Yukon government and the powers to be 
conferred on the new territory of Nunavut. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The department of Indian affairs currently manages the inventory 
of Yukon forests.  Rather than amending the Territorial Lands Act 
to open a separate account for reforestation, the federal 
government will better serve the people of Yukon by modernizing 
the Yukon Act so it is consistent with the devolution objectives 
and gives the provincial powers needed for Yukon to manage its 
own forestry. 
<P><A NAME="LINK207"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. George Proud (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, on April 23 the hon. 
member asked a question about the Elijah Smith reforestation 
fund, in particular about the disbursement of the funds once 
deposited. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1995 Yukon timber harvesters have been contributing to the 
cost of reforestation in Yukon.  I assure the hon. member that 
reforestation activities have occurred.  In 1995, 100,000 
seedlings were planted.  This number increased to 480,000 in 1996 
and 800,000 in 1997.  Other reforestation activities have also 
occurred such as the collection of pine and spruce cones and the 
purchase of site preparation equipment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the 1995 regulations were implemented the disbursement 
mechanism was put in place.  Under the mechanism revenues from 
Yukon reforestation fees are deposited in the CRF.  INAK is 
authorized to draw into its budget an amount equivalent to the 
value of the revenues deposited. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However we recognize that the current process of collecting and 
disbursing funds to reforestation could be more transparent to 
the residents of Yukon, particularly to timber harvesters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To this end Treasury Board people have been working with INAK to 
establish a more transparent process.  To do so legislation must 
be created, and this is consistent with the requirements of the 
Financial Administration Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>INAK is currently working on a proposal to amend the Territorial 
Lands Act which would include a provision to establish a separate 
account in the Accounts of Canada.  This would enable the 
collection and distribution of funds for reforestation to be 
tracked publicly.  We hope to put this in place as quickly as 
possible with the co-operation of parliament.
