	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our government is saddened by the fact that the

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I call upon the media to play a role in educating

	Mr. Speaker, last weekend I was talking to some of our

					 me that for the eight border crossings in Quebec we only have one sniffer dog,
					 no extra manpower and no ion scanners to detect illicit substances.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of a quick verification by a sniffer dog, our
					 border guards have to laboriously hand search each suspicious vehicle. They are
					 hampered because they do not have the staff.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a disturbing trend. The ministers say

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was the 33rd edition of the song festival, which
					 has developed over the years into the most important and prestigious event for

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the festival is to encourage the
					 development of our cultural industry by sustaining the influence of the
					 francophonie on the international scene. Winnipeg's Edouard Lamontagne, one of
					 the finalists, was awarded the opportunity to study at Astafford, France, where
					 he will take part in workshops run by Francis Cabrel.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Congratulations to the winners: Pierre Lapointe of

					 Cowansville, in the performer category. These rising stars treated us to
					 dynamic and inspired performances. </p>

	Mr. Speaker, on Sunday hundreds of Burlington residents

					 Canadians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Muslims in Burlington and throughout Canada were
					 equally shocked by the recent acts of terrorism. Islam is a religion of love
					 and care for all human beings. The destruction and mass murder in New York City
					 and Washington D.C.have no place in religion.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a community Burlington residents reject terrorism.
					 Our gathering demonstrated that our values as Canadians, our respect for
					 diversity and our fellow citizens cannot be shattered like those buildings in
					 the United States. Terrorists have no place in our communities or in our
					 country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of us as individual Canadians and as members of the
					 House must work hard to protect our diversity and to nurture our freedom and
					 respect for others. As citizens of a civilized nation we have all been tested.
					 Sunday's gathering in Burlington is evidence that we can meet that challenge.
					 Burlington residents can be very proud.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, we are nearing the end of summer. Many
					 areas continue to be plagued by one of the most severe droughts in recent
					 history. Canadian producers, and particularly producers in Saskatchewan and
					 Alberta have not had enough rain this summer. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prairie grass has burned off. Dugouts and springs
					 have gone dry. Ranchers have no choice but to haul water and feed to maintain
					 their herds. Many ranchers are being forced to sell off their cattle. Ranchers
					 have not asked for large government intervention but they are asking for
					 consistency. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Normally under these circumstances producers would be
					 able to work with the PFRA to find new water sources or to install pipelines.
					 However because the budget of the PFRA was emptied four days into the new
					 fiscal year there are up to 500 of these projects on hold in Saskatchewan
					 alone.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation is desperate. When will the government
					 act by reallocating money to the PFRA so that ranchers can get access to the
					 most basic of resources, water?</p>

	Mr. Speaker, last week the premier of Ontario and his

					 with decisions of the government of Ontario but on this one I have to state my

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Getting a patent for a diagnostic test or process

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is tantamount to allowing companies to seek and
					 obtain a patent on individual elements of the periodic table such as oxygen or

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge our government to embark on a fight to disallow

	Mr. Speaker, this week marks a victory for tax
					 fairness. The loophole case is finally being heard before the federal court
					 after five years of Liberal obstruction and appeals.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1991 a Revenue Canada ruling allowed one of Canada's
					 wealthiest families to avoid a $700 million tax bill by transferring $2 billion
					 out of the country. The member for Winnipeg--Transcona began raising this issue
					 then, and we in the NDP will not stop until justice is done.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberals clearly wish this issue would just go
					 away, that a 10 year agreement with the family in question would run out and
					 that they would be unable to collect the taxes owed. They have fought George
					 Harris of Winnipeg every step of the way in his legal challenge on behalf of
					 all Canadians. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They promised legislation in 1996 to close the
					 loophole, and here it is 2001 and only another revised draft of legislation has
					 been released for comment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge the government to finally put these rules into

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. M'Barek's return to Quebec is certainly a happy

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are convinced that, in the future, the lessons

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ministers agreed to establish a common evaluation

					 (Saint-Hyacinthe--Bagot, BQ): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, there are some strange goings-on in this
					 parliament and a fortiori in this government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On September 18 of this year, the Minister of Finance
					 tabled Notice of Ways and Means Motion No. 6. This was a notice of ways and
					 means motion amending the Income Tax Act so as to allow taxpayers, and
					 particularly the government, to better manage the money that government
					 receives.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, eight days after this notice of ways and means
					 motion was tabled, we are still trying to find out which minister, which
					 department and which officials are responsible for it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we ask the Minister of Finance who is responsible
					 for this notice of ways and means motion, he refers us to the Secretary of
					 State for International Financial Institutions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we contact officials in the office of the
					 secretary of state responsible for financial institutions, they are surprised
					 and completely taken aback: it is the first time they have seen this notice of
					 ways and means motion, and they refer us to the Department of
					 Finance.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the Department of Finance, we are told that it is
					 the Minister of National Revenue, not the Minister of Finance, who is
					 responsible. The Minister of National Revenue tells us it is the Minister of
					 Finance.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eight days after the notice of ways and means motion
					 was tabled, we still do not know which minister is responsible for this
					 important notice, the effect of which is to introduce new provisions for
					 managing the billions of dollars received from Canadian and Quebec
					 taxpayers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, our efforts to obtain this information from
					 departmental officials have not been any more successful. When we call the
					 Department of Finance and speak to officials, we are told that this is not
					 their responsibility but rather the responsibility of officials working for the
					 Secretary of State for International Financial Institutions. When we speak to
					 officials working for the Secretary of State for International Financial
					 Institutions, we are told that department of revenue officials are
					 responsible.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, after eight days, officials are still
					 wondering which minister is responsible for Notice of Ways and Means Motion
					 No. 6, which department is responsible for this notice of ways and means
					 motion, and which official can provide any sort of answer to our questions
					 regarding the billions of taxpayer dollars managed by the
					 government.</p>

				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I was just getting to it. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday afternoon, there was a suggestion of the
					 possibility of voting on this notice of ways and means motion. We were asked at
					 that time, as members of this House, to vote on a kind of shapeless thing, a
					 UFO, unidentified flying object. We were asked to vote on a motion whose ins
					 and outs no one was able to explain to us.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Montpetit Marleau, we have privileges as
					 members of this House. We have the right to know what we are voting on and to
					 have replies to our questions from the ministers responsible or from public
					 servants. We find ourselves in a situation where responses are not forthcoming
					 and we are being threatened with a vote. This is clearly contempt of this
					 House. Clearly, our privileges as members of parliament are being breached by
					 this government. I am calling upon you for a ruling on this breach according to
					 Montpetit-Marleau.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is impossible for me to discharge my function of
					 Bloc Quebecois critic on finance, since I am not getting an answer from the
					 government. We do not know which minister, department or officials are in

				  </b>

	In spite of the hon. member's arguments in support of
					 his point of view, there is a problem here for the Chair. This ways and means
					 motion was tabled on September 18. It is recorded in the notice paper;
					 therefore it is in the order paper of the House, and a copy was tabled with the
					 clerk of the House.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that I myself often cannot understand these
					 documents, but this is not a question of privilege. Sometimes, these documents
					 are very difficult to understand, because they are very technical.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully sympathize with the hon. member and I
					 appreciate his difficulties in finding someone to provide explanations, but we
					 heard the hon. leader of the government in the House say that he will find
					 someone somewhere who can do it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not, in my view, a question of privilege,
					 because the document is here. I realize that these documents can be very
					 technical, but this is not, in my opinion, a question of privilege.</p>

					 place than it was before September 11, 2001, and events occurring half a world
					 away are now matters of vital public concern which may directly affect the
					 safety and security of Canadians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The report was spearheaded by one of the members of the
					 Canadian Alliance caucus, the hon. member for Calgary East, who is our CIDA
					 critic and deeply concerned with human rights and international security, as
					 all of us are. At his initiative the committee tabled this report, expressing
					 its concern over the repressive policies of the Taliban regime. In particular,
					 the hon. member was shocked at the edict of the Taliban requiring that members
					 of Afghanistan's Hindu and Sikh communities, the minority communities, wear a
					 yellow patch on their clothing to publicly identify themselves.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Afghanistan's Hindus and Sikhs are a beleaguered
					 minority whose numbers have fallen from about 50,000 in the 1970s to around 500
					 today after decades of civil war. The Taliban claims that this measure is to
					 allow police to protect the Hindu and Sikh minority, but this repressive
					 measure is eerily reminiscent of the Nuremberg laws and other repressive Nazi
					 laws against the Jews, which in 1939 required all Polish Jews to wear a yellow
					 Star of David on their clothing.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not surprisingly, at the time this repressive edict was
					 released, spokespeople for the Canadian Jewish community reacted strongly.
					 Canadian Jewish Congress national president, Keith Landy, said the
					 following:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>This is an edict that should be
						  condemned by all who support religious freedom and the rights of minorities.
						  The Taliban regime has demonstrated its lack of respect for human rights in the
						  past. This is but one more gesture to return Afghanistan to the Middle
						  Ages.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went on to say that Jews and other minorities have
					 often been subject to such discriminatory dress edicts, most recently during
					 the Nazi domination of Europe. This is a chilling reminder of those times and
					 the fact that such laws are never passed for the benefit of the minority
					 affected. This is the kind of so-called protection that minorities have to be
					 protected from and serves mainly to make them targets either of the authorities
					 or of populations incited to hatred. We must stand against this.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Landy went on to say:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>We urge the Canadian government to
						  convey to the Taliban rulers of Afghanistan the horror of all Canadians at such
						  clear discrimination against religious minority and to call for this odious
						  measure to be rescinded immediately... We must also continue to press for UN
						  action against a regime which has shown a blatant disregard for all
						  international human rights norms.</small></td>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This edict of May 22, 2001, against the Hindus and
					 Sikhs was simply one of a number of repressive measures the Taliban has taken
					 which have drawn worldwide attention and worldwide condemnation. In March of
					 this year, the Taliban destroyed two historic statues of the Buddha at Bamiyan.
					 These statues were respectively 38 and 53 metres tall and had stood there for
					 2,000 years.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In August, eight American, Australian and German aid
					 workers with the Christian charity called Shelter Now were arrested and accused
					 of proselytizing in favour of Christianity, a crime which can carry the death
					 penalty in Afghanistan. The whereabouts of those young aid workers are now
					 unknown.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course most horrifically of all, on September 11
					 terrorists linked to Osama bin Laden and his al-Qaeda terrorist organization,
					 whom the Taliban have given shelter and support, murdered some 7,000 people in
					 the ruthless attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Canadians who have paid little attention to the
					 events and the problems in a far-off land are now wondering how such a
					 murderous and barbarous regime could have possibly come about. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Afghanistan's traditional monarchy was overthrown in
					 1973 and was eventually replaced with a pro-Soviet government. This led to the
					 1979 Soviet invasion which was heavily resisted by tribal militia known as the
					 Mujaheddin. In 1989 the Soviet invaders withdrew. In 1992 the Mujaheddin
					 finally took over Kabul and ousted the Soviet backed regime. The different
					 factions within the movement could not work together and quickly fell to
					 infighting and corruption. In the midst of all of this chaos, a group of young,
					 reform minded Sunni Muslim students, or Taliban, arose in southern Afghanistan
					 and in religious schools in Pakistan.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They swept to power by 1996 and put in place a radical
					 Islamic regime. While there was initially hope from the people that the young
					 and so-called idealistic Taliban would bring about economic and political
					 reform, these hopes were quickly dashed as the government brought in more and
					 more repressive measures, such as killing minority Shiite Muslims and banning
					 women from all work and education.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the forces driving the Taliban into adopting
					 ever more radical and extremist interpretations of the law was Osama bin Laden.
					 Bin Laden, a Saudi multimillionaire, helped support and fought with the
					 Mujaheddin against the Soviets in the 1980s. He returned to Saudi Arabia where
					 he quickly turned against his own government when it accepted American and
					 western military assistance, including Canadian, in the gulf war against
					 Iraq.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bin Laden began to orchestrate terrorist acts against
					 American soldiers in Saudi Arabia and other American assets abroad. Eventually
					 he left Saudi Arabia for the Sudan to help that country's new radical regime.
					 When in 1996, under Saudi and American pressure, the Sudanese expelled bin
					 Laden, the new Taliban regime in Afghanistan offered bin Laden
					 refuge.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcoming bin Laden turned out to be a deal with the
					 devil for the Taliban. Bin Laden provided funding and military advice to the
					 Taliban which unfortunately it gratefully accepted, but he also used
					 Afghanistan as a base for his al-Qaeda organization which became a university
					 for terror groups from around the world.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terrorists from dozens of countries, including some who
					 came from Canada, have gone to Afghanistan to train in the al-Qaeda camps. They
					 have done this with the full knowledge of and support from the Taliban.
					 Meanwhile bin Laden and al-Qaeda have driven the Taliban into ever more
					 extremist and radical interpretations of the law, including such barbaric
					 measures as the destruction of the Buddhist temples, as I have referred to, or
					 forcing the Hindus and Sikhs to wear yellow tags on their clothing, as I have
					 already mentioned. These measures instigated by bin Laden and his global band
					 of extremists and implemented by the Taliban regime have turned Afghanistan
					 into an international pariah state.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time of the third report of the standing
					 committee, the members called for increased Canadian action against the Taliban
					 through the United Nations. While we should continue to use the United Nations
					 process to condemn the brutal acts of bin Laden and his Taliban supporters, the
					 events of September 11 must force us to consider more direct responses to the
					 threat of terrorism.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;British Prime Minister Tony Blair said only yesterday
					 that the Taliban is “a regime founded on fear, and funded largely by drugs and
					 crime”. He said clearly and unequivocally that the Taliban must surrender bin
					 Laden and his associates or face the military wrath of the civilized
					 world.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prime Minister Blair said:</p>

</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a speech to the United States congress last
					 Thursday, President Bush spoke in similarly forceful terms. He said:
					 </p>

</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went on to state:</p>

						  committing murder.</small></td>
</tr>

</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That night he went on to say:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

<td width="30" align="right">

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government of Canada and members of the House such
					 as the member for Calgary East have indeed condemned the outrages against human
					 rights and the international order that have been perpetrated by the Taliban.
					 However, as the words of Prime Minister Blair and President Bush illustrate,
					 the time for UN resolutions is quickly giving way to the need for a military
					 solution to the problem of the Taliban regime and increased domestic security
					 measures to prevent terrorist groups, whether Taliban backed or not, from
					 jeopardizing the safety and security of Canadian citizens at home.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have not heard words as strong condemning the
					 Taliban from our own Prime Minister or the Minister of Foreign Affairs. We are
					 simply asking the question why. Unlike the United States and the United Kingdom
					 we cannot credibly threaten the Taliban regime with the military response which
					 it so richly deserves and which is justified, incidentally, under article 51 of
					 the United Nations charter granting nations the right to individual and
					 collective self-defence.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lesson for Canadians from September 11, 2001, is
					 that we cannot take our safety and security for granted. We cannot assume that
					 in a post-cold war world all threats to our national security have vanished.
					 They have not vanished and we cannot afford to run our military into the
					 ground.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he knows earlier today there was an agreement among
					 parties, the purpose of which was to end the stalling tactics in the House of
					 Commons that have gone on over the recent days and to proceed with the agenda.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. gentleman has just made a speech about rights.
					 Today we have a bill before the House about the rights of our aboriginal

					 adjourned.</p>

					 Bakopanos): </b>

	I believe that is not a point of order but a request.
					 Does the hon. Leader of the Opposition wish to continue?</p>


	<A NAME="Int-52286"></A><a HREF="#Int-52306"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-52302"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Stockwell Day:
				  </b>

	Madam Speaker, I will continue acknowledging that this
					 is an important issue for all citizens, for all people of the world. If we do
					 not stand clearly for people in other nations who are suffering, then people in
					 our own nation could suffer. We must stand together and clearly indicate the
					 things that must be done to protect people everywhere and to grant safety and
					 security.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot assume in a post-cold war world that we are
					 beyond security threats. We cannot assume that just because we are thousands of
					 miles away from the smouldering religious and ethnic conflicts of the Middle
					 East and Central Asia that these conflicts will not affect us. Some 40 to 60
					 Canadians have already been killed by a brutal act of mass murder that may well
					 have been planned in a cave somewhere in Afghanistan under the protection of
					 the Taliban regime.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parliament must address, and address it now, the
					 security challenges which we face at home and abroad and the measures which we
					 must take both to punish the terrorists who launched the brutal attacks in New
					 York and Washington and to protect Canadians against the threat of future
					 terrorist attacks. We can no longer delay putting the safety and security of
					 Canadians at the forefront of the political agenda.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1938 Winston Churchill published his foreign policy
					 speeches. He was lamenting British indifference to Hitler's repression and
					 military buildup. He entitled those speeches “While England Slept”. This is how
					 Churchill described the policies of Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin at the time
					 for his failure to act firmly in the face of Hitler's totalitarianism: “decided
					 only to be undecided, resolved to be irresolute, adamant for drift, solid for
					 fluidity, all-powerful to be impotent”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot let this description stand as an epitaph for
					 Canada which has proven itself unready to confront the challenge of terrorism.
					 We have a history in the last century of being ready and willing and having the
					 will to do so and that must continue in this century.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, in the two weeks since the horrific
					 events in New York and Washington, the government has not been clear in terms
					 of specific action to give us confidence that Canada is taking the war against
					 terrorism seriously. The official opposition, our members of parliament, want
					 to work with our Prime Minister and the government in the war against terrorism
					 but we need something to work with. We need the specifics.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to consider what the government has done and
					 what it has failed to do since the events of September 11. We need to consider
					 its inaction in bringing in comprehensive anti-terrorism legislation. Other
					 countries have it. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to consider the government's inaction in
					 bringing forward safety and security measures to protect Canadians at the
					 borders, at our airports and on airplanes. We heard again today the government
					 absolutely ruling out air marshals on airplanes. It is time to restore consumer
					 confidence in our airlines, yet almost without debate, something that could be
					 positive was ruled out without discussion. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us consider the government's inaction in failing to
					 commit more resources to the armed forces, to the RCMP, to CSIS and giving them
					 a clear and broad mandate to act against terrorism, both at home and
					 abroad.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last Tuesday, one week after the terrorist attacks in
					 the United States, the official opposition brought forward a motion which
					 called upon the government to draft comprehensive anti-terrorism legislation,
					 similar to what is found in other freedom-loving nations. In that resolution we
					 called for the government to table anti-terrorism legislation forthwith similar
					 in principle to the United Kingdom's terrorism act, 2000. We called for
					 specific provisions to be included in such legislation, specific things, not
					 just words, but action. </p>


	<A NAME="T1535"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1535"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1540"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1530"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1535)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We called for the naming of all known international
					 terrorist organizations operating in Canada. We called for a complete ban on
					 fundraising activities in support of terrorism. We called for a provision for
					 the seizure of assets belonging to terrorists or terrorist
					 organizations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday we had confirmation in the House of Commons
					 by the Minister of Finance that some 27 organizations had their assets frozen,
					 that action had been taken immediately. When we could not find evidence of that
					 having taken place, we posed the question again today. Now we hear that
					 possibly that was not done but the government will not tell us whether or not
					 it was done. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a matter of fact, two ministers are at odds with
					 each other. The Minister of Finance is saying those assets were frozen
					 immediately and the Minister of Justice does not know if they were and is not
					 able to confirm that. We need immediate ratification of the international
					 convention for the suppression of the financing of terrorism. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We called for the creation of specific crimes for
					 engaging in terrorist training activities in Canada or inciting terrorist acts
					 abroad from Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We called for prompt extradition of foreign nationals
					 charged with acts of terrorism, even if the charges are capital offences. We
					 have also called for detention and deportation to their country of origin of
					 any people illegally in Canada or failed refugee claimants who have been linked
					 to terrorist organizations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those are pretty basic requests. The vast majority of
					 Canadians stand shoulder to shoulder with us in making those requests. We were
					 not requesting these things for political opportunism or advantage. We wanted
					 to be flexible. We wanted to allow the government, and as many parties as
					 possible, to embrace these proposals.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I moved an amendment to the resolution that would have
					 allowed the government to table such legislation in draft form before the
					 Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights for its consideration. We were
					 happy to have the government do that. We asked that it do that but even this
					 was too much for the government. Instead it tried to propose that the committee
					 simply discuss the concept of anti-terrorism legislation but was unable or
					 unwilling to produce legislation itself even in draft form.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, we are trying to support the government
					 and the Prime Minister but we need something specific to support. I find it
					 hard to understand a week later what elements of our resolution the government
					 found objectionable. It will not tell us; it will not tell anyone. Maybe it is
					 reticent to name and ban specific terrorist groups that are known to operate in
					 Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reply to questions from the official opposition on
					 fundraising activities by a known front group for the Tamil Tigers, the
					 solicitor general said in the House on June 2 last year under questioning by
					 the member for Lakeland:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right">
</td>
<td><small>--it
						  is important to note that CSIS does not provide a list of terrorist
						  organizations and it does not provide a list of people or organizations that it
						  is targeting.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. solicitor general seemed to imply that the
					 fact Canada does not name known terrorist organizations publicly was somehow a
					 strength of Canadian law. That is not a strength. It is a weakness that needs
					 to be strengthened.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our friends and allies in the United States and the
					 United Kingdom are ready and willing to name banned organizations. Many of
					 these organizations are present in Canada as well.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have named and gone through a list of these groups
					 that have been named. We know them. There are also 27 organizations and
					 individuals named on President Bush's list whose assets the United States have
					 seized and frozen. Some of these groups are also operating in Canada, including
					 al-Qaeda and other similar groups. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is the government so resistant to publishing an
					 official list of proscribed organizations so that these kinds of terrorist
					 groups can be publicly known? What is the problem with doing that?</p>


	<A NAME="T1540"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1540"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1545"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1535"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1540)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot get the answer from the government. Up until
					 yesterday the Minister of Justice implied that she simply intended to follow
					 the precedent of anti-gang legislation that would define criminal gangs. It is
					 not simply defining them. It is naming them so that the public knows who they
					 are. We have to name them. We have to prohibit membership in the organizations,
					 named and known violent terrorist groups committed to the destruction of
					 freedom and democracy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the view of the official opposition this would be a
					 wholly inadequate response to the threat of international terrorism. Merely
					 being a member of a group like al-Qaeda should be enough for police to take
					 somebody into custody whether or not that person can be linked to specific
					 crimes. The very purpose of al-Qaeda is murder and destruction. That is its
					 stated purpose. If it is a restriction of freedom of association to ban such a
					 group, it is most certainly a limitation which is demonstrably justifiable in a
					 free and democratic society. It is a group that is committed to murder and
					 destruction.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are sensitive to and well concerned about freedom,
					 freedom of association, freedom of speech. We still can hear ringing in our
					 ears the warning of another century where it was made clear that any time
					 people were willing to give up a freedom for security, there was a risk of
					 losing both. But the extreme element of this, to not address the most extreme
					 attacks on our freedoms, also puts us at the risk of losing both freedom and
					 security.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freedom of speech is something we fiercely defend, but
					 a person cannot walk into a theatre and shout fire. It would be harmful to the
					 innocent people there. There are limits and we are drawing those
					 lines.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday in the House the Minister of Justice
					 indicated that she was considering a system which would include a list of
					 proscribed groups. We in the official opposition certainly hope that she does
					 listen to our appeals in that regard, but again we ask the question, what is
					 she waiting for?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along with our call for naming terrorist groups, which
					 seems to give the government pause, we are calling for a complete ban on
					 fundraising activities in support of terrorism and provision for the seizure of
					 assets belonging to terrorists or terrorist organizations. The vast majority of
					 Canadians are behind us on this issue.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past few days the government has been
					 extremely confusing on these points, as we have already indicated. On Monday
					 the Prime Minister said in Washington that the Office of the Superintendent of
					 Financial Institutions had already ordered the assets of bin Laden associates
					 to be frozen in Canada the previous Friday. That is what the Prime Minister
					 said. In fact all that had happened was that OSFI had sent a letter to
					 financial institutions with the names of some of the dead hijackers and asked
					 the banks to check to see if they had any bank accounts to assist the FBI with
					 its investigation. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday the Minister of Finance indicated in the
					 clearest of terms that if not on Friday, then at least yesterday they had in
					 fact frozen the assets of bin Laden, al-Qaeda and all of the other terrorist
					 groups, individuals and front organizations on President Bush's 27 name
					 financial most wanted list. It is recorded clearly in <i>Hansard</i>. The
					 finance minister said that those assets had been frozen. Today we find out that
					 possibly that is not the situation, but we cannot get a clear
					 answer.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, all that OSFI had done was send out an
					 information circular containing the president's order and asked Canadian banks
					 and financial institutions to co-operate in investigations. The only concrete
					 measure that the government seems to have taken to seize and freeze assets is
					 an order in council that was put in place back in February which implemented
					 security council resolution 1333 and called for the Canadian assets of bin
					 Laden himself, al-Qaeda and the Taliban to be frozen. That is the only action
					 and that was back in February.</p>


	<A NAME="T1545"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1545"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1550"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1540"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1545)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We certainly support that measure, but apparently not a
					 single bin Laden or al-Qaeda dollar has been frozen in Canada since this
					 measure was put in place in February. President Bush's list goes beyond just
					 bin Laden and the Taliban. He targets 27 different groups and individuals,
					 including the Abu Sayyaf group in the Philippines, the Groupe islamique armé of
					 Algeria, and a number of other groups.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The United States wants to crack down on the financial
					 sources of terrorism around the globe. Despite protestations from the Prime
					 Minister, the Minister of Finance and the Secretary of State for International
					 Financial Institutions, the government has not brought forward a single
					 regulatory or legislative change since September 11 that will help fight the
					 financial war against terrorism. That is unacceptable.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the government does not want to ratify the
					 international convention for the suppression of terrorist financing. It had two
					 years to do so. We have been calling on the government to ratify that
					 convention, but it is still in limbo.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were beginning to assume the worst. The Prime
					 Minister was asked in Washington whether Canada would ratify the convention. He
					 replied that legislation was before the House and that the opposition was
					 blocking it. That is not acceptable behaviour for a Prime Minister who is
					 asking for co-operation. We in the official opposition are offering that
					 co-operation. We are offering to the government to bring in legislation under
					 its name and to take all the credit for it. Yet the Prime Minister says that we
					 are opposing it, which is simply not the case.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no legislation currently before the House that
					 gives effect to the international convention. The government admits that Bill
					 C-16 is only a partial step and does not meet the standards of the convention
					 itself. Bill C-16 takes away the tax breaks from terrorist groups but it does
					 not ban fundraising. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it is explained to Canadians what steps the
					 government has taken to fight the war against terrorism, they are told the
					 government is suggesting that if someone gives to a terrorist group that person
					 would no longer get a tax break. That is unacceptable.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two weeks after the tragedy in New York the government
					 has not implemented the international convention for the suppression of
					 terrorist financing despite the fact it has been in the government's in box for
					 two years. Perhaps the government is unwilling to create specific crimes for
					 engaging in terrorist training activities in Canada or inciting terrorist acts
					 abroad from Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our own Senate committee chaired by William Kelly
					 stated in 1999 that Canada was a primary venue of opportunity to support, plan
					 or mount terrorist attacks. There is a danger of terrorist attacks in Canada,
					 but there is a greater danger of terrorist groups trying to conduct support
					 activities or plan their attacks elsewhere, especially in the United States,
					 from Canadian bases. That is a grave danger.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anti-terrorism legislation should not simply ban
					 terrorist fundraising but all kinds of terrorist support activities that may be
					 undertaken in Canada. That would include training activities, recruiting and
					 communications. Terrorist groups should not be permitted to use Canadian
					 Internet web servers to promote their cause of destruction and murder. All of
					 these kinds of support activities should be addressed by a new anti-terrorism
					 bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The British legislation requires and creates new crimes
					 for members of terrorist groups undertaking these kinds of support activities
					 on British soil. Canada should do no less.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the government objects to the prompt
					 extradition of foreign nationals charged with acts of terrorism even if the
					 charges are capital offences in the country where they were committed.
					 Anti-terrorism legislation must change our laws regarding the extradition of
					 suspected terrorists. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terrorism knows no borders, so we cannot let Canada
					 become a safe haven for those who would rely on the humanitarian compassion of
					 Canadian laws to avoid justice in their own countries or the countries where
					 they have committed their murderous crimes.</p>


	<A NAME="T1550"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1550"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1555"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1545"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1550)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a government like the United States seeks people
					 accused of terrorism in Canada and we are convinced that there is reasonable
					 evidence, we should turn them over regardless of the fact that they may face a
					 penalty there that would not apply here. This would require a change in
					 Canadian law to send a signal to terrorists that they cannot take advantage of
					 Canada to avoid facing justice for their crimes in other countries.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One can imagine the outrage if one of the perpetrators
					 of those awful acts in New York City or Washington, maybe even the criminal
					 mastermind who so carefully co-ordinated the flight schedules of the
					 terrorists, found his way to Canada and we found ourselves, as we would today,
					 unable to extradite such a person to the United States to face justice.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadian law must address this possibility now. It is a
					 very real possibility that those suspected of these horrendous crimes could be
					 headed for, if not already having crossed, the Canadian border.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some may say that is a hypothetical possibility. A
					 Yemeni national whose flight to the U.S. was diverted to Toronto is currently
					 being held for possessing false passports. He had Lufthansa uniforms in his
					 possession even though he was not an airline employee. This person may have
					 been involved in the planning of the atrocities that took place in the United
					 States and may be charged with conspiracy to commit terrorism. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks to the U.S. supreme court decision concerning
					 Burns and Rafay it is doubtful whether the government could extradite that
					 person to face the consequences of the murderous actions in the United States.
					 Most Canadians will not stand for that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government may have objected to our call for the
					 detention and deportation to their country of origin of failed refugee
					 claimants or others illegally in Canada who have been linked to terrorist
					 organizations. Canada has a wonderful reputation for having open arms and an
					 open heart to those people truly seeking safety and wanting to pursue their
					 hopes and dreams in a nation that promotes freedom and democracy. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is a reputation we richly have and deserve. We
					 also have a reputation for being a haven to people of evil intent who are
					 opposed to freedom and democracy, who do not mind the thoughts of planning mass
					 destruction and murder. That is a reputation we need to shed and we can only do
					 it with clear options.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ahmed Ressam failed his refugee claim. He was under
					 investigation by CSIS and he was arrested for theft in Montreal. Yet he could
					 not be deported. Why? It is because Canada does not deport people to Algeria.
					 This ridiculous policy means that Canada could become a haven for terrorists
					 from any country whose legal systems are not perfect reflections of the Marquis
					 of Queensbury rules.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has to change because it is absurd. Somebody
					 illegally in Canada from a country like Egypt, Turkey or Saudi Arabia, who has
					 broken our laws, who has been linked to terrorism, who has possibly murdered
					 our citizens, may be able to stay in this country with impunity and only asked
					 to check in at an Immigration Canada office once or twice a month.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nabil Al-Marabh, a failed refugee claimant, arrested
					 for trying to enter the United States on a false passport was released by the
					 Immigration and Refugee Board on July 11. He has since been arrested in Chicago
					 as a possible suspect in the World Trade Center attacks. He should have been
					 detained or deported to his country of origin and not allowed to roam free on
					 the streets of Toronto and perhaps free to plan the horror that took place on
					 the streets of New York City.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These were the common sense anti-terrorist policies
					 rejected by the government when it rejected the Canadian Alliance motion on
					 anti-terrorism legislation. Now the government, belatedly, is talking about
					 bringing forward legislation of its own. </p>


	<A NAME="T1555"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1555"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1600"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1550"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1555)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are telling the government today that our motion is
					 the standard to which we will hold it accountable. We hope that the government
					 has the courage to swallow its pride and bring forward legislation that will
					 satisfy all six of our provisions and satisfy what the majority of Canadians
					 want to see. We want to give whole support to the government at this time in
					 the war against terrorism, but the government needs to give us something to
					 support. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anti-terrorism legislation is just one part of an
					 effective war on terrorism. We also need measures to increase the security of
					 our borders, to improve safety in our airports and on our airplanes, and to
					 ensure that our cities have effective emergency preparedness plans and that
					 vital facilities like nuclear plants are safe.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have seen little action on safety and security in
					 the last two weeks from the government. We have seen the Minister of Transport
					 move to order cockpit doors locked on airplanes and apparently airlines are
					 replacing metal with plastic cutlery although we have not seen that happen
					 yet.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However we have not seen the kinds of safety and
					 security measures that Canadians are looking for. There is no government money
					 for improved baggage screening. There is no provision for increased RCMP,
					 customs and immigration enforcement presence at our airports. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Canadians are reeling over the layoffs at Air
					 Canada. However, before the government rushes in with financial aid we should
					 first look at where it has clear responsibility to act quickly to protect the
					 safety and security of our airports and airlines. Let us restore consumer
					 confidence in the airlines so that once again Canadians will fly with a sense
					 of security in our skies. If we are to put taxpayer dollars to work, let us put
					 them to work in security first. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead we have seen a complete rejection of the idea
					 of air marshals despite the fact that El Al, the safest airline in the world,
					 has had them for 30 years and despite the fact that the United States is now
					 implementing them. What is the problem with air marshals on airplanes? It is
					 one of the things that Canadians would like to see. If the government wants to
					 increase the confidence of the flying public, providing air marshals would be
					 one of the strongest confidence building measures it could take.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to protect the integrity of our border with the
					 United States. Despite the Prime Minister's assurance that Americans had no
					 concerns about the Canadian border, United States Attorney General John
					 Ashcroft stated yesterday that the Canada-U.S. border “has become a transit
					 point for several individuals involved in terrorism”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attorney General Ashcroft announced that enforcement on
					 the Canadian border would be beefed up, a sentiment that may send chills up the
					 spines of Canadians in places like Windsor and from coast to coast where a
					 total of some $2 billion in trade flows each and every day.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we want to avoid a crackdown in Canada on the
					 U.S.-Canada border that would hurt Canada, we must do our best to show that we
					 take the security of Canada and the United States seriously. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an issue of personal safety and security and of
					 economic safety and security. In a time of uncertainty in the markets we need
					 to send certain signals of security so that the markets will respond
					 accordingly.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to consider creating a more effective border
					 control and taking such measures as arming Canada customs guards with sidearms
					 for the performance of their duties. Part of this is ensuring that we have
					 identification systems that are not open to abuse.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have seen how easy it was for Ahmed Ressam to obtain
					 a Canadian passport with only a forged baptismal certificate. We know from
					 Immigration Canada's own documents that the IMM 1000 permanent residence
					 document is easily forged and frequently sold on the black market, but the
					 government does not plan to bring in new security ID cards until 2003. We
					 cannot wait; terrorists will not be waiting.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the United States, next to the efforts to create an
					 international coalition to fight terrorism, the most dramatic response has been
					 to create a new office of homeland security under former Pennsylvania Governor
					 Tom Ridge. He will be responsible to integrate the different domestic security
					 and safety agencies that are operative in the United States.</p>


	<A NAME="T1600"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1600"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1605"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1555"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1600)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to talk about this. We need a discussion to see
					 if efficiency and reaction times to protect our citizens can be improved. We
					 need to discuss how that might happen. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not saying this is the answer. We are not saying
					 it is an answer. However we need to have at least a discussion to consider the
					 possibilities. What is prominent in our minds is the safety and security of all
					 Canadians. That issue should be foremost. It should get full
					 consideration.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally I will return to where I began: Canada's
					 international role in fighting the war against terrorism. There is much Canada
					 could do at the international level, both diplomatically and as a provider of
					 humanitarian aid, to improve the human condition and alleviate the excruciating
					 pain of refugees and people in wartorn countries. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must see that we do all we can. This should be a key
					 focus, but it should be done without taking our eyes off the goal of doing all
					 we can to fight terrorism.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike the United Kingdom, Canada cannot be relied on
					 to make a significant military contribution to a potential campaign against the
					 Taliban or other possible state sponsors of terrorism. I want to say clearly
					 that this is no fault of the brave, committed, courageous and dedicated people
					 of our armed forces. They are committed to freedom and safety and to protecting
					 it at any cost. We appreciate and respect that. We want them to be supported
					 and given the resources to be able to do the job.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we lose our ability to fulfill our international
					 military commitments to our allies because of a lack of resources, our
					 international diplomatic clout with our allies and others will decline
					 accordingly. It has been doing that. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Britain has already provided troops to the U.S. led
					 coalition. British SAS forces may already be engaged in action against the
					 Taliban in the mountains of Afghanistan. As a consequence the United Kingdom is
					 taking the war on terrorism seriously. The British foreign secretary is
					 visiting the Middle East and taking the initiative in firming up the coalition.
					 Prime Minister Blair was invited to take a position of honour at President
					 Bush's speech during which Blair accepted the president's compliment that the
					 United States had no truer friend than Great Britain.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Britain's role on the world stage in this crisis is
					 significant and secure because Britain is ready and willing to commit the
					 resources necessary to make an important contribution to the war against
					 terrorism. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada's ability to make a contribution is seriously in
					 question. Under the terms of the 1994 defence white paper Canada is pledged to
					 make certain military commitments to its allies. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a crisis we are in a serious position. The 1994
					 document commits the Canadian forces to deploying overseas one brigade, which
					 is approximately 5,000 troops; one battalion group, which is approximately
					 1,000 troops; and to do so within 90 days. The vanguard elements of the force
					 must deploy within 21 days.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white paper also says that Canada must be able to
					 deploy one CF-18 fighter wing with at least two squadrons of 12 to 24 aircraft
					 each; a naval task force consisting of four to six destroyers and frigates, one
					 to two submarines and one support ship; an Aurora land based maritime patrol
					 aircraft; and a supporting transport squadron with C-130 transport
					 aircraft.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost every external expert on Canadian defence policy
					 is highly doubtful about whether we can deliver on any of these commitments. It
					 is not due to lack of desire. It is due to a lack of resources from the
					 government to equip our troops to be there when needed.</p>


	<A NAME="T1605"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1605"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1610"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1600"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1605)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want Canada to make an effective contribution to
					 fight this war. However there is an obligation to point out some of the serious
					 shortcomings facing the men and women who serve in our armed forces. I will
					 address some of the concerns about Canadian commitments.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, we are pledged to provide one fighter
					 wing of between 24 and 48 aircraft to our allies. During the war in Kosovo,
					 Canada deployed one reinforced CF-18 fighter squadron of 18 aircraft. This
					 constituted a maximum commitment involving nearly all our combat ready CF-18
					 pilots. Unfortunately many of these pilots have since left the air force. We
					 ran out of precision guided munitions or smart bombs and had to secure
					 emergency supplies from our allies. We did not have a strategic refuelling
					 tanker aircraft to support fighter deployments.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much of the army's major equipment, such as Leopard C1
					 tanks and M113 armoured personnel carriers, is antiquated. The government will
					 claim some of the equipment has been modernized. However the so-called
					 modernization was criticized as inadequate by the auditor general's April 1998
					 report.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other areas the army has no capability at all. It
					 has no attack or heavy lift helicopters. For an army that stresses mobility
					 this is surprising and saddening. Our inability to deploy ground troops
					 overseas is poor. During Kosovo it took two months to deploy 800 ground troops
					 to the region.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an article in the <i>Canadian Military Journal</i>
					 in the spring of 2000 the commander of task force Kosovo, Colonel Michael Ward,
					 described the airlift for that deployment as a near catastrophe. That
					 description came from one of our committed and dedicated colonels involved in
					 the task force.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our claim to be able to deploy ground units within the
					 timeframe suggested by the white paper is dubious and for several reasons.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the army has not exercised at the brigade level
					 for nine years. DND admits that if it deployed a brigade it could not sustain
					 it for longer than six months. DND says deployment timeframes of 21 or 90 days
					 are needed to assemble a formation and make it ready to move to the point of
					 embarkation. Actual deployment and training in theatre would take additional
					 time.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, our air and sea transport is in bad shape. Our
					 air force has no heavy lift aircraft. It must rely on our allies, or incredibly
					 it must rent aircraft. Nineteen of our thirty-two C-130 transports are about 35
					 years old and badly in need of replacement. The navy has only two support ships
					 which must be used either to transport troops or to refuel and rearm ships at
					 sea. Using the ships for one task means they would be unavailable for the
					 other.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the United States has quietly informed Canada
					 that it will not accept a commitment of less than a brigade within its
					 operational space for ground combat operations. A brigade sized unit is seen as
					 the minimum because smaller units are not self-sufficient fighting
					 formations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, while our navy is probably in the best shape of
					 all our forces even it has problems. The navy could probably assemble the task
					 group it is committed to provide. However at present one of its four destroyers
					 and seven of its twelve frigates are at reduced readiness. That means it would
					 take some time to ready them for deployment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The navy is short about 400 highly skilled technical
					 personnel. This will make activating ships very difficult. In addition, not all
					 our new submarines ordered from Britain have yet been delivered. The 35 year
					 old Sea King helicopters are in terrible shape, as I mentioned earlier. They
					 are often unable to get airborne due to breakdowns.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why are our armed forces in such desperate shape? It is
					 because between 1993 and 1999 the Liberals cut the defence budget by 30% in
					 real terms. We are tired of hearing about a little bump upward here and a
					 little bump upward there. It does not compensate for a 30% reduction in real
					 terms since 1993. </p>


	<A NAME="T1610"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1610"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1615"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1605"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1610)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past 10 years the total number of military
					 personnel numbers has fallen from about 90,000 to less than 58,000. That is a
					 35% drop. While the government claims the forces are more combat capable than
					 they were 10 years ago, the facts tell another story. Some new equipment is
					 beginning to arrive but it is not sufficient in and of itself to restore
					 capability.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A parade of former officers, the Conference of Defence
					 Associations, the Royal Canadian Military Institute and the auditor general
					 have raised similar concerns about the combat capabilities of the Canadian
					 forces.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government put new money into defence in the year
					 2000, a move it constantly trumpets as a great success. However it has been
					 assessed by many independent experts as insufficient to address the broader
					 crisis, and it is a crisis, in the Canadian forces. Very little of the increase
					 will go to equipment. Most of it will make up for shortfalls in the operational
					 budget.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The auditor general has identified a potential funding
					 shortfall in the equipment budget of $30 billion up to and including the year
					 2012. If Canada is to be taken seriously in the international war against
					 terrorism we must act at once to rebuild our military. We must be capable of
					 meeting our commitments in the white paper of 1994. We must take this matter
					 seriously because we are no longer at peace. We are at war with
					 terrorism.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said to the House last week, the war on terrorism
					 is not what William James called “The Moral Equivalent of War”, the periodic
					 moral and social campaigns against collective problems like the so-called war
					 on drugs or the war on poverty. This is a real war and it will be fought, at
					 least in part, with ships, artillery and airplanes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of National Defence has emphasized that
					 this will not be a conventional war, or perhaps not in whole. As we have said,
					 the war against terrorism will be waged on a lot of fronts. It will involve
					 intelligence work, law enforcement, domestic safety, security, diplomatic
					 initiatives and humanitarian aid. However conventional warfare will undoubtedly
					 be involved.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For 50 years NATO has existed as a purely defensive
					 military alliance, possibly the most successful military alliance in modern
					 history. NATO has never needed to intervene to protect one of its members from
					 external attack because it seemed unthinkable that any aggressor would attack a
					 country protected by the umbrella of the alliance. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All that changed on Tuesday, September 11, when an
					 enemy attacked the largest city of the most powerful member of the NATO
					 alliance. All that changed on September 11, when 6,000 innocent civilians were
					 brutally murdered by fire from the sky.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Wednesday, September 12, for the first time in its
					 history NATO invoked its fundamental principle, article 5 of the NATO charter,
					 which states that an attack on one is an attack on all. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the time to stand by our friends, our allies
					 and especially our neighbour to the south. We must leave no doubt whatsoever as
					 to our commitment to them and to NATO. We have neither seen or heard from the
					 Liberal government the same clear level of support offered by the government of
					 the United Kingdom or even the government of Australia. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said before, there are no rear guard
					 positions in the war on terrorism. There are only frontlines. That is exactly
					 where Canada should be. We should be standing shoulder to shoulder with other
					 democratic nations that believe in, support and cherish freedom and democracy
					 as much as we do.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will reiterate our obligation under article 5 of the
					 Washington Treaty. Article 5 in part states:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>The Parties agree that an armed
						  attack against one or more of them...shall be considered an attack against them
						  all and...if such an armed attack occurs, each of them...will assist the Party
						  or Parties so attacked by taking forthwith...such action as it deems necessary,
						  including the use of armed force-- </small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are morally obliged to offer all assistance possible
					 within our capabilities, up to and including military assistance, to the United
					 States and our NATO allies if requested.</p>


	<A NAME="T1615"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1615"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1620"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1610"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1615)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must all stand together in a great coalition against
					 this darkness and this evil of terrorism. But, if we are to do our share, as we
					 hope the Prime Minister will commit to doing, we must rapidly rebuild our
					 forces and make sure that procurement is improved.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We want peace, make no mistake about that, but we must
					 remember that the best way of ensuring peace is to have a strong and committed
					 Canadian forces.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all the areas I have outlined, comprehensive
					 anti-terrorism legislation, measures to increase the safety and security of
					 Canadians, a clear commitment to strengthen national defence and to a Canadian
					 military war against terrorism, and humanitarian aid, the government has fallen
					 down. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we face future threats of terrorism, whether they
					 originate from Osama bin Laden and his allies and the Taliban regime in
					 Afghanistan, we will need to move swiftly and resolutely on all these
					 fronts.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we have seen over the last two weeks in terms of
					 specific action, not glowing words or rambling rhetoric, has not been
					 encouraging. We have seen a government that is relying too much on rhetoric and
					 tiny baby steps, never doing by halves what it can do by quarters.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We want to support the government and the Prime
					 Minister but we need something specific to support.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have taken the time this afternoon to lay out our
					 concerns in detail and to convey the seriousness with which the official
					 opposition is taking in this war on terrorism. We also believe absolutely that
					 we are reflecting the concerns of a majority of our citizens. We know that in a
					 time of war the opposition has a special duty to support the Prime Minister and
					 the government as far as conscience allows.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to say that immediately upon seeing, watching
					 and hearing about these evil attacks on New York City, I was immediately in
					 communication with our Prime Minister, immediately saying that we would be
					 there to support, to stand side by side and to be with the government.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have indicated a number of times in the last several
					 days that we want to support. A number of times I have stood in the House and
					 outside the House and, even for the small things the government has done, I
					 have expressed appreciation to the Prime Minister. I have thanked the Prime
					 Minister. I have said that we will support the Prime Minister. I have said
					 those things many times.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of us have watched with some dismay at the
					 difference in response from the leader of the government as we watched where
					 time and again in the United States the president of the United States takes
					 the initiative, reaches out to members of the opposition, members of the senate
					 majority and minority parties, and includes them in discussion on legislation,
					 in discussion on what needs to be done. He even includes them in the memorial
					 services. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have seen nothing, not one of those things, from the
					 Prime Minister or the government, and yet we continue to stand here and say
					 that we want to support the Prime Minister and the government. We must give
					 Canadians something specific to support in the war against
					 terrorism.</p>

	moved that Bill C-33, an act respecting the water
					 resources of Nunavut and the Nunavut Surface Rights Tribunal and to make
					 consequential amendments to other acts, be read the second time and referred to
					 a committee.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said: Mr. Speaker, I rise to address the House on
					 Bill C-33, the Nunavut waters and the Nunavut surface rights tribunal act. Bill
					 C-33 would address a number of outstanding commitments made under the Nunavut
					 land claims agreement signed in 1993.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also consistent with our commitments in the
					 Speech from the Throne to strengthen Canada's relationship with aboriginal
					 people and to bring the benefits of prosperity to all communities including the
					 remote Inuit communities of Nunavut.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-33 would provide the legislative framework for
					 two institutions of public government in Nunavut: the Nunavut water board and
					 the Nunavut surface rights tribunal. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The certainty created by the act will encourage
					 investment. These institutions will ensure that residents of Nunavut have a say
					 in decisions about the use of water resources, the deposit of wastes and access
					 to lands throughout the territory. Their role will be to balance the interests
					 of many stakeholders while ensuring protection of the fragile Arctic
					 environment. They will operate with fairness, openness and integrity based on
					 known and consistent rules.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preliminary versions of the Nunavut water Board and
					 Nunavut surface rights tribunal were created under the authority of the Nunavut
					 land claims agreement. The agreement requires the government to set out by
					 statute the powers and duties of the two institutions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By way of background, the members of the Nunavut water
					 board and Nunavut surface rights tribunal were appointed in 1996. This was a
					 requirement of the Nunavut land claims agreement and the institutions are now
					 exercising all the powers and duties described in the agreement. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the absence of legislation is contributing to
					 a great deal of uncertainty in Nunavut. This legislative void is a major
					 drawback that must be addressed. For example, concerns have been expressed in
					 Nunavut about the appropriateness of the water licence issued to the capital
					 city of Iqaluit. Officials at the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern
					 Development in Iqaluit have found the licence to be difficult to enforce, a
					 problem that can be traced to the lack of ground rules setting out the
					 jurisdiction of the Nunavut water board. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uncertainty about surface rights is a challenge faced
					 by all stakeholders in Nunavut. Hon. members are well aware of the mining boom
					 that is taking place north of 60. Several mines have recently opened and
					 hundreds of prospectors are now combing the north for new mineral
					 plays.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-33 would ensure that Nunavut has water and
					 surface rights management regimes similar to those that exist in other
					 jurisdictions in Canada. At the same time, it addresses the requirement in
					 article 6 of the Nunavut land claims agreement for the government to name a
					 person or fund to assume liability for damage to wildlife caused by shipping
					 activities. This has not yet been done which could put the federal government
					 at risk for damages in the event of a marine accident.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-33 would provide clear mandates for the water
					 board and surface rights tribunal and certainty for all stakeholders in
					 Nunavut; certainty of access for the resource industries, certainty in water
					 licensing processes and certainty for members of the water board and the
					 surface rights tribunal whose decisions in the absence of legislation, which is
					 extremely important to bring to light, are open to legal challenge at any time.
					 This is particularly true of the water board.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Nunavut land claims agreement does not adequately
					 describe the water management regime for the settlement area. It is silent on
					 the issue of enforcement which is an integral part of any water management
					 regime. As well, there is a lack of certainty respecting the jurisdiction of
					 the new board in relation to the existing Northwest Territories Water
					 Board.</p>


	<A NAME="T1625"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1625"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1630"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1620"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1625)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-33 would fill a legal and regulatory void by
					 fully describing the powers of the Nunavut water board. I would like to quickly
					 review those powers for hon. members who are here in this place and for those
					 who are in Nunavut and across the country, so they will better understand the
					 importance of this piece of legislation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The board will have responsibilities and powers
					 equivalent to those of the Northwest Territories Water Board, which means
					 essentially the authority to licence the use of water and the deposit of
					 wastes. Licences will not be required to use water for domestic purposes or for
					 emergency purposes, such as fighting fires or controlling floods.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-33 also sets out clear rules for granting,
					 renewing, amending or cancelling water use licences. These rules will provide
					 greater certainty for industry and ensure the protection of the eastern Arctic
					 environment. It will also ensure that the interests of all water users are
					 taken into account in the licensing process. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Nunavut water board will be given a broad range of
					 powers to fulfill its mandate, including the authority to consult the public on
					 any and all licence applications. The board will also have the authority to
					 establish strict licence conditions. The maximum proposed penalty for offences
					 is a fine of $100,000, imprisonment for up to one year, or both. This is
					 consistent with similar water management regimes in other parts of Canada.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to inform the House that the water board
					 will have the authority to order compensation for water users who suffer
					 adverse effects as a result of a licensed activity. The board may also require
					 that a licensee make a security deposit with the Department of Indian Affairs
					 and Northern Development.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Bill C-33 would place a great deal of decision
					 making authority in the hands of northerners, and in particular the Inuit of
					 Nunavut, the governor in council would retain the authority to make water
					 management regulations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-33 also sets out the powers, functions,
					 objectives and duties of the Nunavut surface rights tribunal. Unlike the water
					 board, the tribunal is not a licensing body. Its role will be to resolve access
					 disputes between landowners and those who want and need to use the land.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Nunavut land claims agreement has provided
					 certainty of land ownership and paved the way for resource projects and other
					 economic development activities across the eastern Arctic. However, to support
					 economic growth and job creation in Nunavut, we must ensure that processes are
					 in place to allow developers to exercise their subsurface rights in a
					 reasonable and responsible way.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, we must safeguard the interests of
					 those who live on the land. The need for economic growth must be balanced with
					 the rights of landowners to fair and reasonable compensation. It must also be
					 balanced with the rights and desires of the Inuit to protect and preserve their
					 land and the livelihood it supports.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-33 would achieve these objectives. It takes into
					 account the interests of all parties, whether they be government, industry,
					 Inuit organizations or the private individuals themselves. It would establish
					 clear rules for exercising surface access rights on all occupied private lands,
					 including Inuit owned lands throughout the territory of Nunavut. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On occasion, disputes of access will arise between
					 landowners, developers and other interests in Nunavut. Bill C-33 would require
					 the parties to try to negotiate an agreement before turning to the surface
					 rights tribunal. In the event that the two parties could not come to an
					 agreement, the tribunal would have certain powers to resolve the
					 matter.</p>


	<A NAME="T1630"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1630"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1635"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1625"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1630)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These powers are modelled on the regime currently used
					 in the western provinces and in Yukon, and include the establishment of terms
					 and conditions of a right of access to private lands, including Inuit owned
					 lands.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dispute resolution will be much less costly and time
					 consuming than dealing with issues through the courts. Under Bill C-33 the
					 Nunavut surface rights tribunal would be required to deal with applications as
					 informally and expeditiously as possible.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a dispute relates to damage to wildlife, the
					 tribunal would have the authority to determine who was liable and the amount of
					 compensation to be awarded to aboriginal harvesters. Under this proposed
					 legislation an order of the tribunal would be final and binding subject to a
					 review by the Federal Court of Canada on limited grounds, such as bias or lack
					 of procedural fairness.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I noted a moment ago, Bill C-33 also fills a
					 significant void by clarifying who is responsible for damages to wildlife in
					 Nunavut caused by marine transportation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill names the ship source oil pollution fund,
					 which is administered by the Department of Transport, as the fund that would be
					 liable for damages from oil spills. When the damage caused by a ship is not
					 related to an oil spill, the shipowner is named as the person with primary
					 liability. The Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development would have
					 secondary liability only when all other sources of liability had been
					 exhausted.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a number of other elements of the proposed
					 legislation that I would like to bring to the attention of hon. members. First,
					 the powers and authority of the two Nunavut institutions will be extended to
					 the entire territory rather than just Nunavut settlement lands.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is critical that we have uniform regimes for water
					 management and surface access rights throughout Nunavut. This will be more cost
					 effective, consistent and easier to manage than a patchwork of regimes and will
					 reinforce the certainty needed for economic growth and environmental
					 protection.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-33 would also ensure accountability of the water
					 board to elected officials for major decisions regarding water licences. Such
					 decisions can have significant impacts on the environment, the economy and the
					 quality of life in a community. It is absolutely essential that an appointed
					 water board be accountable for these major decisions to officials elected by
					 the public. This accountability to the minister also exists in the Northwest
					 Territories Waters Act and its predecessor, the Northern Inland Waters
					 Act.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Initially, the water board will be accountable to the
					 Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development. In the government here and
					 I am sure in the north, it is our hope and we anticipate that over time the
					 water management function will be transferred to the new territorial
					 government, along with the political accountability of the Nunavut water board.
					 This will further strengthen local decision making and accountability in
					 Nunavut.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some hon. members may recall that this is not the first
					 time this proposed legislation has been tabled in the House. It died on the
					 order paper on two previous occasions. The same hon. members will also be aware
					 that a tremendous amount of work has gone into developing Bill C-33 as we see
					 it today.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact Bill C-33 contains more than 100 amendments to
					 the government's first legislative proposals related to the Nunavut water board
					 and the Nunavut surface rights tribunal. These amendments were developed by the
					 government in co-operation with the stakeholders, particularly Nunavut
					 Tunngavik Incorporated.</p>


	<A NAME="T1635"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1635"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1650"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1630"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1635)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1996, departmental officials have consulted
					 widely on the Nunavut elements of the legislation. Although agreement was not
					 possible on all issues, the bill reflects an excellent balancing of interests
					 and is consistent with the Nunavut land claims agreement.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-33 is an important step toward providing the
					 basic legislative framework that needs to be in place for any jurisdiction. It
					 will establish clear rules that will not only protect our precious water
					 resources, but also encourage economic development in a part of Canada where
					 jobs are at a premium.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am therefore seeking the support of all hon. members
					 on both sides of the House to refer the bill to committee for review. I look
					 forward to listening to members on all sides speak to a void that has been a
					 long time coming to the House, and that is the legislation that we speak of
					 today, Bill C-33.</p>

					 (Saskatoon--Wanuskewin, Canadian Alliance): </b>

	Madam Speaker, it is an honour and a privilege to speak
					 in respect of Bill C-33. My party will be watching the bill very closely in
					 committee. We will scrutinize and vigorously question the witnesses to see if
					 it is workable. We hope it is for the people of Nunavut.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister mentioned that at least on the surface the
					 bill would implement the provisions of the 1993 Nunavut land claims agreement
					 relating to the management of waters and the creation of a surface rights
					 tribunal for the territory of Nunavut.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is my understanding the bill is similar to what is
					 operating in the territories and elsewhere in the country. As mentioned,
					 versions of this bill were before the House of Commons in two previous
					 parliaments; in 1993, Bill C-51 and in 1996, Bill C-62.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What could be better than promoting the conservation
					 and utilization of water, as well as waste disposal, through a licensing
					 system, which would be overseen by a board consisting of people from that part
					 of the country?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our party will raise in committee the issues of the
					 powers of the minister, the terms of reference of the board, the length of
					 terms for board members and so on. We notice that the Minister of Indian
					 Affairs and Northern Development maintains the right to appoint and release
					 board members. We do not know if they can have indefinite terms. We probably
					 would want to see some limits in respect of that. We will be pressing that in
					 committee.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister has the power to issue and rescind
					 licences, as well as to expropriate land. There is a lot of power in the hands
					 of the minister. We will want to know exactly what the checks and balances are
					 in respect to that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been told that the arrangement is similar to
					 the arrangement with other territories. We will be looking more closely at this
					 and no doubt there will be amendments to improve it, to add to it and to
					 increase the value of the bill when it comes before committee.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a general principle, the Canadian Alliance endorses
					 efforts to decentralize the decision making process, taking it closer to the
					 people, at local level of government, and allowing them to make decisions that
					 affect in this case their water resources. Our intent will be to ensure that
					 the past concerns about the bill have been addressed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we go back through the <i>Hansard</i> record and the
					 committee discussions and so on, some of those may in fact have been addressed,
					 but other ones that may require further examination.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-33 would amend a portion of the Nunavut Land
					 Act. It is not a secret to anyone that our predecessor name, the Reform Party,
					 expressed concern over some of the financial costs and the duplication of
					 services that were involved in the establishment of Nunavut. It is a known
					 fact, and it is on the record, that Nunavut receives $580 million in annual
					 transfer payments. It is projecting in this fiscal year a $12 million deficit.
					 Nunavut receives federal transfer payments of approximately 90% of the
					 territorial budget.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these matters need to be watched carefully and
					 closely. We believe that if people pay for their own resources through tax
					 dollars and in support their governance, the more they will hold their
					 government accountable because of that vested interest of dollars.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the remoteness of Nunavut, costs of
					 providing a lot of the services are excessive. Some people have criticized
					 this, but fair minded people in the provinces, territories and particularly in
					 the House should ask whether we have too much government in some of these
					 places. We want to be careful and watchful because sometimes there can be over
					 governance, which is not good for any territory or province.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We notice the Nunavut water board will have eight
					 appointed members, plus a chair for a population in the range of 24,000. There
					 is a bureaucracy of some 930 civil service jobs, as set out in the 1992 Coopers
					 and Lybrand report on the establishment of Nunavut, plus 705 public service
					 which were transferred from Yellowknife.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We notice that there will be eight members on the
					 Nunavut water board. We will be questioning whether that is necessary. In
					 comparison, the entire Northwest Territories water board currently consists of
					 four. It can go up to nine, but it is normally four. The Northwest Territories
					 has twice the land and twice the population. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Various groups of people in the north have said they
					 want those additional board members to guarantee representation for different
					 population groups, including the Inuit of Nunavut and the Inuit of northern
					 Quebec. We will have to look carefully at those claims and try to get some
					 sense of whether that is merited.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also a couple of things that have been raised by
					 members of the House thus far and questions will need to be addressed to
					 provide us some assurance. Some have asked if Bill C-33 will affect the water
					 quality and a safe drinking water supply. As we understand it, Bill C-33 refers
					 to water quality, but does not define those water quality standards and
					 regulations. As was mentioned by the minister, they will be developed by the
					 water board.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would like to know what are the parameters for those
					 regulations. Will they be as good as any other regime or place in the country?
					 Hopefully so or better. Will they be similar to the Northwest Territories
					 regulations?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also another important question for the economic
					 development of Nunavut is will regulations be cumbersome and stand in the way
					 of sustainable development? Jobs are an important part in all places,
					 especially in Nunavut. Will these regulations stand in the way of sustainable
					 development? We want to be environmentally sensitive, but there needs to be
					 economic development. Frequently, we have heard that some the regulations in
					 the territories and Yukon do stand in the way of seemingly feasible sustainable
					 projects.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our concern is that we set some parameters. When they
					 set these regulations, the regulations should not hurt the economic opportunity
					 and the development of job opportunities for the people of Nunavut.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A question was raised about the sale of water. We need
					 absolute assurance that, as far as this particular act is concerned, it is a
					 federal jurisdiction. These days there is some controversy around the issue of
					 the sale of bulk water and whether there needs to be some further definition
					 under NAFTA or whatever. We would also want assurances that that is a federal
					 jurisdiction and not something that can be trumped by the Nunavut water
					 board.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another question is does Nunavut have control over
					 coastal and seabed resources? Our understanding is that Bill C-33 deals with
					 freshwater resources and waste water disposal. We need absolute confirmation
					 and assurance that Bill C-33 does not refer to coastal waters or mineral
					 resources on or under the seabed and that the federal government has control
					 over those coastal waters.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In principle, there are caveats in respect of this, but
					 the intent of local governments making decisions on issues that are of a
					 regional or local nature that is supportable by the Alliance Party, but we want
					 it to be cost effective as well. This is one of the caveats we throw in there.
					 We believe in that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is under the purview of the federal bureaucracy,
					 but it may be of a benefit to have it under Nunavut water board. Careful
					 consideration will be given to this in committee. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Alliance Party will scrutinize carefully
					 and vigorously query those who present to the committee, so we can hopefully
					 improve and make this better legislation for the people of Nunavut.</p>

					 (Charlesbourg--Jacques-Cartier, BQ): </b>

	Madam Speaker, I am one those who believe that “what is
					 conceived well is expressed clearly” to which I would add “and briefly”. I
					 shall, therefore, be brief on Bill C-33.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-33, the Nunavut waters and nunavut surface
					 rights tribunal Act, represents no more and no less than the implementation of
					 certain elements of the land claims agreement between the Inuit of Nunavut and
					 the Government of Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill currently before the House is therefore
					 complementary to that historical agreement. The agreement, the treaty per se,
					 was ratified and implemented on July 9, 1993 through the Nunavut Land Claims
					 Agreement Act.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since its creation, the Bloc Quebecois has strongly
					 supported aboriginal land claims. It sees itself as the ally of the first
					 nations of Quebec and of Canada. The favourable position of the Bloc on Bill
					 C-33, which we are discussing today, is part of that positive attitude, one I
					 would describe as reaching out to the first nations--since the Bloc Quebecois
					 favours maximum self management and accountability for the various aboriginal
					 communities. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it unwarranted for us to oppose the quick
					 passage of this bill, because it is consistent with the expectations and
					 objectives of the nations and communities involved, which is, everyone will
					 agree, what matters most.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1996, a similar version of the bill was introduced,
					 the House will recall. It was strongly opposed by the Inuit of
					 Nunavut-Tungavik, because it respected neither the letter nor the spirit of the
					 treaty signed in 1993. The present version of the bill seems, however, to have
					 been corrected and better reflects the aspirations of the Inuit of
					 Nunavut.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to point out at this time that I have
					 certain reservations, which could, however, be addressed more exhaustively at
					 committee stage so as to clarify certain elements of the bill which do not, at
					 least upon initial examination, appear to be fully consistent with the real
					 aspirations of the Inuit.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, I am convinced that, with other committee
					 members, we will find common ground regarding the power of the Minister of
					 Indian Affairs and Northern Development to appoint members to the Nunavut Water
					 Board.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knowing the Liberal government's almost pathological
					 propensity for appointing to key positions individuals closely linked to power,
					 we will need to be on the lookout in order to protect the interests of
					 Nunavut's inhabitants.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I repeat, it will be possible for us to consider the
					 bill in depth and to hear the observations of the groups concerned at committee
					 hearings which, I hope, will begin soon, be constructive and, I also hope, will
					 take place in an atmosphere of co-operation among the various parties
					 represented in the House of Commons, and with the communities that appear
					 before us.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, the Bloc Quebecois is prepared to work
					 with the government and move quickly to meet the entirely legitimate governance
					 aspirations of the Inuit of Nunavut.</p>

					 NDP): </b>

	Madam Speaker, in the spirit of co-operation, I too
					 will try to be brief. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NDP caucus understands that Bill C-33 is omnibus
					 legislation regarding the Nunavut water board and the Nunavut surface rights
					 tribunal and that these organizations are necessary under the 1993 Nunavut Land
					 Claims Agreement. The implementation of Bill C-33 is the fulfillment of the
					 obligation to complete those requirements. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the Minister of Indian Affairs and
					 Northern Development when he said that the bill was an important step forward
					 as we continued to meet our obligations to build capacity in the new territory
					 of Nunavut. It is our hope that these institutions will guarantee that
					 residents of Nunavut will have more say in decisions about the use of water
					 resources, the deposition of wastes and access to lands throughout their
					 territory.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe the roles of the Nunavut water board and the
					 Nunavut surface rights tribunal should have the effect between balancing the
					 interests of the many stakeholders, while ensuring protection of the fragile
					 Arctic environment. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I speak for all members of the Standing
					 Committee on Aboriginal Affairs when I say I look forward to the further input
					 from northerners in this legislation process as the bill goes ahead to the
					 standing committee and ultimately through the various stages of the House of
					 Commons and the Senate.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This piece of legislation has been conveniently divided
					 into two parts for us. We understand that part 1 of the enactment would
					 implement provisions to the agreement related to the management of waters, a
					 very timely and talkable theme and a necessary issue as we recognize the right
					 to self-determination of the people of Nunavut. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also recognize the right for them to control the use
					 of their waters and the many all-encompassing issues that fall under that
					 category, be it development issues, water use for domestic purposes, the
					 deposition of waste and sewage treatment and, as was raised by previous
					 speakers, the well-being of the marine passageways in the event of an oil spill
					 or damage to marine life.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We further note that the new board would have the
					 authority and the power to not only give permits and licences, but also to
					 regulate and to impose fines, if there was a violation, and to order
					 compensation, if compensation becomes necessary due to the misuse of water
					 rights that may have an impact on those downstream.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very sensitive to this issue partly because I
					 spent much of my formative years north of 60 working in Yukon. I can say from
					 experience that the history of water use and land management in our north has
					 been abominable. It has been lacking in many important ways. This is all the
					 more reason why the people of Nunavut, in the rightly negotiating process that
					 led up to the creation of the new territory, asked for, deserved and were
					 adamant that they be in control of the water management and the land surface,
					 land use management in their area. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have seen firsthand some of the cavalier and
					 irresponsible attitudes toward water use in the Yukon Territory. I will give a
					 couple of examples of mistakes that we do not want to see repeated; a legacy of
					 abuse. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My home near Dawson City was built up the Dempster
					 Highway on the road to Inuvik in the heart of the Klondike goldfields. There is
					 a lot of history about the Klondike. A lot of people had a romantic idea about
					 the taking gold from the Klondike, but what they did was dredge the entire
					 area. They were huge dredges as big as this Chamber. They worked their way down
					 the creek beds, the Klondike and all the historic creeks like Bonanza Creek and
					 Hunker Creek, chewing up the riverbeds. They absolutely gobbled it up at one
					 end, processed it in a huge floating dredge and spit it out the back end.
					 </p>


	<A NAME="T1700"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1700"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1705"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1655"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1700)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These dredges worked their way up and down the
					 waterways of Yukon relentlessly for 30 to 50 years. Salmon streams were chewed
					 up in the pursuit of gold by those who did not have a vested interest. They are
					 now long gone but the damage remains.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will give an example from my home province of
					 Manitoba. When it became necessary to divert the Churchill and the Nelson
					 rivers into one massive river system for hydroelectric dam purposes they
					 flooded South Indian Lake in a very cavalier way. There was not a great deal of
					 thought that went into the fact that it was an existing functioning town with a
					 fish marketing co-op. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People had their livelihoods there. They simply
					 backfilled the whole valley and flooded out the town of South Indian Lake. They
					 flooded the tree line 40 feet deep without recognition that when land like that
					 is flooded arsenic, mercury and other toxic material leech from the soil as
					 natural products that exist there. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was another example of water rights and water
					 management practices under our current system that were negligent and
					 abusive.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example comes to mind. I had a job in Yukon
					 going around the Richardson Mountains, the Ogilvie Range and the Tombstone
					 Range picking up fuel depots the American military had left behind. It used to
					 cache aviation gas in huge deposits all over the north. Forty years later many
					 of the barrels had rusted through and all the aviation gas was flowing into the
					 delicate tundra ecosphere. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was an incredibly negligent and cavalier attitude
					 toward water quality in the north. Due to the fact that the area is so massive
					 it seemed that nothing we could do would ever damage it. Now we know
					 different.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last example deals with hydroelectric power. We
					 have examples like Notigi diversion, Kettle Rapids dam, Jenpeg dam, Long
					 Spruce, Waskahigan, Limestone, Conawapa, the James Bay Grande Baleine project
					 and Site C at Fort St. John. All these hydroelectric projects were done with
					 very little environmental impact studies and very little recognition of what
					 occurs downstream. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not blame the people of Nunavut for being adamant
					 that they wish to have more input into water rights and water use. That is more
					 than we saw in Yukon when water rights were under federal jurisdiction. The
					 Yukon territory did not have jurisdiction of its own water rights because it
					 was operated from Ottawa, to no one's interest.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are comfortable that Bill C-33 would do as it is
					 intended, that is to finish the job of the creation of the territory of Nunavut
					 along with the transfer of jurisdictions that goes along with it and the
					 ultimate goal of bringing greater benefits to all communities in the north.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NDP caucus recognizes that the south has benefited
					 greatly from the resources harvested in the north. We welcome any opportunity
					 to recognize that the northern communities and people who live there deserve
					 the right to share in the great wealth and prosperity of the nation largely
					 drawn from the resources in the north.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will be recommending an amendment dealing with the
					 water board's ability to grant licences for water use. The board would be able
					 to renew or cancel licences as well as assign penalties in the case of abuse of
					 water rights. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maximum fine, as contemplated in Bill C-33, is
					 $100,000. Given the ongoing mining boom in the Northwest Territories and in
					 parts of Nunavut and the types of user group that might be affected by it, we
					 find $100,000 to be a paltry amount of money. It is really pin money to a large
					 mining interest that might be in the north. We know what a mining operation can
					 do to the water quality in whatever area it is in.</p>


	<A NAME="T1705"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1705"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1710"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1700"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1705)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There used to be a myth that we could do anything to a
					 river as long as it ran for three kilometres and after three kilometres it
					 would run clear again. We now know that was an absolute misconception, a myth
					 that was created by the user groups that were polluting the rivers. It is just
					 not true. We think that the $100,000 fine is paltry when it comes to any kind
					 of a penalty. Even if it is coupled with the full compensation of those who may
					 be affected downstream, or hunters or fishermen who may lose their livelihood
					 as a result of the irresponsible action, we still think the $100,000 penalty is
					 paltry.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a couple of other things we wish were in Bill
					 C-33. We are going to be seeking to include them at committee stage, but I will
					 register them here.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one thing that comes to mind is that this bill,
					 even though it transfers the rights to make these decisions to the newly
					 founded territory of Nunavut, it does not specifically make any reference to
					 the bulk sale of water. Given that this has become such a timely subject, and
					 that by the minister's own admission the original bill that was introduced has
					 been amended over 100 times to make it more timely and to plug little
					 loopholes, we wish that the bill specifically barred whoever is in charge of
					 water in Nunavut from the bulk sale of water because it contradicts what we in
					 the House of Commons have already decided is in the best interests of
					 Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also wish it were more specific on an issue that
					 will become topical very soon, that is, the ownership of the icebergs which are
					 created by the breaking up of the polar ice cap. I am not talking about the
					 bulk sale of water, but this is something we need to contemplate soon. Are we
					 going to allow foraging or salvaging rights like we do in our shipping lanes
					 within the 200 kilometres Canadian limit? Will we allow people to come into our
					 waters to harvest and salvage floating bulk water? These things need to be
					 contemplated any time we talk about the bulk sale or the management of our
					 precious freshwater resources. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To keep the speech brief, I will simply say that the
					 NDP looks forward to Bill C-33 going to committee. We plan on being active
					 participants at that stage. We look forward to further input from people who
					 actually live in the north and the people of Nunavut. We wish them well as they
					 take this next step toward true independence and charting their own
					 destiny.</p>

					 PC/DR): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak to Bill C-33 which
					 deals with the Nunavut land claims agreement of 1993 and ensuing and enabling
					 legislation from that with regard to the Nunavut water board and the Nunavut
					 surface rights tribunal. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very pleased to see the member for Nunavut in the
					 House today. I would have appreciated her viewpoint on this issue and hopefully
					 we can still get it. I would be very interested to hear her views. I know she
					 will be giving good advice in committee. It will be a good viewpoint from
					 someone who lives there and understands the place and the culture and the
					 impact of this legislation far better than I.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is interesting to note that this legislation has
					 gone through many lives. This is the third round at it. The bill comes from
					 other legislation from previous parliaments. The Nunavut water board has been
					 operational since 1995 and we are playing catch-up six years later to get it
					 implemented into law.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Nunavut water board will consist of nine members
					 appointed by the minister. Half of them will be nominated by the designate in a
					 reorganization. One-quarter of them will be nominated by the territorial
					 minister responsible for renewable resources or other designated territorial
					 ministers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When any board or tribunal is struck, it is important
					 that its members know what they are doing and that there is ultimate
					 accountability. I know government members and opposition members would agree
					 with that as well.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is interesting to note in the bill that adequate
					 public notice will be given of applications to the NWB. Public hearings on
					 applications will be held as the board deems necessary. When one sees that it
					 is when the board deems it necessary, that raises the alarm bells. It should be
					 brought to the attention of the board that it is probably necessary quite a bit
					 of the time. It would not be wise for the board to say that public hearings
					 were unnecessary and shuffle off the applications. It is very wise to have more
					 rather than fewer hearings when people have concerns. They should not just say
					 "By the way there will be a meeting tomorrow night", or whenever. Great
					 distances are involved. It is very important that adequate public notice be
					 given. When the applications are being studied and ruled upon, the board should
					 be keenly aware of how important it is that the process be made absolutely
					 transparent.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Nunavut surface rights tribunal has been
					 operational since 1996 but the legislation will establish that tribunal as
					 required under the Nunavut land claims agreement which took place in 1993.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tribunal will resolve disputes regarding subsurface
					 rights and sand and gravel on Inuit owned land and losses to Inuit from damage
					 to wildlife. I speak here of oil spills for example as they are entirely
					 possible. I think back to the week after I was elected to parliament in the
					 spring of 1989 and the <i>Exxon Valdez</i> crisis and the long term
					 ramifications which occurred from that. This is something we need to deal with
					 seriously and have proactive, organized methods in place to deal with these
					 things before they happen so that when they do occur, we are prepared.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surface rights tribunal also establishes terms and
					 conditions of right to access to Inuit owned lands and can determine liability,
					 and an amount of compensation due to Inuit in case of damage. It is very wise
					 that this be put into place beforehand rather than face crisis management. The
					 September 11 crisis affected all of us. We saw how important it is to be
					 organized and ready for disasters rather than wondering the day one happens
					 what could have been done to deal with it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surface rights tribunal consists of a chairperson
					 plus two to 10 other members appointed by the minister, two of whom must be
					 resident in Nunavut. There will always be an odd number of members on the
					 tribunal and that is very wise. If I had to ask any questions about it in such
					 a vast territory as Nunavut, I would have to ask why only two members would
					 come from there.</p>


	<A NAME="T1710"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1710"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1715"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1705"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1710)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tribunal can only hear applications where an
					 individual has first attempted to negotiate an agreement with the other party.
					 In other words, people cannot go to the tribunal first. This makes sense. In
					 many instances, differences or problems can be worked out. In many respects it
					 is like us as members of parliament. People have tried to work with the
					 Department of Citizenship and Immigration, Revenue Canada, the CCRA,
					 Agriculture Canada or who knows what and they come to us, their members of
					 parliament. They say they are having problems and they need us to facilitate or
					 mediate or who knows all the things we do in our offices. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is what the tribunal is set up to do. It would
					 hear the applications. People would have attempted to solve the situation
					 first, but it was at a stalemate and they would go to that body.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some pros and some cons to the bill. I would
					 like to look at a couple of the positive things and then bring some concerns to
					 the table with the hope that we are able to deal with those more fully in
					 committee.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Nunavut water board and the surface rights tribunal
					 assure the Inuit greater control over the affairs of their region, and what a
					 region it is. It is a huge land mass with a fairly small population. It is
					 concerned about the thing that is probably of most concern to us, or certainly
					 should be as Canadian citizens, water. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the things we have seen over the last couple of
					 years across the country have caused great alarm. Many reserves are having
					 problems with water. It is important for all of us to say that water is
					 essential. We need to make sure that it is as clean and as safe as possible.
					 The bill is good because it gives the Inuit more control over the affairs of
					 their water.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both the water board and the surface rights tribunal
					 would be subject to an annual audit. The water board would be audited by the
					 board's auditor and at the direction of the minister, the auditor general. If
					 the minister thinks there is something of concern, he can pass that on to the
					 auditor general. I do not think we could ever go wrong by asking the auditor
					 general to step in and ensure that the books are above board. That is a good
					 step.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surface rights tribunal will be audited
					 automatically by the auditor general. Again we think that is a good thing. I am
					 sure the tribunal and the water board themselves know there is safety in being
					 audited by someone. They know they are clean, absolutely above board and under
					 the protection of that. They can operate with a clean conscience and a clean
					 bill of health because they have been given the okay and that is a very good
					 feeling for everyone. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legislation improves on its predecessor, Bill C-62
					 in its last incarnation, by removing the $20 million limit of liability for
					 developers. This change was supported by the Inuit groups. Twenty million
					 dollars sounds like quite a pile of cash to me and probably to most of us in
					 the House, but think of the <i>Exxon Valdez</i>. I do not know what the cleanup
					 costs were for that, but in that kind of enormous cleanup operation, $20
					 million liability is not a lot. It certainly could be higher. The $20 million
					 limit was removed from the bill and that is a good thing. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the concerns that we do have is the whole idea
					 of ministerial power. It is a pity to have to say it but politics enter
					 everything in life. It is not just here in the political arena, but we see so
					 much of it in community groups, churches, schools and businesses. It does not
					 matter what it is, but politics creep into everything and that is the way it
					 is. We want to make sure that the minister puts people on the board because of
					 merit and merit alone, not just because they were a candidate or gave money or
					 whatever. That is good advice for all of us, just to make sure the minister
					 does not have too much power. He appoints the boards and can dismiss members
					 after consulting with designated Inuit organizations. </p>


	<A NAME="T1715"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1715"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1720"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1710"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1715)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know of an organization that will probably be doing
					 some consultation over the next short while. It will, it is sad to say, consist
					 of one phone call and then it will be said that consultation took place. There
					 is probably nothing healthy about that. The minister needs to make sure that he
					 or she, or whoever the minister will be over the long haul in this business of
					 consulting, puts some parameters in place and makes sure that real consultation
					 takes place.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issuance, amendment, renewal and cancellation of
					 licences are subject to the approval of the minister. We should make sure that
					 there is not too much power attached to the minister. If we listen with only
					 one ear and not the other, whoever the stakeholder is, we may get a skewed view
					 of things.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like every good parent, teacher, or manager we should
					 listen to all sides and then step back for a short while and weigh the
					 consequences before a decision is made. We would encourage the minister to do
					 that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have concerns that the federal government is trying
					 to manage from afar. There are incredible distances in Canada. It is a very
					 long way from here to the west and from here to the north. Although we are
					 unbelievably connected and wired, this is still a huge country. We need to be
					 careful not to make Ottawa the centre, the be-all and end-all. That would
					 probably not be wise.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is the idea of having a minimum of two members
					 appointed from Nunavut to the surface rights tribunal. It would be wiser to
					 make sure that there are more than that because people at the ground level
					 always know far more about what is going on. The more distant the level of
					 government, the more distant the actual intimate knowledge of
					 issues.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best example is the city council and the aldermen
					 of my city of Edmonton. They get many more phone calls at home if sewers back
					 up than I do as a federal legislator, because constituents know their aldermen.
					 They know me too but I cannot do anything about the sewers. They will talk to
					 me about taxes or whatever. The more distant the level of government, the more
					 distant the personal communication. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure my colleague from Nunavut would agree that it
					 would be very wise to have as many people as possible operating at ground level
					 in Nunavut. Given that surface rights and land access issues are very important
					 to Canada's north, the majority of the tribunal should be individuals who
					 reside in and fully understand the issues of Nunavut. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not claim to understand the issues there. I hope
					 to learn a whole lot more about them. I would be very nervous if I had to tell
					 them that I was from the government, just appointed to the surface rights
					 tribunal, and there to help. They may be a little nervous about anyone coming
					 in with that kind of attitude. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should make sure that the tribunal works on a
					 practical basis. It should not be a group that is set up to just have meetings.
					 If there is supposed to be a dispute settling mechanism, let the tribunal do it
					 and do it well.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also have concerns regarding the streamlining of
					 regulatory processes. Are they needed? Are they too slow? Are they too
					 complicated? We need to make sure when we address this issue in committee that
					 those are the things we look at and that it is the best tribunal it can
					 possibly be. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our position is that we would support the bill at
					 second reading. I look forward to getting it into committee. I am hoping that
					 we are able to hear from some excellent witnesses because all of us want to
					 learn more about it. If this place is about making practical legislation so
					 that people's lives are a little easier and better at the ground level in terms
					 of claims, damages, liability or loss, those are the things we need to look at
					 in a practical vein.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This piece of legislation seems fairly lengthy and
					 substantial. However there are some good things in it. I have reiterated some
					 of the positives about it and some of the concerns about it. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member for Nunavut should be able to tell us from

					 for Nunavut a hint. Even though there are good things in the legislation, I am
					 sure there are concerns held by her family members, her constituents and
					 stakeholders, whether they are private landowners, have businesses or operate
					 on crown land. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the issues are addressed that to me is practical.
					 I do not want to hear just one side of the story. I want to hear from her, not
					 just in the House but also in committee, what some of the positive things are.
					 I want her to tell us in her own words and from practical experience some of
					 her concerns.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are always two sides to every story and I would
					 be pleased to hear some of her concerns or hesitancies because we want to get
					 them fixed. I am sure the minister wants to get them fixed as well. If she has
					 waited this long, I am sure that like the rest of us she wants to get it right.
					 I would love to hear her concerns about it.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, we are dealing with Nunavut and I am sure

					 about it. Nunavut is an area that has had profound troubles for some time. It
					 is an area with some 24,000 people. It has an extraordinarily high suicide
					 rate. Sexual abuse rates are very high and it has unemployment rates of 20% to
					 40%. Federal moneys are being put in at a rate of about $24,000 per
					 person.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What solutions should have been put in the bill to

					 of Nunavut have been suffering for far too long?</p>

					 Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I know I do not have time to address
					 everything today because of time constraints, but I am very honoured to be able
					 to speak to Bill C-33, the Nunavut Waters and Nunavut Surface Rights Tribunal
					 Act.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On April 1, 1999, the map of Canada was redrawn for the
					 first time in 50 years. I was here when that happened and I am very proud to be
					 part of that history. I see this act as another stepping stone in achieving
					 what we wanted to achieve.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Inuit of the Eastern Arctic effectively achieved a
					 public government framework in that legislation. As a result we have more
					 opportunities for employment, for establishing new businesses, for social
					 development and for protecting the ways of the past while we embrace what the
					 new economy has to offer. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I assure the House that these are exciting times for
					 the people of Nunavut but they are also very challenging times. We have many
					 barriers standing in the way of economic growth and self-sufficiency in
					 Nunavut. As well, a great deal of work must be done to ensure that the new
					 territory has the legislative and regulatory framework needed to function
					 effectively.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-33 will provide an important part of that
					 framework. As legislators we must do our part to support the new territory by
					 dealing with the proposed legislation as quickly as possible. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon. members have been informed that Bill C-33 will
					 establish in statute the powers, duties and functions of the Nunavut water
					 board and the Nunavut surface rights tribunal. The former will be a
					 quasi-judicial body that will license water uses and the deposits of waste in
					 Nunavut. The surface rights tribunal will resolve disputes that may occur
					 between land owners and those who need access to the land.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both of these are institutions of public administration
					 arising out of the Nunavut land claims agreement, instruments of good and
					 efficient government across the entire territory. They will ensure uniformity
					 and certainty throughout Nunavut on issues related to resource
					 management.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainty is a theme that will run throughout my
					 remarks today, because it will be perhaps the single most important outcome of
					 the Nunavut elements of Bill C-33. By providing the legislative underpinnings
					 for the Nunavut water board and the Nunavut surface rights tribunal, Bill C-33
					 will provide certainty that the decisions made by these institutions have a
					 solid basis in law.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the Nunavut water board wrote to a previous
					 minister of Indian affairs and northern development some time ago to request
					 passage of legislation to address the current ambiguities about its role and
					 powers--</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said: Mr. Speaker, the recent attack on the United
					 States has focused a lot of attention in the past two weeks on extremist
					 governments that support international terrorism. The U.S. state department
					 lists seven countries as supporting terrorism and that list includes
					 Sudan.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sudan has offered safe haven to members of various
					 groups, including associates of Osama bin Laden's al-Qaeda organization. Bin
					 Laden himself received safe haven in Sudan from 1991 to 1996. Together he and
					 the government entered into numerous mutually lucrative enterprises in
					 construction, banking and agriculture. He also developed the elaborate
					 terrorist training bases in the country with the government's thorough
					 knowledge. Even though bin Laden is no longer based in Sudan, U.S. officials
					 say they think he still has backers and financial support there.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sudan's role in promoting international terrorism
					 became clear during the trial this year of terrorists accused of bombing
					 American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998 in which 224 people were
					 killed and thousands were injured. A detailed picture emerged of the national
					 Islamic front regime's support for and financial interactions with Osama bin
					 Laden and al-Qaeda.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This support of terrorism by the national Islamic front
					 goes back at least as far as 1993 when the regime was directly implicated in
					 the previous attack on the World Trade Centre and in foiled plots to bomb other
					 targets in New York.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I raise this issue of the Sudanese government's support
					 of international terrorism because it is relevant to the motion before us
					 today. This regime's supporters of international terrorism are themselves
					 practising terrorism toward their own citizens. The same brutal disregard for
					 human life and civil society that is found in the minds of terrorists like bin
					 Laden is the kind of brutal mindset that we encounter in the current regime in
					 Sudan as it prosecutes its civil war. The regime has declared, in their words,
					 a jihad against the people of southern Sudan, including civilians, in the same
					 way that in the past it has supported a jihad against the United
					 States.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To illustrate how civilians are being targeted by the
					 government, let us consider its bombing methods. The air strikes by the
					 government of Sudan consist of massive shrapnel loaded barrel bombs being
					 rolled out the back cargo doors of Antonov cargo planes flying at very high
					 altitudes. They are without anything approaching the precision that would be
					 needed to strike directly at opposition military assets. The only purpose of
					 these crude but immensely destructive barrel bombs is civilian destruction and
					 terror.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is impossible for me or for most Canadians to fully
					 grasp the magnitude of the agony, destruction and devastation that has existed
					 in Sudan for a number of years now. U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell told
					 congress last spring that “there is perhaps no greater tragedy on the face of
					 the earth than Sudan”. Numerous studies and reports have illustrated what
					 Powell was talking about. For example, an exhaustive study by the U.S.
					 committee on refugees showed that civil war and famine in Sudan have displaced
					 some 4 million persons and have resulted in the death of over 1.9 million
					 persons since 1983. Since that study was completed, the numbers have risen to 2
					 million dead and over 5 million people displaced. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devastation to human lives in Sudan has been
					 occurring in the context of a civil war that has ravaged that country since
					 1983. The extremist national Islamic front regime in Khartoum militarily
					 deposed an elected government in 1989. This extremist regime has waged a
					 continuous and brutal war against the people of southern Sudan and other
					 marginalized areas. It is not its military attacks against opposition troops
					 that we are talking about today, but its deliberate attacks against the
					 civilian population in southern Sudan.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me repeat that the government of Sudan has targeted
					 civilians on a massive scale in its prosecution of the war. The national
					 Islamic front is engaged in atrocities in a very systematic way. It is using
					 forced starvation and is systematically bombing hospitals, churches and other
					 religious centres in the south, the east and also in the Nuba Mountains. It
					 denies food aid to starving people as a weapon of war and it is abetting trade
					 in human slavery by its militias.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These human rights abuses are neither wild rumours nor
					 flimsy accusations. They have been systematically documented and reported by UN
					 special rapporteurs, the U.S. state department, human rights organizations,
					 journalists from Europe and North America and Christian humanitarian groups
					 including the Vatican.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians as well, among them members of parliament,
					 representatives of NGOs and representatives of church organizations, have
					 firsthand knowledge of the situation in Sudan and have confirmed what others
					 are saying about the despicable horrors there.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have introduced the motion on Sudan, which you read
					 previously, Mr. Speaker, and I will read it again for the sake of our viewing
					 audience and for all of us. It states:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right">
</td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>That,
						  in the opinion of this House, the government should: (a) condemn the Sudanese
						  regime for the recent attacks on civilian populations and humanitarian agencies
						  working in Southern Sudan and its denial of urgent humanitarian assistance to
						  specific needy civilian populations; (b) review its policies and relationship
						  with the present regime in Khartoum; and (c) make it clear that the
						  continuation of such crimes against humanity against identifiable groups of
						  people constitutes genocide, and that these abuses must end
						  immediately.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the text of the motion I refer to the human rights
					 violations that I mentioned earlier as genocide. One might say that is awfully
					 strong language, and I believe it is, but it is quite well documented. Various
					 authorities that are the on record, experts on Sudan and others, are using that
					 precise term to describe what is going on there.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Sudan, the Arab rulers in the north, with racism as
					 a key motivating factor, are targeting the black African populations in the
					 south for mass destruction. Tribes like the Dinka and the Nuer are being
					 targeted, as are the various people groups in the Nuba Mountains.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To look at this more closely, let us begin by defining
					 genocide because I know members here may have a concern that the language is
					 too strong. In fact we find the relevant definition comes from the 1948 United
					 Nations convention on the prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide.
					 The document states:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>In the present Convention, genocide
						  means any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or
						  in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group as such:</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right">
</td>
<td><small>(a)
						  Killing members of the group;</small></td>

</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right">

<td><small>(b)
						  Causing serious bodily harm or mental harm to members of the group;</small></td>

</table>
</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right">
</td>
<td><small>(c)
						  Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring
						  about physical destruction, in whole or in part;--</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to this UN definition, very clearly what is
					 happening in Sudan is indeed genocide. Those are not my words. Black Africans
					 are being targeted by the Arab government, which is killing them, terrorizing
					 them, in other words constituting mental harm as understood by the UN
					 convention, and keeping them from humanitarian aid, which has caused massive
					 numbers of deaths.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly the U.S. house of representatives has
					 decisively concluded that the national Islamic front government in Sudan is
					 guilty of genocide. On June 15, 1999, and I have here on my desk the House
					 concurred resolution No. 75, the resolution deliberately and repeatedly uses
					 the term genocide to describe the activities of the Sudanese regime. That
					 resolution passed in the house of representatives in the U.S. by a stunning
					 margin of 415 to 1. If we could only get a motion with that kind of
					 overwhelming support passed in the House of Commons in Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the resolution we find the following kinds of
					 statements which are repeated throughout the resolution:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right">
</td>
<td><small>--the
						  National Islamic Front (NIF) government's war policy in southern Sudan, the
						  Nuba Mountains and the Ingessena Hills has brought untold suffering to innocent
						  civilians and is threatening the very survival of a whole generation of
						  Southern Sudanese;--</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right">
</td>
<td><small>--the
						  National Islamic Front government is deliberately and systematically committing

</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right">
</td>
<td><small>--the
						  Congress (1) strongly condemns the National Islamic Front government for its
						  genocidal war in southern Sudan--</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This resolution, so overwhelmingly passed in the house
					 of representatives in the U.S., after it heard exhaustive testimony from NGOs
					 and officials in the U.S. state department, states the belief that the terms of
					 the definition of genocide laid down in the UN convention on the prevention and
					 punishment of the crime of genocide have been met and that this really is
					 genocide in the case of Sudan.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, a UN research agency has made a
					 significant contribution to the issue of genocide in Sudan. The UN Research
					 Institute for Social Development recently released a paper entitled "Race,
					 Discrimination, Slavery and Citizenship in the Afro-Arab Borderlands". The
					 paper's release was timed to coincide with the UN conference on racism in
					 Durban, South Africa. Sudan and Mauritania were singled out for practising
					 slavery and racial discrimination in a study of countries on the Afro-Arab
					 borderlands.</p>


	<A NAME="T1740"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1740"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1745"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1735"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1740)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The paper states that possibly nowhere in the Afro-Arab
					 borderlands is the problem of race, class and citizenship in such a high state
					 of tension between Arabs and Africans or possibly Arabized Africans and
					 Africans as in the Sudan and Mauritania.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The study comments that fundamentalist Islam and Arab
					 fanaticism play a very important role in this tension. In many accounts of the
					 war in Sudan the factor of racism has not often been taken sufficiently into
					 account. Until that factor is understood, little progress will be made in the
					 direction of peace negotiations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This UN study is on racism, not genocide, but the case
					 for using the term genocide is not complicated. It has been made by many
					 agencies and organizations and the U.S. house of representatives. As the UN has
					 confirmed, the national Islamic front is targeting populations based on their
					 race. Second, they are targeting civilians rather than keeping to military
					 targets. Third, they will go on bombing and causing mass starvation for the
					 mass destruction of these groups.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very briefly I will touch on something of which I think
					 we should be aware. We do have differences within the House and maybe even
					 among people speaking to the resolution today and possibly even the seconder of
					 the motion. It has to do with a Canadian connection. I think it needs to be
					 noted at this point with respect to these crimes that occur and what some have
					 termed and authorities have indicated is genocide in Sudan. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is common knowledge that the government of Sudan is
					 financing its war against the populations in the south with profits from the
					 oil industry in Sudan. An oil consortium exists in Sudan in which the Sudanese
					 government has a 5% stake. Malaysia is involved, China is involved and a
					 Canadian company, Talisman Energy of Canada, has a 25% stake. This means that a
					 Canadian company is responsible, we could say, and I do not know how anybody
					 could deny it, for large amounts of money from oil revenues flowing to the
					 National Islamic Front and indirectly then of course to the genocidal war
					 machine.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some have argued that if a Canadian company does not
					 partner with this corrupt regime in oil development then another oil company
					 would do it anyway so it might as well be a Canadian company. I personally
					 believe, and there are others who would definitely be of this view, that it is
					 a pretext for moral irresponsibility. If Osama bin Laden is making money from
					 participating in an agricultural consortium in Afghanistan, would we find it
					 acceptable for a Canadian company to be operating in Afghanistan as a part of
					 that consortium? We would say obviously not. The difference is that in one case
					 the blood of black Africans is flowing while in the other case American lives
					 have been lost. We need to be consistent. These are people of the human race.
					 They have a different skin colour, but they are precious people and people who
					 deserve the right of protection in basic human rights as well. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to Talisman's assistance in funding
					 genocide, it has been proven that the Sudanese government is using a scorched
					 earth policy toward civilian populations living near the oil fields so that
					 they are cleared out for the work of this oil production, so that with respect
					 to the Canadian company Talisman's presence there, it has contributed directly
					 to the deaths of many Sudanese in these areas.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Talisman went to Sudan it was fully briefed on the
					 civil war and asked the Sudanese government for protection for its oil fields.
					 It had to have realized that it was in effect asking the government to kill to
					 protect it, to kill if it came to that, on its behalf in these regions.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In its public relations efforts, yes indeed, Talisman
					 has been shown to put some money into some things and so on. However, I would
					 still insist and I would press them and Dr. James Buckee: I think that for the
					 most part there is not the conscience that ought to be shown. They are bereft
					 of conscience for the most part. We need to have something of a desire to
					 participate to alleviate the ills and some of the suffering of this part of the
					 human family.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talisman has made some token gestures of social
					 spending to justify its presence in the country. However, most people have seen
					 through that. Even Lloyd Axworthy, the former foreign affairs minister,
					 acknowledged that on CBC radio after leaving politics. He said of Talisman that
					 it has not lived up to its obligations and called the company's behaviour
					 deplorable.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latest disgraceful display came this week when
					 Talisman spokesman David Mann was quoted as saying in the <i>National Post</i>
					 that the U.S. might not remove Talisman from the New York Stock Exchange in the
					 near future and that talks between the Sudan and the U.S. government show that
					 Talisman's policy of constructive engagement is in fact working. That is
					 complete nonsense. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also want to point out that $57.3 million of Canadian
					 money has been invested in Talisman by way of the Canada pension plan. It is at
					 arm's length, but nevertheless our moneys are being invested in that. In
					 closing, I simply feel that something significant needs to be done.</p>

					 (Etobicoke--Lakeshore, Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, often there are subjects addressed in the
					 House that are very difficult to debate because of their content and because
					 they affect the lives of human beings. Motion No. 246 is such a motion.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to commend my colleague across the way who has
					 put this motion on the floor of the House because of the content of the issue
					 that he is raising in order to ensure that we discuss this and continue to
					 discuss Sudan.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The civil war in Sudan is, without a doubt, one of the
					 ugliest conflicts festering in the world. The simple rendition of statistics
					 cannot begin to depict the misery that has been visited upon the people of
					 Sudan. The truly tragic aspect of this war in common with most other
					 contemporary conflicts is that civilians are the main victims.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The roots of this conflict run deep. Some say they go
					 back centuries. As with many conflicts spanning generations, there are
					 emotional scars that make dialogue with those who wish to promote peace a
					 fragile process.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is little doubt that the government of Sudan has
					 waged this war in a manner that deserves international condemnation. According
					 to the United Nations, nearly two million people have died since 1983 and over
					 four million have been displaced from their homes. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. member for Saskatoon--Wanuskewin refers in his
					 resolution to attacks on civilian populations. He also referred to the denial
					 of urgent humanitarian assistance to specific civilian populations. We believe
					 the hon. member has appropriately identified the Sudanese government actions as
					 being worthy of harsh international criticism.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a conflict of this dimension, there are no easy
					 answers. The sad fact is that on both sides, rhetoric has taken the place of a
					 genuine commitment to negotiate and compromise. The international community has
					 heard both sides in this conflict repeat over and over again that the war
					 cannot be won militarily and yet both sides continue to fight as though this
					 was their only strategy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basis of Canada's Sudan policy is support for a
					 negotiated settlement to the conflict. Let us be clear. Canada is saying that
					 peace is the only way of addressing the humanitarian and human rights crisis in
					 Sudan. Peace has to be durable and the only way for a peace settlement to be
					 durable is for it to be negotiated in good faith by the parties to the
					 conflict.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is one of the key points that causes us not to be
					 able to support the specifics of the motion. Both sides have committed offences
					 in this war. Both sides have used much needed humanitarian aid as a weapon.
					 Both sides acknowledge that the war cannot be won by military victories, but
					 both sides continue to pursue the war with vigour at a very considerable cost
					 to other responsibilities to their constituents. If Canada's Sudan policy is
					 based on supporting a negotiated settlement, we cannot then single out just one
					 party to the conflict for condemnation. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada has taken a number of measures. Arms sales from
					 Canada have been banned since 1992. Bilateral development assistance has been
					 terminated, though not humanitarian aid targeted at suffering individuals
					 continue but that aid is not channelled through government conduits. Canada
					 does not promote trade with Sudan. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To date in 2001 the Canadian International Development
					 Agency has provided $4.2 million in food aid to residents of Sudan, as well as
					 $2.7 million in other humanitarian assistance.</p>


	<A NAME="T1750"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1750"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1755"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1745"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1750)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1990 CIDA has provided well over $100 million in
					 such assistance through the UN's Operation Lifeline Sudan and the Red Cross.
					 Since 1999 CIDA has committed over $2 million to peace related projects for
					 Sudan, as well as $300,000 for the peace talks secretariat. We are involved in
					 peace talks, in that negotiated peace in Sudan.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada is working with many other countries. A regional
					 organization in the Horn of Africa, the inter-governmental authority for
					 development, known by its acronym IGAD, has taken responsibility for managing
					 the peace process in Sudan. It has successfully negotiated the declaration of
					 principles, a document that outlines the basis from which negotiations can be
					 staged. This is, by the way, the only document of this type recognized by the
					 major parties to the conflict.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of donor countries have formed the IPF, which
					 is the IGAD partners forum, to support the peace process. Canada is involved
					 there both financially and diplomatically. There is strength in numbers and
					 strength in commonality of purpose. The motion before us would isolate us from
					 the concerted position of our partners and prevent us from playing an effective
					 role in support of the peace process.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another difficulty with the resolution concerns its use
					 of the term genocide, although I know my colleague was very specific in his
					 explanation. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must sympathize with the motion of the hon. member
					 but we realize that we must not let emotions that are legitimately generated by
					 this grisly conflict obscure our real goal. Our real goal is peace. Our real
					 goal is to assist the process. Our real goal is to ensure that the peace
					 process in Sudan continues and that there is some alleviation to the situation
					 for the people of Sudan. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am in empathy and I do support a number of the
					 concerns expressed by my hon. colleague but I think it is important to put the
					 Canadian perspective on the agenda.</p>

					 la-Chaudière, BQ): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I rise in the debate, but I point out
					 right off that I am no expert in the matter. I wish to express here the opinion
					 of our critic, the hon. member for Mercier, who is out of the country, as well
					 as that of my party, which is that there can be no military solution to the war
					 in Sudan, except through the annihilation of the people of the
					 south.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member said “Let us stop funding this war and put
					 our weight behind the peace plan of the Intergovernmental Authority on
					 Development. First, the Special Economic Measures Act must be amended to give
					 the government the power to act and the credibility it needs to advance the
					 peace process”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I listened carefully to the member who proposed the
					 motion before us, and he touched on a number of important points. I
					 congratulate him on introducing the motion in the House, because the situation
					 in the Sudan is really untenable. I thank him as well for putting this issue
					 before all members.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps when he introduced the motion, he did not
					 suspect it would be so relevant. I clearly understood the presentation of the
					 specific context, on the subject of terrorism. This motion is really relevant,
					 and I congratulate him on it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I regret he did not get the unanimous support
					 of the House to have the motion be a votable item. It is all very well to
					 debate in the House, but if the motions are not votable, how can we identify
					 the opinion of the various parties here? Personally I gave the Bloc's approval
					 for it to be votable.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have, however, some reservation with respect to the
					 word “genocide”. We must rely on the reports coming out of the UN commission on
					 human rights. I also noted that the American congress voted 415 to 1 to condemn
					 the Sudanese regime's continual human rights violations, its support for
					 terrorism and its participation in a genocide. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the reports by the Canadian Department of Foreign
					 Affairs, the word genocide was never used. I am maintaining a degree of
					 reservation on it therefore, although it is fairly obvious that what is
					 happening at this time is that one group has assumed a dominant position. The
					 group in the south is placed in a virtually untenable situation. I believe that
					 it might be advisable to again look into the use of the word genocide, but I
					 have reservations about using it because the reports we have date back a few
					 months.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. member has merit in presenting a motion that
					 criticizes, perhaps we should not go so far as to use the word condemn,
					 Canada's lack of any real position.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is easy to take refuge behind a multilateral
					 commission, as the hon. member has just done, but if no actions are forthcoming
					 as a result, this comes down finally to tolerating a situation in which human
					 beings, civilian populations, are being killed and attacked in all manner of
					 ways.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion, this is position that is hard to
					 sustain. I would prefer to address the position of the Government of Canada.
					 Not to go too far back in time, I have read in the reports that the former
					 Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Axworthy, whom we can now name because he is
					 no longer in parliament, said the following on October 26, 1999:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small> If it becomes evident that its
						  activities are exacerbating the conflict in Sudan, or resulting in violations
						  of human rights or humanitarian law, the Government of Canada might consider
						  applying economic and trade restrictions under the Export and Import Permits
						  Act, and the Special Economic Measures Act, or other sanctions.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I neglected to clarify that this was in connection with
					 the role of Talisman, the oil consortium, which is now effectively financing
					 the war and the present Sudanese government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until then, both sides were more or less equal. The war
					 went on, and they had no funding. But with the economic upturn, 25% of the
					 government's income now comes from oil revenues. This, then, is the money that
					 is being used to continue the war between the government and the other
					 community in the south. There is, therefore, a very direct link.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three weeks after Mr. Axworthy's statement, the Office
					 of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights published a report.
					 Minister Axworthy responded that he was deeply troubled by the
					 report.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He decided to send two people to Sudan, Senator Wilson,
					 I think she can be named, and John Harker, to study the impact of oil related
					 activities on human rights violations and on the intensification of the war.
					 The Harker report was presented in February 2000 and its conclusions were in
					 line with the previous reports.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Questioned again, the Minister of Foreign Affairs at
					 the time, Mr. Axworthy, responded that he would take no action against Talisman
					 or Sudan. He explained that there was no legislation that would allow the
					 Government of Canada to act. The Export and Import Permits Act was not
					 applicable in the case of Sudan, and the Special Economic Measures Act could
					 only be used in a multilateral context.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was back in February, 2000, over a year and a half
					 ago. We cannot help but notice that the Government of Canada has taken very
					 little real action, other than simply saying that this requires multilateral
					 action. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not want to needlessly prolong my comments. I know
					 that I have one minute left, and so I would like to conclude. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again, I would like to thank the member for moving
					 this motion. I would have liked to have had a vote on this so that we could
					 take action on this motion, and so that it could be studied by the Standing
					 Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade and presentations could be
					 heard, especially given the new context since September 11. We are now in the
					 context of a war on terrorism and I think that there have been links made to
					 the groups that are currently being targeted.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I too would like to ask for unanimous consent to have
					 this motion made votable.</p>

					 NDP): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I rise on behalf of my colleagues in the
					 New Democratic Party to speak in support of the motion put before the House
					 today by the member for Saskatoon--Wanuskewin.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I commend the hon. member for his ongoing commitment to
					 peace and justice for the people of Sudan. I cannot imagine a situation which
					 cries out more for the world community to act in the name of peace and justice
					 than the terrible tragedy that is occurring in Sudan.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been extensive documentation of the horrors
					 being inflicted by the Sudanese government on the people of southern Sudan. In
					 addition to military attacks, people throughout the region must confront the
					 unimaginable horror of widespread famine. I hope the world food program and
					 others will be in a position to respond to the terrible crisis.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will give members a brief historical background of
					 the situation, as my colleague has done. The extremist national Islamic front
					 regime in Khartoum, which militarily deposed an elected government in 1989, has
					 waged an ongoing savage war and scorched earth policy against the people of
					 southern Sudan and other marginalized areas.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the most recent phase of the civil war more than two
					 million human beings, overwhelmingly civilians, have died in the south. Another
					 five million or so have been uprooted or internally displaced or have fled to
					 neighbouring countries as refugees. There are concerns about slavery and about
					 children being forced into military campaigns. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The war conducted by Khartoum is a war of terror. It
					 has involved widespread indiscriminate bombing of civilian targets throughout
					 the south, the denial of food aid to starving people, the abetting of a ghastly
					 trade in human slavery, and scorched earth warfare in the oil regions located
					 primarily in the south.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must understand clearly that Canada is complicit in
					 these actions to the extent that it allows Talisman Energy Inc. to continue to
					 fund and fuel the terrible assaults on the people of Sudan. John Harker, who
					 conducted an independent inquiry into the situation in Sudan, made it clear
					 that if evidence is made available of a direct link between oil revenues and
					 the war being conducted by the government of Sudan, Canada should take steps to
					 ensure Talisman does not carry on its business in that country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evidence is clear, powerful, overwhelming and
					 compelling, yet the government has done nothing at all. The former foreign
					 affairs minister promised to impose tough sanctions if a link were established.
					 That has not happened. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently we learned that the Canada pension plan, as my
					 colleague from Saskatoon pointed out, has invested some $57.3 million of
					 Canadians' retirement funds in Talisman Energy Inc. I do not believe the vast
					 majority of Canadians would want one cent of their money invested in a company
					 which is contributing to such bloodshed and violence.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only are Talisman's funds contributing to and
					 fuelling the scorched earth policy. We know with certainty that some of
					 Talisman's oil fields at Heglig are being used by the Sudanese military.
					 </p>


	<A NAME="T1810"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1810"><!-- Hour: 6--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1815"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1805"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1810)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few months ago a Canadian-British team returned from
					 Sudan. The team was made up of Georgette Gagnon, a Canadian human rights lawyer
					 and member of the original Harker assessment mission, and John Ryle, a London
					 based Africa specialist and expert on Sudan. These people were in the oil
					 concession areas of southern Sudan for about three weeks in April of this year.
					 I have a copy of their report, but unfortunately I do not have time to read it
					 in the House. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key finding of these two respected observers is
					 unambiguous. Talisman's greater Nile concession airstrips are being used for
					 offensive military purposes, not just occasionally but on a regular basis.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was reinforced by the findings of a Canadian
					 political officer in Khartoum, Nicholas Coghlan, who reported in February of
					 this year:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>For the past month there have been
						  two Hind gunships stationed at Unity Field, and interlocutors told me they had
						  been flying sorties almost every day, taking on large amounts of ammunition,
						  and unloading none. Talisman has indicated to the Government of Sudan its
						  unease at this situation and has sought assurances that the Hinds' presence is
						  purely defensive.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Harker report in January 2000 stated that
					 helicopter gunships and Antonov bombers of the government of Sudan had armed
					 and refuelled at Heglig airstrip and from there had attacked civilians. This is
					 totally incontrovertible.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What more evidence do we need? What more evidence does
					 the government need before it will finally take action? The government says it
					 cannot act under the existing provisions of the Special Economic Measures Act.
					 However it could show moral leadership. It could change the legislation to make
					 it clear to Talisman that Canadians are appalled and ashamed by its conduct in
					 Sudan. It could make it clear that Canadians want Talisman out of that country
					 and do not want it fuelling the war any more.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would be interested to know the position of the
					 member for Saskatoon--Wanuskewin with respect to amending the Special Economic
					 Measures Act to facilitate this important step. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to my question in the House in May of this
					 year the Minister of Foreign Affairs stated that if evidence were brought
					 forward by NGOs that Talisman airfields were being used for offensive purposes
					 by the government of Sudan, the government would take action. How many months
					 ago was that? There has been no action whatsoever.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will point out something that occurred in the United
					 States in last few days. The Bush administration, tragically, has decided to
					 back away from the Sudan peace act. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sudan peace act is an important piece of
					 legislation. It would have required the delisting of shares in Talisman and any
					 other oil corporation operating in Sudan. It was an effective measure. It was
					 adopted by a vote of 422 to 2 or something of that nature. The U.S. senate
					 adopted similar legislation but the Bush administration is now deciding to back
					 off. That is shameful.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately we are seeing the one potentially
					 effective tool to put pressure on Talisman being abandoned by the American
					 administration just as it is lifting sanctions against Pakistan to get it on
					 board in the so-called war against terrorism. The price being paid here is too
					 high.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appeal to the government to abandon its current
					 policy of discussion and constructive engagement with the Sudanese government.
					 It should pursue international measures to hold the government of Sudan
					 accountable for its human rights violations. It should push for strong new
					 legislation and a strengthened Special Economic Measures Act to deal with
					 militarized commerce and hold Canadian companies accountable for contributing
					 to armed conflict. As well, the Canada pension plan investment fund should
					 clearly divest itself of its shares in Talisman.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having heard the eloquent pleas of colleagues in the
					 House such the hon. member from the Bloc Quebecois, I hope the House might be
					 persuaded to give unanimous consent to allowing this important motion to go
					 forward to the foreign affairs committee. I seek unanimous consent of the House
					 to allow that to occur.</p>

					 PC/DR): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I cannot say that it is a pleasure to
					 stand to discuss the situation that we have been discussing this evening. It is
					 a matter that is foreign to us in Canada, the discussion of the brutality and
					 victimization of civilian populations in the Sudan.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I certainly commend the member for
					 Saskatoon--Wanuskewin for bringing the matter to our attention. Just the fact
					 that we are discussing it here helps to improve our awareness of the terrible
					 disaster that is going on there. It is hard for us to even imagine what is
					 happening in those countries.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the last two weeks we have been discussing acts
					 against the civilian population in the form of airplanes crashing into
					 buildings in North America. It has brought us to attention and created a new
					 level of concern. It has changed much of the way we operate and many of the
					 things we took for granted we are no longer able to take for granted. However,
					 these are some of the things that go on in foreign countries such as the
					 situation we are talking about today. It is completely foreign to us how
					 governments and populations can act the way they have in the Sudan.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I commend the previous speakers, especially the last
					 speaker, for the way they have outlined many details of the grievous acts
					 against the populations. There is no question about the brutal tragedy in
					 Sudan.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just read through a resolution from the United States
					 house of representatives that was provided by the member who moved the motion.
					 The resolution outlines a fearful description of the situation there. I will go
					 through a few of the paragraphs that they raised for public awareness. They
					 condemn:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right">
</td>
<td><small>the
						  National Islamic Front (NIF) government for its genocidal war in southern
						  Sudan, support for terrorism, and continued human rights violations, and for
						  other purposes.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The resolution reads:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>Whereas according to the United
						  States Committee for Refugees (USCR), an estimated 1,900,000 have died...
						  </small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the U.S. in the last two weeks we saw a horrific
					 accident that took 6,000 or 7,000 lives, which is beyond our imagination. Just
					 take that further to 1.9 million people, mostly civilians, who died over the
					 past decade due to war, war related causes and famine, while millions have been
					 displaced from their homes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The resolution goes on to say:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>Whereas the National Islamic Front
						  (NIF)government's war policy in southern Sudan, the Nuba Mountains...has
						  brought untold suffering to innocent civilians and is threatening the very
						  survival of a whole generation of southern Sudanese;</small></td>

</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>Whereas the people of the Nuba

</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">

						  government is deliberately and systematically committing genocide in southern
						  Sudan, the Nuba Mountains, and the Ingessena Hills; </small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is a motion in the American house of
					 representatives which is very descriptive and gives us an idea of the opinion
					 and the feeling in the U.S. about the situation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are just getting over the attack a couple of weeks
					 ago on civilian populations in our continent. It has been a tough two weeks.
					 For many people, even those who were not directly affected, their whole way of
					 life has been challenged and shattered, and especially for those who had
					 relatives who were direct victims of the terrorist acts in the United
					 States.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Civilians in the U.S., as they are in the Sudan, were
					 the main victims. The victims in the Sudan are from direct military action and
					 also from the manmade famine. Can anyone imagine a manmade famine that has left
					 millions homeless and nearly two million have died?</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As previous speakers have said, both sides say the
					 military cannot resolve the issues. What is the role of Canada? Should we look
					 the other way or should we play a part? In this case I believe the government
					 has failed to provide direct leadership and a consistent, effective policy to
					 indicate our abhorrence for the actions and the events in the Sudan.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada should have a proactive solution or proposal for
					 a resolution. We in our country have an obligation to do that, I believe,
					 because of our standard of living and the protections we hold so dear in our
					 standards of life. Once again Canada can play a role because we are seen to be
					 in a very unique position in the world. We are seen as objective and fair and
					 we could help a lot more than we have.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our party has had a long history of condemning attacks
					 on civilian populations in any country, not only in the Sudan as has been
					 brought to light in this motion. I simply call on the government to finally
					 establish a comprehensive, firm, clear, consistent and effective policy by
					 using economic, diplomatic and even military tools to bring it into the civil
					 war of famine and terror in that country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some speakers have outlined the confusion of the
					 Canadian government with respect to dealing with the Talisman Energy issue,
					 where one minister says one thing about the company's involvement in the
					 country and another minister completely reverses it. That is why I say we need
					 a consistent, effective and clear policy from the government. It is time that
					 it was made available. It is time the government took steps to address
					 this.</p>

					 Fuca, Canadian Alliance): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I compliment my colleague for bringing up
					 this issue. Because I have only three minutes I will work on dispelling some
					 myths about this conflict and proffering some solutions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was in Khartoum earlier this year. The following are
					 my observations. First, this war is less about religion and has everything to
					 do with economics. It is about control of the White Nile, control over timber
					 resources, gold, mining and other resources.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, there is a lot of proxy war going on right now.
					 The Ugandans are supporting the SPLA in the south to fight their own internal
					 war with the Lord's Resistance Army in northern Uganda. That is a significant
					 contributing factor in all of this.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both the SPLA and the government in Khartoum feel at
					 this time that they both have tactical advantages on the ground. In my view
					 neither are actually fully honest in their desire to pursue peace. There are as
					 we know at least three peace endeavours. One is the IGADD process, another is
					 an Egyptian-Libyan process and the third is a Kenyan process.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would encourage our government to do the following.
					 First it should apply pressure to those governments that are using the Sudan as
					 a proxy conflict. Pressure should be put on the Ugandan government of Mr.
					 Museveni to stop supporting the SPLA. To the international groups and
					 organizations that I believe have been misled into believing that this is a
					 religious war between the Christians in the south who are being beaten up by
					 the Arab-Islamic people in the north, let me say that is a complete misnomer.
					 They should stop supporting the people in the south until the various factions
					 of the SPLA make an honest effort to produce peace.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, international communities must tell the
					 government in Khartoum to stop all bombings, engage in an immediate ceasefire,
					 allow relief shipments to go into the south freely and support a peace process
					 among groups in the south that are fighting each other. There is a massive
					 amount of internecine conflict between and among the Nuer and Dinka tribes in
					 the south. It is an issue that is not brought up as often as it should
					 be.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, peace and relief operations from the south must
					 be allowed to get into the south free of charge. No longer can the SPLA in the
					 south charge moneys to international NGOs to relieve the suffering. As my
					 colleagues mentioned, almost two million people are poised to die in the next
					 few months. The FAO has said that this is a massive humanitarian crisis.
					 Imagine what would happen if two million people were going to die in North
					 America or in Europe. Yet the international community has largely turned a
					 blind eye to this and allowed this bloodletting to continue. It cannot
					 continue.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of Talisman, it is the best of a bad
					 situation. If Talisman is removed from the equation the small amounts of
					 resources that are put in for the people on the ground for primary health and
					 education would evaporate. Another country like China would take it over and
					 all the primary health and education in the south would disappear, resulting in
					 the deaths of hundreds of thousands of other people.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I bring that to everyone's attention. On my website
					 www.keithmartin.org there is actually a complete peace solution to this which I
					 have distributed widely. I thank my colleague for bringing this important issue
					 to the floor of the House.</p>

					 (Saskatoon—Wanuskewin, Canadian Alliance): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, as I was not quite able to conclude before
					 about the wealth of information I have on some of the shameful and evil events
					 that have gone on in Sudan, I would like to remind the House again that a
					 minister of the House, Lloyd Axworthy, the former foreign affairs minister,
					 acknowledged on CBC radio that the situation in Sudan was in respect to
					 Talisman. He said that Talisman had not lived up to its obligations at all and
					 he called the company's behaviour disgraceful. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I referred as well to the Canada pension plan premiums.
					 We could poll every Canadian and I am sure they would say that it was abhorrent
					 that their Canada pension plan funds were being invested in Talisman to the
					 tune of $57.3 million and that this investment was like blood on their hands.
					 Canadian money is being invested in a company that is complicit in one degree
					 or another. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it operates at arm's length from the
					 government, directors of the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board are appointed
					 by the government on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance. Ultimately
					 the government is responsible for CPP premiums investments. The government
					 failed to include ethical guidelines for investing when it established the
					 board in 1997.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What has our government done to address the horrors in
					 Sudan and the problem of Canadian involvement there in exacerbating the
					 problems in that country? Nothing of significance. We all know this has dragged
					 on many years. Others have suggested the SEMA should be brought to bear in this
					 situation. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some have talked about IGAD. Although it is an honest
					 attempt by people who are trying to broker peace, it is not working. In fact
					 there are individuals who try in the midst of this to use what I would call the
					 moral equivalence argument in respect to the situation in Sudan. They say that
					 because the SPLA, which is involved, has done some bad things. Therefore,
					 because it is bad on this side and bad on that side, we cannot blame the
					 Sudanese government. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a father, if two of my kids were involved in a scrap
					 and one came over with a baseball bat to do some damage on the other because
					 the other had pushed him or something like that, there would be no moral
					 equivalence. I would not say that because one pushed the other that justified
					 knocking the other over the head with a bat.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moral equivalence is a fallacious kind of argument that
					 is often used by the government; because the SPLA does something wrong, it
					 justifies the Sudanese government doing something wrong. Both have done
					 something wrong, but the blame is far more on the Sudanese government in this
					 situation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberal government has taken a somewhat
					 disappointing, almost a who cares approach, to the tragedy in Sudan and to the
					 Canadian complicity in that tragedy. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The U.S. Congress has come up with two different
					 versions of the Sudan peace act, but it takes the human rights abuses in Sudan
					 seriously. This has gone on far too long. Three weeks ago President Bush
					 appointed senator John Danforth as a special envoy to Sudan to try to work for
					 peace.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is Canada doing? The Minister for Foreign Affairs,
					 when pressed on his response to attacks on Talisman's oil concessions, said
					 that the Sudanese were making efforts to secure the oil fields so that
					 Canadians working for Talisman would be safe. I want all people there to be
					 safe. Lives have been taken in this horrific, evil situation that has gone on
					 far too long.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague, the member for Etobicoke--Lakeshore of
					 the Liberal Party, has worked on this issue for eight long years, and I commend
					 her for that. Others in the House have as well, for longer than I have been
					 here. That just points out the fact that something of significance needs to be
					 done. I commend all those others in the fight. We will stay at it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask one last time and appeal to the members across
					 the way to allow this bill to go forward by giving their unanimous consent for
					 it to be votable, so we can take it on to committee.</p>

					 Southwest, PC/DR): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, about a week ago I asked a question of the
					 Minister of Transport regarding Air Canada and its request for bailout money.
					 On that day I made the point that many sectors of the economy have suffered as
					 a result of the September 11 tragedy in New York City which obviously has had
					 an impact on the entire free world. Not only are airlines hurting, every sector
					 of our economy is hurting. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We now know that Air Canada is asking for $4 billion in
					 compensation. As a reminder, $4 billion is exactly 4,000 $1 million bills. It
					 is a lot of money. The government has to consider a number of things before it
					 even remotely entertains this proposal.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, it is important to note that Air Canada has been
					 losing money steadily since the merger. It had nothing to do with the September
					 11 tragedy. Obviously there are real costs associated with that tragedy and we
					 understand that but every transport business in the country suffered as a
					 result of the September 11 tragedy. Every manufacturing business in the country
					 suffered as a result of the September 11 tragedy. It is only Air Canada that
					 the government is listening to at this time.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will make a couple of suggestions. I am sure my
					 colleagues next to me will support them. Before any consideration is given to
					 Air Canada's request for money, the government should demand an external audit
					 of Air Canada in terms of its management practices and a financial audit. Aside
					 from that, Air Canada has a lot of explaining to do in terms of how it manages
					 itself. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Air Canada has a 14 member board. Each of those board
					 members receives $37,000 a year to sit on that board. Mr. Speaker, if you think
					 your job is a good one, listen to this. The board members get $1,000 a meeting.
					 Last year there were 42 board meetings. In addition to the $37,000, they got
					 $42,000 as a result of the 42 board meetings. It is $1,000 a pop. In addition
					 to that they get free travel and expenses.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the cuts come at Air Canada, and they are coming
					 because some were announced today, let us look at the management of Air Canada.
					 How many people at the top are going to be cut? </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is time Air Canada looked inward to find out why it
					 was not making money prior to September 11. Air Canada owes the Canadian public
					 an explanation. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do know there are direct costs resulting from the
					 September 11 tragedy, but let an external audit be conducted. Allow us to do
					 that so the Canadian taxpayer will know exactly what happened within the walls
					 of Air Canada prior to September 11.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that I rest my case. I hope the government does the
					 right thing and demands an external audit before it gives the request the
					 slightest consideration.</p>

					 Secretary to the Minister of Transport, Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague for 
					 New Brunswick Southwest
					 for sharing his parliamentary experience with this House. I think he deserves
					 our full congratulations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was right to point out that, before acting too
					 quickly in financial terms, we must exercise caution.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reference to lost jobs is a generality. Jobs have been
					 lost in a number of industrial sectors. I think that in the airline industry,
					 the analysis must be very detailed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to what my colleague said a few days ago,
					 the federal Minister of Transport, who has always been wise and circumspect in
					 his interventions since the beginning of this crisis, was quite right in saying
					 that we should not put the cart before the horse.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must take time to carefully assess the scope of the
					 upset and the damage, and we must make no mistake, it is considerable, before
					 we examine the facts and decide what it would be appropriate to do. This is
					 just one part of the transportation industry.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, I think that the Minister of Transport has
					 shown the way. We must exercise caution, because, at the moment, all sectors
					 are affected by the crisis.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The terrorist attack changed all the parameters in our
					 civilization. Our economy, our society and our whole network require us to
					 think more deeply about what corrective measures should be taken, about more
					 comprehensive safety measures.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister should be commended, as the hon. member
					 pointed out, for showing patience, for looking at the issue from a proper
					 perspective and for not jumping into financial commitments which, I believe,
					 would not necessarily be justified.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank the hon. member for expressing his view. He can
					 be assured that his comments will be taken into consideration in the global
					 reflection that we must make, not only with regard to the transportation
					 industry, but all the industrial and tourism sectors, and also the whole
					 economy.</p>
