	The House resumed from October 21 consideration of the 
motion and of the amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Gallaway (Sarnia-Lambton, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to be able to join in the debate this 
morning on the important subject of Canada's post-secondary 
education system. I commend the leader of the Reform Party for 
having taken the initiative to place the issue of federal support 
for our colleges and universities on the parliamentary agenda, as 
he did last spring, and for his suggestions regarding the concept 
of income contingent repayment or ICR of student loans.
<P>
	I believe this debate is helping members of the House gain 
insights into the importance of higher education to our country's 
future and how the federal government can work with the 
provinces to assist our colleges and universities. Since this 
motion was introduced last spring, however, there have been 
several important developments.
<P>
	First, the government moved the new Canada Student 
Financial Assistance Act, which is known as Bill C-28, through 
Parliament to receive royal assent. The new legislation, which 
provides the framework for reforming the Canada student loans 
program, will be proclaimed in 1995. The new act provides the 
flexibility to implement the ICR pilot projects with interested 
provinces. This possibility is being pursued as a means of 
learning more about how an ICR scheme might be designed to 
meet Canadian conditions.
<P>
	The government has moved quickly to implement its 
students' assistance reforms by increasing assistance for those 
students who need it the most. In August of this year the full 
time Canada student loan limit was increased from $105 per 
week to $165 per week and the limit on part time loans was 
raised from $2,500 to $4,000.
<P>
	Over the next five years the changes already announced to our 
existing student assistance program will provide $6 billion in 
loans, which is over $2 billion more than during the last five 
years. The reforms include not only higher loan limits but 
special grants for students with disabilities, part time students 
and women in certain fields of study at the PhD level.
<P>
	In addition to the reforms already under way in the area of 
student assistance, the government has demonstrated its keen 
interest in the future of post-secondary education by informing 
Canadians about federal assistance to the post-secondary 
system and putting forward an innovative approach for 
discussion.
<P>
	The social security green paper provides two options for the 
future of established programs financing arrangements for 
post-secondary education. Under the first, total transfers would 
be frozen at the 1993-94 level starting in 1996-97. The result 
would be that as the tax portion of the transfer grows with the 
economy, the cash transfers will decline correspondingly, 
disappearing altogether within about ten years' time.
<P>
	On the other hand, if we have an opportunity, we could 
transfer the declining cash into a sustainable system of loans and 
grants. These new loans could be based on the concept of income 
contingent repayment. For those who enjoy relatively high 
income after their studies, the rate of repayment would be rapid. 
Those who experience periods of low income would repay only 
when they were in a position to do so. The repayment would 
adjust automatically to income, thus reflecting the ability to pay 
rather than the amount borrowed. Those of us in riding offices 
know a lot about that.
<P>
	We are discussing this concept with interest groups and 
provinces, examining how such a system might work in Canada. 
The government is guided by the principle of equality and at the 
same time the belief that those who benefit from post-secondary 
education have a responsibility to pay a fair share of the costs of 
their education.
<P>
	We believe that every Canadian has the right to an equal 
opportunity in the workplace and in the classroom, consistent 
with the ability to do the job or handle the course work. At the 
same time, government resources are very limited and must be 
directed to those who need help to help themselves. It is true that 
students are often needy while they are in post-secondary 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8606"> 8606 </A></B>
<P>
education, but thereafter their employment prospects and 
incomes usually improve dramatically. On average, 
post-secondary  graduates earn 40 per cent more than the 
general workforce over their careers.
<P>
	Once graduates begin to reap the benefits of higher education 
it seems reasonable that they should pay back part of the costs 
which society has invested in them. We are proposing that 
students take on a greater share of the costs of their education. 
We are asking them to invest in themselves. This is the option 
we want to discuss with Canadians.
<P>
	The potential advantages of income contingent repayment or 
ICR have been widely discussed in recent years and several 
countries, including Australia and New Zealand, have moved to 
introduce ICR schemes. Clearly, in making his original motion, 
the hon. member concluded that ICR could be an important tool 
in assisting students in financing their education.
<P>
	An ICR loan program would be fairer and less risky for 
students. Payments would be geared to income. If a year's 
earnings fell below a certain level, repayment of the loan could 
be suspended.
<P>
<B>(1110) </B>
<P>
	ICR has the potential of making loans available to all students 
without the means testing used in current student loans 
programs. If the government was not paying the interest on the 
loans while the students were still in school, there would be no 
need to limit eligibility.
<P>
	The ICR concept, as it could apply, is currently being 
explored. The specific design would have to be tailored to 
reflect the Canadian environment. The government is 
undertaking work in this area in consultation with various 
student and other interest groups and will involve the provinces 
fully in such consultations.
<P>
	We believe that ICR loans have a role to play in helping to 
maintain a high quality system of post-secondary education 
through the provision of a sustainable source of funding.
<P>
	As I have indicated, the discussion paper on social security 
reform suggests a new approach to how the federal government 
might transform its decline in cash transfers into a sustainable 
system of income contingent loans and grants. This represents 
an innovative approach to dealing with the challenges ahead. 
The idea is receiving considerable support and the option 
deserves consideration.
<P>
	To successfully face the challenges of the future, Canada 
needs well-educated young people and citizens who will 
continue to learn throughout their lives. The government is 
seeking ways to help Canadians achieve their learning goals 
through improved access to higher education.
<P>
	As part of our social security reforms, we must enable 
Canadians to develop the tools they need to become productive 
and self-sufficient members of society. Our objectives must 
remain consistent with the Canadian value of fairness and 
generosity to those in difficulty while recognizing that 
governments have limited resources. Quite simply, we must 
help people to help themselves.
<P>
	The government is listening to Canadians. We have put 
post-secondary education high on our list of priorities through 
reforms to the existing student assistance program and 
proposals in the social security reform paper.
<P>
	The standing committee has already started its consultations 
from coast to coast and many members are conducting forums 
on social security reform in their own constituencies.
<P>
	We look forward to hearing from Canadians in all walks of 
life.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Philippe Paré (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, as 
someone who has spent the best years of his professional career 
working as a teacher, guidance counsellor and school principal 
at the secondary level, I welcome this opportunity to take part in 
the debate on motion M-291, introduced by the Reform Party. 
The purpose of this motion is, basically, to amend the Canada 
Student Financial Assistance Act to include a loan repayment 
system that would take into account the employment income of 
students after they have finished their education.
<P>
	At first glance, we might think this measure would be to the 
students' advantage. It seems reasonable to adjust the terms of 
repayment to the income of the person who contracted the loan. 
However, when we look at what the Reform Party has in mind 
with this motion, our support for this proposal quickly 
disappears as it becomes clear there is no benefit in this for 
students. The objective is clear:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>reduce the cost to taxpayers of financing post-secondary education by 
reducing the number and dollar amounts of loans defaulted upon, by 
charging accumulated interest, rather than simple interest on default loans, 
and by reducing the number and dollar amounts of collection fees for 
defaulted loans.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The Reform Party's first objective seems to be based on the 
false premise that former students do not repay their loans 
because they do not feel like it. There is a tendency here to forget 
the economic problems facing young people today. Even for 
those with a university degree, the unemployment rate is close 
to 15 per cent. And there is also the troubling fact that many 
university and college graduates are underemployed and, as a 
result, underpaid.
<P>
	In addition to the Reform Party's failure to realize that such 
situations exist, it is clear that if we want to reduce the cost of 
education for the taxpayer, someone will have  to pick up the 
slack and pay the bill, and obviously, that onus will now be on 
the students.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8607"> 8607 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1115) </B>
<P>
	This point of view is short-sighted on several accounts. First, 
it ignores the social situation of a great number of students. 
Second, it does not take into account the significant changes in 
lifestyle of every class of society. Today's students are the 
product of what is known as the consumer society which, as a 
social model, constitutes the basis of our western economies. 
How could we confine our young people to a ghetto and believe 
that they will take part in mass consumption only when they 
graduate?
<P>
	A recent survey conducted in Quebec shows that high school 
students spend one billion dollars a year. This means that half 
the students in their last year of high school are working 
part-time. Nobody will deny the impact of this new reality on 
school results, but we must accommodate these new needs. We 
created them from scratch and ubiquitous advertising fuels 
them.
<P>
	Transferring greater financial responsibilities to 
post-secondary students will only increase the tendency of 
students to go to school and hold a paid job at the same time. 
Faced with increased tuition fees resulting from the 
government's so-called social program reform, and the Reform 
Party's intentions, as described in motion M-291, students will 
react quite normally by trying to increase the number of hours 
they spend on the labour market, in order to limit as much as 
possible the need to borrow money. The consequences will be 
disastrous: time spent studying will diminish, the failure rate 
will go up, courses and even whole years will have to be 
repeated, resulting in increased costs for the governments 
subsidizing education. Basically, it is a vicious circle.
<P>
	Transferring heavier financial responsibilities to students in 
such a manner is short-sighted for another reason. It ignores the 
fact that with the globalization of the economy, the quality of 
human resources is the key to competitiveness. It is by taking 
advantage of knowledge, research and development that 
Canadian and Quebec businesses will be able to penetrate a trade 
arena with no borders and maybe no rules.
<P>
	Any increase in the financial burden of post-secondary 
students flies in the face of this universal reality. Instead of 
limiting access to higher education, as the Liberals and the 
Reformers are planning to do, we should do the exact opposite. 
That is a major reason for not supporting Motion M-291, a 
motion which, by its objectives, is anachronistic.
<P>
	The third objective of the Reform motion also reveals the 
fallacious nature of their project. It reads as follows: ``ensure 
that post-secondary institutions in Canada receive the funding 
necessary to maintain the high quality of services they presently 
provide''.
<P>
	This is not very subtle! This objective acknowledges that 
students, by bearing a larger part of the cost of their education, 
will contribute to generate resources for universities and 
colleges. Moving in that direction is  refusing to recognize that 
knowledge and know-how are the keys to any modern economy. 
In this regard we should stress the vision of the Quebec Premier 
who announced last week, in his speech from the Throne, that he 
was freezing university tuition fees and removing the failure tax 
at college level. This is the direction to follow if we want to be 
able to compete with our trading partners under NAFTA and the 
Uruguay Round.
<P>
	We sense that the government as well as Reformers are doing 
their best to gradually withdraw from the area of education. We, 
of the Bloc Quebecois, believe that the federal government must 
withdraw entirely from that area of provincial jurisdiction, an 
area that it invaded not to serve the interests of the people, but to 
enslave, to dominate and to impose its national standards on the 
provinces. By withdrawing from that field, the federal 
government could transfer tax points to the provinces. They 
would then be in a better position to deliver to their people 
education services geared to their needs and realities.
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
	In so doing, the federal government would go beyond 
speeches and do something concrete to reduce the duplication of 
services delivered by both levels of government. However, to 
act in that direction would require great discernment and 
common sense.
<P>
	These ingredients do not seem to be on sale in the federalist 
supermarket. To conclude, I urge all members who still care 
about the future to vote against motion M-291, a dangerous and 
anachronistic motion because of the objectives its seeks to 
achieve.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Daphne Jennings (Mission-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to lead this debate for my 
party.
<P>
	This motion is about Canada's future. It is about the future 
because it is about education. Education is the key to the future 
for Canada's young people.
<P>
	I have spent virtually all my adult life in the teaching 
profession. Conveying knowledge to our young people was for 
me a most rewarding vocation. We must ensure the future of our 
educational system in Canada, and part of that is ensuring that as 
many students as possible can take part in it.
<P>
	As literacy critic for my party, I recognize what happens if 
people do not take advantage of our education system when they 
are young. If you do not learn to read and write when you are 
young, you are going to have to learn when you are older through 
the various literacy programs sponsored by communities across 
Canada.
<P>
	Reading and writing are learned either young or old but have 
to be learned at some point if one wants to become a fully 
functioning member of society. That is why it is so important 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8608"> 8608 </A></B>
<P>
that everyone who wishes has access to education at every level 
of our school system.
<P>
	Years ago, back in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, I believe we 
thought we had licked the access problem for education and if 
we had proceeded with balanced budgets from the 1970s through 
until today, I suppose we could have been right. However with 
the advent of budgetary deficits and the recession from which 
we are desperately trying to emerge, access to education has 
been called into question.
<P>
	It has been called into question by two groups, the students 
and by us, the politicians representing the people of Canada. 
Students are concerned that through the Canada student loan 
program they will receive insufficient funds to allow them to 
attend university without worry.
<P>
	At the same time because of the repayment scheme attached to 
these loans, students are concerned they will emerge at the end 
of their university careers with a huge debt which they are 
unable to discharge in the amounts and in the time required.
<P>
	The repayment problem for student loans is alarming. At 
present one in five borrowers is in default on their student loan. 
About two-thirds of these eventually repay but only after the 
federal government assumes the debt from the bank and has 
launched some form of collection activity.
<P>
	The other third, about 7 per cent of all student loans, are never 
repaid and become simply bad debts. In all, we are talking about 
$1 billion in bad loans, money the treasury may never see.
<P>
	That is why the Reform Party felt it important to look at the 
whole scheme of financing again; look at it with a view to 
making it easier to fund a student's education, making it easier 
for the student to repay and therefore making it easier on the 
country's finances because the loans would eventually be 
repaid, perhaps with lesser amounts, but repaid nevertheless.
<P>
	Let me explain how the Reform Party's income contingent 
loan repayment program will work. It is designed to allow 
students to pay back their student loans over a period of time 
based on their annual income after leaving university. The 
concept is funded on two fundamental principles, the full use of 
the income tax machinery in monitoring and collecting student 
loans, and the implementation of an income contingency 
principle whereby students pay back a set percentage of their 
income.
<P>
	Upon graduation a student would begin to pay back their 
student loan. There is no eight-month delay period as there is 
presently. The repayment of the loan however would link the 
repayment plan to a student's earnings or ability to pay. 
Precisely how much a former student pays back would vary from 
year to year depending on his or her salary level.
<P>
	A specific amount set as a percentage of income would be 
paid through the tax system. If a person's income does not reach 
a specified minimum amount, the payment would be deferred 
until earnings go up. This repayment system, however, depends 
on the supply of accurate income statements long after the 
individual has left the institution of higher education.
<P>
	Revenue Canada could therefore supply the necessary data 
automatically and cheaply through income tax statements. This 
would necessitate the recording of student borrowers with the 
tax department and the inclusion of social insurance numbers on 
student loan forms.
<P>
	With the possession of the full details of most students 
changing future incomes and geographic locations, the income 
tax authorities could then act as the primary monitor subsequent 
to loan collection.
<P>
	I do not believe the use of SIN numbers in this context should 
be objected to. The end result of a more equitable loan scheme 
justifies this requirement.
<P>
<B>(1125) </B>
<P>
	We in the Reform Party like the idea of income contingent 
loans for three basic reasons, the first being the reduced cost to 
the taxpayer. Under the current Canada student loans program 
taxpayers end up footing the bill for defaulted loans. The 
difference between the simple interest paid by borrowers and the 
accumulated interest paid by the government and the collection 
fees charged on defaulted loans is charged to the taxpayer.
<P>
	Two, there would be greater flexibility and fairness for 
students under the program. Under the Canada student loan 
program borrowers and taxpayers are discriminated against and 
repayment terms are onerous and rigid. The current program 
discriminates against borrowers in two ways. First, it 
discriminates against the poor and unemployed by forcing them 
to pay back their loans at the same rate and at the same level as 
those who are gainfully employed and who can afford to pay off 
their loans. Second, the prospective borrowers are discriminated 
against on the basis of their parents' or partners' income 
potential through means tests.
<P>
	This often means that students whose parents are well off are 
ineligible for student loans even if they receive no assistance 
from these same parents. Low income taxpayers are especially 
discriminated against, as they are less apt to send their children 
to university.
<P>
	The burden falls especially on those who pay taxes but do not 
use post-secondary education services. By 1990 two-thirds of 
the adult population did not possess post-secondary credentials. 
In other words, under the Canada student loan plan the poor or

those without university education as the case may be have been 
subsidizing the rich.
<P>
	The repayment plan is inflexible because it forces former 
students to begin repaying their loan only eight months after 
graduation irrespective of their income. The income 
contingency plan in contrast involves no burden of debt that 
must be repaid unconditionally. Repayment falls only on the 
prosperous; that is, upon those persons who graduate and earn 
income at or above the given level.
<P>
	Three, the maintenance of high quality educational services. 
The government is broke. As such both federal and provincial 
jurisdictions are grappling with the problem of how to finance 
post-secondary education. The financial pressure on higher 
education through reduced public funding has been inevitable in 
an era of growing deficits, high taxation and the increasing 
competition of health, environment and other lobbies for a 
greater share of public spending.
<P>
	As governments contribute less and less funding and costs 
increase at the same time the quality of education has and will 
continue to decline. The bottom line is that governments can no 
longer finance post-secondary education at a declining level 
and expect the quality of the service to remain constant.
<P>
	One cannot increase tuition and other fees charged to students 
without making the cost of a university education more and 
more prohibitive under the current system. If students were to be 
permitted to repay their loans on an income contingent basis 
over a longer period of time if necessary tuition fees as a 
percentage of the total contribution to post-secondary financing 
could easily be increased. This would ensure that the quality of 
educational services would remain strong and that those who 
benefit most from the system are those who contribute their fair 
share.
<P>
	The position taken on this subject by the academic world is 
heartening. Mr. Clark Lajeunesse, president of the Association 
of Universities and Colleges of Canada stated the current 
student loan program is outdated as it does not meet students' 
needs and it does not meet university needs either.
<P>
	The income contingent repayment loan is seen by universities 
as allowing them to maintain accessibility and qualify by 
making more effective use of tuition fees.
<P>
	Under the ICR program universities can be more realistic 
about the cost of the programs that they offer. Some fees might 
increase for high cost programs while other fees might decrease 
for low cost programs. While some student groups have 
expressed concern that such a method of financing education 
could lead to higher tuition fees, other students and student 
organizations have expressed support.
<P>
	The Ontario Undergraduate Student Alliance believes that 
ICR holds promise for protecting accessibility to and the quality 
of post-secondary education. The most important matter for this 
group is not so much that costs may increase marginally but that 
the education received by students be worth something. The key 
to the ICR program for this Ontario group is that it is never an 
unmanageable debt load.
<P>
	I believe we should now look seriously at changing the 
method by which university education in Canada is financed, 
especially the financing available for students. The proposal 
from the leader of the Reform Party represents a scheme which 
is fair and equitable to students but is also inexpensive to 
administer. I would urge all members of the House to support 
this motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Finlay (Oxford, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to rise today in response to the member's Motion No. M-291 
and make some comments about the financing of 
post-secondary education using an income contingent 
repayment plan. I would like to offer some comments on 
investment in post-secondary education.
<P>
<B>(1130) </B>
<P>
	All of us recognize that the income contingent repayment 
principle is intended to facilitate investment by individuals in 
their own future. It therefore offers a way for public policy to 
foster what the social security reform discussion paper calls 
mutual responsibility, governments helping people to help 
themselves.
<P>
	Canadians collectively make a greater investment in learning 
than practically anyone else in the world. Few industrialized 
countries spend more of their gross domestic product on 
education than we do. No country spends more than the 2.6 per 
cent of GDP that we spend every year on post-secondary 
education. This represents $16 billion per year, nearly 80 per 
cent of which comes from taxpayers through federal and 
provincial support.
<P>
	Indeed our public investment in post-secondary education is 
also the highest in the OECD countries measured in relation to 
our overall economic activity. The result is some of the best and 
most accessible post-secondary education in the world.
<P>
	We have in relative terms more adults with post-secondary 
qualifications than many other countries and we have more 
people enrolled at any given time. There are currently nearly one 
million full time post-secondary students in Canada, about 70 
per cent in universities and the rest in colleges and institutes of 
technology. Because of its shorter duration programs the college 
level actually produces more graduates than the university 
sector. Both of course make equally essential contributions to 
individual opportunity and national development.
<P>
	In addition to the full time students there are also hundreds of 
thousands of students enrolled in part time programs. Still more 
take short courses, specialized training and other learning 
opportunities. Indeed, one in every four adult Canadians is 
engaged in a learning  activity in any given year, an increase of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8610"> 8610 </A></B>
<P>
about 20 per cent during the last decade. Canadians understand 
the importance of investing both time and money, public and 
private, in learning to adapt to new challenges and 
opportunities.
<P>
	A recent survey by EKOS Associates showed that some 25 per 
cent of the adult workforce are keen to improve their 
qualifications and move up to better jobs through their own 
efforts. These so-called bootstrappers are prepared to work hard 
at self improvement and self investment. They typically have 
adult responsibilities, modest incomes and limited 
opportunities for learning on the job. Their learning needs are 
widely divergent and may range from literacy training to 
advanced education or technical training.
<P>
	Despite our record in creating across Canada an excellent and 
accessible post-secondary education system, many of these 
people still have great difficulty in finding the optimum 
combination of time and money in order that they can 
participate. There are no easy solutions but we need to ask 
ourselves how we can improve this situation.
<P>
	The social security reform discussion paper therefore raises 
two basic questions about federal investment in post-secondary 
education. How can we help to ensure long term stable and 
sustainable support for post-secondary education in a context of 
increasing financial restraints by all governments? How can we 
at the same time not only maintain our accomplishments in 
making post-secondary education accessible but broaden and 
expand that access to more people?
<P>
	The social security paper outlines two options for future 
federal support of post-secondary education. Under the first 
option the current established program funding for 
post-secondary education transfer arrangements would be 
maintained. The total amount would be fixed at the 1993-94 
level in keeping with the government's restraint on transfers 
announced in the 1994 budget. With total entitlements thus 
restrained but the tax portion of the transfers growing with the 
economy, the cash transfer portion would decline 
correspondingly.
<P>
<B>(1135 ) </B>
<P>
	In 1996-97, the first year of any new arrangements, tax 
transfers are projected to be about $4 billion and cash to be about 
$2 billion for a total of just over $6 billion. While this total 
remains fixed, the tax portion is projected to reach $5 billion by 
the year 2001, meaning that the cash will be automatically 
reduced to about $1 billion at that point.
<P>
	Finally, about 10 years after the new arrangement starts the 
value of the tax transfer would exceed $6 billion and the cash 
transfer would be virtually zero. The federal government would 
no longer provide cash support to provinces for post-secondary 
education.
<P>
	We think there is a better way to invest the available cash. 
Instead of just letting it dwindle away to nothing, the green 
paper suggests using it to create a new $2 billion per year loan 
scheme on income contingent repayment principles. This would 
help students to meet the rising cost of tuition and thereby 
contribute an increasing portion of the cost of post-secondary 
education. It would thus help to ensure both the availability of 
high quality relevant opportunities for higher education and 
career training, but also their affordability.
<P>
	The ICR principle as other hon. members have pointed out can 
ensure that an individual's payments on student loans do not 
become unmanageable. In a sense the income contingent 
repayment plan means sharing the risk between government and 
the individual, guaranteeing that payments will adjust 
automatically to income and therefore to ability to pay.
<P>
	This second option would provide support to the 
post-secondary education system in two ways: first through a 
permanent and growing endowment of tax points that provinces 
can use to help finance their grants to colleges and universities, 
and second through loans that enable students to contribute to 
their own education.
<P>
	Over the 10 year period beginning in 1996-97 the first option 
of the continuing current arrangements would provide a total of 
just over $60 billion to the post-secondary system. By contrast 
the second option would provide around $70 billion in tax 
transfers and loans over the same period. That is a difference of 
$10 billion in favour of the alternative approach.
<P>
	This approach depends on the creation of a new student loan 
system that would ensure affordable payments for borrowers as 
well as simple and efficient means of repayment that would 
avoid problems of default. The scheme must be both fair and 
efficient.
<P>
	The income contingent repayment approach properly 
designed could offer an answer to this need. The government is 
consulting interested groups about the specifics of design and 
welcomes their input to the process.
<P>
	The options in the green paper for enhancing our national 
investment in post-secondary education are proposals, not 
decisions. The government is looking forward to reviewing 
these ideas in light of the many valuable comments and 
alternative proposals now being put forward. Not the least of 
these will be the suggestions of members of this House offered 
through the current debate.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
with pleasure that I speak on the motion put forth by the Reform 
Party, but it is with no pleasure that I read and consider it. It 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8611"> 8611 </A></B>
<P>
seems to me that much of this motion is contrary to the 
principles young people have been given for many years.
<P>
	If you take a look at what is underlying this motion, because 
there are the words of the motion but there is a lot more to these 
words, to what lies under all this. Reference is made to reducing 
the number and dollar amounts of loans. We understand that the 
intent is to recover a larger part of the defaulted loans that are 
presently difficult to recover and that we should be shifting 
toward a university tax situation.
<P>
<B>(1140) </B>
<P>
	This smooths the way for what follows: to ensure that 
post-secondary institutions receive all the funding necessary, 
while the goal-as previous Reform speakers have 
conceded-is to reduce the cost of education to taxpayers. So, if 
the necessary funding is to be maintained while you reduce the 
cost to taxpayers, of course someone else's costs will have to go 
up.
<P>
	Whose costs? Probably the students'. They are told: ``Your 
costs will increase but you will be able to repay based on a fixed 
percentage of your income-what is commonly called 
university tax, or post-graduate tax, among students''. We are 
told that this is a good idea, one that was always considered in 
academic circles as potentially interesting-a post-graduate 
tax- but not as part of a system that doubles their indebtedness.
<P>
	In that sense, I fail to see the difference between the Reform 
motion and the social program reform proposed by the HRD 
minister, who is basically suggesting the same thing. He is not as 
direct, though. Perhaps the one thing that can be said to their 
credit is that the Reformers are more direct. The documents 
tabled by the Minister of Human Resources Development talk 
about cuts in cash transfer payments to the provinces-this will 
amount to $324 million for Quebec-as well as cuts in income 
tax points-over $700 million-which will have the direct 
effect of increasing students' indebtedness and doubling tuition 
fees.
<P>
	I now want to come back to indebtedness from a student's 
perspective. I was one myself not so long ago and I have been 
fortunate in that I have a good job and have been able to repay 
my student loans. I am very proud of having been raised in a 
good, accessible education system. I am one of those who first 
saw tuition fees rise every year and those who followed me have 
seen them rise even more because of subtle cuts in cash 
transfers.
<P>
	How can we hope for a competitive, highly qualified labour 
force ready to take up challenges, when our young people look at 
the labour market with little hope while we encourage them to 
increase their debt load for their own good? Well, that is a major 
problem.
<P>
	Why not give them a chance to get through the system and 
then increase their contribution? I think this would be a better 
approach that will ensure greater access. Is this the new system 
you are proposing for something that has always been a top 
priority in this country? Is this the new alternative you will try to 
sell Quebecers when the  time comes to make collective 
choices? Is that the system you want to give us?
<P>
	Both Liberals and Reformers see eye to eye on this. The third 
part of the motion would ensure that post-secondary institutions 
in Canada receive the funding necessary. I told my colleagues: 
``They have the wrong level of government; they should ask 
their provincial legislatures''. Education is not an area of 
federal jurisdiction; our Constitution clearly stipulates that it 
comes under provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	But they always find a way. Liberal and Reform members 
would like to campaign on improving the education system 
because it is a priority for people. They do not have the courage 
to tell them that it is in provincial jurisdiction and explain power 
sharing under the present system to them. This leads to a lot of 
confusion and debt. Let this be a warning to this government.
<P>
	There is no question of letting them meddle in education. It 
makes no sense. They will not repeat on a large scale with 
education what they are doing with occupational training. We 
should not let them. This paragraph about ensuring that 
educational institutions receive the necessary funding is not the 
federal government's role. So far, the federal government's only 
role has been to provide funds for the provinces, which 
reinvested them as they wished, and if this government wanted 
to be consistent, it would let the provinces that so desire collect 
these funds themselves by giving them the tax points or 
achieving their objectives like reforming the sales tax.
<P>
	Why not take the opportunity to see how the provinces could 
do it themselves and at the same time ensure that they have the 
necessary funds so that they would no longer need to constantly 
ask the federal government, which always wants to centralize 
more with a cumbersome bureaucracy that always wants to 
meddle and control more?
<P>
<B>(1145) </B>
<P>
	It has been a long time since the government-in fact it 
probably never happened-downsized its operations and made 
real transfers to the provinces.
<P>
	Let us take a look at the situation of students. Quebecers and 
Canadians in general often live far from educational 
institutions. In order to pursue studies at the university of 
college level, students often have to leave their place of 
permanent residence. Not always, but very often. It was the case 
for me. Except for those enrolled in a few training programs, 
every university student from my region of Timiskaming or 
from Abitibi-Timiskaming must move to some large centre.
<P>
	Obviously, we could provide more university programs in the 
regions and that would be a good thing, but it will always be 
necessary to go somewhere else to get specific training. This 
means that students will have to pay for rent and other expenses. 
There are certain related benefits in that these students develop a 
certain  independence; they learn to become part of society and 
they gain a greater autonomy. However, there are related costs 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8612"> 8612 </A></B>
<P>
which, traditionally, had been partly met by society, through 
loan and bursary programs.
<P>
	However, for the last ten years or so, the proportion of loans 
and bursaries has been reversed. Greater emphasis is put on 
loans now, since it costs students more to pursue studies. The 
user pay principle is being implemented in the field of 
education; yet, education is really a collective good in that 
everyone can benefit from it.
<P>
	Now the government wants to restrict that access in a very 
underhanded manner. Attending university can cost around 
$10,000 for a student from my region. Increasing, if not 
doubling tuition fees would translate into an additional $2,000 
per year for every student enrolled in a university program. Let 
us not forget that, since many students must already work 
part-time to pay for their studies, very few manage to complete 
their program in the normal time frame. Many students need 
four years to complete the three-year program leading to a 
bachelor's degree. Many students take three years instead of two 
to get their CEGEP diploma and they even take four and a half 
years to get their university degree because they have to work 
while completing their education.
<P>
	What would happen if we were to implement the proposals 
made by the Liberals and the Reform Party? What impact would 
it have on full-time versus part-time students, on the quality of 
education, on the quality of graduates? They do not seem to be 
thinking about that. They just look at the financial situation, and 
that is a real cause for concern.
<P>
	If the debt incurred by students is supposed to double, do you 
think that our young people will attend university in larger 
numbers, especially since they often have to face a new 
requirement? They must have a microcomputer, which has 
become an almost essential tool. Of course, many universities 
provide microcomputers on site. Also, there are loans 
guaranteed by the Government of Quebec to help students afford 
a microcomputer, but it is another loan and this ever-growing 
debt becomes more and more of a burden to the system.
<P>
	Students look at Canada's fiscal situation and they see that we 
have an enormous debt, but they also see the cuts that are being 
made. For example, our young people today will never benefit 
from the capital gains exemption that was available to previous 
generations. Many of the incentives and tools that Canadians 
used to become successful are being eliminated. Our young 
people are willing to accept that, but at the same time they are 
being told that they will have to pay more for their education.
<P>
	They are being asked to do the job the government is no longer 
able to do with regard to the debt and we are supposed to believe 
that it will be better for them, that it will improve our education 
system.
<P>
	Canadians are being deceived and the Bloc Quebecois will 
never support such a motion that goes against all the principles 
that society as a whole must contribute for the benefit of all, 
whether for health or education.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to speak in support of the motion by my colleague, the 
member for Calgary Southwest, on the income contingent 
repayment of student loans.
<P>
	For the record let me assure the House that my position and 
that of all the Reform Party caucus is that we wholeheartedly 
endorse all aspects of education. The country needs as much as it 
possibly can get. The debate this morning seems to have centred 
around education. The motion before us today deals with the 
collection of outstanding amounts owed by students in order for 
Canada to ensure the money that is being lent to students is 
being returned.
<P>
<B>(1150) </B>
<P>
	I listened to the debate and the nonsensical rant of members of 
the Bloc Quebecois going back to the idea that only Quebec can 
handle the problems. The arguments they put forward seem to be 
rather ludicrous, looking at the motion put forward by the 
member for Calgary Southwest.
<P>
	The Liberals have talked about fairness. When we take a look 
at outstanding loans we see that 90 per cent of Canadian students 
repay their loans with or without hardship but they do so. Ten per 
cent have been written off. If we are talking about fairness, 
surely we should expect all students to live up to their financial 
obligations rather than 10 per cent being allowed to walk away 
from their responsibilities while the other 90 per cent act 
responsibly and repay the debt.
<P>
	Today we have a very difficult financial situation in the 
country caused by previous governments and a current 
government that refuses to grasp the situation and ensure that we 
get our finances in order. By the admission of the Minister of 
Finance we are going to add another $100 billion to our debt in 
the next three years, thereby squeezing the amount of money we 
are going to have available to pay for education and the other 
services we so desperately need.
<P>
	We also know that the young people are going to pay back the 
debt on top of their education. They are the ones who are getting 
squeezed twice. We are asking them to pay more for their 
education as we continue to consume the assets of the country. 
The students who graduate statistically speaking earn 40 per 
cent higher incomes than those who do not have higher educa-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8613"> 8613 </A></B>
<P>
tion; but we must look to the idea that higher education is very 
expensive. It must be handed out to those who have the  desire to 
take that education, go forward, help develop the country and 
use it for the betterment of Canada.
<P>
	Higher education is not a place where people can fritter away 
some time and borrow the money from the Canadian taxpayer 
and hope that if they have some money they will pay it back at a 
later date.
<P>
	Lets look at some statistics. I have the 1994-95 estimates 
from Human Resources Development Canada, the part III 
expenditure plan. Looking at page 5.4 under the social 
development and education program, we find that claims paid 
by the government, it is estimated for 1994-95, will be $195 
million. That has been increasingly steadily. Working 
backward, the forecast for 1993-94 was $162 million. The 
actual for 1992-93 was $175 million and back in 1991 it was 
$147 million. The amount is getting larger all the time.
<P>
	Can we expect the Government of Canada to continue to 
provide education free for some who want to flaunt the rules and 
expect those who abide by the rules to have to pay for it? I do not 
think so. We have to remember that 90 per cent of students pay 
their loans back.
<P>
	Let us take a look at the defaulted loans. On page 5.39 of the 
same book, in the 1992-93 loan year the student assistance 
branch reimbursed lenders' claims for 29,079 defaulted loans. 
Let us take a look at the dollar amounts. Under $2,500 there 
were 8,180 claims. Between $2,500 and $5,000 there were 
10,642 claims. Well over half of all student loans that have been 
written off were for less than $5,000. Five thousand dollars does 
not buy a decent used car today. It is not a downpayment on a 
house. It does not go very far.
<P>
<B>(1155) </B>
<P>
	The average income in the country is around $24,000 a year 
per individual. We are talking just a few months of income. 
Surely it is only fair, when we are talking about the obligation 
people assume to go to university to get a higher education, that 
these people live up to their responsibilities and repay the loans.
<P>
	Regardless of the Bloc Quebecois talking about how hard it 
would be, we must remember that only 10 per cent are abusing 
the privilege. Of that 10 per cent more than half of them are for 
less than $5,000. If these individuals whose student loans are 
written off have financial difficulties because they have no job 
and have no income, they should be allowed time to repay the 
debt.
<P>
	However when they become employed, when they start to 
generate some income, surely we can expect them to live up to 
their obligations. Therefore the motion by the member for 
Calgary Southwest is perfectly in order. We should recognize 
that when there is hardship we should allow them the 
opportunity to defer payments. When they have the opportunity 
to pay back the loans they signed up for which provided for their 
education, provided for the betterment of their lives and 
presumably added to their standard of living and quality of life, 
the  10 per cent, like the other 90 per cent, should be expected to 
repay the loans.
<P>
	We must remember that over half of the 29,000 who defaulted 
last year defaulted on an amount that was less than $5,000. Let 
us be realistic. Let us talk about being fair. Let us talk about 
fairness for everybody rather than just those who want to live up 
to their education.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Anna Terrana (Vancouver East, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am delighted to be able to address the House on the crucial 
subject of federal support for post-secondary education.
<P>
	The motion before us which was introduced in the spring by 
the Reform Party has taken on new meaning in the context that 
has evolved since then. Not only has legislation been passed to 
overhaul the Canada student loans program but the government 
has released its social security reform discussion paper. Both 
these initiatives reinforce the notion that income contingent 
repayment of student loans is a potential important component 
of the future post-secondary education financing scene in 
Canada.
<P>
	As a further example of the interest in income contingent 
repayment loans demonstrated in the past few months, I would 
like to point to the conference in September sponsored by the 
Government of Ontario with financial assistance from the 
federal Department of Human Resources Development. It 
brought together leading experts from across Canada, Australia 
and the United States and gave some 300 participants a chance to 
exchange views and argue the issues.
<P>
	The arguments in this area often involve strongly held views 
as we have seen in the debate in the House. Throughout the 
debate all sides of the House stress the importance of 
post-secondary education to the future of individual Canadians 
and of our country.
<P>
	I believe none of us questions this basic value but we do have 
differing views as to how best the federal government can 
contribute to ensuring that Canadians continue to enjoy access 
to post-secondary education over the long term.
<P>
	In our red book we did admit that ``we must make better use of 
the $44 billion we spend on education every year''. Many 
Canadian students already receive assistance from the federal 
and provincial governments to finance their studies. The costs to 
students of post-secondary education have increased 
significantly in recent years. The government has introduced 
reforms to the Canada student loans program to help today's 
students handle the increased costs.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="8614"> 8614 </A></B>
<P>
	There is no doubt that in the past significant numbers of 
students have difficulty repaying existing fixed payment loans. 
The government has moved to address the problem by 
introducing grants and expanding interest relief to include 
borrowers of low incomes.
<P>
<B>(1200 ) </B>
<P>
	The government will soon be entering into contracts with 
lenders for the Canada student loans program whereby the 
institutions making the loans will assume greater responsibility 
for servicing and collecting them.
<P>
	Under this new financing arrangement lenders will have a 
much greater incentive to provide income sensitive terms to 
borrowers. This flexibility will assist former students in 
repaying their loans.
<P>
	More fundamental than the question of the operation of 
existing student loans problems is that of the share which tuition 
represents of higher education costs. Canadian post-secondary 
students contribute through their fees on the average about 20 
per cent of university operating costs. We know that 
post-secondary graduates have much greater employment 
prospects and income potential than those who have not 
undertaken such studies. Should they perhaps contribute more 
toward the costs of this education?
<P>
	As the House knows, the standing committee on human 
resources-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> With profound apologies to the hon. 
member, she will have six minutes when the matter comes up for 
debate at the next occasion.
<P>
	The time provided for the consideration of Private Members' 
Business has now expired. Pursuant to Standing Order 93, the 
order is dropped to the bottom of the order of precedence on the 
Order Paper.

	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Motion No. 1</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-51, in Clause 2, be amended by replacing lines 42 to 45, on 
page 2, with the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``4.(1) The Governor in Council, on the recommendation of the 
committee of the House of Commons that normally considers agricultural 
matters, shall designate one of the commissioners to be chief commissioner 
and another commissioner to be assistant chief commissioner.''</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, this is the second time I rise in the 
House to speak to Bill C-51. The bill was discussed at length in 
committee, mainly so that we could provide some clarification.
<P>
	The House will recall that the purpose of this bill is to clarify 
some procedures with respect to contracts concluded by the 
Canadian Grain Commission with grain elevator operators and 
producers.
<P>
	I will first comment on the amendment I proposed to improve 
Bill C-51. The amendment in question does not affect the main 
thrust of this bill. According to the government, the bill will 
impose greater responsibility on grain producers to secure 
payment for their grain from elevator operators and grain 
dealers licensed by the Commission. The government is telling 
producers: Look, you know how this works. We now have to 
make some adjustments to make things work more smoothly.
<P>
	The amendment I am proposing to Bill C-51 is along the same 
lines, in that its aim is to provide for more effective and, above 
all, more transparent operations.
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	The proposed amendment affects the government body that is 
involved in all these operations, the Canadian Grain 
Commission-and more specifically, section 2 of the bill which 
concerns the appointment of the chief commissioner and the 
assistant chief commissioner of the Canadian Grain 
Commission.
<P>
	The section reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Governor in Council shall designate one of the commissioners to be 
chief commissioner and another commissioner to be assistant chief 
commissioner.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8615"> 8615 </A></B>
<P>
	Before the amendment provided in Bill C-51, the governor in 
council only designated the chief commissioner. Bill C-51 adds 
the appointment of the assistant chief commissioner to this 
section. The motion I am presenting this afternoon in the House 
would involve the Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food in 
the process.
<P>
	As amended, the section would read as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Governor in Council, on the recommendation of the committee of the 
House of Commons that normally considers agricultural matters, shall 
designate one of the commissioners to be chief commissioner and another 
commissioner to be assistant chief commissioner.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The governor in council appoints the seven commissioners of 
the Canadian Grain Commission. Of course, if you want to be 
naive-I remember very well how the commissioners were 
appointed under the previous government. I have some friends 
who sat on the Immigration Commission, and I can assure you 
that the Conservative Government did not appoint any Liberals. 
These were well-paid jobs. You were paid to work not too hard 
for five or six years, depending on the appointment.
<P>
	The Liberal Party will be no exception. In appointing these 
commissioners, it will make sure to select good red 
commissioners, making partisan appointments. What we would 
suggest is to enhance slightly the role of the MPs sitting on the 
Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food. Our 
proposal is that, within the committee, which is-need we 
remind you-dominated by the Liberals, the Liberal Party could 
nominate a chief commissioner and an assistant chief 
commissioner. The Liberals are in the majority on the 
committee, but at least we would get the impression that the 
opposition parties had a say in deciding which of the seven 
commissioners would make the best chief commissioner.
<P>
	I sometimes wonder if committees are not used a little bit like 
so-called occupational classes in a school, where you stick 
less-gifted or motivated students who nevertheless have to 
attend school.
<P>
	But here, if we want our committees to have a degree of 
credibility, we must give them responsibilities and roles to play. 
With this motion, the Bloc Quebecois would give them some 
role to play and slightly reduce this shameless partisanship.
<P>
	As it currently stands, the clause allows these appointments to 
be made unilaterally by the Governor in Council, that is, by the 
government.
<P>
<B>(1210) </B>
<P>
	You will understand that it is out of concern for transparency 
that I am suggesting that the government consult the appropriate 
committee so as to appoint the best qualified people to run the 
Canadian Grain Commission.
<P>
	I think it is only fair to say that the credibility and importance 
of the commission are well established. That is why is must raise 
above any partisanship and the best qualified individuals, 
regardless of their political colour or affiliation, must be put in 
charge of it. Such a unilateral approach has often led to 
unfortunate situations in the past.
<P>
	A competent person can be appointed to be chair, only to be 
replaced by someone who is a little closer to the party forming 
the new government. I imagine that certain very political 
positions can only go to people who agree with the government's 
policies and can implement them. But I do not feel that CGC 
positions fall in this category.
<P>
	Furthermore, when someone is fired for partisan reasons, the 
tab for breaking this person's contract is often picked up by 
taxpayers. If this person worked on implementing initiatives, we 
hope that the whole process will not come to a stop while we 
wait for someone else to be appointed and start carrying out the 
new policies.
<P>
	Several people came to testify before the Committee on 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, and I remember very well one 
witness who was very interesting and especially quite eloquent. 
A lady told us her story. She said that she used to sit on the CGC 
and that she was fired when the former Conservative 
government took office. Until we find evidence to the contrary, 
the Liberal Party resembles the Conservative Party in all 
respects. It will not hesitate either to get rid of someone even if 
that person is doing a good job.
<P>
	The members opposite will respond that they do not engage in 
such practices. If all their decisions in situations such as this are 
devoid of partisan considerations, they should be happy to shout 
it from the rooftops today. As nothing lasts forever, they should 
think about their successors who will have total faith in them.
<P>
	Incidentally, this approach would also avoid many 
recriminations since representatives of all political parties 
would have their say on who is appointed to these two positions, 
in the Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food.
<P>
	In closing, I urge once again all members, at least all members 
of the Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food, to vote in 
favour of this motion.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Lyle Vanclief (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
make a few comments on Bill C-51 which is before the House 
this morning. Probably the best way is to sum up what this bill is 
all about and then I will make a couple of specific comments 
about the motion before us.
<P>
	I would like to quote part of the speech the Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food delivered to the House when the bill 
was put forward some weeks ago.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8616"> 8616 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The grain industry is changing and the pace of change is accelerating. To remain 
competitive in global markets, and global markets are where Canada sells most of its 
grain, we need a regulatory and legislative framework which protects the shared 
interests of all stakeholders. At the same time it must assist the individuals and groups 
within the industry to compete successfully, adding value where possible to their 
efforts.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The minister made that statement a number of weeks ago and I 
can assure the House and the industry that this very 
comprehensive consultation process has taken place as we have 
moved through the bill.
<P>
	As far as the motion that has been put forward is concerned, I 
would like to assure the members of the House that as the 
government reviews the appointments, we can guarantee that 
they will be filled with competent, capable, enthusiastic and 
qualified people. When those appointments come along they 
will be advertised in the Canada Gazette. There is nothing 
prohibiting any member of the industry or anybody else 
suggesting that the minister consider someone. There is ample 
opportunity for all of that to take place.
<P>
	However, we must recognize in the final analysis that the 
chief commissioner and the commissioners are responsible to 
the minister. The best way to ensure that the minister is 
comfortable with those appointments is to leave things as they 
are at the present time, with the minister having the final say. 
But I can assure the House that anyone whose name is put 
forward will be reviewed in the same manner as everyone else. 
The House does not have to be concerned about the quality, 
capability and competency of those with whom the government 
fills the positions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
support the amendment brought forward by the hon. member 
this morning. From the parliamentary secretary's statement it 
seems he really supports the motion as well.
<P>
	This motion does not take final authority to make the 
appointments from cabinet. All the motion does is give the 
agriculture standing committee the power to discuss and to 
recommend. I do not believe there is any disagreement and the 
Liberals should support the amendment.
<P>
	The amendment allows the agriculture and agri-food 
committee to recommend names to cabinet for the Canada 
Grains Council's chief and assistant chief commissioners. Our 
party supports this because it will allow for discussions to take 
place, at least in the standing committee, which is better than 
only in cabinet.
<P>
	Even with a Liberal dominated committee, as the committees 
are now, it would still give opposition parties the ability to put 
forward suggestions and to talk about the qualifications or the 
lack of qualifications of these appointments.
<P>
	Where Reform and Bloc members do not agree with the 
appointments the Liberals are making, we can talk about it in 
committee and get some public involvement in the discussion. It 
would make it more difficult for government to make 
appointments strictly based on patronage. It would take that 
aspect out of it to a large extent. At least if the minister did make 
appointments strictly based on patronage and the qualifications 
of the person appointed were not there, then the public could 
make him pay the price because there would be open discussion.
<P>
<B>(1220 ) </B>
<P>
	I would like to close by asking a question of the parliamentary 
secretary. Who could possibly oppose a motion which will 
provide for more discussion of these appointments and still 
leave the final authority to appoint with cabinet? I think I heard 
the parliamentary secretary say that so why would he or his party 
oppose the motion? They should not, based on what he has said.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Vic Althouse (Mackenzie, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
with care to the member for Frontenac. While I agree with his 
sentiments, he is attempting to define a role for the agriculture 
committee in the appointment of personnel for boards such as 
the grain commission.
<P>
	In reading the motion carefully I see that the amount of 
leeway available to the agriculture committee is very limited. 
Essentially all its members will be doing is deciding among the 
three to five people who currently are appointed to the 
commission which would be the chief commissioner and which 
would be the assistant chief. I get that reading in either 
language.
<P>
	Essentially what you will have, even if this becomes part of 
the law, is the governor in council or the cabinet appointing the 
three to five commissioners. After that process is finished the 
agriculture committee or designate would then recommend to 
the agriculture minister and to the governor in council, the 
cabinet, which of those three to five-however large the 
commission happens to be at the choice of the government of the 
day-would be the chief commissioner and which would be the 
assistants.
<P>
	That is not particularly important. I have no objection to it 
going into the bill but it does not change the power of members 
of the committee to decide which of a bunch of Liberal 
appointees, Conservative appointees, Reform appointees, or 
Bloc appointees might be considered the chief and which would 
be the assistant chief in the event that the chief could not act.
<P>
	I liked the arguments that the hon. member for Frontenac 
made when he argued that committees should have more power 
in the management of these commissions by proposing names. 
Unfortunately that is not what the proposed motion does. It only 
picks the three to five appointees and ranks them. That is really 
not a very important job even though it might set a bit of a 
precedent.

	I think that is the key to a transparent appointment process for 
the Canadian Grain Commission and I really see the members 
who will oppose it. It also gives the members of the agriculture 
and agri-food committee a new role.

<BLOCKQUOTE>Motion No. 2</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-51, in Clause 12, be amended by replacing lines 37 and 38, 
on page 6, with the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``et or receipt relates within one hundred and eighty days after the day on which''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Motion No. 4</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-51, in Clause 19, be amended by replacing line 9, on page 
11, with the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``grain in a licensed primary elevator, licensed terminal elevator or li''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Motion No. 5</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-51, in Clause 22, be amended by replacing lines 33 to 40, on 
page 11, with the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``81. (1) With respect to the purchase of western grain from the producer 
of that grain, every licensed grain dealer shall, at the prescribed time and in 
the prescribed manner,</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a) issue a grain receipt, elevator receipt or cash purchase ticket stating the 
grade name, grade and dockage of the grain, and immediately provide it to 
the producer, or</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(b) where no Canada grade name is applicable to the grain, issue a grain 
receipt, elevator receipt or cash purchase ticket stating the type of grain by 
name, value of the grain and dockage of the grain, and immediately provide 
it to the producer.''</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, these motions propose to achieve two 
things. One is to extend the time that grain may be left in an 
elevator before it is priced. In effect it will be extending the time 
from 90 to 180 days and provides additional protection to the 
farmer who left the grain for storage up to the 180 days.
<P>
	This is a reduction from the current law in which the 
protection lasts for one year. It would cut the time in half. The 
effect on farmers is that it forces them to price grain more 
quickly than is currently required. Ninety days in my estimation 
and in the estimation of a lot of producers is not a great deal of 
time. It forces them to unload the grain that has been delivered 
to commercial storage to await a price.
<P>
	Second, Motions Nos. 4 and 5 have the effect of including the 
designation, ``elevator receipt'' in the choices of paperwork that 
might be engaged in on delivery of grain to the various 
receivers.
<P>
	It is extremely important that an official elevator receipt be 
available on demand for the producer. I remind the House that 
the elevator receipt means a document in the prescribed form 
issued in respect of grain delivered to an elevator 
acknowledging receipt of the grain and subject to any conditions 
contained therein or in this act, entitling the holder of the 
document, who now be the farmer; (a) to delivery of grain of the 
same kind, grade and quantity as the grain referred to in the 
document or; (b) in the case of a document issued for specially 
binned grain, which is another designation under the act, to 
deliver the identical grain.
<P>
	With the inclusion of an elevator receipt we are permitting the 
producer to retain the exact amount and type of grain he has 
delivered. He has not yet given up ownership of it. He has only 
put it in storage and started it into the system.
<P>
	This is important in the event a grain dealer goes into 
bankruptcy. It permits the farmer to extract his grain from the 
institution and safeguards against what can only be described as 
rip-offs that have occurred in the past.
<P>
	Prior to the grains act being changed a couple of years ago, 
some processors actually accumulated thousands of bushels of 
grain and collected credit on them, when bankrupt, using the 
grains to relieve some of the  elements of their debt. In effect 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8618"> 8618 </A></B>
<P>
they were transferring the ownership of that grain from the 
farmer to themselves without any money having changed hands.
<P>
<B>(1230 ) </B>
<P>
	These amendments are designed to provide adequate 
protection for producers who use the wide variety of choices 
under the grains act. Therefore no matter what their choice they 
would have the same recourse to protection by the demand for 
the issuance of an elevator receipt. With my amendments this 
would give the producer the protection and knowledge that he 
would still be the owner and would still have the right to the sale 
of that grain.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to speak on the three amendments put forth by the hon. 
member for Mackenzie.
<P>
	The purpose of Motion No. 2 is to limit the time period for a 
grain dealer to meet the paper requirements to 180 days from the 
flexible type of arrangement under the Canada Grain Act right 
now. I do believe flexibility is needed.
<P>
	The Canadian Grain Commission has to be given the power to 
set different lengths of time for the different transportation 
situations and for the different types of dealers in the industry. It 
takes and requires that flexibility. The 180 days would end up 
setting a maximum which is too long for some grains and may be 
too short in the rare case. Flexibility is needed.
<P>
	We cannot support this motion because that flexibility is 
needed for the commission to operate properly.
<P>
	The intent of the motion is good. However we must consider 
the Canadian Grain Commission's overzealous enforcement in 
some cases and its unwise laxness in others as in the case of 
ensuring that companies are operating within the bonding level. 
While those concerns are there with some of the past dealings of 
the Canadian Grain Commission I believe it does need the 
flexibility in this case. Therefore we will oppose this motion.
<P>
	Motion No. 4 adds primary elevators to the list of terminal 
and transfer elevators in terms of facilities where the seller will 
have top priority. If the company that is operating should 
become bankrupt or insolvent the seller has the top priority, the 
first right to receive payment for grain that he has in storage in 
those facilities. This is a good amendment.
<P>
	It never did make sense to me that a farmer with grain in an 
elevator of a company that went bankrupt and was out of 
business would not have the first right to receive payment for his 
grain that was sitting in that facility. That is the case right now. 
Therefore we do support the amendment.
<P>
	Motion No. 5 adds the additional stipulation that in cases 
where no official Canada grade name is applicable to a grain 
under the Canada Grain Act, then the grain dealer shall 
immediately issue a receipt stating the name, the value and the 
dockage of the grain.
<P>
	While its intentions are good, this amendment will make it 
virtually impossible for speciality crop dealers along with 
others to operate. This is especially so in cases where farmers 
are loading directly on to a dealer car or a producer car or for 
truck pick up in the yard and these shipments are going into the 
United States. In cases like that it would make it virtually 
impossible for the sellers, the farmers and the dealer to do 
business.
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
	This recommendation restricts too much. Again the intention 
is good in that the concerns the member has are legitimate. In 
some cases now grain is being loaded on trucks without a grade 
given and without a value assigned.
<P>
	If that grain does not make it to its destination, what 
compensation can the farmer get? What proof has the farmer 
that the grain has been shipped other than the bill of lading, 
which a farmer should get from a trucker before loading?
<P>
	In the case of loading directly on a rail car, whether it be a 
dealer car or a producer car, it is just a copy of the paperwork 
that the farmer sends to the company and the Canadian Grain 
Commission. The company they are dealing with has not really 
been verified by anyone. How much weight would that carry in 
legal terms? Probably very little.
<P>
	In practical terms, how is the farmer going to weigh the grain 
that goes on to the car? How is the farmer going to weigh the 
grain that is put on a truck and is moving into the United States? 
There is no practical way.
<P>
	The cars of course are weighed when they go over the first 
scale on the track but in terms of grade and dockage, that has to 
be determined from the spill. In case of a spill, samples can be 
taken from the product.
<P>
	My personal experience with this is from people I have talked 
to who have had spills. One happened a couple of years ago by 
Innisfree in my constituency. The farmer felt that the 
compensation was fair. Dockage and grade was taken from the 
spill. A weight had not been taken but the farmer was paid out at 
the maximum load that was allowed on the car. Therefore the 
railways have treated farmers fairly in this regard.
<P>
	For those reasons I oppose this amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Althouse:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order, I was 
listening to the last debate and I wanted to clarify which motions 
had been grouped. My understanding is that it was Motions Nos. 
2, 4 and 5. I believe the hon. member was talking about Motion 
No. 6. It confuses the debate to have him opposing something we 
may not yet be talking about.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8619"> 8619 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The member is correct that it is 
Motions Nos. 2, 4 and 5. It is very difficult for members I am 
sure to keep track of what motion we are discussing.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order. Motions Nos. 5 
and 6 do deal with a very similar topic area, but the member is 
absolutely correct. I just spoke on Motion No. 6. A lot of the 
same rationale does apply to Motion No. 5. It is virtually the 
same rationale except we are not talking about transportation. 
We are talking about paperwork. The debate I have just given 
applies if it is translated to paperwork instead of transportation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean Landry (Lotbinière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is my 
pleasure to address Bill C-51, An Act to amend the Canada 
Grain Act and respecting certain regulations made pursuant to 
that Act. As you know, the Canadian Grain Commission has the 
responsibility to guarantee to purchasers of Canadian grain the 
quality and the quantity that they order, and to ensure the 
reliability and the wholesomeness of products intended for 
domestic and foreign markets.
<P>
	The government wanted to give more operational flexibility 
to the commission by amending the act. The amendments 
include changes to the current provisions on licensing and 
security. The Official Opposition tabled a motion regarding the 
appointment of the commissioners to the Canadian Grain 
Commission. Let me tell you that the public has had enough of 
partisan appointments and is tired of seeing heads roll as soon as 
a new government takes office.
<P>
	The amendment to clause 2, which will be discussed more 
thoroughly later on by a colleague of mine, must be adopted for 
reasons of transparency. Motions Nos. 2, 4 and 5, tabled by the 
NDP, deserve some consideration.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	The hon. member for Mackenzie proposes that the deadline 
set in clause 12 be changed. We cannot accept that amendment.
<P>
	The Canadian Grain Commission requires producers to do 
what is necessary to get paid for their grain, within 90 days of 
delivery to an elevator operator or a grain dealer. After this 
90-day period, a producer who did not get paid has 30 days to 
notify the commission. The 90-day period is fixed by 
regulation.
<P>
	In its amendment, the NDP proposes to set that period at 180 
days in the act. Thus, it would no longer be possible to change 
that period by regulation. The Canadian Grain Commission 
would see its flexibility to ensure payment for the grain within a 
reasonable period of time and especially to avoid bankruptcy be 
reduced.
<P>
	Do we need to remind the NDP that this time limit was set up 
following a Federal Court ruling in 1990, which held the 
Canadian Grain Commission responsible for the bankruptcy of 
two of its licensees? The security given by these two licensees 
was not enough and the  taxpayers had to make up the difference, 
which came to $3.8 million in this case.
<P>
	Let us just say that it would be better to avoid such incidents 
from now on. The 90-day time limit provided for in the 
regulations seems fair. This is why we urge members to vote 
against this motion.
<P>
	Motion No. 4 to amend Clause 19 is inappropriate, since we 
are not talking about the same type of elevator receipts. In the 
case of terminal elevators or transfer elevators, a receipt can be 
resold. The last holder has the priority to receive the grain. 
However, in the case of a primary elevator, the purchase or the 
sale is handled directly by the producer and the terminal 
operator.
<P>
	The elevator receipts are redeemable immediately. Even the 
Canadian Grain Commission does not see the need to add 
primary elevators to Clause 19 of this bill, because we are not 
talking about the same type of transactions.
<P>
	In Motion No. 5 concerning Clause 22, the NDP proposes that 
the commonly used name of some types of grain be stated on the 
grain receipt, or the elevator receipt, if no Canada grade name is 
applicable to the grain. After checking with the Canadian Grain 
Commission, it seems that almost every grain has a Canada 
grade name, even though it is not always well known.
<P>
	The amendment as proposed by the NDP could cause even 
more serious administrative problems than if everybody used 
the grade names. Greater responsibility is imposed on grain 
producers and operators to state the grade name, grade and 
dockage of the grain in order to help assess the value of the 
grain.
<P>
	Anyway, the Commission can exempt an elevator operation 
from using the grade. If the Commission releases the lesser 
known grades of some grains, people should be able to manage. 
In this case, we do not think the bill needs to be amended in this 
way.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lyle Vanclief (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
make a few comments on these three motions.
<P>
	First I will comment on Motion No. 2. As has already been 
said this motion which has been put forward by the member for 
Mackenzie sets out a definite date on which settlement would 
have to be made. Other members have commented today that 
there needs to be some flexibility. After a long period of 
consultation which has taken place on this the industry feels it 
should be 90 days. That is why it is there. If we were to prescribe 
in the bill that there be a set number of days, no matter what that 
was, there would be difficulty in the future. If the industry 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8620"> 8620 </A></B>
<P>
deemed it should change, it would take a change in the 
legislation to do so.
<P>
<B>(1245 ) </B>
<P>
	By doing this in 90 days, as will be suggested and done by the 
commission without having been carved in stone in the 
legislation, one of the things we have to keep in mind is to keep 
the money getting to the producers as quickly as it possibly can. 
If the producers were allowed to leave their grain in an elevator 
for a longer period of time those elevator operators would 
probably have to have a greater amount of security posted at all 
times because of the volume that might be there.
<P>
	Also, we want to get the dollars back to the producers as 
quickly as we can. We do not want to put the temptation out there 
for producers to leave the grain in the elevator a long period of 
time and start using it as a storage facility to hold their product 
so they might be able to speculate on the market as it goes along 
and maybe have some distorting influence on the price of the 
market.
<P>
	We certainly cannot support Motion No. 2 for those reasons if 
no others.
<P>
	On Motion No. 4, I want to point out to the member for 
Mackenzie that if he looks at section 112 of the act it already 
provides protection for the holders of primary elevator receipts. 
The section that he is referring to or suggesting that they make 
an amendment to is the section that deals only with terminal and 
transfer elevators. The provision that the member is requesting 
is looked after.
<P>
	The member for Vegreville raised the issue that the producers 
should have first claim. The producer does have first claim. The 
producers have first claim in any situation if the producers still 
maintain their receipt. If the producers wish to assign their 
receipt to somebody else well that may very well differ the 
situation. The producers do have first claim as long as they have 
that receipt.
<P>
	Motion No. 5 refers to the use of grades on a receipt when it is 
received. What we want to avoid here is the temptation that has 
been there in the past to not list the grade name. The elevator 
operator in the past, when they did not have to list the grade 
name, it was not necessary that they post security for that 
product in the elevator.
<P>
	We want to close that loop and close that possible gap, also 
recognizing that there may be times when that has to take place 
and that can take place and that the grade name does not have to 
be there. The elevator operator in that case, if it were a feed 
grain or something, could have that without a described grade on 
it providing that they agree with the commission that they 
provide security so there would have to be specific recognition 
and co-operation made in that case.

	He said: Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to speak to 
these three motions which have been put forward by the Reform 
Party.
<P>
	The purpose of Motion No. 3 is to allow grain dealers or the 
operators of primary or process elevators the ability to opt out of 
licensing under the Canada Grain Act. This amendment would 
remove from these operators all of the requirements and 
restrictions under the Canada Grain Act.
<P>
	This amendment also imposes certain conditions for opting 
out to make sure that it is very clear to people using these 
services that this particular dealer or elevator operator is not 
licensed and therefore meets no bonding requirements under the 
Canada Grain Act. That is an important protection which I think 
is necessary to make this opting out work.
<P>
	The Canadian Grains Commission must allow the opt out on 
the part of the dealer unless it can show good reason that this 
person should not be allowed to carry on business or that the 
facility is not a proper facility to carry on a business.
<P>
	All we are talking about there is the individual who is 
applying to carry on business should have a good credit rating, 
one that would not interfere with allowing him to carry on a 
business, and should not have a criminal record which would 
restrict him, which the commission would feel would not allow 
him to carry on his own business.
<P>
	Those are the only restrictions. Barring those restrictions an 
individual who wants to opt out should be allowed to opt out.
<P>
	This amendment would also allow those who have opted out 
to deal under the Canadian Grains Commission with grading and 
inspection services, to use its services. Unfortunately, it was not 
possible as far as I could tell to make this amendment require 
that the Canadian Grains Commission allow these opted out 
individuals to use its inspection and grading services. I would 
hope that the Canadian Grains Commission would feel an 
obligation because these people are in the grains industry and 
the Canadian Grains Commission says it is important to have the 
integrity in our business by having grading and inspection 
services. I would hope that the Canadian Grains Commission 
would allow for this  grading and inspection even for those who 
have opted out.
<P>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
	That is the purpose of this amendment and I believe that it 
would allow these opted out people to operate. They can of 
course provide security on their own through some type of 
private insurance, some type of bonding. It would also allow 
groups like the special grains people who have expressed a real 
concern with this bill to opt out and then, especially small 
dealers, opt out as a group and form their own group, put their 
own bonding or insurance in place. They could be under the 
umbrella of a special grains group for example. It would allow 
these individuals to operate still using official Canada grain 
names where it applies.
<P>
	I believe the purpose of this amendment would be allowed 
under these changes. Still, it would depend on the goodwill of 
the Canadian Grains Commission to allow for the grading and 
inspection services to be used because these people would have 
opted out completely from the requirements under the Canada 
Grains Act. That briefly is amendment number three. The hon. 
member for Kindersley-Lloydminster is going to speak later 
specifically about the special grains end of it later.
<P>
	I think we can talk about Motions Nos. 7 and 8 together. Both 
of these motions are simply there to delete the changes that have 
been made through Bill C-51 to the act. What it would do is have 
these sections revert to the old language of the Canada Grains 
Act which does not specifically state that the governor in 
council, the cabinet, has the power to overrule the Canadian 
Grains Commission in these areas.
<P>
	These two changes that were put into the Canada Grain Act 
under Bill C-51 specifically state that cabinet does have the 
power to overrule the Canadian Grains Commission.
<P>
	It is political interference with a body that is supposed to be an 
arm's length body, a regulatory body. Those who are in favour of 
making the change under Bill C-51 which gives the cabinet the 
final say state that really all it does is give cabinet a power that it 
has over the entire Canada Grain Act anyway. That is true to 
some extent because the cabinet does have control. The minister 
and the cabinet do have control of the Canada Grain Act.
<P>
	When I was in committee my question to the people in the 
Canadian Grains Commission who administer this act was why 
put these amendments in Bill C-51 which specifically 
designates this power to cabinet. I was given no answer.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8622"> 8622 </A></B>
<P>
	All I am asking is that these powers which are specified under 
these section of Bill C-51 are again left out as they originally 
were in the act. I cannot understand why the Liberal Party would 
oppose this change. I would like to trust that the exclusion of 
this was an oversight on the part of the people who drafted this 
new legislation. The only other reason for adding it is to give 
cabinet hands on, more direct control over the Canadian Grains 
Commission in these specific areas of the act. That is the only 
reason to leave them in.
<P>
	I would ask for support from all parties in the House.
<P>
<B>(1300) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réjean Lefebvre (Champlain, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will 
speak to the House about Bill C-51 and the grouping of motions 
3, 7 and 8. I will start with Motion No. 3. This motion presented 
by the member for Vegreville is the result of complaints voiced 
by western producers, in particular special crop dealers. I 
understand that the purpose of this motion is to make it possible 
for elevator operators or grain dealers to be exempted from the 
obligation to hold a licence for selling or buying grain.
<P>
	Before voting on the motion, we must consider the sections 
involved, as they appear in Bill C-51. According to what was 
explained to us, we understand that the amendment proposed by 
the bill is aimed at reinforcing the obligation to hold a licence. 
Bill C-51 clearly and explicitly prohibits the sale and purchase 
of grain without a licence. If a producer deals with an unlicensed 
merchant and if the latter goes bankrupt, the producer will 
receive no compensation from the CGC. Therefore, he does so at 
his own risk. The situation which led the CGC to include this 
provision in the bill could roughly be described as follows:
<P>
	Certain new elevator operators are in the business of cleaning 
grain from special crops; their neighbours, too, find it practical 
to deal with them because they are closer and, possibly, because 
it is cheaper since they are not licensed, thus saving on 
license-related costs.
<P>
	These costs can amount to as much as $20,000 a year. 
Eventually, the elevator operators offer to act as intermediaries 
for their customers and sell the grain they cleaned. It seems that 
there is some uncertainty in the act that would make this 
possible. This is why the government wants to go ahead and 
clarify this provision. The motion before us now would make it 
possible for small operators to be exempted from the obligation 
to hold a licence, thus allowing them to save the costs associated 
with such a licence.
<P>
	At the present time, all elevator operators and traditional 
grain dealers hold a licence certifying that they meet CGC 
standards. The commission prohibits anyone without a licence 
from buying or selling grain. The CGC demands that licensees 
post bonds equal to the value of their highest monthly 
transactions. The reason for this is very simple. If they want to 
deal in grains, they  have to prove that they have the financial 
capacity to do so.
<P>
	There is a system of securities guaranteeing payment of 
delivered grains in the event of bankruptcy of the elevator 
operator or grain dealer. In the past, the CGC, and consequently 
taxpayers, had to pay for shipments made to two elevator 
operators who went bankrupt. The cost was $3.8 million. The 
motion by the hon. member for Vegreville would be especially 
worthwhile for special crops since the government intends to 
introduce a bill on that subject in the spring.
<P>
	I suppose that we could then include a provision to that effect. 
What concerns me about the motion of the Reform Party is that it 
could lead to deregulation of the industry. With this motion, 
those who would apply for a licence exemption would get it 
unless the CGC proves that the elevator is not suitable for grain 
processing.
<P>
	Given the cost of a licence, well-established companies, like 
Cargill, could ask to be exempted and the commission would be 
unable to refuse. Consequently, despite the underlying good 
intention of the motion, I must reject it because of the risk of 
deregulation.
<P>
	As for Motions Nos. 7 and 8, grouped together, they puzzle 
me. They are mainly technical in nature. Lines 9 to 15 in clause 
33, and clause 34 have been added to the bill to allow the CGC to 
change grade names more quickly. Removing these would block 
the process. I will therefore oppose the motion.
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	The confusion started in 1988 when the CGC wanted to be 
able to react more quickly when new grades were needed. An 
amendment allowing for the creation of grades and grade names 
by regulation was adopted in 1988. Although the amendment 
dealt only with grades and grade names, the approval of the 
Governor in Council was needed. From 1990 to 1993, the CGC 
used an invalid procedure to modify grades and grade names of 
grains. Prior to 1988, grades and grade names were specified in a 
schedule to the act and could be modified only by legislative 
amendment.
<P>
	According to lawyers, a regulation made without Governor in 
Council approval cannot be implemented. The CGC did not see 
fit to have Sections 33 and 34 exempted from Governor in 
Council approval in order to speed up the process. Therefore, I 
will oppose the motion because we must abide by the law and 
also for the sake of efficiency.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I want to speak briefly to the Reform motions that 
would amend the Canada Grain Act. I particularly want to speak 
as they concern the special crop industry.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8623"> 8623 </A></B>
<P>
	I have spoken about the matter before in the House. I have a 
very relevant concern in that it is a growing industry in my 
constituency of Kindersley-Lloydminster. It is one of the 
bright spots in the agricultural industry throughout at least 
western Canada and possibly other parts of the country as well.
<P>
	There have been a couple of minor problems, not minor for 
those involved but minor in the scope of the entire industry. Two 
facilities ran into disrepute. The one in my constituency was the 
Klemmer seed company and the other was Pro Star. The 
producers that delivered to these companies were not adequately 
protected.
<P>
	The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Agriculture 
and Agri-Food is also aware of some of these concerns and 
problems. It may be part of the reason some of the current 
amendments are put forward to amend the Canada Grain Act. 
However there have been discussions with the industry and it is 
proposing further changes in the form of a new special crops act 
that would adequately protect those who deal with this new and 
growing industry.
<P>
	In the interim Motion No. 3 would, temporarily at least and 
ongoing if we did not change the act, allow special crop 
producers to opt out of the auspices of the Canada Grain Act 
which was first passed about 1912 and really does not fit the 
needs of the industry, because they are not Cargill, the 
Saskatchewan Wheat Pool or United Grain Growers. They are 
much smaller operators, almost taking the form of family farm 
operations in many instances. They not only provide valuable 
services to the special crops act but they are extending the 
viability of many rural communities through employment 
opportunities and through service to local producers in those 
areas.
<P>
	The industry is a very conscientious industry and is promoting 
changes and regulations to protect producers. It needs time for 
the government to enact a special crops act so it can function and 
protect producers who deal with the industry.
<P>
	Motion No. 3 would allow them to opt out of the auspices of 
the Canada Grain Act. That is not something that is unheard of in 
the current situation. For instance, right now feedlots which buy 
a lot of grain are able to opt out. They must clearly indicate that 
they are not under the constraints of the Canada Grain Act.
<P>
	The hon. member for Vegreville has indicated that the same 
provision should be made available to other players in the 
industry. They must clearly indicate that they are not under the 
auspices of the Canada Grain Act so that those who would deal 
with operations such as Klemmer and Pro Star would not be 
under any illusions that they were being protected by the Canada 
Grain Act.
<P>
<B>(1310 ) </B>
<P>
	There have been a lot of allegations of political interference 
particularly in the Klemmer case. We may never know the full 
story behind that situation, but it is clear producers must be 
aware of where they are  protected by the Canadian Grain 
Commission and where they are not protected.
<P>
	With this motion the hon. member for Vegreville is 
attempting to clarify that and allow the special grains people to 
opt out so they can bring in their own special crops act, which 
would clearly protect producers who deal with them. Unlicensed 
individuals may still buy and sell using Canadian Grain 
Commission approved grade names if the commission would 
agree. It could perhaps even charge a modest user fee to provide 
that service.
<P>
	As far as Motions Nos. 7 and 8 are concerned, they apparently 
clarify and revert to how the old act was structured. The 
amendments as put forward in Bill C-51 would clarify and give 
far more power to cabinet or to order in council decisions 
affecting the Canadian Grain Commission. If anything, we 
should be moving the other way where this quasi-judicial body 
would be at arm's length and cabinet would not be interfering in 
the daily work of the Canadian Grain Commission.
<P>
	I also ask the House to consider support for Motions Nos. 7 
and 8 so we can have better legislation to facilitate the work of 
the industry and we can see it progress rather than revert to the 
days of 1912.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lyle Vanclief (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
make a few comments on the three motions before us in this 
grouping, the first one being Motion No. 3.
<P>
	I have to question something because I cannot quite figure out 
where Reformers are coming from when they talk about wanting 
some people to opt out. They want the Canadian Grain 
Commission to make the decision on whether somebody can opt 
out or cannot opt out. Let us look at the practical application of 
that. If someone asked for permission to opt out and the 
Canadian Grain Commission thought there might be some 
requirement for the elevator or operator and it was not totally 
satisfied the security was there without a legal bonding or 
security being posted, the commission could say that he should 
not opt out. What message does that send?
<P>
	In other cases, as has been mentioned, some larger grain 
companies that might be considered to have all kinds of backing 
could opt out. As the member from the Bloc said, I could see a 
total breakdown in regulation and therefore deregulation of who 
was secure and who was not secure.
<P>
	Having farmed for many years myself, not in the west 
admittedly but taking grains to elevators, I know farmers are 
busy. There is an assumption that if we know some elevators 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8624"> 8624 </A></B>
<P>
have bonding or security we assume that probably others do. We 
could end up in a situation where an elevator had security posted 
and 20 or 30 miles away an elevator might have security posted 
because it chose to.
<P>
	It is certainly not the intention of the government to leave in 
place a situation where everybody is not treated in the same way. 
Hopefully it will be some comfort to members that the Canadian 
Grain Commission realizes every operator out there does not do 
the same amount of business. They may not have a large volume 
of product in their facility or on their site at any one time. There 
is work being done as far as how smaller operators can 
collectively post bond or securities so they can be covered. We 
have to remember that.
<P>
	What would it do as far as competitiveness between dealers or 
elevator operators is concerned if one had further costs due to 
posting security and another one down the road, 100 miles away 
or even 10 miles away, did not have those costs? It is certainly 
our intention to treat everybody fairly. It is not our intention at 
this time to encourage or to allow some dealers to be in the 
system and some dealers to be out.
<P>
<B>(1315) </B>
<P>
	In reference to the comments from the member for 
Kindersley-Lloydminister as far as special grains, he is right. 
The government is working with the industry to put a special act 
in place to cover those, the peculiarities and specific 
requirements there. There was some concern that we do it in Bill 
C-51 but the general feeling was that there were some things in 
this bill that we could and should do and get out of the way rather 
than holding all those things up. I see the member is nodding his 
head yes, get those done and then work with the special crops 
people to look after their needs which are otherwise there.
<P>
	As far as Motions Nos. 7 and 8 are concerned, again I find the 
comments from Reform Party members confusing. It seems that 
if members of that party have questions on something that has 
happened in agriculture they do not like, the first person they 
turn to is the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food and ask: 
``Why did you allow that to happen? It is in your ministry, your 
department. Why did you allow that to happen?''
<P>
	What we are asking here and what it does is it gives the 
minister the final say, the governor in council. The minister 
would have an opportunity to comment on it. It gives the 
minister the final say on these types of actions and that is where 
the responsibility is going to end up.
<P>
	The intention is not to get into the day to day operations of the 
commission. If there are questions, these things will have had to 
be approved by the minister and the governor in council. This 
will enable the answering of questions the Reform Party seems 
to be in the habit of asking the minister as to why he allowed 
something to happen. It gives the minister the opportunity to 
review those types of decisions before they happen.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Vic Althouse (Mackenzie, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
just a few short words on these amendments.
<P>
	Motion No. 3 proposes to allow people who operate a primary 
or process elevator or who carry on business as a grain dealer 
without being licensed under this act to apply to the commission 
to be exempted under paragraph 17(b) of the act. In effect it sets 
out a class that is not particularly well defined which may apply 
for exemption under the Canada Grain Act. That is probably 
rather dangerous for us.
<P>
	We would probably be better to await a specialty crops act and 
deal with these kinds of issues properly. There is the possibility 
for the kind of anomaly that was raised by our friends from the 
Bloc. One of the large players might decide to opt out. It would 
make the whole marketing practice that Canada has been 
engaged in since the turn of the century very suspect.
<P>
	What we have now is a system where product identification is 
absolutely secure. It is guaranteed in Canada. This is one of the 
tools that Canada has used for almost 100 years to break into 
markets. We are the quality product. We have made Canadian

	We have to take some care in allowing people to opt out. I am 
sure that McDonald's would not permit some of its franchisees 
to opt out and still go on selling Big Macs. We have not 
designated with this opting out process whether Canada No. 1 
can still be sold as Canada No. 1 even though there is a 
disclaimer on the bill of lading saying that the dealer did not 
comply with the Canada Grain Act. Customers are not going to 
understand this. It is only going to reflect badly on all Canadian 
farm produce. We would be just as well to stay away from it.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Vic Althouse (Mackenzie, NDP)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Motion No. 6</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-51, in Clause 25, be amended</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a) by replacing line 16, on page 12, with the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``84. (1) Except with the written permission of'';</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(b) by adding after line 24, on page 12, the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``(2) Except with the written permission of the Commission or in 
accordance with prescribed terms and conditions, no public carrier shall 
transport grain unless it has first been weighed, the dockage established and 
the quality designated.''</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, technically this motion divides what is 
now section 84 in the act. The bill we have in front of us 
proposes to amend section 84 in the act into subsections (1) and 
(2). In clause 25 of the bill before us now it would become 
subsection 84(1) and we would add a subsection (2) which 
would read:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(2) Except with the written permission of the commission or in 
accordance with the prescribed terms and conditions, no public carrier shall 
transport grain unless it has first been weighed, the dockage established and 
the quality designated.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	There are two reasons for this. One is to make it easier to track 
grains that might be subject to bankruptcy procedure and as well 
to look forward to the new technology which is now being 
introduced into western Canada. It is the portable elevator which 
is a very large tandem truck with two units behind it. It has the 
ability to weigh grain as it goes in. The truck driver does the 
dockage testing and provides a grade. It makes certain that 
particular process which some companies are now engaged in is 
done in a way that provides the kind of paperwork transactions 
that will protect the producer.
<P>
	The prospect of watching 2,000 bushels of flax or peas walk 
off the farm maybe to disappear without the proper paperwork in 
the event that particular grain dealer turns out to not have been 
properly bonded is not one a farmer looks forward to. This 
attempts to address that by requiring these kinds of operations to 
do the same paperwork as elevators do.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to make a few comments on Motion No. 6. The purpose of 
this motion is to add to transportation requirements for grain 
being shipped out of Canada the stipulation that unless an 
exemption has been provided for under the act which is already 
available, that the seller of the grain, the farmers in most cases, 
be provided with documentation stating the weight, dockage and 
quality of the grain. That is the intent.
<P>
<B>(1325 ) </B>
<P>
	There is a concern no doubt that when farmers load their 
trucks, as the hon. member just explained, not knowing the 
grade, the weight and the dockage then they are trusting that the 
people at the other end will give the proper payment for the 
commodity. That is a concern. Who would like to see a truckload 
containing $10,000 or $20,000 worth of commodity in extreme 
cases going out of the yard and not knowing exactly what they 
are going to be paid for?
<P>
	However, I believe this amendment does not provide a 
solution. Instead, for farmers and businesses that are operating 
in this way with pickups on the farm or by producer cars, dealer 
cars, rail cars, it would make it very difficult if not virtually 
impossible for them to operate.
<P>
	While I would like to know that every time farmers are 
shipping a load of grain off the farm they know they are getting 
paid for it, if we look at the practicalities it just is not possible. 
We have to recognize that. For that reason I oppose the 
amendment.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
purpose of the motion standing in the name of the hon. member 
for Mackenzie is to add standards for public carriers. It would 
prescribe that grain carried by a public carrier must first have 
been weighed and cleaned and its quality designated.
<P>
	According to the Canadian Grain Commission, no amendment 
is necessary since this is already being done in most cases and 
always when grain is destined for human consumption.
<P>
	As a result of the proposed amendment, smaller producers 
who ship feed grain would see their costs increase 
unnecessarily. If there had been complaints that the quality of 
feed grain was below acceptable levels, the motion would be 
justified. Since that is not the case, at least as far as I know, I do 
not think it would be useful to oblige producers to spend more on 
precautions that are absolutely unnecessary. If most of these 
producers happen to use private carriers and the motion 
therefore does not affect them, it will then have no effect at all, 
since public carriers would only carry grain for human 
consumption.
<P>
	According to the Canadian Grain Commission, this grain is 
already cleaned and weighed and its quality designated. So we 
have their guarantee that grain for our  own consumption is 
<P>

<B><A NAME="8626"> 8626 </A></B>
<P>
being handled in the way specified by the hon. member for the 
New Democratic Party.
<P>
	Furthermore, if small producers also have to conform to these 
procedures, their costs will go up, although we have no reason to 
believe they should be more regulated than they already are. 
And if they use private carriers, they will not be affected.
<P>
	I therefore fail to see the relevance of the motion presented by 
the hon. member for Mackenzie. That is why the Bloc Quebecois 
will not support the motion, since all wheat for human 
consumption is very well regulated and perfectly safe.

<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lyle Vanclief (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will say at 
the outset that the government does not have any intention of 
supporting the motion. I will give a few of the reasons for it. 
There is no question in my mind that what is said in the motion is 
a bit confusing versus what may or may not be its intent.
<P>
	It would have a definite impact in the industry of slowing 
down the movement of grain whether transported by truck, 
producer car or dealer car. Therefore it would increase the cost 
to producers, which is certainly not the intention of the 
government.
<P>
	At the present time the weight, the grade and the dockage 
content of grain delivered by a producer or dealer car are 
immediately determined at the unload. That is the system. To 
have to do that as the car or truck is being unloaded would 
certainly slow things up and add a cost. It would also put an 
additional obligation on the public carriers to have with them at 
all times the documentation on the grade and dockage. It would 
shift some of the responsibility to public carriers for having the 
documentation available at all times.
<P>
	In practical terms, the motion would mean that when a 
truckload of grain to be delivered to a local feed mill was loaded 
by the producer on the farm it would have to be graded. The 
dockage, the weight and everything would have to be with it to 
take a load of grain to a local feed mill. That would be absolutely 
unnecessary. It would be cumbersome. It would slow everything 
up and be expensive.
<P>
	We do not intend to support the motion.

Mr. Speaker, Guelph-Wellington is enriched daily by the

	<B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, an 
Ontario judge has ruled that General Motors Corp. did not act 
properly when it fired a supervisor for using offensive language 
and making sexual innuendos in the presence of five subordinate 
female employees. According to the judge, sexually explicit 
language was the norm in the GM security service.
<P>
	Members of the Bloc Quebecois are concerned about the 
implications of such a decision on present and future cases when 
they go to trial. This decision implies that sexual harassment 
cannot be invoked when the culture of a given service or 
company allows this type of behaviour.
<P>
	In 1987, the Supreme Court of Canada clearly established, in 
the Robichaud case, that employers are responsible for sexual 
harassment in the work place. The decision of this Ontario judge 
reduces the scope of the Supreme Court decision, and we find 
that regrettable.
<P>
	This decision is a step backward in our fight for zero tolerance 
of sexual assault against women. We must oppose it.

to say on behalf of my caucus how pleased we are that he is 
recuperating.
<P>
	When I arrived at Edmonton International Airport on 
Thursday evening I received the news of his frightening illness. 
I was stunned, as were all Canadians. I lay awake almost all 
night thinking of him, praying that he would live through the 
night and that the doctors treating him would have real wisdom.
<P>
	I will always remember the years that the Leader of the 
Opposition and I sat side by side in the House, from the summer 
of 1990 until the election of 1993. We talked about the birth of 
his two sons, Alexandre and Simon. His eyes would light up 
when he spoke of them, of the incredible joy they have brought 
to him and his wife, Audrey.
<P>

will benefit greatly from ethanol. So will the environment of 
Asia, Chinese farmers and industry. This technology can also 
benefit Canada.
<P>
	The proposed ethanol plant to be located at Chatham, Ontario

confidence in the Canadian Wheat Board by electing 10 strong 
supporters of the agency to its 11 member advisory board. They 
have rejected the efforts of a small but vocal group that wanted 
to weaken the board and implement a dual marketing system. 
Their vote was a sweeping endorsement of the board and single 
desk selling.
<P>
	It is a recognition of the outstanding job that the wheat board 
has done selling Canadian grain, expanding export markets and 
working with farmers to make Canada a world leader in 
agricultural production.

continually insist they are helping small business through 
regional development.
<P>
	The Business Council on National Issues had but one 
suggestion for the federal government: ``Just say no''. The 
Canadian Aerospace Industry said: ``We have seen attempts to 
create pseudo-competition by region in this county by pitting 
companies against each other supported by tax dollars. This has 
resulted in wasted energy, misguided marketing, lost 
opportunity, squandered money, and all too frequently, failed 
enterprises''.

might as well amalgamate the regional development programs. 
He could then create a new crown corporation called ``Pork

	After successful negotiations, the town of Paris and Canada 
Post have reached an agreement under which the town will

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="MILDAVIESHIPYARD">MIL DAVIE SHIPYARD</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, by 
refusing to take a firm stand on the Hibernia contract issue, the 
government has made another move which, combined with the 
actions of the Minister of Transport and the Minister of Industry, 
will lead MIL Davie straight to disaster.
<P>
<B>(1415) </B>
<P>
	We learned over the weekend that the Minister of Industry had 
been keeping secret for more than a year a report on Canadian 
shipyards that urged the government to depend only on a small 
number of shipyards and drop MIL Davie.
<P>
	In light of the unfair treatment of MIL Davie by the Hibernia 
consortium and the failure of the government to follow through 
with the Magdalen Islands ferry contract, does the Deputy Prime 
Minister recognize that all the actions of her government are 
being dictated by this secret report to the Minister of Industry, 
which has the MIL Davie slated for closure?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, first of all, before 
answering the hon. member's question, let me say that I was 
relieved to learn that the Leader of the Opposition was on his 
way to recovery. In the months to come, he will have to exhibit 
incredible strength, something we all know he is capable of, and 
we wish him much courage in getting better. Knowing the 
Leader of the Opposition-he is a real fighter-we are confident 
that he will return quickly.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In the name of all Canadians I would wish the Leader of the 
Opposition a very speedy recovery. The whole of Canada was 
watching the events of the last few days. Our hearts go out to 
him and to his family. We wish his speedy return to the House.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8631"> 8631 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Copps:</B> To answer the question, Mr. Speaker, of course 
the government of Canada, through the Prime, has expressed 
disagreement with the policy adopted by the Hibernia 
consortium. We are aware of the possibility and support 
tendering. Unfortunately, we are dealing with a private sector 
consortium that is entitled to make its own decisions and, in 
spite of the views expressed by the government of Canada, it has 
decided not to proceed to a call for tenders, as we felt would 
have been proper and fair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
asked the Minister of Industry several questions in this House on 
saving the MIL Davie shipyard.
<P>
	Are we to understand from the answers of the industry 
minister, who has always hidden behind the lack of an MIL 
Davie business plan to avoid facing his responsibilities, that 
what he really wanted was to follow up on the secret report he 
has been hiding in his department for over a year, which 
proposes closing MIL Davie, and that the minister lacks the 
courage to say so frankly?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, I wonder if the hon. member is big enough to admit, 
first of all, that MIL Davie's shareholder is responsible for 
announcing its position on the MIL Davie corporate plan 
submitted by the former Quebec government. That is first and 
foremost the shareholder's responsibility. That is what I said 
several times.
<P>
	Yes, there was a report. That is no secret. The <I>Financial Post</I> 
obtained it on request. That is normal. That is the position of 
someone who was a consultant. That is not necessarily my 
position or the government's. Moreover, if MIL Davie wants to 
succeed, it must do so on global markets. That is what I said 
several times here.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	For any company to succeed in the modern marketplace it 
must produce goods at a price the world is willing to pay to 
acquire them. That is first and foremost for any company the 
responsibility of its management and its shareholders to 
determine.
<P>
	When we hear the point of view of the Quebec government on 
the MIL Davie business plan, when we know whether its unions 
are willing to support it, perhaps then we can respond 
accordingly to any further request we have on their behalf.
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
minister knows full well that some contracts were necessary to 
allow MIL Davie to reorganize. Instead of acting as his 
responsibilities called for, the minister has always hidden 
behind the lack of so-called business plans.
<P>
	Are we to understand that after demanding that Quebec make 
90 per cent of the efforts to rationalize shipyards in Canada, the 
federal government's only goal, after closing the Sorel-Tracy 
shipyard and the Vickers shipyard in Montreal, is to close 
Quebec's third major and last remaining shipyard, MIL Davie, 
so that the shipyards in the Maritime provinces can survive?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, maybe using statistics for demagogic purposes is a 
good strategy. In fact, Quebec's share of shipyard 
rationalization is 30 per cent. Please, Mr. Speaker, let us stick to 
the facts.
<P>
	Second, I wish to say to the hon. member that it is not a matter 
of hiding. I think it is essential for a company seeking help from 
the taxpayers in Canada and Quebec to have a good corporate 
plan that has been approved by shareholders and workers alike. 
At that point, we can make a move with MIL Davie.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I cannot understand why the member is not willing to say that 
we have to find a long term solution. If he would look at the 
business plan that has been presented, he would understand the 
business plan does not claim that the long term solution to MIL 
Davie is one contract turned over from anybody. The long term 
solution involves fundamental readjustment of that company to 
a new marketplace.

	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development. 
Yesterday, the Minister of Human Resources Development 
greatly disappointed the young unemployed people who had 
come to discuss his reform of social programs with him. A 
participant asked him: ``Where are these jobs? Tell me; I am 
ready to work''.
<P>
	Why does the minister have nothing else to offer young 
people who want to work, who want real jobs, than a so-called 
reform whose main purpose is to make cuts at their expense? 
They will be the second-class unemployed. They will have to go 
into debt to pay their tuition fees, which will double. Why?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as the hon. member should 
know, last Friday Statistics Canada released its latest job report. 
It pointed out that for the first time in six years the jobless rate 
had dropped to below 10 per cent; in fact it is 9.6 per cent.
<P>
	Much more important, in the last 11 months 414,000 full time 
jobs have been created. That is the fastest growing job rate of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8632"> 8632 </A></B>
<P>
any industrial country in the world. The unemployment rate for 
young people dropped a full two percentage points during the 
same period of time.
<P>
	We are living up to our commitment to create jobs. If the hon. 
member would go back to her own riding and look at it, she 
would see that the job rate dropped over the past 11 months by 
3.1 per cent. It is now below 9 per cent. That is real job creation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
sure that the Minister of Human Resources Development is not 
pleased that 1,364,000 people are still without work, not 
counting all those who are looking for work and are not declared 
as unemployed.
<P>
<B>(1425) </B>
<P>
	Does the minister admit that if he had wanted to do just one 
thing to help create jobs, he should have reduced unemployment 
insurance premiums in September, when he knew that the fund 
had ten times as much as he wanted when he promised to reduce 
UI premiums: $2.7 billion compared to $240 million?
<P>
	Young people would have benefited the most from these new 
jobs.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the fact is that on January 1 
the premium rate on unemployment insurance drops down to $3 
per hundred. We have already taken the step we committed to in 
the last budget and the premium rate is coming down.
<P>
	While the hon. member is exaggerating a number of figures, I 
remind her that she should recognize at the end of this year the 
cumulative deficit for the UI fund will be over $3 billion. Until 
we get that cumulative deficit down, because it is a real drag on 
the economy, we will not be in a position to make changes. By 
the time of the next budget I am sure we will be in a position to 
have a better report or a better analysis. In the meantime we have 
to move to get that $3 billion deficit out of the way.

	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, one of the promises in the red book was for more 
transparent government. I have not read the fine print but I do 
not think that meant government leaks.
<P>
	Today the industry minister's orange paper takes it place with 
the GST report, the HRD green book, the justice minister's 
action plan on gun control and the defence white paper. All were 
conveniently leaked to the media before the official 
announcements were made. The government's complete 
disregard for Parliament reinforces fears of Liberal arrogance.
<P>
	My question is for the Deputy Prime Minister. Why is the 
government showing such disdain for the House of Commons 
and what is it doing to end these leaks?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I assure the hon. member that it was out of a desire to 
present the next paper in our series of papers on the economy 
that I decided to make the presentation in the House of 
Commons this afternoon, which I will be doing immediately 
following question period.
<P>
	For that matter, I want the hon. member to know that there is 
no obligation either under the rules of the House or otherwise to 
make such a presentation in the House. I want to assure him that 
we will be very interested in hearing his support for a plan which 
should help build a more innovative economy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the government totally missed the point.
<P>
	The problem is that leaks are occurring and they are 
unprecedented. Leaks to the media must be at the top of every 
government communications plan. The government leaks like a 
badly fitting diaper. The government is making a mockery of the 
House of Commons with every proposal it produces. While 
opposition MPs are sworn to secrecy and they are stuck in 
departmental lockups, Liberal spin doctors are out descending 
on the media like locusts.
<P>
	My supplementary question is for the Deputy Prime Minister. 
Are these leaks part of a deliberate communications strategy on 
the part of the government?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have a certain amount of experience with fitting 
diapers. We always preferred the reusable rather than the 
disposable in our household.
<P>
	I assure the hon. member it would be of very great concern if 
information were leaked that could either affect the markets or 
could lead to somebody prospering inadvertently or indirectly. 
In the case of the information I have seen published as a result of 
these documents having reached the public domain, no such case 
will occur.
<P>
	I assure him that the participation of members of Parliament 
in discussion coming from the proposals we put forward in the 
action plan is of great importance to us.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I could quote instances when the Liberals were on 
this side of the House and they condemned the government for 
leaks. They are promoting more leaks that are far worse than the 
previous government did.
<P>

<P>
<HR>

<P>
	Time and time again they place political strategy ahead of

<P>
<B>(1430 ) </B>
<P>
	They seem to think that polls give them a blank cheque to do 
as they please. I have news for this leak infested government. 
Reform MPs are tired of its arrogance and it is starting to wear 
thin on Canadians too.
<P>
	Will the government investigate this process of leaking 
proposals and reports before they are even tabled in the House? 
Will it take the appropriate and necessary action?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the point is being missed here. Most of the matters I 
have seen reported in the newspapers today were matters which 
were debated and discussed in various fora over quite a number 
of months. In many ways what we see today is the culmination of 
many months of consultation, of discussion and of thought 
which have been engaged in among members of Parliament as 
well as in the House.
<P>
	I know the member is concerned about this because he 
recognizes the strategic importance of this document. I hope for 
that reason he will take the opportunity afforded to him to study 
it, to read it, to make further suggestions. I believe it plays an 
important part in the gradual unfolding of an active government 
policy on economic development in Canada.

<P>
	More than two months after he tabled his working paper on 
social program reform and two weeks before the public 
consultations end, the minister has tabled only four of the nine 
technical papers that are to lay out the directions of his plan. 
This delay suggests the worst, especially as far as education and 
welfare are concerned.
<P>
	In view of the urgency of making all the relevant information 
public, so that a real debate can take place on this reform which 
will directly affect millions of Quebecers and Canadians, how 
does the minister justify this delay?

<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources

papers will be tabled publicly within the next 10 days.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, does 
the minister not agree that this delay and the lack of information 
in the papers already tabled, as the Auditor General pointed out, 
are because the minister has gone ahead with this reform 
blindly, just so that he can make the cuts required by the 
Minister of Finance?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, that may be the case but I 
just read a large scale national survey this week. It showed that 
96 per cent of Canadians believe major changes have to be made 
in social policy. It may be that the hon. member does not 
understand but 96 per cent of Canadians are in favour of what we

	<B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Okanagan Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Industry. It appears 
the industry strategy seems to be one of shuffling money around, 
not reduction in spending. Yet this morning the Minister of 
Industry stated on ``Canada A.M.'' that his departmental budget 
would be reduced by as much as 50 per cent by the end of the 
third year. That is two years from now or less than that.
<P>
	Can the minister tell us specifically what will be cut?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will not disclose that. As the member knows we are 
involved in an ongoing process of program review which is in 
effect, as the Prime Minister announced in September in Quebec 
City, a basic review of each and every program in every 
department and agency of the Government of Canada from 
bottom up.
<P>
	I believe this review is important. It is a vital part of our own 
plan in order to achieve our objective of reaching 3 per cent of 
GDP as the level of the deficit by the third year of the mandate. 
In the industry department we are prepared to make the changes 
that, as the member indicates, will result in an overall budget 
decrease of almost 50 per cent by the third year of the mandate.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Okanagan Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, that is exactly the answer I expected the minister to 
give.
<P>
	I think it is about time that we get down to some specifics 
rather than these generalizations. It has been very clear that 
Canadian business has said the best way for government to 
create a competitive environment is to reduce taxes. Yet there is 
no such statement in the industrial strategy.

my question is for the Minister of Human Resources

<P>
	On September 19, here on Parliament Hill, the minister 
promised Ogilvie Mills workers that, by December, he would 
table amendments to the Canada Labour Code, introducing 
anti-scab provisions. Yesterday, the minister reneged on his 
promise, giving as a pretext that his department was preparing 
another bill on pay equity.
<P>
	How can the minister justify his about-face regarding the 
need to introduce anti-scab provisions in the Canada Labour 
Code? How can he justify his about-face, except by an obvious 
lack of political courage?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, no, it just means that we 
are doing a very thorough job of consulting with business, 
labour unions and other parties that would be affected. We are 
trying to do a major rewrite of labour codes. I have assigned the 
assistant deputy minister for labour to undertake that process. 
He is busily engaged at the present time reviewing the various 
aspects and a fairly broad based set of proposals. As soon as that 
is ready we will present the appropriate legislation to the House 
of Commons.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernard St-Laurent (Manicouagan, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
how can the minister justify his refusal to table a bill before

is required is a few amendments to the Canada Labour Code?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member should 
know that it is not as easy as that. Certainly our experience over 
the last several months is that when we table amendments the 
members opposite usually hold up that legislation for weeks and 
months on end.
<P>
	I have asked our assistant deputy minister to make sure that 
we have a very carefully assessed, very carefully judged set of 
reforms and proposals to make to the labour code.
<P>

of the workplace, reform and modernizing our whole labour 
relations is the key to economic growth and development. 
Therefore we want to make sure that we do it right.

value of loans it guarantees under the Small Businesses Loans

loses about $100 million a year.

	Would the Minister of Industry tell the House why taxpayers 
should underwrite Canadian banks by assuming liabilities that 
should properly fall to entrepreneurs and banks, not taxpayers?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there are really two questions there. The first one is 
why should there be a Small Businesses Loans Act program in 
the first place. The answer to that is very simply that the primary 
reason for getting loan capital to many small businesses is to 
provide some government guarantee, thereby offsetting the fact 
that many small businesses lack the security they require in 
order to otherwise borrow from the banks.
<P>

<P>
	In answer to the question about subsidies, I would like to 
assure the hon. member that we are proposing changes to the

and taxes?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Let me say, 
Mr. Speaker, that I am sure the member will agree with the thrust 
of the document which we will be tabling today. It does 
recognize the fact that the key to continued economic growth 
and job creation is going to be the private sector and that it is 
important for government to do as much as it can to stay out of 
the way of the growth and job creation potential of the private 
sector.
<P>
	That is how we intend to move the economy forward so that as 
the cycles go up and down overall we see a general gain in 
employment levels as well as in productivity and the economy. 
That is the key to it.
<P>
	Do we need to reduce spending? Yes, we need to reduce 
spending. That was the purpose behind the consultation process 
that my colleague, the Minister of Finance, launched in this 
House and in the finance committee a few weeks ago. It is 
toward that end that we will be working in this February's 
budget.

somatotropin?

<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources

friends of ministers. Which  one of these incompatible ministers 
are we supposed to understand?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, not only have I not made the statement the member 
alludes to but I would say to him that he has made a startling 
allegation and it is incumbent upon him to provide facts, dates, 
numbers and names. We will be happy to look at them.
<P>
	Let me say also that a key component of an economic 
development strategy has to be one that recognizes the 
differences that exist among and between the regions of this 
country. We have a very large country with quite a varied 
economy.
<P>
	The role played by the federal government in understanding 
the differences among regions, in meeting the needs and 
requirements of sectors as diverse as those in natural resources 
as well as those in the manufacturing and new advanced 
technology sectors is one which requires a great deal of 
co-ordination across government. That is what we are 
endeavouring to do.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
could have retracted one statement because these people do not 
have too many friends.
<P>
	We are releasing a report this week on regional development 
which showcases the government assisted gravy train which is 
off the tracks.
<P>
	The Minister of Industry is on record as opposing massive 
grants and subsidies to businesses. Therefore, what assurance 
can he give the business community and Canadian taxpayers 
that he will fight the difficult decision among the ministers of 
goodies who have two different messages coming out, one from 
two ministers of goodies and another from the Minister of 
Industry?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, let us try to keep some perspective on what we are 
trying to accomplish here.
<P>
	The member will know the concern I have about assistance to 
business is that it be very strategic in target. That is in line with 
the strategy other ministers who have responsibility for 
economic development are pursuing.
<P>
	As the member will know, we need to make sure our 
investment in economic development is strategic. It is targeted 
and focused. It recognizes the need to recognize those sectors in 
which high risks are prominent, in which other countries are 
providing assistance to their businesses, in which the markets 
for goods and services being produced are international and 
therefore subject to the discipline of international marketplaces.
<P>
	Those are criteria that apply to regions. Those are criteria that 
apply to sectors. We have been very consistent in seeking to put 
our assistance to business programs on that kind of footing.

<P>
	Yesterday in Budapest, the Minister of Foreign Affairs said 
that we should give the search for peace in the former 
Yugoslavia a last chance and that he used the expression ``last 
chance'' because he thought an agreement was not far off. 
Meanwhile, the Bosnian Serbs still refuse to listen to reason and

the United States and Russia.

	<B>Hon. David Collenette (Minister of National Defence and

country believes the only way out of the terrible tragedy which 
is unfolding in the former Yugoslavia is through a negotiated

Canadians are still being detained in Bosnia, and I think that, 
following the release of 53 Dutch and British soldiers, we first 
want to ensure the release of our soldiers over there.

the pressure is being kept up at all levels, including the CSCE,

	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Industry.
<P>
	The Department of Western Economic Diversification has 
loaned $670 million to companies in the four western provinces 
since the Tories invented the department. Only about 25 per cent 
of those loans are currently being repaid. Many experts predict 
that the default rate will be in the 40 per cent range.
<P>
	Given that the minister has publicly stated he is not in favour 
of massive subsidies and that he said earlier today that he 
favours private sector development, is he prepared to admit that 
regional development programs are not effective ways of 
enhancing Canada's economy?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, first I would like to say to 
the hon. member that both his facts and his assessment are 
wrong.
<P>
	We have made major changes in western economic 
development so that we are not giving large grants to large 
businesses. We are now providing basic assistance to firms with 
under 50 employees so that we can help them deal with some of 
the challenges in the export market, such as meeting quality 
testing and other kinds of requirements.
<P>
	I will give one example. A few months ago we were able to 
assist with a very small grant of $200,000 the Vancouver based 
firm Northstar which allowed it to secure a $30 million line of 
credit with one of Canada's major banks so that the firm could 
provide export financing for small business. Since then the firm 
has already had 2,000 applications for financing of small 
business export development around the world.
<P>
	It seems to me that was one very good investment that will 
help thousands of western Canadian companies secure new 
markets. The hon. member should get his facts straight.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, speaking 
about facts, perhaps the minister could get his facts straight. 
One good investment out of $1.2 billion worth of regional funds 
is not good enough in this country.
<P>
	Since the Minister of Industry will not answer the question, 
my supplemental is for the Minister of Human Resources 
Development. There is a world of difference between 
entrepreneurs taking risks with their own money and taking 
risks with other people's money, especially when it is the 
taxpayers who will have to pay the interest on the borrowed 
funds and the defaulting loans.
<P>
	What does the minister consider as an acceptable level of risk 
from his Department of Western Economic Diversification as it 
continues to flush taxpayers' money down the drain? Where is 
the rest of the justification on the $1.2 billion?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if the hon. member knew 
anything about the way the program worked rather than just 
repeating a bunch of mythology and garbage he has heard from 
other people he would realize that most of the money is coming 
back by repayable contributions. Western economic 
development recycles money back into business so we can 
create jobs. I understand the Reform Party is not interested in 
jobs, it is not interested in employment and it sure as hell is not 
interested in western Canada. I can tell you that.

have already promised a $4 billion plus investment in Chile. The 
second reason is we want to counter the confusing network of 
trade rules that are becoming a problem for members of our

per cent of farmers turned out to vote for these largely symbolic

campaigned actively during the advisory committee elections?

	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and

chief commissioner and a number of the commissioners of the 
Canadian Wheat Board participated in public meetings during 
the fall. They discussed a broad variety of aspects pertaining to 
the marketing of western Canadian grain. To the best of my 
knowledge they were not actively involved in any campaign 
with respect to the election of the advisory committee to the 
Canadian Wheat Board. If the hon. member has any information 
to the contrary I would be happy to have it.

analyse the results of that same advisory committee election 
which demonstrated overwhelming support for pro-wheat board 
candidates.
<P>
<B>(1500 ) </B>
<P>
	Since the sole support for dual marketing and the subsequent 
weakening of the board's powers is clearly seen to be limited to 
a small minority special interest group, what action will he take 
to protect and reinforce the ability of the board to act in the best 
interests of the vast majority of producers who support the 
board?
<P>

marketing systems that they regard to be most appropriate and in 
their interest.
<P>
	In the course of that kind of objective, reasonable, rationale 
dialogue, the respective merits of certain marketing systems 
will become obvious. I would imagine under the close scrutiny 
that public dialogue and examination gives, the Canadian Wheat 
Board will be able to demonstrate its merits very effectively.

	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.): </B>Madam 
Speaker, before beginning my speech, I would like to join the 
Deputy Prime Minister, who spoke earlier, in wishing the leader 
of the opposition and his family a lot of courage on his way to 
recovery.
<P>
	Today on behalf of my Cabinet colleagues, I am putting 
forward the next key part of the government's jobs and growth 
agenda. This plan introduces over 30 concrete measures 
involving ten Ministers and their departments ``to help create a 
climate where business can create more jobs for Canadians'', if I 
may quote the Prime Minister.
<P>
	But before I turn to what we will do next, let us revisit where 
we were just over a year ago when this government took office.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We were faced with an unemployment rate when we took 
office of 11 per cent. Business confidence was volatile and 
consumer confidence was very low. After two years of a 
half-hearted jobless recovery, fewer Canadians were working 
and the economy was producing fewer goods and services than 
at the beginning of the decade.
<P>
	As a government our first order of business was to work with 
other levels of government and the private sector to get the 
recovery moving. Our first weeks in office were characterized 
by decisive action, including the launching of the national 
infrastructure program. The reward for leadership and action 
has been a continuing rise in confidence and improvement in the 
overall economic conditions of the country.
<P>
	Most important of all, more Canadians have jobs. Since 
taking office 414,000 jobs have been created by Canadians for 
Canadians. Only a year ago people were talking about 
unemployment rates in excess of 10 per cent to the year 2000. As 
of last Friday we broke the 10 per cent barrier and Canada's 
unemployment rate stands at 9.6 per cent. But the government 
believes it has to do better than just recover from the last 
recession.
<P>
	The cycles of recession and recovery over the last three 
decades have shown some disturbing trends. Decade over 
decade average unemployment rates have risen, productivity 
growth has fallen and with it real incomes of Canadians have 
stagnated.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The time has come to reverse these trends. The time has come 
to get average unemployment rates down permanently. The time 
has come to increase productivity, thereby increasing real 
incomes. But you cannot do this simply by wishing or declaring 
it to be so. What is required is decisive action by government, 
wise investment by business and labour, and a new model of 
co-operation and partnership.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The government is taking decisive action. That is why we 
have launched a root and branch review of our social programs. 
That is why the Minister of Finance has set out a new framework 
for economic policy. That is why we are reviewing every 
program in every department and agency of the federal 
government. That is why the government is committed to 
reducing the deficit to 3 per cent of GDP, come hell or high 
water. That is why I am introducing Building a More Innovative 
Economy.
<P>
	At the outset let me say that this plan will disappoint some. It 
will disappoint those who believe that government can and 
should do everything. That approach defined the success of 
economic programs by bigger budgets, not better government. 
That is an approach I reject.
<P>
	This plan will also disappoint those who believe that the best 
thing government can do is nothing. That is not our view. We 
believe that economic leadership by government can contribute 
to economic success.
<P>
<B>(1510) </B>
<P>
	The fundamental premise behind Building a More Innovative 
Economy is that it is the private sector, not government, that 
creates jobs. What government can do is to improve the climate 
for the private sector to create those jobs.
<P>
	Where can good government make a difference? The first 
priority is building a healthier marketplace. Business needs 
better access to the financing required to help it grow. It needs a 
labour-management environment that is more co-operative, 
less adversarial. It needs fewer and more focused government 
programs. It needs regulations that makes sense. It needs fewer 
demands from government to fill out forms and shuffle paper.
<P>
	Tomorrow the President of the Treasury Board will announce 
the details of our plans for regulatory reform and paper burden 
reduction. We will use the power of government purchasing as a 
strategic tool for small and aboriginal business development and 
growth. My colleague, the Minister of Public Works and Gov-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8640"> 8640 </A></B>
<P>
ernment Services, will soon announce the details of this 
initiative.
<P>
	Our second strategic priority is trade. The challenges here are 
crucial for all Canadians. For jobs, incomes and prosperity we 
depend more on trade than almost any other country does. Yet 
we are not the nation of traders that we could be.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	That is why my first priority as Minister of Industry was to 
achieve Canada's first internal trade agreement-the beginning 
of a process that will bring down interprovincial trade barriers.
<P>
	And that is why in the early days of its mandate, the 
government moved quickly and decisively to improve Canada's 
international trading arrangements both in North America and 
elsewhere in the world.
<P>
[English] 
<P>
	That is also why the Prime Minister has made international 
trade a personal priority. The recent Team Canada trip to China 
was an unprecedented success, showing how Canada can 
succeed in global markets when we work together. We will build 
on this momentum.
<P>
	This plan introduces a variety of steps we will take to improve 
Canada's trading performance. For example, my colleague, the 
Minister for International Trade, will introduce measures to 
help develop globally minded businesses. Our challenge as a 
government is to equip more and more Canadian firms to win in 
the fiercely competitive international marketplace.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We will focus on support to small businesses that are entering 
export markets for the first time and target resources for 
exporter preparation.
<P>
	We will improve export financing measures.
<P>
	Taken together, these measures will quickly enable more 
Canadian firms to meet the challenge of international trade.
<P>
	Also, a large component of our balance of trade accounts is in 
tourism. Tourism is big business in Canada and, for the last ten 
years, we have done a pathetic job promoting ourselves to the 
rest of the world. That is why last year, Canada suffered a travel 
account deficit of almost $8 billion.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	That is why the Prime Minister announced we will be 
establishing a Canadian tourism commission to work with other 
governments and the tourism industry to be more aggressive in 
marketing Canada as a safe, beautiful and sophisticated 
destination, meeting the needs of almost every traveller.
<P>
<B>(1515 ) </B>
<P>
	Our third strategic priority is infrastructure, both physical and 
intellectual. This is an area of comparative advantage over 
which we have control. In this area the government is working 
on several fronts. The Minister of Transport is producing a new 
direction for transportation in Canada to meet the needs of the 
21st century. The Canada infrastructure works program is well 
under way and will create a further 65,000 direct jobs.
<P>
	Today I am announcing that the government will proceed with 
phase II of CANARIE, the Canadian network for the 
advancement of research, industry and education. This 
commitment will accelerate progress on the Canadian 
information highway.
<P>
	In addition, I am announcing a continuation of the SchoolNet 
program which will see all of Canada's 16,500 schools and 
3,400 libraries connected to the information highway by 1998, a 
full two years before the target set by vice-president Gore for 
the United States.
<P>
	Our fourth strategic priority for building an innovative 
economy is science and technology.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In the world today, virtually all product innovation is 
science-based, the result of research and development. And 
nothing is more important than product innovation for 
businesses to maintain and improve market share, thus 
contributing to economic growth and productivity.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Therefore, nothing is more important for jobs. I believe that 
no one will dispute the importance of the federal government's 
role in science, technology, research and development. The need 
to be more strategic and to ensure that our investment in this 
area supports Canada's social, economic and environmental 
goals led to the launching of a comprehensive science and 
technology review last June.
<P>
	This review is nearing completion and will set the stage for a 
clear articulation of a renewed science and technology strategy 
for Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Building a more innovative economy lays out specific 
initiatives to do just that: build a more innovative economy. My 
plan is a series of over 30 initiatives involving ten ministers and 
their departments-a truly government-wide effort in 
responding to the challenges of economic leadership.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is not a panacea. Panaceas do not exist. It is a co-ordinated 
plan of action, responsive to the real needs of the private sector, 
a result of consultation, a commitment to a work plan and the 
accountability that comes with it.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8641"> 8641 </A></B>
<P>
	The challenge before us is clear, to push the limits of this 
recovery and to achieve real and sustained jobs and growth. We 
will not decree an innovative economy. That simply means we 
must work together to build one piece by piece. I believe we can 
do that by acting together, by focusing on real results and by 
targeting our programs and reducing our spending to meet our 
deficit commitment.
<P>
	We said in the red book: ``Dynamic economies constantly 
re-invent themselves and grow through innovation. Innovation 
and experimentation inevitably entail risk and the possibility of 
failure. It is the job of government not to protect entrepreneurs 
against all failure but rather to create the best economic 
conditions and institutions to allow entrepreneurs to get on with 
the job''.
<P>
	Building a more innovative economy is a plan of action to 
implement this vision.
<P>
<B>(1520) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I would like to react today to the tabling of the industry 
minister's policy statement for his department.
<P>
	Although this document has some good points, as we admit, 
we can only see it as a political document that seeks to make up 
for a non-existent substantive industrial policy; we were 
entitled to expect a substantive policy, given the state of the 
Canadian economy.
<P>
	The statement refers to a plan of action for some thirty 
programs involving co-operation among ten or so departments. 
We already know that for some aspects of the announced action 
plan, some ministers will work together and we will only see the 
results in 1998, according to information we obtained for parts 
of the document. Some plans will only take effect in 1995, if 
then, according to conversations I had with people in the 
department.
<P>
	We therefore think that this paper is premature, since the 
proposed new policies depend on other departments' policies 
which are not yet known or will come, very late, from 
consultations that are still incomplete and program reviews that 
are a long time coming.
<P>
	We know very well that several key documents on social 
programs have not yet been tabled. How can the minister boast 
that his policy takes into consideration all that businesses need 
to achieve the desired growth? For example, the action to be 
taken by the Department of Public Works will not be known until 
1995.
<P>
	The minister wants to promote growth for small businesses by 
opening up government procurement and allowing companies to 
have access to what is available in terms of such procurement. 
However, we have no idea of where this will come from, nor 
when the action plan will be completed.
<P>
	In the context of that growth, how will this access to 
government procurement for small businesses work? Will 
companies be allowed to register in some file? Will there be 
calls for tenders for professional or technical services? How will 
this plan work? We do not know. For companies, growth does 
not mean the same as development. Indeed, the growth of some 
companies does not necessarily promote economic development 
for a territory or a region.
<P>
	Given these unknowns, we find it hard to understand why the 
minister is so quick to extol the virtues of his action plan and say 
that it meets an urgent need in the economy, and particularly a 
desire to develop small businesses, which will generate 
employment as everybody agrees.
<P>
	The strategy for technological innovation is another example 
of the government's lack of global vision. Indeed, the minister is 
considering a technological innovation policy without knowing 
the results of the current consultations on research and 
development, which will only be completed in 1995.
<P>
	The minister talks about consulting with partners. However, 
when you think of the information highway issue raised by 
Quebec, it is very hard to see the minister showing leadership, 
since his government is totally opposed to any dialogue on this 
issue.
<P>
	How can the minister justify the existence of a true 
technological innovation policy while putting on the back 
burner the whole issue of research and development? By 
definition, innovation implies the search for new products and 
processes, so that companies are competitive in the 
international market. Otherwise, we obviously cannot talk about 
competitive businesses.
<P>
	In his action plan, the minister proposes three strategic 
priorities: Support for small businesses, infrastructure and 
technology. As far as support for small business is concerned, 
the minister reluctantly proposes to maintain funding support 
through the Small Businesses Loans Act program. I say 
reluctantly since it is only because this program is mentioned in 
the red book that the minister has decided to maintain it, 
although without implementing the red book promise to get rid 
of personal collateral.
<P>
	The minister is announcing that available funds will be 
increased to $12 billion because this program gets results. In 
itself, this is good news.
<P>
<B>(1525) </B>
<P>
	This program is so popular that businesses register quickly. 
Small businesses are a well-known fact; they are dynamic, 
eager to innovate and expand. On the other hand, the minister is 
announcing that the program will have to be self-financing. 
This is what the government is seeking, to go and get back the 
money it loaned. I believe that to be its fundamental goal. In 
itself, it is laudable.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8642"> 8642 </A></B>
<P>
	But if we compare that to what the Minister of Human 
Resources Development is suggesting when he says that access 
to credit will be made easier for students, we quickly understand 
the equation. To save public funds, the government is forcing 
individuals into debt. What is the impact of this on SMEs? Are 
they going to be pushed deeper into debt or will they really get 
help to start up or develop domestically or internationally?
<P>
	Thus, without even conducting a cost-benefit analysis, which 
could have shown the efficiency of the program and indicated 
which policy was preferable with respect to tariffs, the minister 
is acting, in our view, as an amateur, increasing, without any 
consultation, the cost of financing SMEs. We can draw a parallel 
with the social reform whereby the government says that it will 
cut support to students, but they will be given the chance to go 
deeper into debt while the government sets up mechanisms to 
recover the loans it guaranteed.
<P>
	I wonder whether this is a responsible way to behave for the 
government and especially the industry minister, in the present 
economic context. Although some people on the government 
side sometimes think we are the bad guys, I must congratulate 
the minister on announcing measures to reduce red tape.
<P>
	Everybody is complaining and rightly so. Everybody agrees, 
every time you want to do something you have to fill out 16 
different forms and send them all over. Therefore this is a good 
move by the government. Reducing red tape is something SMEs 
have been asking for for a long time in order to stop wasting time 
and resources. Imagine having to submit 119 pages of 
information to get $10,000. Finally we are giving SMEs what 
they have been asking for.
<P>
	However, I would like to point out to the minister that we are 
here to promote a sovereign Quebec and I mentioned the 
information highway where the message to the minister was to 
open up to negotiation and co-operation. The minister did not 
open up, so I remind him that under our option, a level of 
government-the federal level-will disappear, thereby 
reducing red tape, inefficiencies and regulations often at cross 
purposes, making our industry much more efficient. This is a 
clear goal.
<P>
	The government is continuously reminding us that we must 
create the atmosphere for growth in the high-technology sector. 
We agree. SMEs in that area represent the future of our 
industrial base. True, high-tech SMEs are creating the jobs of 
tomorrow and will be mainly responsible for our ability to 
maintain the high standard of living we need and must have.
<P>
	It is therefore regrettable that the government would not 
propose any policy to stimulate their growth and, in particular, 
improve their financing. We must realize that these companies 
pursue speculative endeavours and have specific financing 
problems. Banks are seldom willing to finance technology and 
this brings me back to the role of government. It says it wants to 
recover its money, and it acts like a banker. We know what a 
bank does, it loans  money when it is reasonably certain that it is 
secure. Precisely what the government is doing.
<P>
	Yet, there are technological areas where risk is high. It is 
impossible to act like a banker in the sense that we cannot expect 
all the guarantees that a bank would normally require. That is 
obvious.
<P>
<B>(1530) </B>
<P>
	If we really want to encourage the development of these 
businesses, we must provide ways to find more appropriate 
funding for them. In our dissenting opinion to the report of the 
industry committee we proposed extending the Small 
Businesses Loans Act in order to fund the working capital of all 
businesses. This would have made it possible to support the 
financing of small and medium size high-tech enterprises. 
Instead, this government proposes a piecemeal strategy with a 
program that would only provide exclusively for the financing 
of exporting SMEs.
<P>
	Even the Canadian Association of Exporters recommended to 
the industry committee-and I do not know if the minister has 
heard about it-that the working capital of exporting SMEs be 
financed under the act. The government does not listen to the 
people involved.
<P>
	As for infrastructure, the minister praises the transport 
minister's policy. We have seen what has been going on in that 
area up to now and we are not at all heartened. If this is an 
indication of what this government intends to do about 
transportation, we should expect the worst.
<P>
	We believe that the national policy on airports, among others, 
is nothing but a disguised way to pass on the cost of regional 
transportation to municipal and provincial governments. This 
process had begun under the previous government and we 
already see costs being passed on to other levels of government.
<P>
	Furthermore, the federal government has the nerve-and this 
is important because they did it in several departments-to keep 
the revenue from the national network of airports and use it to 
finance regional airport infrastructure while disavowing any 
responsibility for their operating costs. This is how the federal 
government wants to manage public property and public funds 
throughout Canada.
<P>
	This is what federalism is all about. This is it. The federal 
government keeps the power even though it cuts funds and 
totally withdraws from the administration of services. As we 
were told, it does not have any choice, it is debt-ridden. It will 
have no choice but to turn to the provinces for help, and will be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8643"> 8643 </A></B>
<P>
unable to return the favour. The facts are really very simple. 
Everyone understands the situation.
<P>
	The Minister of Transport is following a policy which 
jeopardizes some regional transportation facilities and will 
greatly increase the cost of transportation from region to region.
<P>
	The information highway is the best example of the total lack 
of consultation and co-operation between the federal 
government and the provinces. As I said earlier, the minister is 
about to ask the CRTC to significantly change the regulations 
concerning telecommunications in order to facilitate the 
creation of this information highway, without even consulting 
the provinces. The information highway will have a major 
impact, as you know, on a great many areas, some under 
exclusive provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	In committee, we were very surprised to learn that the 
minister is going ahead with the information highway. But who 
will control the information to be found on this highway? Who 
will provide the information? One thing became clear in our 
discussions with officials from the Department of Industry, 
nobody has the answer to these questions. This issue has not 
been examined yet. It will be in the months to come. We are 
about to go ahead with the information highway without even 
making sure that its contents will be controlled and that there 
will be joint action with the provinces, which obviously have 
jurisdiction in this area.
<P>
	Finally, I would like to address the issues of technology andR &amp; D. The document tells us that Canada's effort in R &amp; D is 
less than that of other G-7 countries. However, the Canadian 
government invests as much as its competitors in civilian R &amp; D. 
This demonstrates how badly administered and inefficient the 
government's R &amp; D effort is.
<P>
	It is about time we thoroughly reviewed our involvment inR &amp; D matters and adopted a true science policy for R &amp; D. The 
government must be ready to question everything, to 
decentralize our technological efforts and to base our research 
laboratories outside Ottawa to take advantage of the scientific 
resources that are found across the country and make better use 
of them. This may create some synergy with the scientific 
research capabilities throughout Canada.
<P>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
	To conclude, the document tabled by the minister is nothing 
but an incomplete policy statement, which contains many 
policies already announced by his colleagues and others that 
will be announced by 1998. Thus, to be able to put Canada and 
Quebec back on the prosperity track, we have to consider-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sorry to interrupt 
the hon. member. I will now recognize the hon. member for 
Okanagan-Centre.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Okanagan Centre, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it is a privilege and very exciting actually to be 
participating in response to the minister's statement. I think 
there were some very positive things said by the minister and I 
want to commend him for those kinds of things, particularly for 
the fact that he recognizes that there is a problem. The difficulty 
is that I am not quite so sure that he has a solution to the 
problem. This is where I think we have to focus our attention.
<P>
	It is very interesting the way this particular paper has been 
presented to us. The first omission I find that really bothers me a 
lot is that there is no particular and no direct reference to the 
recommendations that were contained in the ``Taking Care of 
Small Business'' report by the Standing Committee on Industry.
<P>
	There were many recommendations in that particular report 
that gave direct impetus to the kinds of strategic planning that 
ought to be done in the Department of Industry and in the 
government at large.
<P>
	It became very clear during that particular discussion that 
there was a major gap in the recognition of the contribution that 
small business makes to the creation of jobs in Canada. It is true 
that there have been a number of new jobs created in Canada but 
for the government to take credit for this is not correct. The jobs 
were created by entrepreneurs and those people want to develop 
themselves.
<P>
	I commend the particular suggestion that there is going to be a 
particular place for small businesses to enter into government 
procurement contracts, contracts that are $125,000 or less but 
larger than $25,000. It raises all kinds of interesting questions 
that my hon. colleague raised not so long ago when he spoke 
about a particular department other than the Department of 
Industry in which certain contracts were divided up into smaller 
components so that indeed they would not have to meet certain 
regulatory provisions.
<P>
	Is this a possibility now that certain procurements may be 
made so that larger procurements will be broken up into 
$125,000 ones, or will that not be the case? Will others be 
combined? This not clear.
<P>
	I want to pay particular attention to the Small Businesses 
Loans Act. That ceiling was increased from $4 billion to $12 
billion. The Canadian Federation of Independent Business says 
that particular program is not working so well. This morning I 
heard the hon. minister say on Canada AM that small businesses 
liked it so much that they used it up right away, within 18 months 
of it having been increased.
<P>
	The interesting thing is that banks have to a large extent used 
the SBLA to cover their particular risks, so that it became a 
subsidy to the banks. It is small wonder that with this kind of 
help the larger banks in Canada can show a combined profit of 
something like $4 billion. Is this the kind of thing that small 
business is supposed to be supporting, so that the big banks can 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8644"> 8644 </A></B>
<P>
make big profits  like that? The Small Businesses Loans Act had 
no small contribution to that particular sector.
<P>
	That is not all. The other part of this is that there seems to be a 
suggestion that subsidies and grants to businesses create jobs. I 
submit to you, Madam Speaker, and to the minister and to this 
House that is probably false, that in fact when you have a 
subsidy which may create a job over on this side, it loses a job 
over on the other side because this business over here has to pay 
larger taxes, has to pay increased interest rates in order to 
subsidize that particular business over there. That is misleading 
if nothing else.
<P>
	There is another thing that happens when you do this sort of 
thing. You divert investment from those businesses that are solid 
to those businesses that have some kind of artificial government 
support and shoring up.
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	Business should be allowed to stand on its own feet. Where I 
commend the minister is where he says that the government 
should create an environment so that private businesses can 
succeed. I endorse that 100 per cent. I commend him for that 
statement. Now may he go ahead and prove that he believes that 
by taking away subsidies and grants for small business.
<P>
	Much was made about trade and much was made about the 
imbalance in trade when it comes to tourism. There is a 
suggestion that some $100 million is going to be spent in the 
tourism industry, approximately $50 million for the setting up 
of a tourism commission, another $50 million from $15 million, 
so it is not quite the $50 million in addition, for a promotion 
budget that has been increased from $15 million to $50 million. 
That suggests more than a triple amount of dollars spent in 
promotion.
<P>
	I ask the minister and the House whether they really believe 
that spending three times as much money will result in three 
times as many tourists coming to Canada and spending three 
times as much money than if that promotion budget were not 
there.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, I suggest to you that there may be an 
increase but it will not be in direct proportion to the increase of 
public spending in that particular sector.
<P>
	The minister said not too long ago and he states in his orange 
book that the solution is not in throwing dollars at a problem but 
rather to solve the problem. The best people to solve the problem 
are the entrepreneurs. They understand the business. They 
understand the marketplace. They know the value of the dollar. 
They know how to efficiently deploy those dollars. They know 
how to employ people. They know how to get good work out of 
people. Throwing dollars at the problem is not the answer. We 
need to recognize that applies in the tourism industry as well as 
in every other industry.
<P>
	There has been a suggestion that the infrastructure program is 
a major innovative development in this particular strategic 
document that has been presented to the House. The 
infrastructure program that currently exists, I believe it is $6 
billion on the one side and that is going to be matched by the 
provincial government and the municipal government, is a 
beautiful pot of money. It has become known in many quarters 
as boccie Canada, and builds boccie courts.
<P>
	The infrastructure program needs to be recognized for what it 
is. It is a program that benefits particular places. I want to really 
commend the British Columbia government. So far I know of no 
instance, and there may be some since I last looked at the list, 
when the money has not been spent on bona fide infrastructure 
programs such as highways, bridges, water systems, sewer 
systems, things of that sort. That is significant but building 
boccie courts is not. Building canoe museums is not. These are 
the kinds of things.
<P>
	I want to move into another area which has to do with the 
science and technology program. We have had a review this 
spring of the science and technology program all across Canada 
and we had the hon. secretary of state go across Canada holding 
various discussions with business people, interest groups, 
looking at what should be done in this particular area.
<P>
	Three things became very clear. When they put together the 
summary forum which took place here in Ottawa in 
mid-October they came up with a bunch of round tables with 
some very high powered, highly trained, highly developed and 
intelligent people who made some beautiful statements. When I 
examine those particular conclusions and compare them with 
conclusions of 1940, 56 years ago, there are in many instances 
very few substantive differences between the problems 
articulated today and the problems articulated some 50 years 
ago.
<P>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
	When a noted journalist put things together and compared the 
two he recognized, in particular when it came to the industrial 
application of the technological and scientific studies and R and 
D research that had been done primarily through government 
funding, that the minimal effect was industrial application.
<P>
	Some $6 billion is being spent in that area plus $1 billion 
being spent on tax credits. That is a total of $7 billion. In this 
fall's statement the Auditor General said that we were not 
getting an effective resolution and application of those dollars. 
We were not getting the kinds of results we should be getting.
<P>
	The time has come for us to do some new thinking, not to go 
through the old thinking and do it all over again. We know what 
the problem is. It is time we build a new innovative economy 
<P>
<HR>

	<B>Mr. Taylor: </B>Madam Speaker, I am pleased today to rise to 
speak on the amendments, some of which I brought forward and 
one of which has been brought forward by a member of the 
Reform Party.
<P>
	The amendment process of Bill C-56 that is in front of us 
today will give us a good indication of the seriousness with 
which the government wishes to approach the process of 
developing the best environmental assessment legislation that 
we possibly can.
<P>
	A lot of testimony was heard before the committee studying 
the bill. Among that testimony were many clauses of the original 
bill that are not discussed under Bill C-56 today but are matters 
which require attention in any case. I am hoping that we will 
have some opportunity in the future to address some of the 
additional concerns that we are unable to deal with in this bill.
<P>
	Also among the testimony of the witnesses before the 
committee were matters relating to the concept of an 
independent decision-making process. That is what the first 
amendments I proposed today deal directly with. First, these 
amendments ensure that the concept of independent 
decision-making is included in the section outlining the 
purposes of the act to make things perfectly clear. Second, they 
ensure that the decisions are consistent with the 
recommendations of the assessment panel and are treated 
seriously by giving the necessary authority to the responsible 
authorities.
<P>
	The concept is not a new one. It is one that has already been 
recognized by the Liberal Party which, prior to being elected, 
made certain promises to the Canadian people in regard to the 
environment. These promises contained in the now famous red 
book include the following: ``Under a Liberal government the 
Canadian Environmental Assessment Act will be amended to 
shift decision-making powers to an independent Canadian 
environmental assessment agency subject to appeal to cabinet''.
<P>
	In Bill C-56 the only amendments the Liberals have brought 
forward to the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act fail to 
create this independent decision-making body. In fact one could 
argue that they do almost the opposite because the government 
bill amends the act to give cabinet, referred to as the governor in 
council, the ability to amend the panel reports and then gives it 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8649"> 8649 </A></B>
<P>
the final say on the panel report. Certainly cabinet cannot be 
considered an independent decision-making agency.
<P>
	There are all too many examples where government 
departments and even ministers are the proponents of projects 
which would sooner see the recommendations of an independent 
assessment panel disappear than have them implemented. The 
possible conflict of interest with cabinet or between federal and 
provincial governments is altogether far too likely to go 
unaddressed.
<P>
	On the other hand it is important to recognize that elected 
governments must be held accountable for their actions and they 
must be given the power to act when the interests of the 
electorate, the Canadian people, the citizens of Canada, need 
protecting.
<P>
	I recognize that at the end of the day the government is 
responsible for its actions or the actions of those operating in its 
name.
<P>
	Therefore in writing the amendment before us I have tried to 
establish the framework for independent decision-making, that 
is establishing the independence of the assessment panel.
<P>
<B>(1610 ) </B>
<P>
	At the same time, I want to express my support for the concept 
of an appeal of this decision to cabinet. I tried to incorporate the 
idea of appeal into my amendment but it was ruled out of order 
by the legislative counsel before it appeared on the Order Paper. 
Therefore I had to rewrite my amendment in a way that would fit 
the needs of the legislative counsel rather than the needs that I 
really wanted to bring forward here today.
<P>
	I was told that the idea of an appeal to cabinet was not 
consistent with the government's intent in Bill C-56, but I want 
the government to realize that although my amendments do not 
specifically allow for the appeal to cabinet of a panel decision or 
of a cabinet decision, I am willing to accept an amendment in the 
future, another bill that the government may wish to bring 
forward.
<P>
	I am willing to accept an amendment that would incorporate 
an informal appeal process. It would be easy to do with 
reference to the fact that any person who participated in a 
mediation or a panel review in respect of a project could appeal 
to the governor in council any or all of the findings or 
recommendations set out in the report.
<P>
	I want to make clear that accepting my recommendations 
today does not preclude a further amendment by government in 
the future to ensure that the appeal process exists and to give the 
protection that the government may think is necessary by 
government.
<P>
	In the meantime, it is absolutely imperative that the 
legislation ensure the independence of the process. I think only 
the support of my motions today would ensure that. It is worth 
noting that the concept of independent decision-making is 
already accepted and practised in other areas of federal 
government activity.
<P>
	Perhaps the best known example of the process, although it is 
somewhat different, there are similarities, exists within the 
mandate of the CRTC. It exists basically at arm's length from 
government. It issues orders that are basically binding on those 
applications that have been made before it.
<P>
	However, there is an appeal process of sorts that allows the 
cabinet to make decisions on appeal. In the testimony heard 
during the committee study of the bill before us, officials from 
the Federal Environmental Assessment Review Office, FEARO, 
admitted that the current process requires that every decision of 
an assessment panel is not actually final until such time as the 
cabinet responds to it.
<P>
	They also admitted that cabinet is not required to respond 
within any specific period of time. Therefore it is fairly easy to 
say that cabinet could take an infinite amount of time to respond 
to any report or any recommendations contained in a report from 
an assessment panel or from a mediation review.
<P>
	We are already aware that cabinet, when it is not supportive of 
a panel decision or indeed parliamentary decisions, and I give 
the example of Bill C-13, the legislation that required more than 
two years to be proclaimed because of arguments received in 
cabinet over the regulations, as an example of how cabinet can 
delay matters for a long period of time.
<P>
	Actually, the Indian lands claims process is also one in which 
cabinet has indicated that it is prepared to take its time on 
reviewing a decision that it is not altogether happy with. The 
Indian Land Claims Commission reported two years ago on the 
Canoe Lake Indian Band claim regarding the Cold Lake air 
weapons range. Cabinet is still sitting almost two years without 
responding to that recommendation of the commission.
<P>
	We cannot allow that sort of a timeframe to elapse in regard to 
environmental assessment reports. Without going into any 
specific detail about how the two amendments that I have 
brought forward would work, let me simply conclude by saying 
that regardless of which path the cabinet wishes to take, the 
responsible authority is required within a short period of time to 
take a course of action consistent with the recommendations of 
the panel and, second, cabinet, if it has found the panel authority 
not consistent with the public idea, does have an opportunity to 
respond but the idea of an appeal is not within this amendment.
<P>
<B>(1615 ) </B>
<P>
	Therefore, I would be very happy to hear what the government 
has to say about adding an appeal process to the motion I have 
put forward.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8650"> 8650 </A></B>
<P>
	It is my submission that the bill fails to meet the test of an 
independent decision-making authority as promised by the 
government prior to the election. I urge support of the motions I 
brought forward to ensure that the independent 
decision-making authority exists within the new agency.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Comox-Alberni, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to put forward Motion No. 3 to amend Bill 
C-56. This amendment addresses clause 3 of the bill which 
amends section 37 of the Canadian Environmental Assessment 
Act. My amendment changes the decision-making authority on 
environmental panel reports from cabinet to order in council. 
That is the basic meat of it, changing it from cabinet to order in 
council.
<P>
	Prior to Bill C-56, the decision to act on or reject panel 
recommendations was made solely by the Minister of the 
Environment. Bill C-56 broadens the distribution of power to 
include the governor in council, which basically means cabinet. 
However, this is still not strong enough.
<P>
	Although the spirit of the government's amendment is to 
ensure that responses to public panel recommendations are 
decided by cabinet, it must be clear that cabinet, or governor in 
council, does not refer to cabinet as a whole.
<P>
	Cabinet remains undefined. It could mean full cabinet or it 
could refer to only a few ministers. Cabinet may be many things. 
Cabinet can be simple and informal or it can be formal in the 
way of an order in council. Cabinet has many versions. For 
example, there are inner cabinets, outer cabinets and 
committees of cabinet.
<P>
	The term cabinet is far too loose. As it stands, important 
environmental decisions could be controlled by two or three 
ministers with their own agendas. To avoid this potentially 
divisive situation, an order in council involving the full cabinet 
is required to ensure that all interests are fairly represented. The 
interests of one particular region will then be balanced by the 
representation of ministers from regions all across the country.
<P>
	To ensure that decision-making is democratic, panel 
recommendations must be approved or rejected through order in 
council which means the cabinet as a whole, not just two or three 
ministers. This amendment reduces the likelihood that 
environmental decisions will be subject to the whims of any 
individual minister as government as a whole is responsible for 
actions on panel recommendations.
<P>
	The amendment addresses concerns brought forward by the 
Liberals regarding the environmental assessment process. The 
Liberal red book states: ``The gap between rhetoric and action 
under Conservative rule has been most visible in the area of 
environmental assessment. All too often Conservatives have 
ignored the solid recommendations for environmental 
protection offered by public review panels''.
<P>
	As it stands there is nothing in the bill to prevent a few cabinet 
ministers from rejecting panel recommendations. What better 
way to ensure that recommendations for environmental 
protection, brought forward by public review panels, are fairly 
reviewed and justly responded to than to make sure that the 
decision-making power is held by cabinet as a whole, not two or 
three ministers. This amendment directly addresses those 
concerns by limiting the discretionary powers of ministers.
<P>
	It is my hope that hon. members on the opposite side will give 
serious thought to this amendment before they cast their vote. 
This is a fair and just amendment that will ensure a more 
democratic and balanced process of environmental assessment. 
It ensures the interests of the environment and industry are 
protected and works in favour of the best interests of all 
Canadians to ensure the continued protection of our 
environment.
<P>
	I now wish to respond briefly to the proposed amendments to 
Bill C-56 brought forward by the member for The 
Battlefords-Meadow Lake.
<P>
	In Motion No. 1 the member proposes to amend clause 1 of 
Bill C-56 by adding a subclause that strengthens the intention of 
the bill to ensure that projects likely to cause significant adverse 
environmental effects or public concern are publicly reviewed 
through a process of independent decision-making.
<P>
	The Liberal red book promises that: ``Under a Liberal 
government, the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act will 
be amended to shift decision-making powers to an independent, 
Canadian environmental assessment agency subject to appeal by 
cabinet''. Yet nowhere in the act or proposed amendments 
contained in the bill is such independent decision-making 
powers granted to the agency. As it stands, the current intent of 
the bill is in conflict with the promises contained in the red 
book. There is no process of independent decision-making 
granted to the agency in the bill.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	As it stands, the agency provides for ministerial 
decision-making as Bill C-56 proposes to broaden 
decision-making to cabinet. However, there is nothing in the 
bill that allows for independent decision-making because 
recommendations are approved or rejected by cabinet. The 
agency attends the hearings, prepares its report and presents it to 
cabinet. Beyond that there are no powers granted to the agency. 
This proposed amendment will recognize the agency as an 
independent decision-making body.
<P>
	I agree there are several advantages to having this agency at 
arm's length from the government, similar to the relationship of 
the CRTC and government, as proposed in the red book. This 
proposed amendment by the member for The 
Battlefords-Meadow Lake is in line with the Liberal red book 
and as such I 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8651"> 8651 </A></B>
<P>
would expect the government to honour its election 
commitments and include this amendment, which I support, into 
the act.
<P>
	The member for The Battlefords-Meadow Lake also 
proposed Bill C-56, clause 3, Motion No. 2 in the Order Paper, 
to make the panel or mediator reports binding to the governor in 
council. This proposed amendment requires the responsible 
authority to take a course of action consistent with the findings 
and recommendations in the panel report.
<P>
	The amendment addresses the first amendment as it gives the 
agency independent decision-making powers. As I said earlier, I 
agree that the agency should have some independent 
decision-making powers. However, the proposed amendment 
would give the agency absolutely authority over decisions. 
There are some merits as well as some concerns with this 
proposal.
<P>
	One aspect it recognizes is that panels and mediators have a 
far greater level of expertise regarding the issue than a review by 
cabinet. It also makes the final decision-making process more 
open to the public as panel reviews are open to the public, 
whereas cabinet meetings are not. The public is not privy to 
matters which guide cabinet decisions behind closed doors.
<P>
	I agree that there are many benefits to granting 
decision-making powers to the review panel. However, I cannot 
support this clause which allows for appeal to cabinet. The 
government must be allowed the opportunity to intervene when 
necessary.
<P>
	There will be occasions when the government will need to 
make decisions for political reasons, contrary to the review 
panel. Obviously this will not be a popular decision for which 
the government will undoubtedly take political heat. However, I 
feel the option must be open to the government. Therefore, I 
cannot and do not support this amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Parliamentary Secretary to Deputy 
Prime Minister and Minister of the Environment, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I wish to speak to the three motions. First, 
Motion No. 1 from the member for The Battlefords-Meadow 
Lake, ensures that projects reviewed through a process of 
independent decision-making are instituted.
<P>
	The member's suggestion is indeed interesting. However, he 
is adding words to an amendment which has been put forward to 
promote the concept of one project, one assessment. In this 
regard I suggest his proposal is out of place.
<P>
	With respect to the intent of the member's suggestion, the 
government has put forward in Bill C-56 an amendment to 
section 37 of the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act 
which would ensure that projects are subject to public review 
through an open and transparent process. This amendment 
ensures that panel recommendations are reviewed and 
responded to by the governor in council, thus ensuring that not 
just one minister will respond to panel recommendations.
<P>
	The government believes that this amendment, along with the 
creation of the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency, 
will allow for decision-making which is as independent as 
possible, coupled with an open and transparent process in which 
all Canadians may participate. For this reason the government 
will not support this motion.
<P>
<B>(1625 ) </B>
<P>
	Motion No. 2, moved by the member for The 
Battlefords-Meadow Lake, goes right to the heart of the 
cabinet decision-making process. The government has 
committed itself to ensuring that public reviews are carefully 
considered and responded to.
<P>
	However to suggest that the governor in council be given a 
time limit to respond would unduly fetter the decision-making 
process of the federal government. It would as well not reflect 
the seriousness of the decisions in front of cabinet.
<P>
	In some cases ministers may wish to respond quickly, or 
depending on the significance or complexity of the issue, the 
governor in council may well wish to take more time in its 
consideration of projects which are of national significance. The 
length of deliberations might also be influenced by stakeholders 
that in some cases may desire speedy responses or in others a 
more lengthy debate.
<P>
	Further, as the member knows, the Canadian Environmental 
Assessment Act is progressively designed to encourage 
harmonization with the provinces. In this light many provinces 
do not have time lines and it would be inappropriate for the 
Government of Canada to impose them.
<P>
	While we can understand the intent of the member's motion, 
we feel that the proposed amendment would unduly fetter 
decision-making and would contradict the careful deliberation 
that environmental assessment calls for. The government 
therefore cannot support this motion.
<P>
	Finally, with regard to Motion No. 3, introduced by my 
colleague for Comox-Alberni, as was confirmed by the 
committee studying Bill C-56, the governor in council 
responses to public reviews will be and must be made by order in 
council. This is the way the governor in council works.
<P>
	In this regard the member's motion is somewhat redundant 
and the government again cannot support its adoption.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
Motions Nos. 1, 2 and 3 put forward today by our colleague from 
The Battlefords-Meadow Lake and Motion No. 3 put forward 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8652"> 8652 </A></B>
<P>
by the hon. member for Comox-Alberni are amendments to 
Bill C-56.
<P>
	First, I will remind you that the Bloc Quebecois will vote 
against Bill C-56 since this bill amends the Canadian 
Environmental Assessment Act which implements across the 
country an environmental assessment process that duplicates a 
process already existing in some provinces, including Quebec 
where there has been an environmental assessment process for 
more than 15 years now.
<P>
	We have spoken against the enactment of this Act wich we 
consider to be unacceptable federal interference in provincial 
jurisdiction. We will have another opportunity to oppose federal 
interference in provincial jurisdiction on third reading of Bill 
C-56.
<P>
	Let us look now at the motions from our colleagues. Motion 
No. 1 wants projects likely to cause significant adverse 
environmental effects to be publicly reviewed through a process 
of independent decision making. That amendment would be 
included in the purposes of the Act. It is hard to see what our 
colleague from the NDP is really getting at with this 
amendment. He should tell us more about this process of 
independent decision making. Should the body or agency 
making the decision be permanent or ad hoc? What would the 
administrative structure of such an agency be? Who would be on 
it? Who would pay? How would the recommendations or the 
reports of that body be handled?
<P>
	Members of the NDP propose creating a new body which 
would only add to the list of existing agencies. In Quebec, we 
already have the BAPE, Bureau d'audiences publiques sur 
l'environnement. On the other hand, for those who support the 
imposition of the federal process-which we do not-the act 
provides for the establishment of the Canadian assessment 
agency, as well as opportunities to use a mediator or a review 
panel for major projects.
<P>
	As you can see, there are already many authorities provided 
for in the act. It seems to us that the NDP motion wants to add 
more to that federal superstructure, but without saying 
specifically what that new independent authority will be.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	You will understand that we, in the Bloc, cannot accept this 
motion from the NDP. We have a firm fundamental position on 
this bill and nothing can change it. We will also vote against 
Motion No. 2 that was moved by the same member.
<P>
	I would like to deal a little more with parts (1.1) and (1.2)(<I>b</I>) 
of the motion. Part (1.1) says: ``Where a report is submitted by a 
mediator or review panel-'' But what does the NDP do with the 
independent authority that it is proposing in its first motion? It is 
talking here about the report of a mediator or review panel. What 
about the independent authority report? Clearly defining 
structures does not seem to be a strength of the NDP.
<P>
	I think that the NDP does even worse when it proposes, in 
clause (1.2)(<I>b</I>), that:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-the Governor in Council may, for the purpose of dealing with any or all the 
findings or recommendations set out in the report</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(<I>b</I>) substitute its own findings and recommendations for those of the report 
where it concludes that the findings or recommendations of the report are 
not in the public interest.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I ask my colleague if the whole process that the federal 
government wants to implement and impose on the provinces is 
really to further public interest in environmental assessment 
issues. With this amendment, the NDP is telling us that the 
process as a whole is not important and that, in the end, Cabinet 
can impose its own decision in the public interest.
<P>
	It is not reassuring at all, considering who influence our dear 
ministers. Lobbyists are certainly not the greatest champions of 
public interest and the environment.
<P>
	Another major inconsistency in the motions of the NDP is that 
it is asking for an independent public review while giving the 
last word to the government. It is inconsistent and illogical to 
advocate these two things at the same time, that is, an 
independent agency whose recommendations will be submitted 
to a higher authority.
<P>
	The NDP is not very clear and rigorous in its proposals. If 
what it wants is to give more power to the people, its two 
motions are not very convincing. They are pulling in opposite 
directions. The result is a draw, since it is impossible to answer 
yes and no at the same time.
<P>
	Motion No. 3, presented by the member for Comox-Alberni, 
adds a reference to orders in council in clause 3 of Bill C-56. 
The bill only mentions the approval, or consent, of the Governor 
in Council, in a non-specific fashion. The Reform Party simply 
wants to specify how it will be done, by order in council. For us, 
this is merely specifying how they will go about it; it does not 
change Bill C-56 significantly.
<P>
	Finally, we will not vote in favour of any of these motions. 
Bill C-56 and the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act are 
both unacceptable and the changes proposed by our NDP and 
Reform colleagues do not make them more acceptable to us.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Terrebonne, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I am pleased to speak on the amendments to Bill C-56 proposed 
by NDP and Reform members.
<P>
	My comments will be similar to those made by my colleague 
for Laurentides, because, for different reasons, three of the 
motions cannot be approved by our party.
<P>
	The first motion proposed by the hon. member for The 
Battlefords-Meadow Lake raises problems, as it says this: 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8653"> 8653 </A></B>
<P>
``projects likely to cause- public concern are publicly 
reviewed through a process of independent decision making''.
<P>
	The process of independent decision making causes 
problems, because it remains undefined. It is said that an 
independent process should give some directions, but the 
process itself is not defined.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	As far as environmental assessment is concerned, I wish to 
analyze some aspects, some government structures, mostly at 
the federal level, where these assessments are made. One must 
remember that each department, before implementing a project, 
must do an assessment demonstrating that it is not harmful to the 
environment.
<P>
	Moreover, the Federal Environmental Assessment Review 
Office, FEARO, is about to be replaced by the Canadian 
Environmental Assessment Agency.
<P>
	The bill provides for a mediator who will review, hold 
hearings, carry out consultations-an activity our Liberal 
friends are particularly fond of-and this mediator will make 
decisions as part of the environmental assessment process.
<P>
	Such processes also exist at the provincial level, as my 
colleague from Laurentides pointed out earlier. In Quebec, the 
BAPE, or Bureau d'audiences publiques sur l'environnement 
(office of public hearings on the environment) conducts an 
environmental assessment which, by the way, is very serious 
and highly respected. My hon. colleague, who was Minister of 
the Environment, could attest to this.
<P>
	The bill also provides for something that no one has objected 
to, a very good idea: environmental groups, which are concerned 
with the environment but, unlike industry groups, may not be 
able to afford to appear before committees and panels to express 
their views, would receive government funding to come and 
share their views with various committees. I think that this 
provision, and particularly the government funding granted to 
environmental groups-it is important to mention this because 
these groups will finally be given a chance to be heard-will 
facilitate public participation in the various environmental 
assessment processes.
<P>
	I think that adding to the four or five existing environmental 
assessment organizations or agencies a fifth or sixth one, which 
would be this independent umbrella organization at the federal 
level, is going too far. It is difficult enough getting along as it is. 
As my colleague said earlier, they are pulling in opposite 
directions, so that putting the icing on the cake would not 
necessarily make sense.
<P>
	As I said in my preamble, how does our colleague from The 
Battleford-Meadow Lake define ``independent organization''? 
That is very important because we can move in different 
directions with that.
<P>
	At this time, Madam Speaker, I would like to give you another 
reason why we are opposed to Bill C-56. We see here that Clause 
4(<I>d</I>) of Bill C-13 would allow the public to participate in the 
environmental assessment process. Bill C-56 also provides for 
the compulsory creation of a participant funding program, as I 
said earlier. So we see that the public is really involved in this.
<P>
	As for Motion No. 2 providing that the Governor in Council 
may substitute his own decisions for those of the mediator, we 
find it somewhat unparliamentary and undemocratic, since we 
were elected to the House of Commons by the people. We have 
had responsible government since 1848 and we are here to make 
it work.
<P>
	So the Cabinet could be asked to reject out of hand the work 
done by our environmental assessment agencies and impose its 
own decisions when the public interest is at stake. I submit to 
you, Madam Speaker, that this is not quite acceptable in a 
democratic society.
<P>
	With respect to Motion No. 3 proposed by our Reform 
colleague from Comox-Alberni, we have a slight problem, as 
we have with three of the motions, in that simply adding by 
order in council would not amend the bill sufficiently for us to 
support Motion No. 3.
<P>
	Decisions are made by the Governor in Council but it remains 
to be seen whether the government has the will to act on the 
environment; we seriously doubt it. That is why I support my 
colleague from Laurentides in opposing the three motions 
proposed to us.

<BLOCKQUOTE>Motion No. 4</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-56 be amended by adding after new subclause 5(2), the 
following new Clause:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``5.1 The Act is amended by adding the following after section 59:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``59.1 (1) Every regulation that is proposed to be made under section 59 
shall be laid before each House of Parliament at least twenty sitting days

	He said: Madam Speaker, I am pleased to rise to speak to my 
motion in front of the House today. This is a motion that I have 
raised in this Chamber on one previous occasion. I am very 
pleased to have an opportunity to again try to convince the 
members of this House of the importance of dealing with public 
involvement in the regulatory process.
<P>
	I should indicate to members and to those who are watching 
today from outside this Chamber that public involvement in 
decision making is something that I have always taken very 
seriously.
<P>
	Although Bill C-56 in front of us deals to a certain extent with 
participant funding and individual participation within the 
process of environmental assessment, I was very anxious to 
include amendments as well dealing with participant funding, 
define more readily participant funding and also ensure that the 
agency in the legislation take more responsibility for participant 
funding programs.
<P>
<B>(1645 ) </B>
<P>
	I found that the amendments I submitted for inclusion on the 
Order Paper for today were ruled out of order before they were 
printed, again because they did not deal specifically with the 
intent of the legislation before the House.
<P>
	While we are dealing with the importance of public 
participation in the environmental assessment process I want to 
urge the government to do more to ensure a public participation 
funding program or an intervener funding program than has 
been done in the legislation in front of us.
<P>
	The government responded in committee to the question of 
greater definition of public participation funding programs by 
stating that it will include guidelines and rules within the 
regulations that make the act operable. That and other reasons is 
what prompts the amendment on the table now.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8655"> 8655 </A></B>
<P>
	What I am saying by moving the amendment is that the 
current regulatory process is inadequate, troublesome and 
lacking in public scrutiny. Members of the public and in fact the 
members of the House do not have the ability to examine in 
public, debate in public, discuss in public with a view to change, 
regulations once they have been dealt with, generally behind 
closed doors.
<P>
	As witness after witness before the committee in the previous 
Parliament and before the committee in this Parliament 
indicated, it is the regulations which run the act and therefore 
the process, not the act itself. The regulations are as important as 
the act.
<P>
	We have spent on environmental assessment legislation 
hundreds if not thousands of hours putting in place the proper 
wording for the legislation but we have not dealt at all with the 
regulatory process.
<P>
	One of the witnesses before the committee, a man by the name 
of Brian Pannell from Winnipeg had some comments in this 
regard that I want to bring to the attention of the House before I 
proceed with my arguments. Mr. Pannell said: ``On the law list, 
the law list remains substantially deficient. I can tell you that 
this law list has been worked on for years and it has always been 
a struggle to be relatively inclusive of the real substantial 
decisions that should be on there and there are still many 
decisions that should be on there that aren't because there are 
many departmental interests that are served by not having them 
there and I don't see an early resolution to this process''.
<P>
	The regulatory process takes place behind closed doors. 
Decisions are made about how the act will be run by people who 
study this very closely. To a certain extent the people in this 
regulatory process are doing a great job. The regulations are put 
in place and go before cabinet. Before those regulations can be 
published the cabinet makes decisions, makes deletions, makes 
additions, does whatever it wants to, not referring anything back 
to the regulatory development committee or whatever it is 
called, and the regulations are published. That is it. Everything 
is done and the operations of the act proceed.
<P>
	Some time ago in dealing with the previous government's gun 
control legislation the government set a precedent by 
establishing a process by which regulations could be reviewed 
by members of Parliament. The government conceded, because 
the regulations concerned the addition of firearms that could be 
prohibited by order in council, not by debate, not by public 
discussion but simply by cabinet deciding that this or that 
firearm could be put on a prohibited list.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	In this case we have regulations that can decide the future of 
environmental assessment, the process, how the participant 
funding program is going to operate, who is  going to get 
funding under participant funding processes, which projects 
will be reviewed, which projects will not be reviewed, who can 
appear before panel decisions, who can sit on panels and where 
they are going to operate. All of these details about the 
decision-making process that will eventually lead to 
recommendations on projects are dealt with under regulations. 
As members of Parliament we and the public have no 
participation in that process before, in the middle of or after it is 
completed.
<P>
	The point I am making is fairly simple. We are asking that 
when the regulation process is complete and the regulations are 
on the table that we set aside a period of time when members of 
Parliament or members of the Senate can respond to those 
regulations. We can say to the country that we do not want these 
regulations to pass until such time as we have had a chance to 
look at them. These matters can then be brought before 
committees or dealt with in any way that the government wishes 
to have them dealt with. Should public scrutiny allow those 
regulations to go forward, they can.
<P>
	The government loses nothing in this process other than the 
fact that some of the regulations and some of the regulatory 
process is under the scrutiny of members of Parliament, the 
Senate and therefore the people of Canada, if we are paying 
attention to the needs and the interests of the Canadians who are 
concerned about these matters.
<P>
	I do not consider this to be a significant amendment in terms 
of what it means to the government achieving its ends. I do see it 
as a significant amendment in terms of allowing for greater 
public participation on the side of the question that really 
matters: the operational and administrative side, the regulatory 
side.
<P>
	I urge the government to carefully consider its concern and its 
stated support for public participation in the process. By 
supporting this amendment it will bring greater clarity to the 
whole regulatory decision-making process.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Comox-Alberni, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak to Motion No. 4, the third 
amendment proposed by the member for The 
Battlefords-Meadow Lake. The proposed amendment relates 
to section 59 of the act which grants the governor in council 
authority to make regulations relating to environmental 
assessment and follow-up programs set up in the Canadian 
Environmental Assessment Act.
<P>
	These regulations are an essential part of the act. They are the 
guiding principles which shape the environmental assessment 
process. Once again there is some merit to the proposed 
amendment but there are also many concerns which arise with 
this proposal.
<P>
	Presently under the act, the regulations which guide the 
environmental assessment process are determined by governor 
in council which basically means the cabinet. Cabinet decides 
what the regulations will include. Members of Parliament 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8656"> 8656 </A></B>
<P>
outside of the inner circle of government are excluded from the 
process.
<P>
	The amendment to the bill proposes to address this concern so 
that the regulation proposed under section 59 would be laid 
before the House of Parliament. This would allow for a more 
democratic process in the development of these regulations and 
would allow members of the House to participate in the 
decision-making process as regulations are proposed.
<P>
	The hon. member also proposes that regulations are presented 
to the House at least 20 sitting days before the proposed 
effective date. The time line of 20 days would ensure that 
members have adequate time to comment on regulations and 
proposed meaningful amendments where necessary.
<P>
	My concern with this proposal is that it would slow down the 
process. I have concerns that if every regulation were brought 
forward, the process would be far too time consuming and would 
in fact be unworkable. Members need to participate in decision 
making but this suggested amendment would grind the House to 
a halt.
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
	For these reasons I cannot support and therefore oppose the 
motion.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ): </B>Madam Speaker, 
we recognize that Motion No. 4 put forward by the hon. member 
for The Battlefords-Meadow Lake definitely has some merit. 
While it will not gain our full support, it is far from worthless. It 
has the advantage of applying the concept of transparency to one 
of the most fundamental aspects of the Canadian Environmental 
Assessment Act, the regulations made under the Act.
<P>
	I would like to remind my colleagues that on October 6, the 
Minister of the Environment announced in this House that the 
Act would be proclaimed and that its regulations would soon be 
published in the <I>Canada Gazette</I>. These regulations are actually 
one of the many shortcomings of this federal legislation. They 
confer great power and allow the federal government to give a 
wide application to its environmental assessment process, 
without any regard for assessment processes already established 
by the provinces.
<P>
	The federal regulations have a major impact in Quebec. In 
view of the great power the federal government has seized to 
initiate federal assessments, as provided under the regulations, 
most projects covered by Quebec regulations are likely to be 
subject to the federal regulations also. Clearly, two processes 
could be undertaken for the same project, unless, of course, 
there was a bilateral agreement between the province and the 
federal government. So far, I think that only one province has 
signed such an agreement with the federal minister.
<P>
	Federal regulations on environmental assessment reinforce 
and give further extension to the Act. That will lead to a 
duplication of assessment processes, an inability to meet 
deadlines under provincial processes, the possibility that 
provincial decisions could be challenged, some uncertainty and 
hesitation by developers in submitting projects owing to the 
dual assessment process and the subsequent decisions, a waste 
of time and money, the possibility of legal challenges for the 
results and decisions, if the two assessments reach different 
conclusions. These are serious consequences of regulations 
made under the Act.
<P>
	Since the minister refused to amend her legislation to specify 
that provincial procedures, and more specifically those in 
Quebec, are comparable to the federal process and equally valid, 
so that projects subject to Quebec regulations would be subject 
only to provincial procedures, we now have two sets of 
procedures, which is very costly and very confusing for all 
concerned.
<P>
	The federal legislative process is opaque to the point of being 
secretive. Regulations are churned out without any genuine 
debate by members. They are published and easily pass 
consideration by the Committee on Scrutiny of Regulations, 
without anyone being able to challenge the basis for certain 
regulations. The process makes absolutely no sense at all and is 
also dangerous because these regulations are often vitally 
important.
<P>
	In this particular case, the regulations of the Canadian 
Environmental Assessment Act mostly duplicate Quebec's 
regulations. It is most unfortunate that no Quebec members had 
a chance to look at these regulations before they came into force. 
It is also unfortunate that members have had absolutely no say in 
this respect. We find the same situation-not a very democratic 
one, in my opinion-with all other bills debated and voted on in 
this House. We can see the bills and study them clause by clause, 
but we never have that opportunity with the regulations.
<P>
	If the NDP motion is adopted, it would have to be part of the 
general procedure for proposed legislation, so that at least 
elected members would be able to discuss draft regulations 
before they become official.
<P>
	We support the main purpose behind this motion. However, 
we object to including the senators in a process to prevent the 
approval of draft regulations. The Senate consists of 
non-elected individuals, appointed strictly on a partisan basis. 
These are patronage appointments, and these friends of the 
government cost us $53 million.
<P>
<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
	As I said before, the motion's purpose, which is to give us a 
chance to examine the regulations and to amend or reject them, 
<P>

<B><A NAME="8657"> 8657 </A></B>
<P>
is entirely valid. The legislative system should make it possible 
for members to intervene in this area.
<P>
	Therefore, I move, seconded by my colleague the hon. 
member for Terrebonne:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Motion No. 4 be amended:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(<I>a</I>) in sub-clause (1), by replacing the words ``each House of Parliament'', 
with the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``the House of Commons'';</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(<I>b</I>) in sub-clause (2),</BLOCKQUOTE>
(i) by replacing the words ``either House of Parliament under subsection (1), a 
motion for the consideration of that House'', with the following:
<P>
``the House of Commons under subsection (1), a motion for the consideration 
of the House''; and
<P>
(ii) by striking out the words ``fifteen Senators or'', ``the Senate or'' and ``, as 
the case may be,'';
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(<I>c</I>) in sub-clause (3), by replacing the words ``both Houses of Parliament'', 
with the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``the House of Commons'';</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(<I>d</I>) in sub-clause (4), by replacing each instance of the words ``both 
Houses of Parliament'', with the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``the House of Commons''; and</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(<I>e</I>) in sub-clause (5), by replacing the words ``either House of

<BLOCKQUOTE>``the House of Commons''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Terrebonne, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I rise to further explain why I will have the pleasure to support 
the sub-amendment presented by my colleague from 
Laurentides.
<P>
	To clarify where we are coming from with this 
sub-amendment to Motion No. 4 presented by the NDP member, 
I will say that the only thing we agree with is that we would be 
ready to support the motion presented by the member for 
Battlefords-Meadow Lake. Therefore, we would be pleased to 
support it. However, to be consistent with the positions we have 
taken since the opening of this Parliament, we cannot accept that 
non-elected individuals might take the place, even occasionally, 
of elected representatives.
<P>
	We must point out that the Senate is composed of appointed 
members who are, as my colleague so skilfully demonstrated, 
appointed in a partisan way; they are government cronies. These 
appointees, who cost taxpayers $53 million a year, and who are 
supposed to be wise, have shown that this is seldom the case.
<P>
	Therefore, according to the 1848 principle of responsible 
government which I explained earlier, decisions made here by 
democratically elected representatives of the people should only 
and always be discussed in this House. I should point out, for the 
benefit of all those present, that each one of them represents a 
federal riding, but that they also represent their provincial 
legislature, and that there is only one House in each province 
because their provincial legislature recognizes the authority of 
democratically elected representatives.
<P>
	What we are opposing mainly is the fact that non-elected 
individuals could make decisions. We must therefore support 
the amendment to the amendment submitted by my colleague 
from Laurentides and make sure that we remove from the 
motion of our NDP colleague anything that could be interpreted 
as meaning that both Houses must be involved in the 
decision-making. Democratic decisions are made here, in this 
House, and anything not democratic, like the present proposal, 
must be rejected.
<P>
<B>(1705) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Parliamentary Secretary to Deputy 
Prime Minister and Minister of the Environment, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I would like to say first of all that I am a bit 
surprised at the Bloc Quebecois position. Despite explanations 
by the hon. member for Terrebonne, one cannot help wondering 
how the Bloc Quebecois can move an amendment to an 
amendment to a bill over which it is in total disagreement. It is a 
bit surprising.
<P>
	Similarly, I would like to refer to remarks by the hon. member 
for Laurentides who keeps harping on the same old theme that 
the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act is some kind of 
absolute intrusion in prerogatives of provinces and more 
particularly Quebec.
<P>
	I want to point out to the hon. member that the federal 
government has not only the right but the responsibility, as 
stated by the Supreme Court, to deal with environmental 
assessment, if only in such areas of exclusive jurisdiction as 
coastal zones, navigable waters, fisheries, national harbours, 
airports, the St. Lawrence Seaway, Crown lands, native lands, 
defence facilities, not to mention the shared jurisdiction on 
environment itself.
<P>
	Indeed, I would point out to the hon. member for Laurentides, 
if she is interested in getting information, that joint assessments 
have been made for a very long time in Quebec concerning, for 
example, Cacouna Harbour, the St. Marguerite River more 
recently and the Lachine Canal very recently. There are 
instances of several projects assessed either by BAPE or, on rare 
occasions, by the federal government, when the project was 
essentially under federal jurisdiction.
<P>
	As for the motion by the hon. member for The 
Battlefords-Meadow Lake, we are quite aware that under 
several acts of Parliament, regulatory systems are established 
independently of Parliament.
<P>
	In the case of the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 
the regulations were subjected to one of the most rigorous and 
progressive procedures established by the Government of 
Canada. During the last election, we on this side of the House 
promised an in-depth review of the existing regulations-
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="8658"> 8658 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sorry to interrupt 
the parliamentary secretary. We are debating the amendment to 
Motion No. 4.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lincoln:</B> May I speak to both at the same time? It is the 
same subject anyway.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Does the member have 
agreement?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lincoln:</B> During the last election, we on this side of the 
House promised an in-depth review of existing regulations as 
well as ongoing consultation on the others. Some existing 
regulations have been reviewed thoroughly and substantially 
improved as many witnesses have recognized, in fact.
<P>
	All the other regulations are subjected to the same in-depth 
analysis by all the interested parties.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I am very sympathetic to the member's suggestion, but the 
suggestion does not seem to recognize that extensive 
consultation has taken place, nor does it reflect the fact that the 
development of regulations is a much larger question than that 
contained in the regulations under the Canadian Environmental 
Assessment Act.
<P>
	If the member for The Battlefords-Meadow Lake wishes to 
change the federal regulatory development process, the 
Canadian Environmental Assessment Act is certainly not the 
place to do it. For this reason the government will not accept this 
motion, nor the amendment to the motion.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Is the House ready for 
the question?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Question.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Is it the pleasure of the 
House to adopt the amendment?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> All those in favour of 
the amendment will please say yea.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Yea.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> All those opposed will 
please say nay.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Nay.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> In my opinion the nays 
have it.
<P>
	<I>And more than five members having risen:</I>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Is there unanimous 
consent to defer the vote to tomorrow at 5.30 p.m.?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Madam Speaker, a point of order. I wonder if 
you could seek unanimous consent to adjourn the House, having 
completed the legislation before us for today.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Is there unanimous 
consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> It being 5.12 p.m., as 
there are no members available for the proceedings on the 
adjournment motion, the House stands adjourned until 
tomorrow at 10 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 5.12 p.m.)
