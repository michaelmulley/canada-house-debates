amend the Access to Information Act (disclosure of results of 
public opinion polls), be read the second time and referred to a 
committee.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, most Canadians believe that this is the best 
country in the world. However, that does not mean they agree with 
the status quo and do not want changes. Canadians want 
constructive change and near the top of every list is the desire for a 
more open and accountable government.
<P>
	Open government means a free flow of information between the 
government and its citizens. It means that government informs the 
public rather than manipulating them. Open government means 
that when tax dollars are used to commission polls about the 
thoughts and opinions of Canadians, everyone has the right to 
assess the results of these polls in a timely manner.
<P>
	Canadians who want access to poll results should not have to 
jump through bureaucratic hoops in order to get the answers. 
Unlike the last Parliament which was very secretive this Parliament 
must change the system. Never again should Canadians be faced 
with the situation where the information commissioner has to take 
the Prime Minister to court to force him to release publicly funded 
poll results as happened in the Mulroney regime.
<P>
	The kind of backroom government that has been so common 
here in Ottawa must change and it must change quickly. The 
Canadian public will not accept that sort of secrecy any more. They 
will not put blind faith in their politicians. They have learned 
through experience that left to its own devices, government will 
take advantage of the situation.
<P>
	Government will selectively release important information to 
manipulate the public and advance its own agenda. In fact, we 
recently witnessed a perfect  example of just this type of behaviour 
by the Parizeau government in Quebec. While this example did not 
involve polls, it did involve a series of publicly funded studies that 
examined the consequences of separation.
<P>
	As all members are probably aware, the Parizeau government 
realized that some of the studies cast serious doubts on the viability 
of a separate Quebec. These studies responsibly pointed out the 
economic pitfalls that would invariably be associated with 
separation and the Parizeau government did not like it. Instead of 
releasing all of the taxpayer funded studies, Mr. Parizeau only 
released those that reinforced his own position.
<P>
<B>(1105)</B>
<P>
	The point therefore is to make all polls public in a timely 
manner. Not only was this manipulation by the Parizeau 
government dishonest, it also was an example of the need for 
legislation that specifically prevents this kind of behaviour.
<P>
	The current government has not been as secretive as the previous 
one. If the Liberals truly believe in the concept of open 
government, then they should not be afraid to put their money 
where their mouths are. By making open government the law of the 
land, Parliament can show all Canadians that times have changed 
and that the rights of citizens to know what their government is 
doing is a fundamental one. If Parliament is really serious about 
open government, then all members should give their consent to 
make Bill C-309 votable and then we should pass it.
<P>
	The bill would amend the Access to Information Act to ensure 
that all federal departments, boards or agencies that commission 
public opinion polls gave notice to the designated minister and the 
Speaker of the House of Commons. The designated minister would 
then be obliged to submit to the House of Commons the results of 
the polls and report the following: a description of the nature of the 
poll; a copy of the questions asked and a summary of the responses 
given; the period when the poll was conducted; and the cost of the 
poll. The minister would be required to lay this report before the 
House no later than 15 days after the poll was completed. If the 
House is not sitting, the report would be deposited with the 
information commissioner within the same deadline, published in 
the <I>Canada Gazette</I> and then presented to the House of Commons 
during the first five days after it resumed sitting.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15370"> 15370 </A></B>
<P>
	If Bill C-309 was made votable and passed, the results of all 
public opinion polls commissioned by federal government bodies 
would become public in a very timely fashion. This prompt 
disclosure would make the results available while the information 
is still relevant to the current concerns of the public and is what 
the Canadian people are demanding.
<P>
	Although I hope I am wrong, I predict Liberal members will 
speak against the bill. Members opposite know very well that they 
made election promises to ``make open government the watchword 
of the Liberal program''. I doubt they are willing to live up to that 
promise.
<P>
	This reluctance of the Liberals to honour their red book promises 
was clearly demonstrated earlier in the year when they were the 
only members from any party to vote against open government by 
defeating Motion No. 304. I proposed this motion. It would have 
opened up Parliament and crown corporations to scrutiny under the 
Access to Information Act. I was told it was not to be passed at that 
time because the whole question was under review and massive 
changes were to be made to the Access to Information Act. 
Everyone agrees that it needs revision. I wonder if we will hear the 
same reasons now.
<P>
	Even though Liberal members had been given assurances that 
M-304 would not breach the confidentiality of their offices or 
disrupt the competitive edge of crown corporations, Liberal 
members unanimously voted against that motion. This was 
especially strange considering that several members had told me 
privately they favoured the motion and thought it was a great idea. 
We all know what really happened. Instead of allowing their 
members to vote freely on the matter, the top brass stepped in and 
cracked the party whip. Even though the chief government whip 
has given his word to the House that Liberal members are allowed 
to vote with their consciences on private members' business, those 
members are told what to do and as always they do it.
<P>
	I would now like to anticipate the line of argument from my 
colleagues opposite. I predict they will say that since they have 
been in government Treasury Board policies on communications 
and information management have been changed in order to 
address the problems of disclosure of public opinion research. I 
predict we will hear that these guidelines and the promises of the 
public works and government services minister make Bill C-309 
unnecessary. The problem is already solved, they will say, but this 
is not correct.
<P>
<B>(1110)</B>
<P>
	It is true the change in the Treasury Board guidelines tinkered 
with the old Mulroney system but this did not mean the problem 
was solved. It was not and the government knows it. News 
clippings abundantly reveal the continuing problems with the new 
and improved Liberal system. Two headlines in the <I>Globe and Mail</I>  
recently say it all: ``Liberal poll results rules much like the Tories'', 
``Liberals will still allow polls to be kept secret''. A Winnipeg <I>Free 
Press</I> article entitled ``Imitating Mulroney'' says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Public Works Minister David Dingwall called the new guidelines a 
``breakthrough''. In fact, they are little more than Brian Mulroney's policy warmed 
over with a little red sauce for artificial flavour. These flimsy guidelines will not 
require ministers to reveal information gathered at public expense, if in the opinion 
of the minister that information is considered advice to the government.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	What does it mean, advice to the government? By tradition, 
advice must stay locked up in a bomb-proof vault until the minister 
passes on to a better place or until the paper it is written on turns 
yellow and disintegrates.
<P>
	Let me move on to a very interesting article that was published 
in the normally Liberal friendly Toronto <I>Star</I> after the new 
Treasury Board guidelines were put in place. Its title is: ``Liberals 
restrict access to poll results''. It reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-previous Conservative governments were attacked for keeping taxpayer 
paid for polls secret, including constitutional polls. Now, the Liberal 
government seems determined to do an even better job of delaying and hiding 
poll results.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	We are talking about millions of dollars of taxpayers' money 
being spent on public polls and their findings not being made open 
to the public or to this House. The author of this article, Ken Rubin, 
correctly calls the government's new access scheme fraudulent. He 
describes the flawed new process as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>1. The lengthy up to 90 day period for publication of poll reports goes far 
beyond the already too long 30 day release period possible under the Access to 
Information Act. There will be instances in which publication is well after 90 
days.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>2. The up to 90 day period for publication release begins only after a final 
written report is received from the pollsters. That's even though the polling 
results are immediately conveyed-sometimes months earlier-orally or in 
draft written form to the government.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>3. A summary report of polling results could be all that is published, leaving 
out the guts of the research usually found in the technical tables.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>4. Some polls still will be kept secret through applying partial or total 
exemption of poll results under the Access to Information Act.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It will be up to the minister to decide.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>5. The Treasury Board directives formally encourage departments to 
consider applying for exemptions under the Access to Information Act. This 
policy endorses the view that polls are something other than publicly paid for, 
routinely released results of public response to government commissioned 
questions.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>6. The Treasury Board's practices will make more progressive federal 
departments think twice before publishing certain ``sensitive'' poll data; after 
all, departments have to go to the Treasury Board to fund their polls and focus 
group research.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15371"> 15371 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>7. Once the government has decided to publish a poll result, that poll is no 
longer covered under the Access to Information Act. This means recipients could 
lose the right to complain, all the way to the federal court, about the polling results 
received after late receipts and publishing delays.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	There is much more in this report, but we all get the point of the 
problems with this new legislation. The change in Treasury Board 
guidelines was a finesse by the government, not an honest attempt 
to address the existing problem. This is unacceptable and more 
concrete steps have to be taken.
<P>
<B>(1115 )</B>
<P>
	I do not claim Bill C-309 by itself can fix the problems of 
secretive government. It cannot and no one would say it could. 
However, if this legislation were passed it would be a step in the 
right direction.
<P>
	Parliament can talk about open government until the cows come 
home but unless we are willing to legislate change it means nothing 
more than words. It is time to legislate open government.
<P>
	In the sincere hope that members will have the courage to act, I 
ask for unanimous consent to make C-309 a votable item. If this is 
done all members of Parliament will have a chance to get on the 
record on this very important issue.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Does the hon. member have 
the unanimous consent of the House?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Susan Whelan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Revenue, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise to commend the hon. 
member for this proposal to extend the application of the Access to 
Information Act.
<P>
	I am a firm believer that open government is essential to the 
preservation of the respect which members of the public give us as 
politicians and to the trust they place in their government. The 
Liberal Party is committed to the principle of open government.
<P>
	I am not sure, however, this amendment is necessary. It is my 
understanding the act already provides for access to public opinion 
polls. Section 4 of the act provides that everyone has a right of 
access to any record under a government institution. In so far as 
opinion polls constitute such records, they are covered by the act. If 
specific poll results are not disclosed to the public it is because in 
specific circumstances a legitimate interest that competes with 
presumption of access is invoked. It should be noted the act 
performs a careful and complex balancing between a variety of 
interests. I am concerned that amending the act to address a 
specific and limited aspect of the act would disturb the various 
balances within the act.
<P>
	In 1992 the trial division of the federal court pronounced on the 
question of release of public opinion research in the case of 
Information Commissioner v.  Prime Minister. That case dealt with 
public opinion polls commissioned during previous constitutional 
negotiations. The decision of the federal court trial division of 
November 19, 1992 provides guidance on disclosure of such 
information.
<P>
	In addition to section 4 of the act, the Treasury Board secretariat 
has issued guidelines for federal institutions on the release of 
public opinion polls. The Treasury Board communications policy 
amended last July provides that first, government institutions must 
make every effort to disclose results outside the formal resolution 
process prescribed by the Access to Information Act of public 
opinion research.
<P>
	Second, in the spirit of the Access to Information Act, 
institutions are encouraged to make the final report of public 
opinion research available within 30 days of receipt and should 
resort to the 90-day allowance only if constrained by publishing 
requirements.
<P>
	Third, in those cases in which a minister elects not to disclose 
the final report in response to an access to information request, the 
minister must send a letter to the information commissioner 
informing the information commissioner of his or her decision 
inciting the provision of the Access to Information Act that the 
minister has exercised. A copy of the letter will be sent to the 
Treasury Board for purposes of monitoring implementation of this 
policy.
<P>
	With section 4 of the act interpreted by a recent court case 
dealing with opinion polls, and with a new government policy 
which guides government institutions on the disclosure of public 
opinion polls, it is not at all clear to me that there is a present and 
pressing problem with respect to the release of public opinion 
research that justifies an ad hoc amendment.
<P>
	Another reason I would not support Bill C-309 is that the 
Minister of Justice has announced his intention to reform the 
Access to Information Act. I understand a review of how public 
opinion polls are disclosed or not disclosed to the public will be 
part of that review.
<P>
	I trust the Minister of Justice will reform the act in providing for 
more open government, including greater access to polling 
information. I am concerned that Bill C-309 would amend the act 
in an ad hoc fashion.
<P>
	It has been about 12 years since the act was first passed. A 
parliamentary committee and the information commissioner have 
both made extensive recommendations for reform. I believe it is 
time for a fundamental review that would look at all aspects of the 
act.
<P>
<B>(1120 )</B>
<P>
	In addition I have concerns with specific details in this proposal. 
The requirement that every public opinion research contract be 
reported to the minister and to the Speaker of the House of 
Commons and that reports be  tabled in Parliament or with the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15372"> 15372 </A></B>
<P>
information commissioner and published in the <I>Canada Gazette</I> 
seems like overkill.
<P>
	An amendment that provides that no exemptions apply to the 
release of public information opinion research would have been 
sufficient for members' purposes. The media, citizens and 
parliamentarians are quite familiar with the relatively easy process 
of filing access requests. In any event the Treasury Board policy 
calls for informal dissemination public opinion research. New and 
duplicated reporting requirements merely add red tape and cost, 
which we can ill afford at this time.
<P>
	Another problem I have with Bill C-309 is that it would apply to 
any department, branch, office, board, agency, commission, 
corporation or other body established by or pursuant to any act of 
Parliament or established by or pursuant to any proclamation, order 
in council or other instrument made or issued by or under the 
authority of the governor in council.
<P>
	By defining which institutions are covered by this proposed 
amendment in this way the proposed amendment goes entirely 
against the way the rest of the Access to Information Act is 
structured. The act applies to all government institutions listed in 
the schedule, approximately 140. The purpose of listing the 
institutions is to make it clear to everyone which institutions are 
covered by the act. Going away from a list approach creates the 
possibility of confusing the issue of whether the act applies to a 
particular institution. It may mean having to go to court to find out 
whether the act applies to a particular institution in a given 
circumstance.
<P>
	As a result of Bill C-309 some institutions not currently subject 
to the act will be subject to the specific amendment. For example, 
Canada Post is not subject to the act but will be subject to the 
proposed clause 5(1).
<P>
	I am also concerned about the definition of public opinion poll, 
which I find extremely broad. It could include quantitative and 
qualitative research conducted among members of the public using 
a prepared questionnaire or interview schedule. A good proportion 
of this research would be of very limited public interest.
<P>
	I do not believe Bill C-309 is needed. There is already a right of 
access to public opinion poll research under the Access to 
Information Act. There is recent case law that provides guidance to 
the government in disclosing such polls. There is a government 
policy on disclosing poll results. The Minister of Justice has stated 
his intention to reform the Access to Information Act.
<P>
	Given all this, I do not think it is appropriate or necessary to 
proceed with an ad hoc amendment on the specific issue of public 
opinion polls. I have problems also with the fact the bill would 
introduce significant new bureaucratic reporting requirements, 
deviate from the way the rest of the act defines government 
institutions and potentially could apply to research of very limited  
public interest. For all these reasons, I cannot support the bill.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the purpose 
of Bill C-309 tabled on February 22, 1995 by the hon. member for 
Red Deer is to amend the Access to Information Act. Its main 
objective is to oblige the government to disclose results obtained 
and methods used in public opinion polls commissioned by the 
government through various agencies.
<P>
	The proposed legislation provides that the government shall lay 
before this House a report of the results of public opinion polls it 
has commissioned.
<P>
	We support this initiative because it encourages openness and 
the democratic exercise of power. The debate on public opinion 
polls and the need for making this tool more transparent is mainly 
about whether these polls undermine the democratic process by 
influencing the behaviour of society in general.
<P>
	Recent studies have shown that publication of these polls can 
have an impact on a close race, especially towards the end of the 
campaign. The publication of public opinion polls can have a 
positive or negative impact on the morale of volunteer campaign 
workers and donors.
<P>
<B>(1125)</B>
<P>
	Party strategists complain that it is hard to retrieve lost ground 
when the media have decided, on the basis of public opinion polls, 
that a party is no longer in the running. Opinion polls may be 
purposely misinterpreted, if the technical information provided is 
too incomplete to assess the validity of the results.
<P>
	Clearly, the secret use of this powerful instrument is a first step 
towards arbitrary use of power and a practice that is a threat to 
democracy. What seems to be a highly scientific instrument that 
confers a certain authority becomes, in the hands of unscrupulous 
politicians, a tool for political propaganda and manipulation. I am 
thinking, for instance, of the group for Canadian unity, a special 
unit of the Privy Council of this government.
<P>
	Working on behalf of the No coalition, the intergovernmental 
affairs office, located in an office tower in downtown Ottawa, 
attempts to implement the vision of the No forces, the status quo, 
which will make debtors and paupers of all Quebecers and even 
Canadians. This anti-referendum unit funded with public money 
has a budget of more than three million dollars. Part of this money 
is spent to commission public opinion polls whose methods and 
results are used to influence the democratic process in the Quebec 
referendum.
<P>
	This Canadian unity group, more obscure and secretive by far 
than the centre for Canadian unity was during the 1980 campaign, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15373"> 15373 </A></B>
<P>
commissions public opinion polls on a weekly basis and uses them 
to manipulate  public opinion in a democratic society. In fact, 
because of the secret nature of these polls, nothing prevents this 
government from using methods that are questionable from a 
scientific point of view and thus commissioning results that will 
influence the vote.
<P>
	Nothing prevents the government from only disclosing polls that 
are favourable and eliminating those that might be less favourable 
to its negative vision. Polling companies play a role that has an 
impact not only on elections but also on policy development. 
Governments use public opinion polls to define their positions on 
various controversial issues and to determine their priorities. 
Federal ministers therefore take the initiative of commissioning 
polls to test public reaction to various options. In short, the 
government is no longer concerned about the content of its policies 
but focusses on their form based on public opinion polls. The 
famous Axworthy reform is an excellent example.
<P>
	The amounts allocated by the federal government for public 
opinion polls are astronomical. During the period from April 1990 
to November 1991, a mere 19 months, apparently over $10 million 
in expenditures were approved by the Department of Supply and 
Services and committed by the federal government for public 
opinion polls. That amount does not include contracts awarded 
directly by departments.
<P>
	For all these reasons it is essential for transparency to become 
the main objective of democratic governments when they make use 
of public opinion polls. Bill 309 calls for effective measures to 
ensure government transparency when public opinion polls are 
used. The report submitted to the House of Commons must 
therefore indicate the nature of the public opinion poll, the 
questions asked and a summary of the responses given, the name of 
the person or firm commissioned to conduct the poll and finally, its 
cost. This is a bill with the potential to change the face of Canadian 
style democracy.
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	Speaking of surveys, I would like to comment very briefly if I 
may on the results of the survey carried out by Léger and Léger for 
<I>Le Journal de Montréal</I> and the <I>Globe and Mail</I>, released last 
Saturday, the day before yesterday.
<P>
	With two weeks to go until referendum day, the yes side shows a 
solid 49.2 per cent compared to 50.8 per cent for the no side. In 
only a few weeks we have taken over five of the federalists' 
percentage points, reducing the difference to a mere 1.6 per cent.
<P>
	This considerable advance is in large part due to what the press is 
calling the ``Bouchard factor'', but it must be pointed out that this 
week we gained only two percentage points.
<P>
	Before distribution of the undecided voters, 45 per cent of 
respondents stated that they would vote yes to the referendum 
question, while 42.4 per cent indicated that they would vote no.
<P>
	Among those whose minds were definitely made up, I must point 
out that 52.2 per cent of francophone respondents stated that they 
will be voting yes, compared to only 34.3 per cent who will vote 
no.
<P>
	There are a number of explanations for this upturn in support for 
the sovereignist camp. We have the most popular, most credible, 
most loved leaders in Quebec on our side in Mr. Bouchard, Mr. 
Parizeau and Mr. Dumont. Lagging far behind them are the 
spokespersons for the no side, the Prime Minister of Canada, the 
Minister of Labour, Mr. Johnson, and the hon. member for 
Sherbrooke.
<P>
	We will win this coming October 30 because we are promoting 
the project of a just society that is fair for all, a project of 
generosity and compassion for the most disadvantaged segments of 
our society: the unemployed, welfare recipients, immigrants, 
refugees, pensioners and so on. On the other hand, the blueprint for 
society of this government, of the Liberals, the Conservatives and 
the Reform, is to protect big capital, those who are already 
advantaged. The program of the ministers of finance and of human 
resources development, of Ontario's Mike Harris and Alberta's 
Ralph Klein is to protect the rich and neglect the poor.
<P>
	In conclusion, I state that the Bloc Quebecois supports Bill 
C-309.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I should like to speak for a few minutes in support of the 
private member's bill of the hon. member for Red Deer who has 
done some excellent work on the issue.
<P>
	In 1980-81 I had the privilege of working on the original access 
to information bill. I believed then and I still believe now the 
intention of the government at that time was to do the very thing 
the private member's bill suggests.
<P>
	In the last 13 years to 14 years the whole access to information 
process has become locked in a system I call the bureaucratic MAD 
treatment, maximum administrative delay. As a government 
member I have had great difficulty on more than one occasion in 
getting the access to information system to work for me.
<P>
	The objective of the hon. member for Red Deer is to refer the bill 
to committee. He has not asked the House to accept the bill line by 
line, comma for comma. If small amendments are required I 
believe they can be accommodated in committee.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15374"> 15374 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1135 )</B>
<P>
	The whole discussion on access to information is something that 
would serve the government and serve the House well. What the 
member is saying in the bill is very much a part of our 
government's red book wherein we were committed to operating a 
much more transparent, a much more accountable, a much more 
open government.
<P>
	Day after day the Prime Minister lives a life of transparency. We 
all know that these polls are being conducted and there are the 
results of the polls. We have nothing to hide when we conduct 
polls. They are done to advance public policy in a more refined and 
better way for all Canadians.
<P>
	We on this side of the House celebrate that members of 
Parliament should work hard at developing and thinking some of 
their own ideas. This example very much fits that description. The 
member for Red Deer has put forward the idea that all public 
opinion polls should be much more accountable to Parliament and I 
support him in that regard.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to rise in support of Bill C-309, an act to amend the 
Access to Information Act (disclosure of results of public opinion 
polls).
<P>
	As I look through the bill it makes complete sense to me. I am 
sure that anyone who believes in the democratic process would 
agree that the bill is simply common sense. Every day public polls 
are conducted by media outlets, associations, academics, and 
especially by government departments.
<P>
	There are two principal differences between the groups I have 
listed. First, the government is the only one funded solely by the 
taxpayers of Canada. Second, the government is the principal one 
that does not make the results of its polls easily and readily 
available to the Canadian public. Is there a paradox in this 
situation? Last year the Winnipeg <I>Free Press</I> in an editorial wrote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>During the election last fall, the Liberals made transparency and openness in 
government a central theme. What a difference a victory makes.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Yes, what a difference a victory makes. We all know that the 
former Conservative government was obsessed with public polling. 
In 1992 the Conservative government spent an unprecedented $140 
million on public polling. Most of that money was awarded to 
chums of the Conservative Party, a firm called Decima polling.
<P>
	How nice it would have been to be working at Decima in 1992. I 
see why the Liberal government criticized the Conservatives 
during the 1993 election campaign. Expenditures on polling prior 
to 1992 were about $10 million a year. With an increase to $140 
million, who would not want to make it an election issue?
<P>
	I will briefly outline the history. It is important the House knows 
why the Liberals are arguing against Bill C-309. Liberals will tell 
us that there is no problem when comparing their policy to that of 
the Progressive Conservatives. This may be true. Hopefully no 
government will ever again reach the total polling expenditures as 
the Conservatives did in 1992.
<P>
	The one key point that must be clear in the debate is that the 
Liberal government is doing very little to change the old style 
polling established by the Conservative government. The Winnipeg 
<I>Free Press</I> stated last year:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>By tradition, advice from polling must stay locked up in a bomb-proof vault 
until the minister passes on to a better place or until the paper it is written on 
turns yellow and disintegrates.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
	This tradition is still alive and well with the Liberal government. 
In May 1994 the Liberal government introduced what it said was an 
alternative to this tradition. It introduced a series of polling 
measures that the Minister of Public Works and Government 
Services said were based on ``principles of transparency and 
openness''. The only thing transparent is the Liberal commitment 
to tell the Canadian people what the Liberals want them to know. 
The only thing that is open is the Canadian taxpayer's wallet as he 
or she pays for the veil of secrecy created when government polls 
are conducted.
<P>
	Bill C-309, an act to amend the Access to Information Act, 
prohibits the blatant manipulation of public information gathered 
by government departments. The bill would force any government 
department or unit that commissions a public opinion poll to give 
notice to the appropriate minister. The minister is then obliged to 
submit to the House of Commons the results of the poll. The 
minister would present four key components of the poll: first, a 
description of its nature; second, a copy of the questions asked and 
a summary of the responses given; third, the period of time when 
the poll was conducted; and fourth, the cost of the poll.
<P>
	This seems to be a logical progression of events. Ministers of the 
crown should not even need legislation compelling them to submit 
poll results. By their very nature as chief representatives of 
departments in a democracy, all information gathered at the 
department should be open to public scrutiny. As it stands, the 
ministers are picking and choosing the poll results that are most 
beneficial to them in promoting their policies.
<P>
	The government will argue that it has answered all the concerns 
of Canadians about access to public polls. The government will 
claim that in May 1994 it released guidelines to ensure that 
information was made public. However last December the Toronto 
<I>Star</I> called the guidelines ``a fraudulent new access scheme''. The 
Toronto <I>Star</I> was absolutely correct.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15375"> 15375 </A></B>
<P>
	There are a few catches that the Liberal government failed to 
mention when it introduced the new guidelines. It failed to 
mention that the government still has the ability to keep some poll 
results secret. It is able to do so if the individual minister feels 
the results would be injurious to the public interest or to 
federal-provincial relations. That seems to give the ministers room 
to impose total personal discretion. What one cabinet minister may 
see as injurious to public interest may be necessary information 
to the average Canadian.
<P>
	Mr. Kenneth Rubin, an expert on government documents, called 
this ethics package ``so vague it is hard to criticize it precisely, but 
the specific rules for withholding polls are what the Tories 
practised''. This vagueness is a blessing only for cabinet ministers 
as they are able to interpret it to their own benefit.
<P>
	Another benefit to cabinet ministers and their friends in the 
polling companies is that they are given 90 days to release poll 
publications, which is an absolute absurdity. After 90 days the issue 
is likely dead and Canadians have little interest in old news or dead 
issues. Also quite often the government has already used the 
information to its advantage by this time.
<P>
	The 90-day period of silence is stretched even further as often 
the polling companies give the government a verbal or a brief 
written synopsis of the results. There is no requirement to release 
poll results until 90 days after the government receives the final 
written report. This in reality can add months to the 90-day period. 
The information commissioner in his annual report in June called 
this ``a loophole of monumental proportions''.
<P>
	Even then, if the 90-day period is not long enough, the minister 
can still apply to have it extended indefinitely. In effect a minister 
can sit on an issue as long as he or she chooses. The government 
can also use the extended period provision to avoid criticism and 
legal action. Once the government has decided to release the poll 
results the poll is no longer open to further scrutiny under 
provisions of the Access to Information Act. That means any right 
to complain to the federal court about information quality or delays 
is no longer an option.
<P>
<B>(1145 )</B>
<P>
	If all this security is still not enough for cabinet ministers, they 
have even more ways of ensuring the Canadian public does not 
receive poll results accurately. They can instruct their friends at the 
polling companies to provide only summaries of the results and 
leave the real meat and bones of the research in the technical tables.
<P>
	Another creative method of avoiding the public is that the 
government can purchase omnibus polling packages from 
companies that are providing them to other organizations as well. 
These poll results then remain the property of the polling company 
and do not have to be  made public, even though government 
money paid for this information.
<P>
	Bill C-309 responds to all these loopholes by offering a 
straightforward method of dealing with the publishing of poll 
results. It requires the ministers to submit polls to the House of 
Commons no later than 15 days after the poll is completed. If the 
House is not sitting the report must be submitted to the information 
commissioner, published in the <I>Canada Gazette</I>, and presented to 
Parliament upon its return. This is simple logic and is democratic. 
Bill C-309 eliminates all the vagueness that allows the government 
to abuse the system.
<P>
	The information commissioner wrote in his 1995 annual report: 
``The Liberals promised to do better than the Conservatives, much 
better. Many Canadians thus anticipated a new government with 
the self-confidence to be candid''. In my opinion, it is quite clear 
that this government is no more candid than the former 
government. This is not merely my opinion. The information 
commissioner, who is an expert in the field, agreed when he added 
in his report that ``expectations for a bright new day with sunshine 
in all the old dark places were unrealistically high''. The 
information commissioner is clearly not satisfied with this 
government's commitment to openness. Canadians are not satisfied 
either.
<P>
	The information commissioner and the Reform Party are not the 
only ones that are not content with the government's lack of 
commitment to open government. The Ottawa <I>Sun</I> criticized the 
government accurately last fall when it stated: ``Who knows, one of 
these days the government might even poll you for your opinion on 
whether it should be forced to release the results of all its opinion 
polls. Tell them what you think, just don't ask them for the results. 
You might be told it's none of your damn business''.
<P>
	It is the business of Canadians to know what questions and issues 
are being polled. Canadians deserve the right to know what is the 
popular opinion of the nation. They deserve to know what the 
government is doing with the results it receives. They deserve to 
know if the government departments are polling for legitimate 
reasons or for the government party's own political gain. Finally, 
Canadians deserve the right to see how much money is being spent 
by the government and for what reasons.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Colleagues, I find myself in 
a situation we all do from time to time. I know the practice is not to 
recognize people in the gallery. However, I would want the group 
from St. Timothy Catholic School to know that if I could recognize 
them I would, but it is not our practice to do so.

<P>
	I will make my remarks brief. I rise to speak in support of Bill 
C-309. It is a pleasure to do so. I believe reform of the Access 
to Information Act is very necessary and long overdue. My feeling 
on Bill C-309 is that while I support it wholeheartedly, it does 
not go anywhere near far enough. The time has come, in the name 
of opening up government, in the name of opening up the 
bureaucracy, to review the provisions of the Access to Information 
Act.
<P>
	I have had a lot of experience with the Access to Information Act 
over the years, particularly in the matter of getting historic records. 
As the member for Broadview-Greenwood said, the act as 
originally designed is not the act as it is currently practised. We 
have a situation where an act that was originally intended to open 
up government documents is now being used in many instances to 
withhold government documents.
<P>
	I want to say to the member for Red Deer that I join him in 
supporting this bill and putting this bill forward. I hope it is a first 
step for a complete overhaul of both the Access to Information Act 
and the Privacy Act.
<P>
<B>(1150)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish to 
recognize the individuals on the other side who are supporting this 
bill. I would like to ask those members who do not support the bill 
why they do not support it. Why did we not have unanimous 
consent to have this bill made a votable bill?
<P>
	When these people were in opposition to the Conservatives they 
ripped at the Conservatives all the time. They said we have to 
change the access to information laws, open government up, and let 
Canadian taxpayers, who are footing the bill for this information, 
have access to it. Why the change of heart once the Liberal Party 
was elected as government? Why the difference?
<P>
	I think the fundamental reason for that lies at the very heart of 
what is wrong with our approach to governing in this country. It is 
because we have among the three old-line parties an elitist, top 
down approach to governing. Once the political party of the day 
gets into power it is not much interested in listening to the people in 
the sense of shaping policy or developing legislation. It is very 
much a command and control government that we have. It wants to 
have information so that it knows how to shape its messages and 
sell its policies but it is not really interested in having policy 
developed or shaped by the Canadian people. In this milieu, it is 
not particularly helpful to have information available to the public. 
It is much more advantageous to keep that information to yourself 
and use it for your own purposes and not allow the Canadian people 
to have access to it.
<P>
	I would use the gun control bill as a perfect example of a bill that 
is widely hated by Canadians. The government is refusing to 
acknowledge that fact. It is using polling as  a means of trying to 
determine how it can best sell this odious piece of legislation. It is 
not really interested in listening to the views of Canadians from 
coast to coast who take real offence to this legislation.
<P>
	I would make the argument that the situation we find ourselves 
in is not likely to change. We will have opposition parties forever 
decrying the lack of access to information and ridiculing and 
condemning the government of the day for not changing the access 
to information rules. However, once these parties get into power 
they will act the same way unless we have a fundamental change in 
our whole approach to governing.
<P>
	That is what the Reform Party of Canada stands for. We believe 
that not only do we come here with a set of policies and principles 
we would like to put in front of the Canadian people, but we also 
suggest there has to be a fundamental change in the way Canada is 
governed. Ordinary Canadians should have much more say through 
referenda, through initiatives, and through recall to have their 
views and wishes incorporated into the policies and legislation of 
the government.
<P>
	Until we have these fundamental changes, until we have a break 
away from this elitist, top down approach to government in which 
information is always going to be very tightly corralled, where 
there is no advantage in making that information known to the 
general public, we are never going to have the changes we would 
all like to see. I would suggest that while the members opposite talk 
about opening this up and having better access to information, it is 
not going to change until we change the system.
<P>
<B>(1155 )</B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Seeing no other members 
rising, I wonder if the House might be disposed to this. The motion 
stands in the name of the hon. member for Red Deer. The 
understanding is that no one else will speak after the hon. member 
for Red Deer closes the debate. I would seek the member's 
co-operation, if he would reply under the right of reply for two 
minutes and no more, to in fact close the debate on Motion No. 
M-309 which stands in his name.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, what we have 
heard is a general agreement that the access to information 
legislation needs to be reformed. I would like to believe there is an 
honest will to do that and that the justice minister will deliver on 
the promise to change the legislation.
<P>
	The problem is there are a lot of issues on the justice minister's 
plate and I honestly do not believe he will get around to the changes 
in the legislation or will be able to deal with them in this 
Parliament. For those of us in the House who believe there should 
be changes, I believe that the onus is on us to continue to bring 
forward these ideas and the desire of the Canadian people to have 
more openness in government. The people are demanding it.  They 
are saying that it must happen. I believe that we as parliamentarians 
<P>

<B><A NAME="15377"> 15377 </A></B>
<P>
must respond. I would urge all members to get behind the changes 
and to pressure their parties to make these changes.
<P>
	I would like to thank the House for this opportunity. I would like 
to thank the members who spoke in favour of the bill. We should 
keep up the fight to ensure that the justice minister does find the 
time to change the access to information legislation.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I thank all members for their 
co-operation.

	The time provided for the consideration of private members' 
business has now expired. Pursuant to Standing Order 96, the order

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="EMPLOYMENTEQUITYACT">EMPLOYMENT EQUITY ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed from October 6 consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-64, an act respecting employment equity, be read the 
third time and passed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it is my privilege this morning to rise to speak to Bill C-64. I will 
be speaking against the bill.
<P>
	Bill C-64 extends and supersedes the 1986 Employment Equity 
Act, which covered crown corporations and federally regulated 
private sector employees. It covers banks, airlines, railways, and 
telecommunications, which employ about five per cent of Canada's 
workforce.
<P>
	According to the government, the purpose is to ``achieve 
equality in the workplace so that no person shall be denied 
employment opportunities or benefits for reasons unrelated to 
ability and, in the fulfilment of that goal, to correct the conditions 
of disadvantage in employment experienced by women, aboriginal 
peoples, persons with disabilities and members of visible 
minorities by giving effect to the principle that employment equity 
means more than treating persons in the same way but also requires 
special measures and accommodation of differences''. It is to be 
reflective of Canada's population as a whole.
<P>
	While it does not bear directly on the federal scene, it certainly 
impacts on the bill at hand. I would like to quote from Friday's 
editorial page of the <I>Globe and Mail</I>. It is entitled ``Why merit 
matters'', and reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Ontario's new Conservative government has introduced legislation to repeal 
the one-year-old Employment Equity Act. All Canadians, whatever their status 
or background, should be glad.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Despite the denials of its supporters, Bill 79 was unquestionably a ``quota 
law''. Employers were expected to set targets for creating a workforce that 
reflected the racial and gender make-up of the community at large. The bill was 
also clearly discriminatory. By requiring employers to favour members of the 
designated groups, it effectively required them to discriminate against members 
of the undesignated group: that is, able-bodied white men.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>But these are not the worst aspects of Bill 79. The main evil of the law is its 
implicit attack on the principle of merit.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Appeals for the importance of merit tend to have an elitist sound to modern 
ears. In fact, merit has always been cherished most dearly by the disadvantaged, 
who regard it as a ladder to better things. For generations, even centuries, 
disadvantaged people have pleaded to be released from the pigeon holes in 
which others place them and evaluated on their ability as individuals. ``See me 
for who I am, not what I am. Judge me on what I can do, not what I look like''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The supporters of employment equity would throw all this out the window. The 
merit principle, they will say in their honest moments simply hasn't worked. The 
disadvantaged are still disadvantaged. The colour blind, gender blind world is an 
impossible dream. We need to try something else. So instead of disregarding the 
group identity of people in hiring and promotion, we will fixate on it. Instead of 
encouraging employers to hire the best person for the job, we will require them to tot 
up their workers like so many jelly beans. Instead of encouraging new immigrants to 
become part of the wider society, we will tell them to define themselves by race.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In a diverse society with high levels of immigration, this is a terribly dangerous 
thing. Designed by well meaning people to encourage integration, employment 
equity in fact works against it, encouraging Canadians to huddle together in groups 
and feeding the unhealthy obsession with race and gender that has seized Canadian 
society in the 1990s. This obsession has already infected universities, museums, 
writers' organizations and women's groups. Bill 79 would have made it a law. Every 
Canadian should give it a hearty, ``Good riddance''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1200)</B>
<P>
	This does not directly bear on Bill C-64 but I think the same 
arguments apply against the imposition of Bill C-64. In our case 
new equity laws will immediately cover approximately 230,000 
Treasury Board employees. They will affect all federally regulated 
businesses and businesses with over 100 employees undertaking 
federal contracts.
<P>
	Due to the increased cost this law will cause, it will hold off 
implementation indefinitely on certain agencies such as CSIS, the 
RCMP and the armed forces. In practice Bill C-64 means enforcing 
racial and sex based numerical goals to correct perceived past 
discrimination. The numerical goals are quotas in disguise. If 
numerical goals are enforceable they serve exactly the same 
function as quotas.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15378"> 15378 </A></B>
<P>
	For years employment equity has been at work within the public 
service. It will be difficult or impossible to introduce it at the 
moment because the government is cutting jobs and has a hiring 
freeze in place. Public service employees declared surplus have 
ironclad job security which guarantees them another reasonable 
job offer within the public service.
<P>
	Admittedly men still account for more than 50 per cent of public 
servants and this is also reflected in the executive ranks. Most of 
the top managers within the bureaucracy were hired 25 years ago 
when government was growing. The bureaucracy still reflects a 
nation of a quarter century ago. For those same 25 years women 
have been entering the workplace with roughly the same 
educational credentials and the same job aspirations as men.
<P>
	In the private sector women have successfully moved into every 
profession: medicine, law, accounting, advertising, banking. 
Progress has been impressive. Why? The world has changed for 
women. Gender alone is no longer a very big influence on 
opportunity and life. Education and ability count for far more. 
Unquestionably racism and sexism do exist but discrimination 
alone does not explain the vastly unequal outcomes in life for 
different groups of people.
<P>
	Government and Canadians have an obligation to open doors for 
the disadvantaged but they are not always who we think they are. 
This matter is more complex than simply passing laws or imposing 
quotas. Current data and statistics are not enough. With the 
reduction in the public service the new laws will not radically 
affect or change the face of the current bureaucracy. Most of the 
data and conclusions are taken from self-identification surveys 
which are to identify women, disabled, aboriginal peoples and 
visible minorities, but the accuracy of these data is at best 
questionable.
<P>
	Many individuals do not perceive themselves to be 
disadvantaged or do not wish to admit it. Employer specific 
surveys do not reflect information accurately. In many cases people 
do not view themselves as disadvantaged unless specifically 
required to address the issue but are protected with anonymity such 
as in national surveys.
<P>
<B>(1205)</B>
<P>
	The 1992-93 report on employment equity in the public service 
states the number of visible minority employees may be 
underidentified by one and a half times. The number of disabled 
may be underidentified by two and a half times.
<P>
	With distorted data, conclusions based on the underidentification 
of designated groups means there may be already higher numbers 
of disadvantaged people in the workforce. Alternately there is an 
incentive to falsify self-identification surveys based on perceived 
advantages of being considered disadvantaged. For  example, a 
1994 annual report on the Employment Equity Act noted that as of 
1991 nearly 2.3 million Canadians reported having a disability, an 
increase of 30 per cent over 1986 surveys.
<P>
	Due to fiscal constraints the government will be using 
employment equity figures from the 1991 census until the year 
2003. How reliable are these figures? Statistics Canada 
acknowledges that in 1991, 10 per cent of the aboriginal population 
was not even enumerated. Only 3 per cent of Canadians reported 
their ethnic/cultural origin as Canadian.
<P>
	The existing Employment Equity Act calls for a comprehensive 
review every three years. The last review was in 1992, but the 
mandatory review for this year has not been undertaken. Basically 
the government is moving ahead with new legislation without 
having the benefit of this review.
<P>
	Since Canada has a shrinking bureaucracy there will be little 
direct impact on government but there will be an impact on 
businesses with over 100 employees who wish to conduct business 
with the federal government. What does that mean for them? No 
comprehensive study has been done in Canada on that outcome.
<P>
	To quote the Reform minority report on employment equity, the 
American magazine <I>Forbes</I> is the only source which has attempted 
to calculate the costs of affirmative action. It cited that the cost for 
regulation and compliance alone stood at $17 billion to $209 
billion annually. It verified that U.S. affirmative action costs were 
$113 billion per year since 1980, or 4 per cent of the GDP.
<P>
	In 1992 the Conference Board of Canada defined small, medium 
and large businesses and gave the annual average cost of 
employment equity for each category. Due to the lack of 
comprehensive studies in Canada, Reform took these figures, with 
the assistance of the Library of Parliament, to cover businesses 
across the nation. If all Canadian businesses were subject to equity 
legislation which was in place in Ontario, where firms with more 
than 50 employees were asked to have an employment equity plan, 
the total annual direct costs would be $1,035,223,000.
<P>
	These direct costs exclude compliance, opportunity and other 
indirect costs. The <I>Forbes</I> study showed that total costs were six 
times the direct costs. Based on this, the cost to Canadian business 
would reach $6.5 billion per annum, nearly 1 per cent of our GDP. 
The Library of Parliament has confirmed in writing the 
reasonableness of our figures.
<P>
	In essence this is another costly tax on business. The 
government's debt and deficit are already choking our economy. 
Taxpayers are unable to sustain even more expense, be it direct or 
indirect. The department of public works is already implementing a 
strategic procurement initiative which applies to all government  
depart-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15379"> 15379 </A></B>
<P>
ments and grants preference to aboriginal businesses bidding on 
federal contracts up to $2 million.
<P>
	By giving preferential treatment to native businesses in 
government procurement, the government hopes to provide a 
sustainable economic base for native self-government. However, 
employment equity carries a stigma and a presumption of racial or 
gender inferiority. Equity programs do not remove sex and race 
bias from the workplace; they institutionalize them.
<P>
	Brian Lee Crowley's article ``Does counting bodies add up to 
fairness?'' details findings of a 1987 study. What happens when 
women are promoted under a program emphasizing gender over 
ability is that they consistently rated their performance more 
negatively, took less credit for successful outcomes, were less 
eager to persist in their leadership roles. They also viewed 
themselves as more deficient in leadership skills. In other words, it 
diminished their worth in their own eyes.
<P>
<B>(1210)</B>
<P>
	In other areas such as education, law school, if doors are opened 
to individuals who are ill prepared to take on the challenge, the 
outcome can lead to failure and creates a dependency on 
government programs rather than fair competition.
<P>
	This spring the supreme court sent a clear message the charter is 
meant to protect individual rights rather than group rights. Section 
15 of the charter of rights and freedoms claims Canadians are equal 
before and under law. It adds governments cannot override this 
basic equality to enhance groups disadvantaged because of their 
race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age or mental 
or physical disability.
<P>
	Madam Justice McLachlin in the Miron case stated the larger 
purpose is simply the protection of individual human dignity and 
freedom which are violated whenever individuals are denied 
opportunities based on the stereotypical application or presumed 
group characteristics rather than on the basis of individual merit, 
capacity or circumstance.
<P>
	This hard hitting ruling clearly spells out that every person has 
the right to be judged on his or her own merits and not on the basis 
of group characteristics.
<P>
	Reform's minority report to the standing committee's report 
``Employment Equity: A Commitment to Merit'' has two very 
clear messages: employment competition based on the merit 
principle is key to both equality and productivity, and that 
employment equity legislation is the denial of basic human rights. I 
encourage all members of the House to read that report. It is not the 
status quo, but it does contain pertinent facts that tend to be glossed 
over.
<P>
	Politically, employment equity gives the appearance of being the 
expedient means to achieve equity in the workplace; it is politically 
correct. It is hard for the  government to move into new directions, 
to change the status quo. We grant that.
<P>
	In the example I quoted earlier, on the Harris government's 
scrapping the employment equity law we heard screams of 
``unfair''. For some, change becomes uncomfortable and they are 
unable to envisage innovative directions where there is equality of 
opportunity.
<P>
	The government is intent on moving forward with a new law 
without a proper review. I stated earlier that some government 
agencies would be exempt, defence being one. The Department of 
National Defence has conducted a diversity survey which could be 
and probably will be a step toward affirmative action. During the 
defence review Liberal members pushed to have hiring quotas 
official defence policy. The Canadian forces anti-racism policy 
does exempt affirmative action programs from classification as 
racism.
<P>
	In the 1970s promotion of thousands of francophones was 
distorted by going well down promotion lists to find someone with 
a suitable background. By this I do not mean 10, 15 or 20 names, I 
mean 40 or more. The same is going on at the moment for women, 
although to a lesser extent. Eleven per cent of the Canadian forces 
are women.
<P>
	If all Canadians are equal before and under the law, we must not 
continue to support laws that patronize designated groups, in 
essence assume their mediocrity. Merit should be the underlying 
principle. Anything that detracts from the merit principle, civilian 
or military, is bad policy. Diversity studies clearly signal the 
government is moving to introduce characteristics other than merit 
to hiring or promotion programs.
<P>
	Government's role should be to ensure equality of opportunity 
rather than the equality of results in the public sector. It is 
government's responsibility to provide a standard of secondary 
education which is accessible to all, local responsive 
post-secondary institutions, affordable student loans based on 
need, bursaries and scholarships based on need and excellence, 
sensitivity training in the public sector which supports inherent 
equality, dignity and worth of all.
<P>
	We should ensure that laws against discrimination are enforced. 
Government should lead by example, by laying out objective 
testing regimes, by broad based advertising of all job postings and 
by offering facilities to accommodate disabled people wherever 
they may work. As Madam Justice McLachlin pointed out, the 
protection of individual human dignity and freedom is important 
for all.
<P>
<B>(1215)</B>
<P>
	We are not all equal in ability. Those who wish to pursue 
education or a vocation should not face discrimination barriers. 
Those who pursue this course deserve to reap the benefits and 
rewards of hard work.

	Clearly, legislated equity does not achieve its goals. It is costly 
and it is unfair. Merit should be the sole hiring criterion in an 
environment free from arbitrary obstructions to hiring or 
promotion. Merit must be restored as the sole basis for hiring and 
promotion in the public service.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I often hear hon. members of the Reform Party referring to the 
Ontario Employment Equity Act. Somehow they try to tell 
Canadians that we are speaking about the same act.
<P>
	I would like to take the opportunity to clear up some of the 
misconceptions that have been stated by the Reform Party. I want 
to put on the record that our legislation specifically prohibits the 
imposition of quotas. Another fundamental difference is that Bill 
C-64 takes a unique human resource planning approach. Ontario's 
legislation is modelled more on a human rights approach with third 
party complaints. I would point out that under the Ontario system 
any person can lay a complaint, including interest groups, job 
applicants, employees, unions, public or private corporations, or 
any other individual. There is no such provision in our legislation.
<P>
	With regard to the rules and regulations that govern the two 
pieces of legislation, Ontario has set out the obligations of 
employers in considerable detail and there are extensive provisions 
for detailed regulations. Bill C-64, on the other hand, is much less 
prescriptive and minimizes regulatory burden by limiting new 
regulations to just a few essential areas. A criticism of the Ontario 
act is the very broad regulation making power it confers on people.
<P>
	There is a substantial difference in just what is covered by the 
federal and Ontario legislation. The Ontario act has a much broader 
scope. For example, the threshold for private sector coverage in 
Ontario is 50 employees while under Bill C-64 it is 100 employees. 
Keep in mind as well that the Ontario legislation covers about 
17,000 employers while our act targets approximately 350 
employers, and many are leaders in the business community.
<P>
	To enforce its legislation Ontario established two new 
independent government agencies, the Ontario Employment Equity 
Commission and the Ontario Employment Equity Tribunal. Hon. 
members know that Bill C-64 will utilize two existing government 
agencies, namely Human Resources Development Canada and the 
Canadian Human Rights Commission.
<P>
	I trust that I have helped to clarify for the hon. member the key 
differences that exist between the provincial and federal 
legislation.
<P>
	If that is not enough, I would like to remind hon. members of 
some very interesting survey results. Roughly two thirds of Ontario 
businesses responding to a poll just  after the recent Ontario 
election reported that they are in fact in favour of reforming or 
keeping that province's employment equity law as it is. The 
business position is reform it but do not repeal it. Only 8 per cent 
said they would cease implementing employment equity initiatives 
if the law is repealed, with 69 per cent saying it would not have any 
impact on their company's equity plans.
<P>
	I appreciate this time to make some comments. I think that in 
this debate it is important that the Reform Party face the facts and 
the truth.
<P>
<B>(1220 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Frazer:</B> Mr. Speaker, that was very instructive. However, 
when we talk about quotas, whether we take guidelines or equity of 
employment for various groups, we are specifying they are quotas. 
If we say that 5, 10, 20 or 30 per cent of the population falls into 
certain categories, the implication is that 5, 10, 20 or 30 per cent 
will be given jobs based on those percentages. This demeans 
people. It tells them it does not matter how good you are or how 
hard you can work or how capable you are, you will get your job 
because you belong to this group. I think that is not only divisive 
but also is totally and absolutely unfair.
<P>
	As I said in my previous remarks, in the study on women it has 
been found that the practice now instituted in the federal hiring 
system of giving a certain quantity of jobs to women actually 
undermines their self-confidence. They think maybe they got their 
jobs because they are women, rather than because they deserve it, 
they are qualified for it and are good at it. They measure 
themselves as inadequate and they feel inadequate because they 
were given preferential treatment for hiring.
<P>
	The Reform Party wants equality of opportunity for all, 
regardless of their race, their colour, their gender, their language or 
whatever. Give them a fair chance at the job. If they are up to it, 
they will do it and they will do it well; otherwise, they should not 
be in the job.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, of course I have to say that I support the hon. member in 
his position on this bill.
<P>
	The point the Liberals opposite are missing is the principle of 
this bill. The principle is the social engineers of the Liberal Party 
are trying to legislate that businesses in this country will have to 
enter into hiring practices that will be based on things other than 
merit or abilities.
<P>
	This country was made strong by Canadian workers who got 
their education and their training and did everything they could to 
prepare themselves to be competitive in the marketplace. They did 
that and achieved individual rewards as a result. As my colleague 
has pointed out, this bill seeks to destroy that individual initiative 
by placing special considerations on special groups. What 
happened to merit? There is no merit mentioned in Bill C-64.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15381"> 15381 </A></B>
<P>
	For this member to tell me that businesses in Ontario are 
supporting this bill, this employment equity idea, over a 
fundamental principle of hiring people based on their individual 
merit is absolute nonsense. I would like to meet a businessman 
who responded to that survey who would tell me in all truthfulness 
that he does not care about the merit, the qualifications of the 
employees, but would rather base his hiring practices on this 
absurd legislation the Liberal Party is attempting to bring in here.
<P>
	I ask these social engineers across the way to give us a break. 
That is not the real world any more.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew (Secretary of State (Training 
and Youth), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am proud to be associated with 
this important initiative, Bill C-64.
<P>
	I believe the hon. member does not know what we mean when 
we talk about merit. I have worked with the under-represented 
target groups for many, many years. In 1984 to 1986 I worked with 
the Public Service Commission where we instituted a number of 
initiatives because there was such a gross under-representation of 
those target groups.
<P>
	For instance, aboriginal people are the lowest paid on a national 
average. They are paid less than all of the average working 
population. If you are a disabled person you are grossly 
under-represented. It is very difficult for a disabled person who has 
merit to get a job on a meritorious basis.
<P>
<B>(1225 )</B>
<P>
	These hon. members should be looking for ways to integrate the 
under-represented people rather than keeping them out and 
marginalized. Those aboriginal people who make it into the system 
are still mostly located in the technical and clerical areas. That is a 
fact and it has nothing to do with merit. Those people have merit. 
The problem is that they are not getting promoted. Even though 
they have merit, the qualifications, the experience and the skills, 
they are being paid less than other people. Talk about inequality. 
Those are the facts.
<P>
	Let the hon. members know there is nothing wrong with sharing 
an equal place in the workplace, shoulder to shoulder with a 
woman, an aboriginal, a disabled person or a member of a visible 
minority. There is nothing wrong with that. No one said that if you 
are an aboriginal person, a woman, a disabled person or a member 
of a visible minority you have to be stupid or unqualified to make 
the employment equity program. That is not what this bill states.
<P>
	This bill states that everyone will have an opportunity because of 
systemic discrimination and because the opportunities have not 
made themselves available over 125 years to those people to enter 
with equality into the workplace. This bill states that they will have 
the opportunity now. There are still fewer people of those four 
target groups who are paid as much and who have as  many 
promotions. I do not know why the hon. members cannot accept 
that fact.
<P>
	The other day the hon. member for Wild Rose put a rather 
disparaging human face on employment equity by using his son. I 
have three children, but I am not going to come out here and plead a 
case for my children. I have worked to get them an education. They 
can fend for themselves and work for themselves. This is about 
broad public policy; it is not about one case.
<P>
	If there ever was a case, listen to this. In my riding there is an 
aboriginal man who is now severely disabled. He is an elder in the 
community. In 1959, along with his four partners, he was working 
in a sawmill. He was in a serious accident while sawing wood for 
the government employees in a place called Rocher River. His 
friend was decapitated and this man's arm was amputated. He made 
a number of attempts to receive some type of compensation for his 
loss but had no success. This is an employment equity issue, an 
equality issue, a human rights issue.
<P>
	Because this man lived in a harsh and inclement environment he 
had to rely on his skills. He went to residential school in that area 
but was not an educated man. He was a trapper. He had children. 
His children could not pursue or finish their education simply 
because he needed them to stay home and cut wood, haul water, and 
do all those things necessary to survive. I am not sure where the 
system failed. This man's wife has worked all of her life and has no 
regrets, but it was a severely difficult case.
<P>
	These are the kinds of things we are talking about. We are talking 
about having a human mind and heart to the toils and the struggles 
of the average Canadian. We are not talking about creating gross 
inequality and promoting people so that they are falling off the top.
<P>
	This is a very disparaging and discouraging kind of discussion 
we are having with members opposite. Why is it so difficult for 
them to understand the struggles of that kind of individual rather 
than bringing in people who are saying they did not get a job 
because they are not the right colour? That is not what it is about.
<P>
	There are people who are disabled, women, visible minorities, 
aboriginals, and a combination thereof who have severe 
difficulties. On the national average, when these people make it 
into the system they do not get paid as much as the person who is 
already there. They are paid less for the same work.
<P>
<B>(1230 )</B>
<P>
	There is another problem. When they get into the system they are 
at the bottom. Aboriginal people, for instance, are mostly in 
clerical and technical areas. They are not in senior management 
areas. That is changing but very slowly.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15382"> 15382 </A></B>
<P>
	We need some help and this provides help, but it does not step 
on anyone to do it. I challenge the Reform Party to come up with 
facts to prove that it does. The facts will not bear its position out.
<P>
	As a country we value diversity. We support our many 
communities as a source of social stability and economic strength. 
As individuals too many Canadians continue to face enormous 
barriers to employment which prevent them from achieving their 
full potential.
<P>
	I have met with the disability groups. I have seen those people. I 
have spoken with them. It is all right to stand in the House of 
Commons and isolate oneself from that constituency, but 
sometimes one should go to the source. We as elected members 
have to go to the source, keep open minds and respond to those 
people rather than criticize them and stomp on any opportunities 
they might have.
<P>
	It is ridiculous. We have to help those people. They have less 
than we do in terms of opportunities. As a disabled person mobility 
is a problem and the work environment can be a problem. Those are 
the things we have to work on.
<P>
	If people live in high unemployment areas or in areas of extreme 
poverty as do some aboriginals, they are marginalized socially. 
They do not have a mode of transportation. There are many barriers 
facing them. Some are institutionalized; some are systemic. That is 
true. That is a fact. That is something we cannot deny and we have 
to face reality.
<P>
	I spoke about an individual who has endured, who has worked 
many years on the land with one arm. The individual said to me: 
``My arm must be worth $100,000''. Any insurance company 
would say: ``How can we put a value on the loss of one's arm or any 
extremity?'' It would be putting a value on a life. It would be 
putting a value on the man's capacity to provide for his children so 
they can pursue and finish their education and his wife can be there 
to raise their children with him. That was not made available to that 
family. These are the kinds of situations that arise out of the 
inequities, the barriers, the obstacles.
<P>
	In 1994 the Employment Equity Act annual report painted a 
depressing picture for people with disabilities, members of visible 
minorities, women and aboriginal people. Since 1991 employment 
has declined more severely for employees covered under the act 
than for employees in the Canadian economy.
<P>
	In spite of an increase in the population of designated groups 
fewer of them found their way into the labour market. They are not 
a threat. Believe me, the jobs are safe. They just want an 
opportunity to do something, to make themselves independent.
<P>
	Members opposite on a daily basis wail away about how people 
have become so dependent, are on welfare and are living off the 
system. Here is an opportunity for  them to help those people to 
integrate into the system, to be independent, to have self-respect, to 
have a job and to support their own families.
<P>
	Members of designated groups still find themselves at the lowest 
end of the social and economic scale. Not only do they not have the 
opportunity, many of them are also the poorest. It is not correct that 
the wage gap between visible minority employees and other full 
time workers has widened for men and remains almost the same for 
women since 1987. There has not been that much movement.
<P>
	I do not know why the intimidation. I do not know why the 
perverse, twisted language that strikes fear into the hearts of the 
average Canadian. It is so seductive to speak that way. It is so easy 
to use colourful, provocative gross language that overstates the 
case and sells it unfairly. That is not right; that should not be done. 
Let the facts speak for themselves. There is something seriously 
wrong when talented, educated women continue to be over 
represented in clerical, sales and service jobs but under-represented 
in upper management and technical jobs.
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	How can we call ourselves a caring and passionate society when 
we deny people with disabilities accessibility and the dignity that 
comes with a job? It is a source of national shame that our first 
peoples account for only 1.04 per cent of the workforce, occupy the 
lowest paying jobs and are on the losing end of the wage gap when 
compared with other Canadians.
<P>
	It is unacceptable that university educated aboriginal young 
people experience an unemployment rate twice that of their white 
male counterparts, considering the barriers that face them when 
they enter high school.
<P>
	In some places I have visited there is a dropout rate in excess of 
85 per cent. Those children who make it into the system, who make 
it through high school and who make it through university are in an 
alien, foreign environment. It is different. It is difficult. I have done 
it. I know. It is difficult for them. They need support. They do not 
need criticism, opposition and confrontation. Leaving employable 
people on the sidelines does us all a disservice. It damages 
individuals. It wastes enormous talent. It hinders our economy and 
diminishes society as a whole.
<P>
	Employment equity is quite simply fairness in the distribution of 
jobs. Bill C-64 is designed to ensure that nobody is denied 
employment opportunities or benefits for reasons unrelated to 
ability. Inequality by comparison is a drag on our economy. Passive 
income support costs all Canadians, not the least of whom are the 
individuals affected. There is a pressing need for the legislation.
<P>
	By the turn of the century two-thirds of entrants to the workforce 
will be from the four designated groups: women, aboriginal 
peoples, members of visible  minorities, and people with disabili-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15383"> 15383 </A></B>
<P>
ties. The country needs the wealth of their talents. We cannot afford 
to overlook any segment of the population any longer.
<P>
	Will those two-thirds be the unemployed? Will those two-thirds 
be the ones on welfare? Will those two-thirds be the ones who are 
not moving anywhere, not promoted, not given any employment, 
not given any opportunities?
<P>
	Those are the real questions to be answered. People are our most 
important natural resource. Strategies that capitalize on the 
underutilized capabilities of every employable Canadian are 
clearly in the best interest of the country.
<P>
	Employment equity improves the workplace environment and 
promotes productivity by encouraging a more tolerant and 
integrated workforce. This is the intent of Bill C-64. That is why I 
ask members opposite what is so reprehensible. What is so wrong 
with having the four designated groups standing shoulder to 
shoulder and sharing the workplace with the rest of the population? 
That is the way it should be. That is what our country is about.
<P>
	We are a mosiac. We are not a melting pot. Canada is that kind of 
a country. We do not try as in the United States to make everybody 
the same. We are all individuals in the House which does not stop 
us from respecting one another. We do not have to agree 
ideologically with each other to respect one another as people. That 
is not the way the country should be proceeding into the future. 
That is not the way a country as diverse as Canada will work.
<P>
	Individuals benefit from contributing to their communities. 
Canada profits from the skills and strengths they have to offer. In 
short we all benefit not just in better social conditions which are 
critical but in realizing our national economic potential. It is good 
business for Canada to have those people integrated into the 
workforce. It is good business for Canada and for us as elected 
officials to have those people independent, integrated, promoted, 
and to have them utilize their skills and their merits as they should.
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	We can recreate our country in a way that better reflects us by 
working shoulder to shoulder with designated groups and by 
acknowledging the contributions of members of the designated 
groups to the economic wealth and rich cultural diversity of our 
country. Every one of us has a contribution to make but we can only 
make it if we are given the opportunity.
<P>
	Thank God for the opportunities given to those people. I have 
seen them work. I have seen programs clearly targeted to those 
groups and they work. They have given disabled people an 
opportunity, such as some of the programs where disabled people 
are integrated into banks and into some other areas. Be they clerical 
or  whatever, they are a start. We know that and are working on 
another part of it such as promoting those people if they have the 
capability and the merit to do it. Why not? That is the way it should 
be.
<P>
	Employment is the great equalizer. Jobs give us satisfaction, 
self-esteem and mutual respect. They also give us wages which 
allow us to provide a better standard of living for our families. 
Work gives us reason to believe in ourselves and for others to 
believe in us. This is the equality women, persons with disabilities, 
aboriginal peoples and members of visible minorities are seeking. 
We can take an important step toward that goal by adopting Bill 
C-64 and by doing so help our goal of building a more vibrant 
economy and a stronger country through a more representative 
workforce. We can make a positive contribution to Canada by 
helping disadvantaged Canadians build better lives for themselves 
and their families.
<P>
	I appeal to my colleagues on the other side to take another look 
and to have a more tolerant view of what equality and equity are all 
about. It is not about rising above the rest, being better than anyone 
else and pushing people out of the way. The numbers are not there 
to substantiate that. They are stagnant; there is no movement there. 
Those people are not a threat. They need our help. We can do 
enormous good for those people. We can make a contribution to the 
country by helping them lift themselves up.
<P>
	I appeal to my colleagues and I appeal to all other Canadians to 
take a tolerant view toward the bill and those people.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the remarks of my colleague. I should like to ask her a 
question or two.
<P>
	The minister related the incident about the sawmill accident. I 
certainly give my regards to that family. I could imagine what a 
disaster it would be in terms of the family income as well as the 
personal and tragic loss. I appreciate that the fellow who had his 
arm amputated was obviously unable to work in the sawmill 
industry after. The minister said it was a human rights issue. I 
suspect more specifically it might be a disability issue. Of course 
he faced that and was unable to work in the same area and provide 
for his family.
<P>
	I can be called naive or whatever, but I cannot make the leap 
somehow logically that employment equity would solve that 
problem. Could the member enlighten me? I hate to plead 
ignorance here but it seems incredible to me. If all of a sudden 
employment equity or Bill C-64 had been an issue, how would it 
have made life different for him?
<P>
	Would it not be wiser for that company to say that he had skills 
in the sawmill business? Maybe he could have been used in a 
different capacity which perhaps was not so physical that he needed 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15384"> 15384 </A></B>
<P>
to use his arms. If he had  merit, capabilities and competence in the 
industry, surely they would have been able to work him into that. 
How in the world would employment equity all of a sudden solve 
those problems? I cannot see it.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Blondin-Andrew:</B> I appreciate the hon. member's question. 
On a professional and personal level I felt the case had to be 
highlighted and maybe this was the only opportunity I would get as 
a member of Parliament. It also demonstrates that this person, who 
is aboriginal and disabled as I emphasized in my speech and 
members can check <I>Hansard</I> if they want, has struggles which are 
many. Many programs and services are available but not all of 
them can overcome the struggles.
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
	Bill C-64 may not address this issue. However, I felt it was a 
very important issue to be raised on behalf of a person who 
belonged to one of the four under-represented groups or targeted 
areas. That person has an opportunity to have a voice through me. 
That happens with many of us in the House of Commons.
<P>
	I do not have the opportunity to get up to make statements which 
is something I would have done as a member of Parliament in the 
previous session. I felt that because this person was a disabled 
aboriginal person and his case was so specific that it needed a bit of 
profile. I have provided the opportunity at this time.
<P>
	In terms of employment equity, if we look at all of the 
information I have provided, the hon. member will know that 
perhaps this was stretching it a bit. However, I felt that because of 
this individual case, which has had very little success, perhaps it 
would be an opportunity for it to have a bit of attention.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to make the observation that members 
opposite, in particular the last member who spoke, are confusing 
discriminatory hiring practices with the term employment equity.
<P>
	We have laws in Canada that prohibit discriminatory hiring 
practices. We have laws that prohibit employers from not hiring 
qualified people because they happen to be a member of a certain 
visible minority group or because they may be physically or 
mentally disabled. There are laws which prohibit businesses from 
discriminating against people based on who or what they are.
<P>
	This bill ensures that if two people of equal merit, of equal 
training, of equal ability, apply for a job and one happens to be a 
member of a designated group and the other one is not, that favour 
be bestowed on the person who is in the designated group and 
disfavour be bestowed on the person who is not. I fail to see the 
logic of the bill.
<P>
	The government is trying to tell free enterprise how to hire 
people. The fact is that the government is already in the face of 
business too much and it is hurting the economy.
<P>
	The hon. member related a very tragic case. She brought it down 
to a personal level. I would like to bring it down to a personal level 
as well.
<P>
	My oldest son has a learning disability. He probably would fit 
into one of the designated groups. I expect that my son will become 
employable because my wife and I are doing everything we can to 
ensure that he receives training and obtains the ability to become 
employable, not because he is handicapped in his learning, but 
because he has the skills to do a job.
<P>
	I do not want the government to look after my son's future. I 
want him to be independent. That is why I want him to be trained 
and to have the ability to hold a job.
<P>
<B>(1250 )</B>
<P>
	The state should not be determining the future of my son. When 
it does that, it takes away his independence, his ability to function 
as an independent Canadian, to acquire the skills and to merit 
getting a job, not because of his disability but because of his 
strengths.
<P>
	That is why I am fundamentally opposed to this bill. It will 
diminish the qualities, the abilities, the training of individuals and 
will place them in a category that will get them a job because of 
who they are and not what they are or what they can do.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Blondin-Andrew:</B> Mr. Speaker, throughout the course of 
the constitutional talks I learned a very important lesson from 
Canadians. Treating all people the same does not necessarily 
express equality. Needs are different based on the individual needs 
of a person.
<P>
	I salute my colleague for the efforts he has made on behalf of his 
son. However, we are not talking about one individual. We are 
talking about four designated groups. Those groups have a 
disadvantage in the system. It is not that blatant.
<P>
	I know there is an appeal process. If a person feels discriminated 
against he or she can go to the Canadian Human Rights 
Commission. However, if a person is systematically ignored, not 
promoted or marginalized year after year and if the statistics bear 
out no movement for certain designated groups, systemically there 
is a problem. It is very subtle because employers can ignore 
employees they do not favour. They can engage in a very subtle 
approach and make it difficult for employees by ignoring them, by 
not promoting them or hiring them for other jobs. It is very hard to 
prove.
<P>
	As I indicated before, because these four designated groups get 
paid less and are under-represented on promotion lists, they need 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15385"> 15385 </A></B>
<P>
our help. That is something the hon. member should think about. It 
is not to discriminate, not to make more dependent and not to  hire 
people who do not have the talent or merit. It is to enable those 
people who have the merit and the talent to integrate into a system 
that has not allowed them to do so. The doors have been closed and 
we need movement there. We need to open not only our hearts, but 
the doors to employment and training opportunities for those 
designated groups.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to say to my colleague at the outset that I appreciate the fact 
that there were serious differences in the comment she made and 
she was, in fact, stretching it. Employment equity is not going to 
solve those problems. That is in <I>Hansard</I> forever more. I do 
appreciate the case of that family in the north.
<P>
	This is an interesting debate. I find myself amazed as I look at 
the charter of rights and freedoms, section 15(1), which states: 
``Every individual is equal before and under the law and has the 
right to the equal protection and the equal benefit of the law 
without discrimination and, in particular, without discrimination 
based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age or 
mental or physical disability''.
<P>
	That seems fairly clear to me and probably clear to everybody 
else who is listening to this. The Canadian Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms protects us all, regardless of race, gender, language, 
ethnic background, et cetera.
<P>
	I want to know how in the world we can get from that, where the 
charter protects us, to Bill C-64 on employment equity. Frankly, I 
have not heard an answer from the government side. I have heard 
stories, passionate story telling and all kinds of situations where 
people have talked about individuals. I could relate all kinds of 
them myself. However, when I hear my colleagues saying Bill C-64 
is going to be the answer to all this, there is just no way on the earth 
that I an convinced and I suspect that most Canadians who are 
listening to the debate are simply not able to make that leap.
<P>
<B>(1255 )</B>
<P>
	With the protections under the Canadian Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms I question why we are even debating this bill. There 
seems to be no reason. It is not going to resolve any situations. It is 
not going to make people's lives easier. The very institution that 
should be protecting the fundamental rights vis-à-vis the charter of 
rights and freedoms of all Canadians is being used to suppress one 
of those rights. It says: ``We will look after this person but we will 
not look after that one. We will give one special treatment but not 
for the other, I am very sorry''.
<P>
	Bill C-64 will deny the right to equal protection and equal 
benefit of the law without discrimination. Once we start travelling 
down that fork in the road I see nothing but flag warnings and 
signals ahead that we had better be careful. As was talked about in 
the Charlottetown accord,  once people start saying to particular 
groups that they get distinct society status, they get special 
attention because of this or there should be so many women in the 
Senate, that takes us down a dangerous path where we do not think 
we could ever get back to that fork in the road.
<P>
	When I hear the stories being talked about this morning, the 
alarm bells go off. I have to ask myself where it leads us. It is 
exactly as we saw in Charlottetown. What road does that lead us 
down? Are we ever going to be able to get back to that tributary? I 
really do not think it will help us a lot.
<P>
	This bill will officially sanction discrimination against 
non-designated groups. As soon as somebody is designated, then 
someone else becomes non-designated. As soon as an individual or 
a group is committed to something, suddenly other people are left 
out by the sin of omission. Why do we have this obsession in this 
Parliament to make sure some people are labelled? I am sure my 
friend the minister across the way does not think it is good or right 
to label people. Yet here is legislation that he supports where he is 
starting to label people, then by omission others are left off the 
table.
<P>
	There has to be a hint of discrimination displayed against 
designated groups. If there is, that is when there are problems. Just 
let there be a hint against those designated groups and the equity 
control patrol will suddenly swoop in. They are hot on the trail to 
right those wrongs and impose stiff penalties on the offenders. It 
amazes me when I think about it.
<P>
	For instance, why should we have equity police? Heaven forbid, 
we sit in a Chamber where there are 53 women, which I will talk 
about a little later. I have heard colleagues, especially in the last 
Parliament but certainly in this Parliament as well, saying that 51 
per cent of the population are women so 51 per cent of members of 
Parliament should be female. That is ridiculous. Later I will talk 
about the fact that I am a female MP but I will do it on ability and 
competence rather than just on the fact that I am a female.
<P>
	The equity police are to be people going around checking up to 
make sure that everybody is doing what they are supposed to be 
doing. Mr. Speaker, you can see that will lead down a road to 
trouble as well. Imagine if someone were on you all the time 
saying: ``I do not think he is doing the right thing. I think his hiring 
practices in his House of Commons' office are questionable''.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, can you imagine the fear, the nervousness, the 
sense of being watched that you would feel? I am sure you have 
read <I>1984</I> where George Orwell talks about how the thought police 
are going to be on us all the time. Although I do not want to sound 
like an alarmist it seems this legislation provides a possibility for 
that. It may be setting up these equity police. They will be going 
around making sure that everybody is hiring the right people and 
doing all this stuff in their offices.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15386"> 15386 </A></B>
<P>
	The human rights commission is to be the overseeing group that 
looks after this. It will send in the equity police to make sure that 
everything is going according to Bill C-64. It is interesting to note 
that absolutely zero funding is to be given for that.
<P>
	Suddenly this new bureaucracy or group is being set up that says: 
``We are going to have the equity police to make sure that 
everybody is hired properly. Maybe there is just the right number 
of people at the table; maybe the House of Commons staff can be 
broken down just fine''. It is impractical. It is divisive. It is not 
going to work.
<P>
	I get to these equity police. Dear knows how they are going to be 
assembled. I am not sure. I suppose they would have to fit under the 
right group. Who polices the police in this situation? There is zero 
funding for this bunch that will work under the human rights 
commission. How in the world are we ever going to be able to 
police such a thing?
<P>
	We want less government. We want people to walk around in 
freedom, to be able hire who they think will do the best job for 
them and make sure that everybody is going to do the best he or she 
possibly can.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	Knowing there is always someone trying to run a business, a 
government department or whatever, there is nothing that would 
make any of us, whether MPs, senators or whatever say we are 
really nervous and we want to make sure all the right things are 
being done. I am not sure the people who will be equity police will 
have the qualifications to do the cop job the government will be 
asking them to do.
<P>
	The most amazing thing I find about this piece of legislation is 
with regard to the province of Ontario. This is not my home 
province but I visit here from week to week with my job. What an 
incredible turnaround when the socialist government, which was in 
power for several years, was thrown out on its left ear in June 
because of the Conservatives and Mike Harris and all he stood for. 
My friends will remember that just last year even a socialist NDP 
government in Ontario could not get this type of legislation 
through.
<P>
	I know my friends over here are in full favour of Bill C-64. I 
have a question for one of them from Ontario. If the NDP socialist 
government in Ontario cannot pass employment equity legislation, 
how in the world will the Liberals do it? I know my friend from 
Broadview-Greenwood is very concerned about this. Although he 
is from downtown Toronto, a hair bigger than my hometown of 
Heinsburg, I would like him to answer the question seriously. Will 
it solve the problems? Will it make sure people have employment? 
Will it help the employment situation? I know numbers in 
employment are important to him.
<P>
	He says it will and I have a great deal of faith in him, but I am not 
sure we can make this leap of logic that it  will make a whole lot of 
difference. If an NDP socialist government could not even get it 
through, how in the world will it fly across the country? It is not.
<P>
	We have seen what has happened to the NDP and socialism. I can 
remember in the last Parliament I used to sit back there and the 
NDP was down here. What is happening worldwide? There is a 
move away from that government interference in our lives. We now 
see the NDP as a fourth party in the House. We will see that 
continue to move away. It has happened in Ontario and right across 
the country.
<P>
	Hiring habits are wonderful but as soon as someone tells us we 
have to do this or they will come after us if we do not, we know 
even in our human nature that as soon as someone says we have do 
this they are toast. It is as simple as that. It did not work in Ontario 
and it simply will not work here. Employment equity legislation 
flies in the face of the merit principle.
<P>
	Is the Revenue Canada document ``The Employment Equity 
Action Plan for 1995-96'' a start or is it the be all and end all? Will 
1995-96 be the big watershed year for employment equity or will it 
be the start of something that leads us down the path of 
divisiveness and danger?
<P>
	A really good example in this document states how hiring quotas 
would work, quotas being what we are talking about. The 
government is refusing to acknowledge that. It says it is not talking 
about quotas or specific numbers. It is numbers, it is quotas and it 
is tokenism that we are really talking about here.
<P>
	Under women the document states females are 
under-represented in certain occupational groups, namely auditors, 
managers and senior managers. The solution to the problem is the 
following discriminatory statement from the document: ``Consider 
only female recruitment when external hiring is undertaken as an 
ongoing policy''.
<P>
	If the men in the Chamber cannot see through that, surely the 
women can. Can anyone imagine anything so pathetic as somebody 
saying we should consider only female recruitment when external 
hiring is undertaken as an ongoing policy? That is absolutely 
ridiculous.
<P>
	Let us look at our own situation in the House of Commons. I am 
a woman involved in politics. I represent one of the 53 women MPs 
out of 295. We are under-represented in the House of Commons but 
let us keep working on it. There were 40 women in the last 
Parliament. We are 53 in this Parliament. My friend over here is a 
new MP which is great because we have more numbers. Would she 
not sooner work with a smaller group of really committed, class 
act, competent women rather than having 51 per cent of the MPs 
here elected just because they were women?
<P>
	Let us look at people who will have some abilities in this place. I 
said this before in the Chamber and I am not ashamed to say it 
again. If I go anywhere in my  constituency and say: ``Hello, Mr. 
Mills, my name is Deborah Grey, I am your member of Parliament, 
I am your Reform candidate, please vote for me, I am a woman'', I 
would expect him to take me into his house, sit me down, give me a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15387"> 15387 </A></B>
<P>
cup of coffee and say: ``Come on now''. It is incredible. That is 
what this legislation would lead to.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, you know as well as I do because you sit with the 
governing party and you were here in the last Parliament, when 
people were getting ready for nominations-remember the wrangle 
before the 1993 election-some women in this party, in the NDP 
and, bless it, the memory of the Conservative Party anyway, did not 
even have to go through a nomination process. Certain women said 
certain ridings were for them. They did not have to go through a 
nomination process because they were anointed or appointed to 
that. My friends know this. There is absolutely no way they can 
deny it.
<P>
	A few women in the House got the nomination by acclamation. 
Is that right? Is that employment equity? Absolutely not.
<P>
	I would like to think that I and the two women sitting in the 
Chamber right now won the election because we are competent. Is 
that agreed? Absolutely. They had some skills and they had some 
ability and they would be effective members of Parliament. It is not 
just because the leaders of the parties said they think we should 
have so many women. The NDP gives extra funding for people.
<P>
	There were nomination meetings held at which some men were 
told they would not get the chance to run because certain seats, 
NDP, Liberal or whatever, were designated for women. Let us look 
at the numbers and see how effective that was. Many people were 
nominated. I do not know the number of women nominated in 
ridings who did not actually win their seat, but I do know my 
numbers of women elected.
<P>
	For the Liberals, 36 out of 178. That represents 20 per cent of 
their caucus. We appreciate that and we celebrate it, up from 13 per 
cent. I suppose that is a great start. It is interesting that it was up 
from 13 per cent but they did not have employment equity to do it. 
Of the Bloc Quebecois, eight out of the 53 are women, 15 per cent. 
For the Reform Party, we are seven women out of 52, 14 per cent. 
The NDP elected one, 11 per cent of its nine members. As for the 
Conservatives, their numbers are quite interesting. Fifty per cent of 
their caucus is female and I certainly respect them for that.
<P>
	A record was set in 1989 when 100 per cent of the Reform 
caucus was female, myself of course. Do members see what we can 
do with numbers? It is absolutely ridiculous.
<P>
	The sad part was there were so many more women who were 
candidates in that election. They did not win  their seats for the 
Liberal or the governing caucus. Why? So many of them were told 
they would be run in such and such a constituency. They knew they 
did not have a hope.
<P>
	Somebody said they were spear carriers for that, not even 
dreaming they would ever get the seat. It is true. I know of a couple 
of situations in B.C. in which some NDP fellows wanted to run for 
the nomination and could not. I think they had a pretty good idea 
they would not win the seat. Reform took most of the seats across 
B.C. except in the lower mainland.
<P>
	Nothing would be more pathetic than if my party leader or 
someone else came to me and said they were going to put me in 
here. They would like me to run in such and such a riding. They do 
not think I have a chance of winning but they want a woman in that 
seat. I would say no, forget it. I do not want any part of that. If I 
cannot run fair and square regardless of my being a woman, I will 
not participate in something like that and I hope these people would 
say the same thing.
<P>
	One of my heroes of this place is Agnes Macphail. She was cool. 
I am sure all the women and men in the House would agree she was 
a wonderful woman. She was the first woman ever elected to this 
place.
<P>
	I was nervous in 1989 as the only Reformer and some of the new 
members of Parliament may have been nervous because this place 
is inspiring. We were all awe struck when we came.
<P>
	Agnes Macphail was elected in 1921 for the Progressive Party. 
She sat with the Progressives from 1921 to 1935 for the 
constituency of Grey South East. She then moved to the CCF and 
was the member for Grey-Bruce as it was called then from 1935 
to 1940.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	If Agnes Macphail were here today, I would love to hear what 
she would have to say about employment equity and that the 
government is trying to push through Bill C-64.
<P>
	They did not have the blessing of microphones in the Chamber 
then so one had to speak loudly to be heard. The best line I can 
remember from Agnes Macphail, truly my hero, was when one 
male member of Parliament said: ``Agnes, have you ever been 
mistaken for a man in the Chamber?'' She said: ``No, have you?''
<P>
	That is a class act. I do not think employment equity would have 
helped her a whole lot. I think she would be absolutely scandalized 
by Bill C-64. Someone asked her if she had ever been mistaken for 
a man. What a ridiculous thing to ask. We have come a long way 
since then.
<P>
	This morning I was at the Governor General's residence for the 
presentation of the awards to six women who did a wonderful job in 
the Persons case with the famous five from Alberta. It was a 
wonderful ceremony. I am not sure why my friend is laughing 
across the way. It  is a pity she was not there because these are great 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15388"> 15388 </A></B>
<P>
women who were awarded the Governor General's medal today. It 
was excellent. They have all done work on the Persons case and 
they were all being rewarded for the work they are doing.
<P>
	It was interesting when they gave us the history that Nellie 
McClung, Emily Murphy and all those wonderful women from 
Alberta in the 1920s were not even recognized as persons. They 
took it to the Supreme Court and it was turned down. They did not 
even get to be called persons. Then in 1929 they took it to the privy 
council. They went to Lord Chancellor Sankey in England, trying 
to get overturned the ruling that said: ``Women are persons in 
matters of pains and penalties but are not persons in matters of 
rights and privileges''.
<P>
	Emily Murphy found that a bit hard and somebody challenged 
her because she was a magistrate; imagine, a magistrate in Alberta. 
They challenged her that she was not a person. Five people were 
allowed to appeal that and away these women went. On October 18, 
1929 they were granted by Lord Chancellor Sankey to be persons.
<P>
	I find it pathetic that somebody has just snorted here and thought 
this was a real laugh. I want to honour these people for what they 
did back in 1929. Because of that, she was and I am able to sit in the 
House of Commons. We are treated as persons. Then of course 
women got the vote after that.
<P>
	This is the kind of stuff that is important. I would like to know 
what those women would think about it. Emily Murphy challenged 
married women's property rights. If a woman had property with her 
husband back then and her husband died, she would be tough out of 
luck. She would lose the title to that land.
<P>
	Things have come a long way since that day. I really appreciate 
that. We need to celebrate that. I do think this legislation will take 
us down a very dangerous, divisive road down and we will be sorry 
we cannot turn around.
<P>
	Again I tell my colleagues across the House that as hilarious, 
scornful, mocking or whatever they think this is, they need to be 
aware that it will not solve the problems. The NDP could not pass it 
in Ontario. It will get rammed through the House of Commons but 
there will be waves and repercussions making it very frightening 
for people across the country.
<P>
	Employment equity will breed resentment because it will be 
assumed that designated groups attained employment not by the 
merit principle but by legislated coercion. It will label designated 
groups as being inferior and unable to compete on a level playing 
field. It is patronizing, hierarchical and elitist. It assumes 
designated groups need a higher order to run interference for them. 
It is wrong. It is bad. I am really sorry the government will ram 
through Bill C-64.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my colleague mentioned Agnes Macphail. I am  presently 
reading the memoirs of Eugene Forsey. For members who do not 
recall Eugene Forsey, he was a force of the New Democratic Party. 
He had a strong ethic for fairness in Canadian society when this 
was an important thing for people to be doing, as it is today.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	In the memoirs of Eugene Forsey he recounts a tale of Agnes 
Macphail. Members will know that Canadians watching this debate 
on television do not realize that just outside the Chamber of the 
House of Commons is a bust of Agnes Macphail. Every time we 
walk into the opposition lobby we can see the bust of Agnes 
Macphail.
<P>
	When Agnes Macphail was at the founding convention of the 
CCF in Regina in the 1920s there was a motion put forward at the 
convention in the true socialist manner stating that 50 per cent of 
all people sitting on committees within the CCF would be women. 
Women would have employment equity within the party. There 
would be a balance. No matter what committee it was, 50 per cent 
of the members would be women.
<P>
	It was reported by Eugene Forsey that the shortest speech ever 
made by Agnes Macphail was when she spoke to the convention. 
She said that she had achieved what she had achieved in her own 
right, not because she was a woman. It did not work for her and it 
did not work against her. She wanted to be judged as a person who 
was capable of achieving her own ends in her own right. She felt 
that was the appropriate way for all people to be treated.
<P>
	I thought I would share that little anecdote with members.
<P>
	I do not suggest that the Liberals have evil motives in bringing 
this forward. I think their hearts are in the right place, but I do not 
think their minds are necessarily connected.
<P>
	I would ask my colleague from Beaver River if she would 
comment on the notion that perhaps we should be putting our 
energies into the prevention of discrimination and we should be 
using the facilities of the country to educate rather than to legislate. 
What we really have to do is talk about how we can have values in 
our country, values all Canadians can share, which have to do with 
the prevention of discrimination and the fact that we are all of us 
equal Canadians, no matter when we arrived here, no matter the 
colour of our skin, no matter our gender. We should be addressing 
the values, we should not be writing laws.
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciated the story about Agnes 
Macphail. She realized that we are not going to get anywhere by 
somebody saying we are going to give Agnes special treatment or 
we are going to give babysitting money to someone when they are 
running as a candidate.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15389"> 15389 </A></B>
<P>
	When I ran as a candidate I ran thinking that somebody 
somewhere might elect me on the basis that they thought maybe 
I could string two or three sentences together, that I love my 
country, and that I am committed to being a member of 
Parliament. I am glad to say that it happened not only once, in 
1989, but again with a larger majority in 1993. I appreciate that, 
but never once would I be able to go around and say I am a 
woman, so elect me or re-elect me; or that I am getting special 
funding from my party; or if somebody wanted to challenge me 
for the nomination in the constituency of Beaver River that my 
party leader would say: ``No, you are not able to challenge 
Deborah because she is the sitting MP and I want her there''. That 
is ridiculous.
<P>
	We need to encourage wide open nomination meetings for 
people who want the job. It makes for a good race and it is 
democratic. What could be worse for true democracy than a party 
leader saying no, sorry, you cannot run because I have so-and-so 
and she is going to run in this riding?
<P>
	We have to put our energies into educating people. That is far 
and wide the most beneficial thing we can do. We are not going to 
legislate all the problems out of Canada. That is simply bizarre. We 
have seen any number of times that it simply does not work. It does 
not work when a government says we know best and we are going 
to do all of these wonderful things, especially when the whole idea 
of employment equity has just blown up in its face. The Ontario 
members know that. They just saw in their own province that it did 
not work.
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	How do we think we can legislate these things? We have to spend 
our time educating. That would involve such things as starting here 
in the House of Commons, where we would not see political 
hanky-panky going on and party leaders engineering and telling us 
who we will have as candidates and as MPs. Surely the House of 
Commons would be a good place for education to start.
<P>
	Some Wednesday, because almost everyone is here for question 
period, I would love to see a show of hands from people who did 
not have anyone challenge them for their nomination. Would that 
not be a great educational tool to see how many people were 
anointed or appointed as candidates? I bet members would be too 
ashamed to put up their hands. I know I would.
<P>
	If my party leader said: ``Deb, we are going to put you in here 
and no one else can run against you'', I would be ashamed. If a 
news reporter ever asked me how many people challenged me for 
the nomination, I would have to say there were going to be two or 
three, but I was anointed as the candidate so they were not allowed 
to run. Can you imagine how pathetic that would be? Imagine the 
signal that would send to the rest of the country. My friend knows 
about it. What kind of signal would that send to the country? It is 
pretty pathetic.  Those are the kinds of educational things we need 
to get going.
<P>
	I would like to correct something I said earlier about the fact that 
there would be employment equity or equity police for those of us 
who are hiring our staff. I was wrong on that and I admit it. But this 
bill does not even extend to the House of Commons. I ask some of 
the experts over there if I am correct on that. Does it extend to the 
House of Commons staff?
<P>
	Could anyone, even in the gallery, explain to me how in the 
world the House of Commons becomes exempt from this? Well, it 
is good enough for everyone else in the public service, but this 
group is exempt. By the very fact that the people who are working 
here are exempt from it, we have the sin of omission again. As soon 
as there is a sin of commission because we commit names and 
groups to people, then there is the sin of omission and it does not 
even extend to the House of Commons. I think people watching us 
on television today should be well aware of that. It is absolutely 
incredible that the House of Commons is exempt. All of a sudden 
we are special again.
<P>
	If anything takes us down the road of something that is 
dangerous and divisive, it is that it is good for everybody else 
across the country but we are exempt from it here. It sort of makes 
me smell the MP pension issue all over again, as a matter of fact. 
We are cutting out all the pensions for all these people and we are 
sorry that we have to lay off 45,000 public servants, but we MPs 
will keep our pension plan. Instead of $6 to $1 for employer to 
employee contributions, we are just cutting back, folks. We are just 
slicing the fat off this. Now our employers are only going to give $4 
to $1. So MPs are exempt.
<P>
	There is another group of people who all of a sudden become 
special. I am sure my friends are well read and I am sure they 
remember the novel <I>Animal Farm</I> by George Orwell. I am sure they 
will remember the phrase in there that all animals are created equal 
but some are more equal than others. If anything smacks of that, it 
is Bill C-64. If anything smacks of that, it is the MP pension plan, 
which no other person in the country is able to get.
<P>
	My friend the President of the Treasury Board knows it full well. 
I have spoken at public meetings and I know he has as well. If he 
had asked for a show of hands from any of those groups he spoke 
with asking if anyone qualified for this kind of a pension plan, there 
would not have been a hand up in the place. But it is okay to tell 
everyone else across the country they have to tighten their belts.
<P>
	My friend over here just hollered out that I was going to get 
$100,000 instead of $1.4 million that I am eligible to collect. I do 
not know where he got that number. Let me put it on the record that 
I am getting back only the contributions I have made. The President 
of the Treasury Board told me: ``You take all of your pension or 
you  take zero''. Those were my options. He would not even grant 
me a one to one contribution like anyone else would get. We were 
exempt from the federal civil service pension plan, that act where 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15390"> 15390 </A></B>
<P>
the employer would have to put in at least 50 per cent of the money. 
I am not getting that. I am getting back $32,000 of my 
contributions at 4 per cent. No mutual fund would ever give that 
little money since 1989. I get $32,000 back that I can roll over into 
my RRSP, and some $16,000, much like he gets, except he is not 
rolling it anywhere, except into the trough for a very large pension 
because we are about the same age. I get $16,000 back, which I will 
have to pay tax on at 46 per cent, which is my tax bracket.
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
	There it is. If it were a hundred grand I would love it, and I would 
do what I could with it, but because I have opted out of that pension 
plan, I will be exempt. I know I will certainly sleep with a clear 
conscience, knowing that at least I am not ripping the taxpayer off 
for that much money.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board 
and Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to rise as a co-sponsor of this piece of legislation, in 
so far as it relates to the federal employees, the Public Service of 
Canada.
<P>
	Let me first of all express my gratitude to my colleague, the 
Minister of Human Resources Development, for bringing forward 
this legislation, bringing the private and public sector together 
under one piece of legislation, and for members on the Standing 
Committee on Human Rights and the Status of Disabled Persons 
for their significant contribution to the debate.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The committee's main report reflects the collective wisdom of 
those who testified.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
Together they described employment equity as a sensible and 
balanced measure that strengthens our social fabric.
<P>
	Canadians have an excellent understanding of what equality is 
all about. They appreciate that for there to be a harmonious and 
well-balanced society, all of its members must have an opportunity 
to contribute to it as well as share in its benefits. That is what 
employment equity and this legislation are all about.
<P>
	Employment equity has been criticized, we have heard it in just 
the last few minutes, on the grounds that it introduces 
discrimination into the workplace. In fact, the opposite is true. 
Employment equity helps individuals compete for employment on 
an equal basis. Nobody receives special advantages, nobody 
receives special privileges under this legislation. To claim that 
anyone does represents a serious misunderstanding of the 
principles involved in Bill C-64.
<P>
	Employment equity simply seeks a diversity in the workplace 
similar to what can be found in society. Therefore, we must remove 
barriers to employment opportunities to better reflect the 
population as it is today. These barriers are frequently buried in 
systems and longstanding practices.
<P>
	For example, if for no particular good reason except tradition all 
police officers must be six feet tall, then most women could not 
compete. This sort of systemic barrier was once commonplace in 
this country, yet there would be few today who would argue that it 
makes much sense now, if in fact it ever did.
<P>
	Let me give another example, rather less obvious perhaps. If a 
recruitment or promotion board were composed of three people, all 
males, all graduates of the same university, and all about the same 
age, one could be forgiven for wondering if this board would be 
much open to the perspectives of persons with different values, 
different experiences, different traditions. Selection boards require 
greater diversity to ensure that no candidate's talents are 
overlooked.
<P>
	We must take measures to encourage equitable access to 
opportunities for employment and opportunities for advancement 
in the public service. This may mean, for instance, establishing 
training positions, so that those who are disadvantaged can develop 
skills and acquire experience to compete on an equal footing. When 
we make full use of all available human capital, then our society 
will truly benefit.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The face of Canadian workers has changed.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
It has changed dramatically. Women, aboriginal peoples, persons 
with disabilities, and people in a visible minority now represent the 
largest share of new entrants to the labour market. In just 10 years 
the representation of women in the labour force has risen from 40 
per cent to 45 per cent. This 5 per cent shift represents some 
750,000 women. Employment equity helps the labour market adapt 
to changes of this magnitude.
<P>
<B>(1330)</B>
<P>
	It might be helpful to speak in more concrete terms about 
creating an environment that takes advantage of diversity. The 
Public Service of Canada is a good example. Diversity within the 
workforce means more than just having people of different 
backgrounds working together. It is not enough to hire an employee 
with a disability without helping to build the employee's 
relationships with his or her colleagues. It is not acceptable to 
ignore the support and training that women need to advance within 
an organization. Diversity within an organization calls for the 
acknowledgement and accommodation of differences.
<P>

<P>
	The Treasury Board has issued a publication called ``Alternative 
Formats Access for All''. It provides guidance on how to produce 
material in alternate formats for persons with disabilities. An 
alternate format might be large type on a page or a cassette 
recording of printed material. The alternate format not only helps 
public servants but at the same time better serves the public.
<P>
	The Treasury Board has also published a series of best practices 
as well as guides to assist public service managers to implement 
employment equity. Two most recent best practices that have been 
published deal with women and persons with disabilities. Both 
draw on practices that have proven effective in a range of 
organizations across the country.
<P>
	Also we have just printed guides concerning the management of 
employees with psychiatric and developmental difficulties. We 
have also produced guides with respect to retention of aboriginal 
employees.
<P>
	To ensure that employment equity is implemented effectively, 
departments and agencies must prepare an employment equity plan 
with goals and timetables. These are not quotas but goals they will 
strive to achieve. However the merit principle still prevails.
<P>
	The plans are public documents as are the reports on what has 
been achieved under them. The plans will not be effective unless 
they build on the advice that the diversity of employees can 
provide. Some of this advice is provided by consultation groups 
reporting to the Treasury Board but much of it comes from 
advisory committees set up within departments.
<P>
	The views of the public service unions are also important. I want 
to acknowledge the spirit of co-operation that inspires public 
service unions on employment equity matters. We are mindful of 
the need for continued collaboration with them. We are confident 
the provisions of the legislation will bear fruit.
<P>
	We have established the framework to help the advancement of 
employment equity in the public service of the nineties. The 
framework places employment equity firmly within the practice of 
good human resources management and business planning. The 
legislation in front of us will continue to provide a solid legal 
foundation. It is not a radical break from the past; it is indeed a 
bridge to the future.
<P>
	It is important to remember that although we tend to speak of 
diversity in terms of groups the focus is actually on the individual. 
It is not the group that is recruited as a filing clerk or that is 
considered for promotion to executive ranks. It is one particular 
person. Can anyone object to the need to reach out to all members 
of society based on their individual qualifications and merits? 
Some people would argue that employment equity encourages 
candidate selection to be made on the basis of sex or ethnic origin 
or a disability rather than merit. I beg to differ.
<P>
	As a matter of fact the essential point is that appointments to the 
public service are governed by the Public Service Employment Act 
which enshrines the merit principle. It is far different from the kind 
of legislation that was talked about earlier by the member for 
Beaver River with respect to the province of Ontario. Our act 
enshrines the merit principle. The administration of the act rests 
with the Public Service Commission, an independent agency that 
reports directly to Parliament.
<P>
	Progress in the area of employment equity has been made in full 
respect of merit. It is the principle on which a non-partisan, highly 
professional public service has been built. This cornerstone of 
human resource management will not be eroded.
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
	Employment equity is not about preferences. It is a method of 
creating a fairness that might not otherwise exist. Several years ago 
the Conference Board of Canada issued an interesting paper on 
employment equity. The introduction revealed that women, visible 
minorities and persons with disabilities make up close to 60 per 
cent of the new entrants into Canada's labour force. It then went on 
to say that the full participation of these entrants to Canada's labour 
force constitutes a vital resource and that their full participation in 
the workplace will be fundamental to the ability of organizations to 
understand and respond to the needs of the rapidly changing 
marketplace. That is what the conference board said.
<P>
	To achieve this goal organizations need solid policies and fair 
practices. For example, the same board found that if we want to 
attract minorities it is a good idea to advertise job openings outside 
the mainstream media and put them into the ethnic media. The 
conference board finding related to culture was of significance 
because organizations which implement interviewer training 
considered it a particularly effective measure in raising 
employment levels for designated groups.
<P>
	I have made it clear that employment equity is not about 
introducing discrimination. It is not about reverse discrimination in 
the workplace. Rather, employment equity is about providing 
opportunities by removing barriers and establishing policies and 
programs to address the needs of designated member groups.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Employment equity is about including everyone, not excluding 
certain individuals.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	No one should be excluded from access to employment 
opportunities for reasons unrelated to competence, for reasons 
unrelated to ability. That is what Bill C-64 is all about and that is 
why I stand to support it today.

<B><A NAME="15392"> 15392 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened with great interest to the comments of my 
colleague opposite regarding the legislation, in  particular his 
comment in our other official language which I thought was very 
well done. While I appreciated the language I sure have a problem 
with the content.
<P>
	It is interesting the minister opposite just finished talking about 
how the employment equity legislation has fairness as its 
cornerstone, has no quotas and has to do with providing 
opportunity, not providing opportunity to people specifically 
because of their race, their gender or the colour of their skin.
<P>
	Let me read into the record from the employment equity guide of 
the Department of Justice some of the non-quota targets. The 
heading of the chart is ``New Employment Equity Targets''. They 
are not quotas. They are targets. The legislation will make these 
targets into quotas because it has penalties for companies that do 
not meet the target requirements. Somehow that seems like it could 
be a quota. As a matter of fact the legislation repealing the Ontario 
employment equity act of 1993 which the Government of Ontario 
is using is the job quotas repeal act. It is strange, is it not?
<P>
	In any event I will quote from the employment equity targets in a 
Department of Justice document: ``Women by occupational 
category, promotions 93 per cent; aboriginal people, promotions 
1.7 per cent; persons with disabilities, 2.8 per cent; and visible 
minorities, 2.7 per cent''.
<P>
<B>(1340 )</B>
<P>
	I will continue: ``Recruitment for aboriginal peoples, 2.2 per 
cent; persons with disabilities, 2 per cent; visible minorities, 4.4 
per cent. Recruitment for women, 43.8 per cent; administrative, 
39.9 per cent; technical, 49.3 per cent''.
<P>
	I ask the minister opposite whether these numbers that are 
targets have the force of law behind them and a penalty for 
non-compliance through the equity police of up to $50,000 if 
companies are not in compliance. What are they? Are they quotas 
or targets? If this is not a quota, what is?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Before giving the floor to 
the hon. minister I advise the House we have now passed five hours 
of debate at third reading of the bill. From here forward members 
will have 10 minutes without questions or comments when we 
resume debate on the bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Eggleton:</B> Mr. Speaker, numerical targets have long been 
established as part of employment equity programs. They are not 
quotas. It is not the same as the American system where they are 
obligated to try to reach certain numbers. They become goals; they 
become objectives. However for various reasons they may not be 
able to be met. If an honest try or an honest effort is made and they 
cannot be met, there are no fines involved in that.
<P>
	It is expected that an organization will take a look at its 
composition to see how it relates to the workforce in general and 
will take some measures to try to have a balanced workforce. That 
is what we are trying to do here. We do not have that at the moment.
<P>
	In terms of aboriginal peoples, people with disabilities and 
visible minorities, they are under-represented in the federal 
workforce. They are under-represented in the federally regulated 
companies that are also part of the legislation. We have greater 
numbers in the workforce. They are having a hard time getting into 
the system.
<P>
	The bill is all about giving them the opportunity to get to the 
door. On their own merit they still have to make it into the job. 
None of that has changed in terms of the principle that guides the 
employment service act of the federal public service.
<P>
	Targets become a goal and objective. I am sorry the member 
does not understand that. It has long been established. I can 
remember when I was mayor of Toronto that we established those 
kinds of goals. Sometimes we made them and sometimes we did 
not but there were reasons why we did not. People put out the best 
effort they possibly could.
<P>
	Over time we make progress. It will not happen overnight, 
particularly now that we are into downsizing. It takes more time to 
reach the goals. It helps us to focus without getting into quotas, 
without in any way abandoning the merit principle. It does not 
relate to the province of Ontario legislation which it has now 
decided for whatever reasons to repeal. This is not the same kind of 
legislation at all. This clearly upholds the principle of merit.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it was 
rather ironic that the President of the Treasury Board would stand 
to tell us that this is always about merit. When we think back to his 
nomination we think of the fight he had. He was picked by the 
Prime Minister to fight the election in his riding rather than having 
to go through the competition of a real nomination process so that 
he could demonstrate to his constituents that he deserved their 
merit by winning the nomination.
<P>
	I would like to ask a question of the President of the Treasury 
Board. If he is to try to achieve these quotas or targets that he 
speaks about-he can choose his word-basically he can influence 
only two opportunities in the make-up of the federal civil service: 
first, when people are hired and second, when people are fired. He 
has no control over those who go of their own volition.
<P>
	Does the President of the Treasury Board intend to advance the 
civil service toward achieving the targets he talks about through the 
early departure incentive program, through the early retirement 
incentive program, where he will end up with a different ratio or 
mix in the civil service as we advance toward the numbers and 
targets he has set out?
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15393"> 15393 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1345)</B>
<P>
	When he and Treasury Board go through this exercise of 
downsizing, are those who dominate the civil service at this time 
likely to find a pink slip on their desks because he wants to move 
toward achieving the targets that he has set out?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Eggleton:</B> Mr. Speaker, the nomination process in York 
Centre has nothing to do with employment equity goals. However, I 
have fought and won a lot more elections than the hon. member has 
ever even thought about, some 11 of them. In this past election the 
people of York Centre gave me a plurality of somewhere over 
20,000. I won every single poll. The voters of York Centre spoke 
quite well, as they have in most parts of the country, by electing a 
very solid Liberal majority government to represent every aspect of 
the country, not just some portion of it.
<P>
	With respect to the downsizing, we are not being detracted in 
terms of the employment equity goals by that. It is obvious that a 
lot of people in those four target groups are going to be part of the 
downsizing. Given that we operate on the merit principle would 
indicate the reverse order of merit as being paramount in that case.
<P>
	The situation is being monitored very carefully to try to maintain 
the numbers as best we can. After all, we do not have enough 
aboriginal people, the disabled, or people who are in the visible 
minority groups, as well as women in executive groups. Therefore, 
I do not want to make the situation any worse if we can help it by 
staying within the principles of merit which the Reform Party 
keeps telling us we should. We are monitoring the situation 
carefully.
<P>
	I am pleased to say that as a result of the report issued last week 
by Treasury Board, of the over 8,000 positions that had been 
removed, there has been no change of that balance. In fact in some 
of the groups a little bit less has been reduced. The one exception to 
that would be people with disabilities. This would be largely 
because a number of them are going out under the early retirement 
incentive, people who are closer to retirement age perhaps, more 
than disabilities, but those are people who are taking a very 
conscious, positive decision about leaving.
<P>
	I am very pleased to say that of the over 8,000 people who are 
gone and in particular those who were in the indeterminate or 
permanent positions, none of them went involuntarily. They all 
went voluntarily. That shows we are trying to treat people who are 
departing the public service in a fair and humane way, as well as 
those who continue to stay to operate the programs and services.
<P>
	After all, we have to bring about that reduction. We do not 
particularly like it. The hon. member is critical of it but, at the same 
time, he and his party are critical of the deficit. This is all part of 
getting our fiscal house in order  and reducing the deficit. We are 
treating people in a very fair and reasonable way. We are keeping a 
very close eye on our employment equity goals at the same time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise today to speak about Bill C-64 dealing with 
employment equity.
<P>
	Equity is one of the most important things that Canadians 
should, and I believe do, stand for. However, there is a major 
difference between the equity being proposed by the government 
and the equity Canadians would like to see.
<P>
	I think back to the pioneer days and the days the west was 
developed because I am from St. Albert just outside Edmonton. 
Equity back in those days was opportunity. If we are going to talk 
about equity we should always talk about opportunity rather than 
results. Tens of thousands of people came to this country, and still 
do, for the opportunity to succeed, the opportunity to prosper and 
the opportunity to make the mark that would have been denied 
them in other countries. That is the type of equity I believe 
Canadians want.
<P>
	Through the hard work of pioneers, they built a country of which 
we are proud. They built a country that recognizes the equality of 
all our citizens. That is one of the great platforms of the Reform 
Party. It says we are not into hyphenated Canadians. There is only 
one kind of Canadian and that is the ordinary Canadian who works 
hard and makes the country work.
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
	A letter on employment equity appeared in the Edmonton 
<I>Journal</I> a few weeks ago. In some ways one might think it 
superficially drew the situation out to the extreme. It talked about 
the hypothetical situation of an Olympics with men and women 
being equal. Of course 51 per cent of race winners would have to be 
women and 49 per cent men. How would that be achieved? By 
putting weights on the legs of the men and so on. While the point is 
ridiculous there is a moral to this story. To have equality of results, 
somebody has to be penalized. That is the point I want to drive 
home. To have equality of results the obvious winners have to be 
penalized in order to allow others to win their share.
<P>
	Our position is that rather than penalize the winners, we should 
do our best to give everybody the opportunity to win through 
education. It is education that determines whether or not someone 
is going to succeed. It is not because they are black or white, or 
male or female, or handicapped or crippled, or whatever. The point 
is if they are educated they have a chance to succeed.
<P>
	Last week, a study was released which indicated that of the top 
10 per cent of income earners in this country the vast majority 
attributed education to their success, not who they were, not what 
they were, not their family background, not whether they came 
from a rich background. Education was the dominant factor which  
determined whether they were able to succeed or not. That is why 
the House should focus on making sure people have the opportuni-
<P>

<B><A NAME="15394"> 15394 </A></B>
<P>
ty to succeed through education, not by introducing quotas that will 
penalize those who have the desire to succeed, those who have the 
willingness to work hard to succeed, those who go far beyond the 
others and want to succeed. Why hold them back? Unfortunately 
that is the nature of the government's way of doing things.
<P>
	We want to ensure we can get back to the days where hard work 
is equal to prosperity rather than having it guaranteed by 
government legislation.
<P>
	If failure is to be eliminated, as this legislation tries to do in 
many ways, it comes at a cost. The cost of eliminating failure is 
equal to the price of success. If we do not let some people succeed 
because we want no one to fail, then we will bring everyone down 
to the lowest common denominator. We saw what happened in 
eastern Europe in Russia. They refused to allow anyone to succeed 
and the whole country failed.
<P>
	While this legislation is but one small piece along that road, 
Reform Party members feel that Canadians will be far better 
pleased and a lot more confident that this country can dig itself out 
of the hole if those who have the will to succeed are allowed to 
move ahead and help the rest of us and to provide education to 
those who need to get their feet on the ladder.
<P>
	I have a constituent who has been in to see me several times. He 
would like to be a Mountie. In the west the Mounties are a revered 
police institution. Everybody knows the Mounties. They are known 
throughout the world as that great Canadian police force. They are 
recognized and revered around the world.
<P>
	This constituent wants to be a Mountie. Every year he does 600 
hours of volunteer police work with the RCMP. He sat the exams 
and met the minimum standards. He has a university education. 
The only thing that stops him from being a Mountie is the fact that 
he is a white male. Other family members are in the force. He 
would dearly love to be in the force but because he is a white male 
he cannot be what he dreams to be. That is because this government 
brings in what it calls targets, which I call quotas, and denies 
someone who would be a first class policeman. We have denied 
him his dream.
<P>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
	That is why we have to recognize that this legislation is out to 
lunch and the fact that we need to build people up, not hold them 
down.
<P>
	This past week while we have been away I attended three 
graduation ceremonies in my riding. At a couple of them I 
presented the Governor General's award. I had an opportunity to 
talk to people about education. I cannot encourage them enough 
because in this complex and technological age we live in we need 
all the education we can get.
<P>
	If we tell people that it does not matter how much education you 
have, how much motivation you have, how much will you have to 
succeed because you just happen to be in the wrong category, then 
we are sending the wrong message to young people and we have 
received the wrong message from the people who built this country. 
In many ways that is part of the reason we are so far in debt. We 
have lost our way and that is a great shame.
<P>
	In an earlier debate the member from Beaver River talked about 
the fact that this legislation is going to be forced on businesses, 
forced on the civil service, but the House of Commons is exempt. 
Why would the House of Commons be exempt? Why would we in 
typical fashion tell the people to not do as we do but just do as we 
say?
<P>
	This is why the Reform Party is totally opposed to this 
legislation. I would gladly support anything the government would 
do to ensure that education became the reason for equity.

	<B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke-Lakeshore, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month, a time for all 
of us to remember that in 1995 an estimated 17,700 Canadian 
women will be diagnosed with breast cancer and 5,400 will die 
from this terrible disease.
<P>
	The leading cause of cancer deaths among women, breast cancer 
can be eradicated through education, awareness, good health, and 
with the support of our community. The collaboration of survivors, 
health professionals, and governments must also continue in order 
to address breast cancer issues and to ultimately find a cure.
<P>
	Chances are we have all known someone who has had breast 
cancer. I therefore invite you to visit the Canadian breast cancer 
memorial tribute this week in the foyer of the House of Commons. 
With this memorial we will remember the many Canadian women 
who have battled courageously but have lost to this disease. In their 
memory we must continue to provide support to those who are 
fighting for their lives.

	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to draw the attention of the House to an award that was presented 
on the weekend to the woman entrepreneur of the year. This award 
is an initiative of the University of Toronto Faculty of Management 
and it counts organizations such as the <I>Financial Post</I> among its 
sponsors.
<P>
	For the category of international competitiveness, my 
constituent, friend, and client, Paula Lishman, was the recipient. I 
have known Paula for many years. Her intuitive designs in 
reversible furs are respected throughout the world.
<P>
	Paula exemplifies the fight of small and medium sized 
businesses, and women in particular in the country to get 
established and win the confidence of the financial community. 
Trading internationally and creating meaningful jobs in Durham 
and in Canada have been the results of her efforts. I know about her 
struggles because I was her accountant and sat with her on the other 
side of many bank managers' desks.
<P>
	Paula's perseverance in the face of adversity is a lesson for all 
small and medium sized business operators. I am proud and happy 
that Paula Lishman has earned the recognition she so justly 
deserves.

	<B>Mr. Jean Landry (Lotbinière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Government of Canada is inundating us with subliminal 
advertising in the midst of the referendum campaign, which is not a 
problem for Radio-Canada. The no side's messages state that the 
sovereignist leaders are claiming to the be only real Quebecers, 
when in fact they have never said such a thing. And yet, 
Radio-Canada is airing this message.
<P>
	However, the message of the yes side showing how the federal 
government has systematically refused to listen to Quebec's 
demands is not acceptable. Radio-Canada suddenly remembers its 
advertising standards and refuses to air this message. This decision 
is incomprehensible and surprises even the Telecaster Committee, 
which approves its broadcast.
<P>
	The truth is that the yes side's message was so effective 
government officials demanded it be rejected. This is the behaviour 
of a side in a panic and with nothing to offer Quebec.

	The leader of the Bloc Quebecois has just traded his pilgrim's

on the economic  impact of Quebec's separation and its effect on

	The author of the study starts out by announcing that an 
independent Quebec would have none of the rights and obligations 
resulting from Canada's membership in several trade agreements 
with the U.S. including NAFTA, the World Trade Organization and 
the Auto Pact. A Quebec separated from Canada would have to 
negotiate access to all these treaties.

<P>
	This study confirms what our Minister of Finance recently said. 
An independent Quebec will have to renegotiate all international

<P>
	Stan Waters made Canadian history twice on this day, October

first Reform Party member to sit in the Senate. His passing in 
September 1991 left that seat vacant and the Prime Minister filled 
it with a typical patronage appointment.
<P>
	Canadians are tired of this old Liberal lament that we hear time 
and time again that because the Charlottetown accord failed 
Canada can never have an elected Senate. I say bunk. It has already 
happened in Alberta. It can happen in every province in Canada.
<P>
	I know traditional parties will not want to see the house of 
patronage disappear. Where would they put the old boys and girls

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="REFERENDUMCAMPAIGN">REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in desperation, Daniel Johnson mentioned a commitment 
made in 1992 by the Liberal Party of Canada to recognize the 
distinct identity of Quebec, in an attempt to convince himself that 
the political will for constitutional change exists. However, on 
September 11 this year, the Prime Minister of Canada told him, and 
I quote: ``Distinct society-we are distinct, no need to put it in the 
Constitution. When you look at me and hear me speak English, you 
know I am distinct''.
<P>
	My question is directed to the Prime Minister. I want to ask him 
whether he intends to remind Mr. Johnson that the federal 
government has no intention of amending the Constitution to 
recognize the distinct identity of Quebec, as he himself, the Prime 
Minister of Canada, said on September 11 this year.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, twice Canadians have been asked to vote on this. I 
remember the distinct society was part of the Charlottetown 
accord. I voted for the accord, Mr. Speaker. The Leader of the 
Opposition voted against it. The leader of the Bloc Quebecois 
voted against it. The members of the Parti Quebecois voted against 
it. Jacques Parizeau did. We were in favour of the accord.
<P>
	They voted against it, but today they want it back. I think that is a 
little ridiculous. As we said before, today the issue is not the 
Constitution. Today we have to answer a question put by the Leader 
of the Opposition and his former leader, the Premier of Quebec, 
about whether we should separate.
<P>
	When asked the question: ``Should we separate?'', the people of 
Quebec will say no. Today we are not talking about the 
Constitution but about answering the question put by the Leader of 
the Opposition.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, so constitutional change is not important enough to 
discuss at a time when it happens to be the focus of the debate on 
the future of Quebec. That is rather strange.
<P>
	The Prime Minister just referred to Charlottetown. He knows 
perfectly well that the Canada clause made recognition of Quebec's 
distinct identity devoid of all substance by subordinating this 
recognition to the fundamental principle of provincial equality.
<P>
	I want to ask him: Would he confirm that it is because of the 
sacrosanct principle of provincial equality, he refuses to recognize 
Quebec as a distinct society, as he is being asked to do today, alas in 
vain, by Mr. Johnson who will not learn the lessons of Meech and 
Charlottetown?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Mr. Johnson voted for the distinct society in the 
Charlottetown referendum, while the Leader of the Opposition 
voted against the distinct society when we had a referendum. Mr. 
Parizeau voted against the distinct society when we had a 
referendum. Funny how they have changed their minds today. Why 
did they not consider what they were doing at the time?
<P>
	They wanted to vote against the accord so they could go on 
complaining and then have a referendum on separation. We will 
have one two weeks from today, when people will answer the 
question on the separation of Quebec from the rest of Canada. The 
people of Quebec know that their future is about remaining full 
members of the federation of this great country, Canada.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if the Prime Minister voted for Charlottetown, it was 
because recognition of Quebec's distinct identity did not mean a 
thing. That is why he voted in favour of the accord and that is why 
we are going to vote against it.
<P>
	I want to ask the Prime Minister how he expects Quebecers to 
trust him after what he did the day after the No in 1980, when he 
did a job on Quebec by isolating it and imposing a constitution that 
Quebec still refuses to sign.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition likes to talk about  the past. I 
have nothing to hide. At the time we were, legally speaking, a 
colony of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15399"> 15399 </A></B>
<P>
Great Britain, and we had to patriate the Constitution. We had no 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms in Canada, something we wanted 
to have. The Constitution at the time did not include the 
recognition of French and English as Canada's two official 
languages, which was done in 1980, fifteen years ago.
<P>
	The country has continued to progress, while he is still back in 
1980 and we are heading for the 21st century, and he says he has the 
answer, the magic wand. You wave the magic wand and poof, the 
studies commissioned by Le Hir vanish into thin air; another wave, 
and all the risks of separation disappear; another, and the concerns 
of everyone, from the Prime Minister of Canada to the leaders of 
other countries, are no more. And then suddenly, another wave and 
Mr. Parizeau, the leader of the No side, has vanished.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	Clearly short of arguments to defend the federalist cause, Liberal 
Senator Jacques Hébert, government whip in the Senate, used 
coarse, derogatory and unacceptable language in describing 
political scientist Josée Legault as a separatist cow.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister publicly dissociate himself from this 
inappropriate remark by his old friend Jacques Hébert and will he 
offer an apology, on behalf of the Liberal Party of Canada, to the 
women who have been offended by it?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My dear colleague, the government's 
administrative responsibilities do not extend to the Senate. I would 
ask my hon. colleague to rephrase the question, which will perhaps 
be acceptable.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Venne:</B> Mr. Speaker, given the unacceptable nature of this 
remark and the responsibilities of the senator, who was appointed 
by the Prime Minister to perform official duties, I am asking the 
Prime Minister whether he will relieve him of his duties.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
respond.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Just a minute. I will allow the question, and the 
Prime Minister will be able to answer it.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if this remark was made, I deplore it. That is all I can say. I 
was not present. I am told it was made in a private conversation. It 
was not said publicly, but if it was made, I deplore it.
<P>
	Everyone makes mistakes, perhaps the senator made one here. I 
have also made mistakes. This senator has faithfully served 
Parliament and Quebec society. He may have made a mistake-it 
happens-I regret it.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, we are 
not talking about deploring a remark, we are talking about 
dissociating oneself from it.

	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the health 
minister has failed in her bid to squash semi-private clinics in 
Canada. Two of the largest provinces just ignore her and four 
provinces have bluntly said no to decreased medicare funding and 
no to longer waiting lines.
<P>
	However, it is never too late to operate co-operatively. We call 
on the minister to put aside her silly squabbles. We call on her to 
work with the provinces toward health care reform which puts 
patients rather than bureaucrats first.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Minister of Health is defending something voted on by 
the House of Commons, the five principles in the Canada Health 
Act.
<P>
	We all agree with her that these principles have to be protected. 
Unlike the Reform Party, we do not want a two tier system. 
However, at the same time she has agreed to talk about some 
specific problems with the provinces in order for them to operate in 
a way that is completely acceptable according to the principles of 
medicare. She has the support of this whole party.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Prime 
Minister wants specifics. Maybe he will listen to the patients on 
waiting lists throughout the country. The cardiac waiting lists in 
Canada today are longer than they have ever been in history. Why? 
They have no choice. The minister offers no choice and no 
alternatives.

<HR>
<B><A NAME="15400"> 15400 </A></B>
<P>
	Does the minister have anything to say to Canadians on waiting 
lists other than ``just line up and shut up''?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member should know that administration occurs 
on a daily basis and discussions on how to operate medical services 
within the provinces are completely provincial responsibilities. We 
are not running hospitals. They are run by provincial governments.
<P>
	However, it is very difficult for me to understand that these 
people are always complaining that we should not spend money 
and should cut all the time but then they want us to increase 
payments to the provinces. I would like the member to say so and 
by how much. I will listen to him.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Prime 
Minister continues to say we do not need more money in the 
system, but how much less do we need?
<P>
	This rigid centralist solution will not work. This kind of 
government is why we are in so much trouble with health care and 
indeed with Quebec.
<P>
	The provinces know this edict on semi-private clinics will not 
work. I call on the Prime Minister to abandon this approach. When 
will the Prime Minister join the provinces in real reform, real 
health care reform?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we have established a forum on that. We have experts 
operating under my leadership on how to reform medicare. We 
have a problem with that in Canada. I recognize that. We included 
in our red book that it was to be reviewed. We have formed a 
committee of experts listening to the views of Canadians.
<P>
	However in the meantime, and we said it very clearly, we have to 
reduce the cost of medicare from what it is today, 10 per cent of 
GDP, to around 9 per cent. It will be done although it will not be 
easy.
<P>
	The provincial governments are also doing their share. They are 
cutting and we have to benefit a bit from their cuts because the 
federal government has deficit problems. Some provinces cut $500 
million so we must have the right to cut in relative terms if we want 
a balanced situation in Canada. We are having ongoing discussions 
with the provinces on this. I am happy to know that the Reform 
Party does not want us to spend more money on it.

Speaker, I think the Leader of the Opposition is trying to do some 
damage control, considering the terrible blunder he made when he 
implied that since we are in Quebec, we are white. He then implied 
that Quebec-
<P>
	You know, what is disturbing about the comments of the Leader 
of the Opposition is that to be a good Quebecer, it is better to be 
white than coloured and it is certainly better to speak French than 
English. If you are a separatist, you are a good Quebecer; if you are 
a federalist, you are not. If you happen to be a woman, maybe you 
should have more children.
<P>
	This is a matter of personal choice for every woman. We may be 
in favour of certain policies in this respect but they should not be 
connected with race and with relationships that deny the equal 
status of men and women in society.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is simply appalling that a Prime Minister should stoop 
to distorting comments to such an extraordinary degree. This is 
intolerable. Everybody knows there is a problem with the birth rate 
in Quebec and that it concerns all governments. Everyone knows 
that in Quebec many couples, and we all know people like that, 
would like to have children but cannot afford to.
<P>
	So I want to ask him whether he does not realize that we will 
have to introduce appropriate measures for financial support, 
measures to make daycare available to everyone, and I want to ask 
him whether he realizes that by threatening to cut social programs 
as he has started to do and will continue to do more and more after 
the No, he ignores the needs and interests of women and married 
couples?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, since I am being accused of misquoting the Leader of the 
Opposition, I will read to you what he said: ``Do you think it makes 
sense that we have so few children in Quebec? We are one of the 
white races that has the least children. That does not make sense''. 
Are Quebecers members of the white race? There are Quebecers of 
every colour and every religion.

	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
both the Prime Minister and the Minister of National Defence have 
said that they want to get to the bottom of the events in Somalia. 
They have pledged to act after the commission of inquiry submits 
its report.
<P>
	However, section 69 of the National Defence Act requires that a 
trial for most services offences must begin within three years of the 
alleged offence. Because the commission is not scheduled to report 
until June 1996, it seems that discipline and leadership failings of 
late 1992 and early 1993 will go untried.
<P>
	Was the minister aware of this limitation when he called the 
inquiry? How exactly does he plan to get to the bottom of events if 
charges cannot even be laid?
<P>
<B>(1435 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the government 
is fully aware of the provisions of the National Defence Act with 
respect to the statute of limitations on non-indictable offences. I am 
sure the commission on Somalia is also well aware of it.
<P>
	With respect to the question on charges, we do not presume that 
further charges are to be laid, but we do not preclude it either. I 
would ask the hon. member and his party to let the commission do 
its job and we will do our job in government. Then we will have 
justice served.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
this Liberal government took a year to announce a public inquiry. It 
was almost another full year before the inquiry began to hear 
witnesses.
<P>
	Last November I asked the minister to suspend the courts martial 
and proceed immediately with the inquiry. He refused. How can 
this minister explain to the Canadian public that because of his 
delays justice will be denied by a technicality?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, unlike the 
Reform Party, we have a profound respect for the justice system in 
this country.
<P>
	The hon. member is fully aware that we were precluded from 
calling the inquiry because there were courts martial in process and 
then subsequently there were appeals. Until we had the Westray 
mine decision of the supreme court in May of this year, we could 
not have  started a commission without risking having the charges 
quashed of people currently on trial.
<P>
	If I had done what the hon. member advocated we do and people 
who have subsequently been charged and convicted were then not 
subject to the justice system, he would be the first one yelling and 
screaming in the House of Commons that somehow the

thread runs through the Prime Minister's entire political career. 
Every time Quebec wanted to assert itself, he has stood in its way. 
We just learned that Elections Canada has initiated the whole 
process required for holding a Canada-wide referendum. This is 
probably not a spontaneous initiative by Elections Canada.
<P>

democratic decision of Quebecers?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I did not speak to the Chief Electoral Officer. If he has 
decided to set the whole machinery in motion, an election will 
certainly be held within two or three years. For the moment, my 
only goal is the one we all share: winning the referendum in two 
weeks.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, since the 
Prime Minister can see that it is less and less likely that he will win 
the referendum in Quebec, I ask him again: Does he realize that by 
staying extremely vague on the Elections Canada manoeuvres, he 
is raising doubts as to his democratic intentions?
<P>
	I ask him again: Does the Prime Minister reject the idea of 
holding a referendum in order to counter the democratic decision 
Quebecers will make in two weeks?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Chief Electoral Officer reports directly to the House of 
Commons. All the hon. member has to do is call and ask him why 
he is getting ready to hold an election. An election can be called 
any day. I could get up tomorrow morning and call an election.

Vancouver Island crown counsel positions, he said that the sole 
criterion for their appointment was that of competence.
<P>
	Well, their competence showed up last week when one of the

competence?

what the Minister of Justice said on these appointments still holds 
true.
<P>
	The matter to which the hon. member refers is an incident where 
perhaps more through an administrative mix-up the new agent was 
unable to get the files for the court. It had nothing to do with the 
agent's competence. The matter is being looked into by the 
Minister of Justice.

	<B>Mr. Russell MacLellan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister

if the agent is unable to get the information and unable to get the 
files then the agent cannot do the job if the agent is not granted a 
postponement by the court. If this is the case, as I believe it may 
well be, then certainly there is nothing whatever to discredit the 
agent.

is for the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration. His department 
has speeded up citizenship processing in Quebec since the 
referendum campaign has begun. Never, in any recent provincial or 
federal election, had such an extensive operation been undertaken 
to issue certificates of citizenship. Because of this accelerated 
process, more than 15,000 new citizens will be able to vote in the 
upcoming referendum.
<P>
	How can the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration justify this 
eagerness to expedite the processing of citizenship applications in 
Quebec, when his own officials have confirmed that never before 
had such an extensive operation been conducted just before an 
election anywhere in Canada?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, what is being done with respect 
to citizenship processing in the province of Quebec leading up to 
the referendum is nothing different from any lead up to any 
provincial campaign.
<P>
	My department has done likewise with the provinces of 
Manitoba, New Brunswick and Ontario. If we compare the number 
of citizenship processings with the year of the Ontario election, it is 
up some 45 per cent.
<P>
	Is the hon. member suggesting that we should somehow slow 
down the process? Is the hon. member suggesting that it is not 
proper to have the persons exercise their democratic right to vote? 
Exactly what is his point?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in my case it 
took one year to become a citizen, and the minister did not do that 
before the elections in Ontario and New Brunswick.

	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and

	The government does not assume how newcomers or immigrants 
will vote. Perhaps the party on the other side is assuming somehow 
that new immigrants will vote a different way from the intention of 
their party. That is  not my business as minister of citizenship. My

<P>
	When the Liberals announced the Atlantic groundfish strategy in 
May 1994 they called it a program to end all programs. Significant 
funding was allocated to reduce industry capacity and for 
retraining.
<P>
	The government has already siphoned money away from 
retraining. Last week the minister announced funding reductions to 
the $300 million buy back program, the heart of capacity reduction, 
because TAGS benefits are running unchecked resulting in a 
massive deficit.
<P>
	Will the minister admit to the House and to the fishermen in 
Atlantic Canada that TAGS is in total chaos and will do nothing 
more than perpetuate income dependency?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I will make no such admission.
<P>
	The Reform Party really has to sort itself out. Its members spend 
most of their time calling for a total cancellation of the TAGS 
program, cancellation of all forms of unemployment insurance 
assistance and, if we read between the lines, cancellation of 
Atlantic Canada on most days.
<P>
	The Liberal Party announced last week in consultation with my 
colleague, the Minister of Human Resources Development, the 
beginning of the early retirement component of that program for 
fishermen between the ages of 55 and 64, the first round of a 
licence retirement program. The Minister of Human Resources 
Development will proceed shortly with details on early retirement 
programs for plant workers.
<P>
	We are well on our way to achieving our 50 per cent capacity 
reduction objective and we are on our way to rebuilding the 
Atlantic fishery for the long term.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this is not our 
program; this is their program. They are not meeting their own 
targets.
<P>
	Fishermen in Atlantic Canada tell me that TAGS has a $400 
million projected deficit because, to be frank, just about anybody 
could qualify for benefits. One fish plant operator told me that 
one-third of his workforce left their jobs to go on TAGS. Another 
fisherman told me: ``All you need to do to qualify for benefits is 
show up at a TAGS office wearing a pair of rubber fishing boots''.
<P>

	Will the minister admit that TAGS is an abject failure because it 
has been totally mismanaged and will now do almost nothing to 
reduce industry capacity?
<P>

Mr. Speaker, it is tragic when a member is on the job for a short 
period of time as a critic and then perpetuates certain rather 
destructive myths about a region of the country. ``All you have to 
do to qualify for assistance is show up with a pair of rubber boots'' 
is the kind of cruel and twisted humour that does nothing to solve 
the problems of Atlantic Canada.
<P>
	The reality of the TAGS program is that 39,000 people qualified, 
but only 25,000 have actually taken assistance. The others have 
been able to find new kinds of work in the fishery or in other 
sectors. Fourteen thousand people who qualify based on the criteria 
have gone off to find a new start in their lives. Thousands more 
have entered training programs and many more thousands are now 
in the process of moving out of this industry and making a new

``We must assume that the federal government is acting in good 
faith; the right to vote is sacred''.

	We are not taking shortcuts on the applications. The applications 
within the system are being processed. There is a view at the lead 
up of every provincial and federal election, including the 
referendum this time as well as in 1980, that if there is an ability to 
speed up the processing with the viewing of granting the franchise 
of the vote it will be done.
<P>
	For instance, in the province of Ontario in the lead up to the 
provincial election in 1994, instead of the 72,000 people that were 
processed in 1993 there were 107,000 people processed or a 49 per 
cent increase.

	In Manitoba, in New Brunswick and in the other provinces the

	<B>Mr. Russell MacLellan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
with respect to the Royer case, the Supreme Court of Canada has 
now been asked to look at it. As this case is before the supreme 
court it would be improper to comment on it.
<P>
	This case is different from the Daviault case in that this is a 
crime of specific intent whereas the Daviault case was a crime of 
general intent.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice is looking at the possibility of acting as 
an intervenor in this case if it goes before the Supreme Court of 
Canada.

question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15406"> 15406 </A></B>
<P>
	In opposition the Prime Minister opposed the Tory vision of 
health care. He opposed cuts to the transfer payments to the 
provinces and territories. He opposed Bill C-91 which has sent 
the prices of prescription drugs sky-rocketing. He said he would 
protect Canadian health care with more than just rhetoric.
<P>
	Unfortunately some Canadians believed him but we have seen 
no changes to Bill C-91. We have seen reduced transfer payments. 
The real problems with health policy are the Liberal government 
policies.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister stop letting the Minister of Finance set 
health policy, present a vision to Canadians and ensure stable 
funding for provinces and territories so we can have a truly national 
health care system?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will certainly tell the Minister of Finance the member 
for Yukon is not very happy with him.
<P>
	As the hon. member for Yukon has resigned as the leader of the 
NDP, I take this opportunity to congratulate her on behalf of 
everyone for having served her party and the House of Commons 
very well. As the leader of her party, her contributions were always 
of a very high level and extremely useful to the House of 
Commons. Of course I did not agree with her all the time and I did 
not expect her to agree with me all the time.
<P>
	On behalf of everyone, I congratulate the member on a job well 
done.

	<B>Hon. Sheila Finestone (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism) 
(Status of Women), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a great pleasure today 
to pay tribute to the Hon. Audrey McLaughlin, an outstanding 
human being, a wonderful spokesperson in the interests of our 
society and always very measured but very convinced in her 
observations and in her remarks.
<P>
	Audrey McLaughlin is one of the outstanding leaders and role 
models of Canadian politics and female politics. She has 
strengthened us all by her presence. She has been symbolic of all 
we are about and why and what we wish to achieve in terms of 
equality of opportunity, equality of access, equality by the very 
right of our competence our skills and our personalities. She is a 
woman who has all of those attributes.
<P>
	In every way she symbolizes why we are all here. She has 
contributed in very significant ways to the changing of the tone and 
the substance of debate. That has been one of the most significant 
observations I could make as we shared the other side of this floor 
for many years. Audrey always had the ability to present her point 
of view in a very deliberate and measured way. She did not agree 
most often with the procedures of the House but she was never 
disagreeable in her approach to her point of view and expressing 
her firm conviction which she holds from depth of heart which 
becomes very obvious.
<P>
	It was a privilege to have the Hon. Audrey McLaughlin on the 
trip we recently completed for the fourth annual conference in 
Beijing on women's issues. Her presence was a symbol to the host 
country as we travelled with four different parties representative of 
the diversity of this country, not only the diversity of political 
opinion but the diversity of our geography and the diversity of our 
people.
<P>
	She is an eloquent spokesperson for the aboriginals of her 
region, the people who have elected her to the House; not only the 
aboriginals but certainly those she represents with such sincerity 
and depth of commitment to their interests and to their well-being. 
For this we owe her a very strong vote of thanks.
<P>
	When Audrey would stand to make a speech or to pose a 
question she did it in a very holistic way. It was never with the 
finest of lenses, which I appreciate perhaps more than most. I like 
that approach because it puts an issue into the context of daily 
human life, of living. Living is so daily and, Audrey, you bring that 
to our attention so succinctly and effectively.
<P>
	As a woman she is a trailblazer. In 1989 she became the first 
woman to lead a national political party in Canada, in fact in all of 
North America. Sixty-eight years after Agnes Macphail, the first 
woman was elected to the House of Commons. As a woman she 
bears the legacy of womanhood, having many and diverse roles 
which are  rather in competition at many times. She is of course a 
politician but say she belies the phrase ``you are too nice to be a 
politician''.

<HR>

<P>
	She is a leader who brings with her and believes in sharing power 
and leadership and is a model to other women. We have stunning 
proof of that in the House, which you have just brought to our 
attention, Mr. Speaker. We all welcome Alexa McDonough as the 
new leader of the New Democratic Party. We wish her well as she 
takes on a very difficult and very trying role. I hope she does not 
find putting together both roles of politician and general citizen too 
difficult.
<P>
	Audrey McLaughlin the activist has served on many boards and 
has brought a lot of interesting perspectives to these boards of 
directors. Audrey McLaughlin is also a mother with two children 
and it has taken the support of those children for her to be in the 
House. She has also been an outstanding daughter to her mother 
and we have all followed that with great heart.
<P>
	On behalf of countless women and children across this land, we 
take our hats off to you, Audrey McLaughlin. We wish you well in 
your future.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to add the voice of the official opposition to 
that of the government spokesperson in paying all of the honour 
that is due to Audrey McLaughlin as she moves from the life of an 
elected representative to the life of a private citizen.
<P>
	I would like her to tell her that we have all loved and admired her 
and that we will continue to show her all of the esteem she 
deserves. When I was on the opposition benches from 1990 to 
1993, when the Bloc was not a recognized party, I had the 
opportunity, since I was in the same corner of the House, to work in 
close conjunction with Ms. McLaughlin as Leader of the 
Opposition. I must admit that I learned lessons from her which I try 
to put into practice daily.
<P>
	I believe that we must acknowledge the work carried out by this 
great lady who is leaving the House of Commons for another life, a 
life in which I know she will be equally productive. We must tell 
her how much she will be missed. The social awareness she has 
shown in this House is something that has been building throughout 
her life. She came to politics from social work. She has worked in 
the health field, she has worked with children. When she spoke of 
those causes in the House she knew what she was talking about, and 
we sensed that in the sincerity of her speeches.
<P>
	I would also like to remind people that she was the first woman 
leader of a major federal party. She has blazed a trail for others to 
follow. We must acknowledge  that she has done a good job of 
doing so, for now another woman will be leading her party.
<P>
	I do not wish to see her leave the House right away, but I know 
that the decision she has made to leave the leadership of a great 
party like the NDP was a very big decision. I hope she will remain 
extremely active in politics, for the party she has led which is now 
to be led by Ms. McDonough and in fact has been led by her since 
the weekend, is a party which represents in English Canada the 
values to which all of us in the Bloc Quebecois adhere, but which 
are not exclusive to the Bloc.
<P>
	We know that social values are very important in English 
Canada, that English Canada fought long for them. There must 
therefore be a party in this House at all times to defend those 
values. I hope that party will be the NDP.
<P>
	Again, allow me to repeat our regrets that Ms. McLaughlin has 
stepped down from the leadership of the New Democratic Party, 
and to wish her from all of us a long and active life. At any rate, we 
know that she will be following the excellent examples set by 
Stephen Lewis and Ed Broadbent before her.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
behalf of the Reform Party I would also like to congratulate the 
member for Yukon.
<P>
	We have sat together in the House for several years. Although we 
have all kinds of different political views, we also share many 
things and have a lot of things in common. We first came to the 
House via byelections, a very exciting situation. The member for 
Yukon was elected in 1987 and I was elected in 1989. We are 
women and that gives a certain situation and a certain leaning. 
When you are in here you learn all kinds of things about being a 
woman in federal politics certainly. We are both far from home as 
we serve in this place.
<P>
<B>(1515)</B>
<P>
	When we live in far flung western and northern ridings, Ottawa 
is a long way from home. There are people who we really cherish 
and miss dreadfully when we are a long way from home.
<P>
	We have sat as independents in this House. We have that in 
common as well. That gives a certain perspective also in the House 
of Commons. It lets us realize that things are not always just the 
way we would want them to be but it is a good learning situation for 
both of us.
<P>
	What impressed me the very most when I first came here and 
wandered around as a caucus of one all by myself was seeing 
Audrey in her good business clothes and her Reeboks walking 
through the Byward market. That really warmed me to you, 
Audrey. I realized then that here was a party leader who was 
practical and when she was going on a long jaunt from Parliament 
Hill she  was free and willing to wear her Reeboks. I have always 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15408"> 15408 </A></B>
<P>
appreciated that about her. I will continue to think of her as I march 
through the market in my Reeboks.
<P>
	When somebody comes to Parliament Hill from so far away, 
they give up an incredible amount of their personal life. I know, 
Audrey, it is difficult to be so far away from home as you put many 
relationships on hold as you come here and serve the Canadian 
public.
<P>
	I want to thank you on behalf of my party and on behalf of all 
Canadians who appreciate so much-maybe they do not say it 
daily-the fact that you have also given up much. We want to thank 
you and say that we appreciate all that you have done. Thank you so 
much for your contribution to Canadian life, to the Canadian 
political process and the incredible sacrifice that you have made to 
your country. Good luck in all that you do in the future. God bless 
you, Audrey.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
this weekend the NDP elected a new leader. My caucus colleagues 
and I were pleased to have our new leader, Alexa McDonough, 
recognized in the gallery today.
<P>
	The NDP caucus looks forward to working with Alexa. It also 
looks forward to the day when she and many others join us in this 
House to put forward our vision of the country and the world.
<P>
	For the last six years, that vision has been put forward on our 
behalf in this House and across Canada by the member for Yukon, 
the Hon. Audrey McLaughlin. As chair of the federal NDP caucus I 
am honoured to be able today to pay tribute to Audrey on behalf of 
my colleagues and I am sure on behalf of Hill staff, party members 
and many other Canadians, all of whom I believe came to very 
much appreciate the member for Yukon and her way of doing 
politics.
<P>
	Audrey, like some of her predecessors, had some moments here 
in Parliament that will be recorded in the minds and hearts of New 
Democrats forever as richly symbolic of the dissent which we 
express in this place about what is regarded by the conventional 
wisdom as unacceptable or unavoidable, whether it is on matters 
like NAFTA, privatization, deregulation, a whole list of things. 
Your leadership in our opposition to the gulf war was such a 
defining moment for many New Democrats.
<P>
	And if I may say so while I am talking about courage, I 
remember your support of the Charlottetown accord when you put 
what you thought was best for your country ahead of what you 
knew might be politically risky for your party.
<P>
	As the first woman leader of a federal party, you made history 
and you made it in such a way that our party was able to elect 
another woman as leader without gender being an issue. Thanks to 
your history-making leadership bid, the time when gender is an 
issue in Canadian political leadership contests may well be history. 
This is  as it should be and for this all Canadians who value the 
equality of the sexes are indebted to you.
<P>
	The member for Yukon is no longer our leader, but we are 
delighted that she continues to be our colleague, having put behind 
her the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune that sometimes 
come with the leadership of political parties. We know that the 
people of Yukon will be the real beneficiaries as Audrey will now 
be able to give her undivided attention to a part of Canada that she 
so clearly loves, and whose reality she brought home to us in the 
NDP caucus and elsewhere.
<P>
	I venture to say that the phrase coast to coast to coast, which 
Audrey always insisted on, by way of recognizing northern Canada 
and the northern coast it represents, has changed the lexicon of 
Canadian politics in a way that brings recognition to northern 
Canada and the constituency which you so ably represent.
<P>
<B>(1520 )</B>
<P>
	On a personal note I remember as well the joy which you took in 
having caucus go to the Yukon for a retreat. I remember even better 
the experience of mushing on the back of a dog sled, thanks to the 
care which Audrey took to make sure that we all had a taste of this 
great northern tradition. The dogs were a little bit tired after pulling 
me.
<P>
	Since the election of 1993 and her announcement of her intention 
to step down as our leader, the member for Yukon has given much 
of herself and her energies to the renewal process in our party, a 
process which she gave impetus to originally and which has helped 
to invigorate the NDP.
<P>
	In this, as in all things, Audrey has earned the affection of many 
New Democrats with her warm smile, her kind words and her 
ability to remember so many of the countless faces and names she 
encountered as a political party leader.
<P>
	Finally, there is one word that seems to come to everyone's 
mouth when we speak of the member for Yukon and that is dignity: 
dignity in the day to day demands of politics. I remember Audrey 
patiently putting on my son Daniel's rubber boots in order to 
personally view the flooded yards and homes of south Transcona in 
my riding. But most of all dignity in the face of difficult 
circumstances, dignity in the face of electoral defeat, dignity in the 
face of criticism and dignity in the passing of the torch to a new 
leader.
<P>
	For all these things and more, Audrey, we say thank you.

	<B>Mr. Eugène Bellemare (Carleton-Gloucester, Lib.):</B> Mr.

woman to 
<P>

<B><A NAME="15409"> 15409 </A></B>
<P>
head a  national party. For this, I offer her both praise and 
congratulations.
<P>
	I have had an opportunity to visit the Yukon and been impressed 
by the work Ms. McLaughlin has accomplished there. The Yukon is 
no easy place to visit. It is no easy place to serve. It is immense and 
surely as far away as you can get in Canada from the capital. For 
this I raise my hat to one who, probably, for many weekends has 
gone home to visit her constituents and returned to work every 
week.
<P>
	I have found Ms. McLaughlin to be affable, friendly, 
distinguished and elegant. She always had time to chat, regardless 
of one's political affiliation. She invariably had a smile and a kind 
word to say. We will miss her. She served her party with 
enthusiasm. She knew her subject matter. She spoke well in the 
House, in both official languages.
<P>
	I have always appreciated the fact that she recognized Canada's 
two main groups and wanted to represent everybody all the time, 
always with a view to improving quality of life. I am pleased to 
have sat in the House with her as a colleague since 1988 and I will 
remember her as an extraordinary individual. My congratulations, 
Ms. McLaughlin.

<P>
	<B>Hon. Audrey McLaughlin (Yukon, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
certainly thank everyone for their very kind comments. I also thank 
my caucus colleagues for their support and their comments today.
<P>
	I have been very proud to lead a political party that has 
consistently stood for working Canadians and those who would be 
working, for a strong national health care program, for Canadians 
who really believe we have to have tax fairness and fair trade 
agreements. It is a party that refuses to abandon the poor, the ill and 
the vulnerable, when right now that seems all too popular.

<P>
	Unfortunately, it was a time when political life seemed 
somewhat suspect. There is less respect for politicians. However, 
despite all of our country's problems, I am proud to be a member of 
Parliament, proud to work for my country and for my territory, the 
Yukon. We are a diverse country with a strong sense of history, a 
country built by the first nations, the anglophones, the 
francophones and the allophones.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We are a diverse country, made up of many peoples. We have 
many challenges to meet in the 21st century. It will take the 
contribution of every Canadian to move us forward with pride in 
this heritage and hope for our future.
<P>
	I have sometimes despaired about the political process and 
wondered if we could really do this, but I have never doubted that 
in this most imperfect of systems, we are engaged in the noble 
process of public service. It is for this reason that I feel privileged 
to continue as the member of Parliament for Yukon and to continue 
to serve Canada and my constituents. I look forward to working 
with our new leader, Alexa McDonough.
<P>

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="BILLS-9-SPEAKER'SRULING">BILL S-9-SPEAKER'S RULING</A></H4>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Colleagues, I am now ready to rule on the point of 
order raised by the hon. member for Gander-Grand Falls on 
October 4, 1995 concerning the procedural acceptability of Bill 
S-9, which is on the Order Paper today, an act to amend the 
Canada-United States Tax Convention Act, 1984.
<P>
	At that time the hon. member brought to the attention of the 
Chair the possibility that a bill from the Senate, which had been 
read a second time in the House and referred by the House to 
committee, might impose expenditures on the Government of 
Canada.
<P>
	As all members know, Standing Order 79(1) and section 54 of 
the Constitution Act, 1867, require that the House of Commons 
shall not adopt or pass any vote, resolution, address or bill for the 
appropriation of any part of the public revenue or of any tax or 
impost to any purpose that has not been first recommended to the 
House by a message from the Governor General. In short, a royal 
recommendation must be obtained.
<P>
	In addition, section 53 of the Constitution Act, 1867, states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Bills for appropriating any Part of the Public Revenue, or for imposing any 
Tax or Impost, shall originate in the House of Commons.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It is the duty of every member of this House to be vigilant in this 
regard and to scrutinize bills no matter where they originate.
<P>
	Bill S-9 has not just arrived in the House. The message from the 
Senate was received on May 3, 1995. The bill was read a first time 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15410"> 15410 </A></B>
<P>
on June 14 and was read a second  time and referred to the Standing 
Committee on Finance on September 21.
<P>
	Although the bill is now coming to the House for report and third 
reading stages, the Chair does accept the explanation given by the 
hon. member for having raised this matter so late in the legislative 
process since his point of order is based on information received 
during the finance committee's deliberations on the bill.
<P>
<B>(1530)</B>
<P>
	I wish to remind all hon. members of citation 319 of 
Beauchesne's sixth edition, which requires that points of order be 
brought to the attention of the Chair as soon as possible.
<P>
	I want to thank the hon. member for Gander-Grand Falls for 
raising his concerns. I would also like to thank the hon. members 
for Willowdale, Regina-Lumsden, and York South-Weston and 
the parliamentary secretary to the government House leader for 
taking an interest in this matter and providing the Chair with their 
views on what is described in Erskine May's 21st edition at page 67 
as ``the most important power vested in any branch of the 
legislature, the right of imposing taxes upon the people and of 
voting money for the public service''.
<P>
	I want to assure the House that I view this matter very seriously 
and I have thoroughly studied the situation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In his presentation, the hon. member for Gander-Grand Falls 
argued that the provisions of Bill S-9 would impose expenditures 
on the government by reducing taxes on profits made by American 
multinational corporations in Canada. He also stated that the bill 
would require the government to pay a tax credit to persons subject 
to estate taxes in the U.S. Therefore, the government would suffer 
``a loss in tax expenditures for all time to come''. The hon. member 
for York South-Weston also spoke to this point.
<P>
	In his submission, the hon. member for Gander-Grand Falls 
made reference to two rulings given by my predecessor Speaker 
Lamoureux on November 12, 1969 and on June 12, 1973. I have 
examined these rulings very carefully. In both cases, the bills 
brought down from the Senate very clearly contained provisions 
requiring expenditures by the government and Speaker Lamoureux 
quite rightly ruled that these bills infringed the privileges of the 
House of Commons. Both bills were set aside. However, these two 
precedents do not, in my opinion, apply to our present 
circumstances.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	From my research, the substantive changes to the Canada-United 
States tax convention dealt with in Bill S-9 appear to relate to 
reductions in the rate of withholding taxes applied to different 
types of payments,  for example, to dividends paid by a company 
resident in one country to a company in the other country owning 
more than a certain percentage of voting stock in the first company.
<P>
	The bill will also have the effect of granting some tax relief 
retroactively and there may be some reimbursements payable for 
taxes paid under the law as it now reads, should Bill S-9 be passed 
by the House and receive royal assent.
<P>
	The bill does not appropriate tax revenue, but rather exempts or 
reduces taxes otherwise payable, in some cases retroactively.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	As members know, when the House is dealing with tax 
measures, members may propose amendments to such bills so long 
as they do not exceed the scope, increase the amount or extend the 
incidence of any charge upon the public.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	No amendment may be proposed that would increase the rate of 
tax nor extend its incidence to a new class of payers without the 
recommendation of the Crown. In their search of such measures 
committees may also propose such reductions. I would refer hon. 
members to citations 988 to 991 of Beauchesne's sixth edition on 
this point.
<P>
	Citation 992, also dealing with the powers of House committees 
with regard to tax bills, states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>So long as an existing tax is not increased, any modification of the proposed 
reduction may be introduced in the committee on the bill, and is regarded as a 
question not for increasing the charge upon the people but for determining to 
what extent such charge shall be reduced.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1535)</B>
<P>
	It must also be borne in mind that members of this House can 
initiate and have initiated bills to lower taxes. So too can the 
Senate. And there is a longstanding practice for the government to 
introduce such bills in the other place at its discretion.
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary to the government House leader 
noted in his intervention that Bill S-9 is not a bill for appropriating 
any part of the public revenue or for any tax or impost and therefore 
does not require a royal recommendation. There will be no 
expenditure of public funds, though money already collected from 
Canadian citizens pursuant to the tax laws of Canada may be 
refunded.
<P>
	As the parliamentary secretary pointed out, the repayment of tax 
revenues already received is not an appropriation of public money. 
Thus, the bill could be properly introduced in the Senate.
<P>
	In conclusion, Standing Orders 79 and 80 have not been 
contravened, as Bill S-9 neither imposes a tax nor  appropriates 
money for any purpose. Since the bill relinquishes funds it might 
other-
<P>

<B><A NAME="15411"> 15411 </A></B>
<P>
wise have gained, it is not appropriating money but forfeiting 
revenue it would have raised without such changes.
<P>
	Once again, I thank the hon. member for Gander-Grand Falls 
for his diligence in guarding the privileges of the House by 
bringing this matter to my attention.

	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader </B><B>of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
pursuant to Standing Order 36(8), I have the honour to table, in 
both official languages, the government's response to three 
petitions.
<P>

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="WOMEN'SHISTORYMONTH">WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Finestone (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism) 
(Status of Women), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, today we are celebrating 
Persons day, the highlight of women's history month.
<P>
	This is a time to celebrate the contributions of women to 
Canadian society, a time to be proud of the remarkable progress 
Canada has made toward equality for women and against actions of 
racism and sexism.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The Fathers of Confederation made the original blueprint of 
Canada in 1867. However, it took until 1921 for women to earn the 
right to vote.
<P>
	Nonetheless, throughout history, the women of Canada-in all 
their diversity-have prevailed. They have shaped the values of 
this great country: democracy, tolerance, generosity, fairness, and 
respect for human and minority rights.
<P>
	Today we celebrate five intrepid women from Alberta who won a 
court case in 1929 that changed the lives of all Canadians. The 
court's decision made women legal ``persons'' under the 
constitution. And that made them eligible for appointment to the 
Senate.
<P>
	Today we have the largest representation of women ever in the 
Parliament of Canada, in the Commons as well as in the Senate. 
With the charter of rights and freedoms, the constitution now 
guarantees women and men equal rights and freedoms as full 
partners in our society.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Women have made great progress toward equality, and that 
means progress for Canadians and for all of Canada.
<P>
<B>(1540)</B>
<P>
	Today we recognize women's issues as societal issues. We 
recognize and realize that women's equality is in the best interests 
of Canada. All our talent and all our potential in all the 
socioeconomic and cultural fields of activity must be used as we 
progress to face the challenges of the 21st century. That is why we 
must keep up the momentum toward our global goal of the 
universality of women's human rights, for they are inalienable, 
integral and indivisible.
<P>
	The government has approved a plan of action to ensure that 
women's equality is kept on track. The federal plan for gender 
equality, equality for men and women, which was tabled prior to 
our departure for the fourth world conference on the status of 
women, deals with the real issues of the day. Those issues are 
action for the economic empowerment of women, action to support 
women entrepreneurs, action to promote employment equity so 
women can have a fair chance at the jobs of today. These measures 
and others, along with social support systems, can help women and 
their families rise out of poverty.
<P>
	Make no mistake, the family is the basic unit of society and must 
be supported in all its forms. We need healthy, vital families and 
women's economic independence. That can help. It can allow 
women to escape domestic violence. There is a direct link between 
economic independence and violence. That is just one reason why 
we will continue to work on eliminating the violence that limits 
women's ability to participate in and contribute to society. We have 
taken measures such as stricter firearms control, a new 
anti-stalking law, federal subsidies for shelters for battered women.
<P>
	Economic empowerment means recognizing and valuing the 
important role of women's unpaid work as homemakers, as 
caregivers, as volunteers, as those who look after the elderly. This 
work has value of great worth in our caring and sharing society.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	That is why the 1996 census will include a question on unpaid 
work.
<P>
	The federal plan also puts women at the heart of government 
decision making. It requires that every policy, program and law be 
developed with the impacts on women, as well as men, in mind. Let 
us not forget that women represent half of Canadian society. We are 
not a society of special interests but a society built by both men and 
women over two centuries.
<P>
	We also have a global plan: the platform for action on women's 
equality adopted at the recent UN World Conference on Women in 
Beijing.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15412"> 15412 </A></B>
<P>
	I am proud to say Canada played a leadership role in securing 
a strong agreement on the rights of women and girls in Beijing, 
which was signed by 189 nations attending the conference.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I am also proud to say that Canada's leadership on equality was 
recognized with two awards: a prestigious United Nations prize for 
advancing literacy, thanks to the initiatives in New Brunswick; and 
Canada was honoured with the global award for the most 
improvement in the status of women over the last decade. In 
making the award the International Federation of Business and 
Professional Women commended Canada for its steady and 
remarkable progress in advancing equality for women. This was 
acknowledged and awarded after 110 countries were carefully 
examined. Canada was not found wanting. Canada was found head 
of the pack.
<P>
	The way to the future is clear. Canadians must continue that 
progress to a true partnership between women and men. This is 
imperative as we face an increasingly complex global society.
<P>
	In closing, I want to extend my heartiest congratulations to the 
six women who were honoured today. Each of them were pioneers 
in their own way. Each of them fought against violence and fought 
for an integrated and accepting society. We owe them a great debt 
of gratitude. I extend them my best regards.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
very pleased to speak about this victory for women which my 
colleague, the hon. secretary of state, has pointed out was a 
concrete step toward equality for women. The 1929 legal victory 
was an important step in this egalitarian undertaking, I agree. It 
represented a significant milestone in terms of democracy.
<P>
	Other victories followed, as we know, perhaps less striking ones 
but equally important: women's influx into the work force; 
improved education for women; their entry into non traditional 
employment; the creation of daycare services; their presence on 
various boards, I could go on and on. Yes, Canadian women and 
Quebec women have made progress, and they must be 
congratulated and encouraged to continue.
<P>
	I shall make use of this opportunity to explain to my colleagues 
why, very soon, Quebec women will be deciding to continue their 
progress on their own. Although they have made definite progress, 
as I have said, the women of Quebec will be able to progress a little 
faster on their own, with the weight of the federalist yoke lifted 
from their shoulders.
<P>
	Quebec women will be well protected by the Quebec charter of 
human rights, which will reaffirm equality and the rights of 
women. They will continue to be well served  by the civil law 
system, under which they have equal status and equal rights with 
men.
<P>
	In a sovereign Quebec, Quebec women will be ensured of the 
survival and the dynamism of their language and culture. They will 
no longer have to worry about the survival from generation to 
generation of things I know are of concern to them: culture, 
language, education, employment. Quebec women will continue to 
progress under a democratic political regime, with an equal say in 
drafting the constitution of their new country, with their rights to 
equality reaffirmed.
<P>
	Quebec women will make even more gains under a democratic 
Quebec, within a system in which social rights will be the focus of 
the state's actions. They will benefit from a family policy focused 
on their needs and those of their children, a policy free of the 
constraints imposed by the present federal system, which makes 
policy harmonization impossible.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Finestone:</B> Really!
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Gagnon (Québec):</B> Please, madam secretary of state.
<P>
	In a sovereign Quebec, free of Ottawa's centralizing goals, 
women will clearly benefit from a policy of full employment 
coupled with a social policy that reflects the effect of their 
participation in the working world. I am talking here of policy on 
child care, working conditions in keeping with family 
responsibilities and employment equity. Where are the daycare 
places so long promised by the federal government? They were 
promised, and we are still waiting. Yet we are paying the federal 
government to have these places created.
<P>
	Quebec women will have the advantage of a unique system of 
manpower planning and training. They will have the benefit of a 
system that is decentralized in favour of the regions, the prime 
sources of human and business activity.
<P>
	Finally, Quebec women will move far beyond the endless battles 
and constitutional red tape and will focus their energies on 
improving the quality of their life, that of their children, their 
husband and their fellow Quebecers. This was the request of the 
participants in the women's march on poverty, last June's bread and 
roses march, which was undertaken on behalf of all Quebec 
women. This is what the Government of Quebec is proposing and is 
committed to promoting.
<P>
	In conclusion, Quebec women will quicken their step toward 
equality by dropping a level of government, which is preparing to 
sacrifice them on the altar of economics and which is preparing to 
impose cuts on their old age pension and unemployment insurance 
cheques, by tying these benefits to the family salary in the new 
reform of social programs. They will drop a level of government 
that is useless, costly and more concerned about the interests of 
major corporations than about the grocery bill of single parent 
families.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15413"> 15413 </A></B>
<P>
	I am appealing here to Quebec women's common sense and 
administrative talents to get them to realize that savings are 
possible by eliminating overlap and duplication.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	It is by taking control of their own destiny, by becoming 
self-sufficient that Quebecers, like Quebec, will grow from now on, 
in friendship with their Canadian sisters and without forgetting the 
progress that has already been made. There is, however, much more 
to be done in this area, and I think that the federal government 
should first deal with women's economic equality.
<P>
	Women in the public service still earn only 70 per cent of what 
men make. Something must be done, and I urge the government to 
move from rhetoric to action.
<P>
	It is said that women's economic independence is important and 
could reduce violence against them. I call on the government to 
take measures to ensure that women are paid as much as men for 
doing the same work. I urge the government to think about the 
action plan for gender equality.
<P>
	The study the minister referred to earlier, the federal plan, puts 
women at the heart of government decision making. This plan 
requires that every policy, program and law be developed with the 
impacts on women, as well as men, in mind.
<P>
	I exhort the government to be very vigilant regarding the reforms 
contemplated by the Minister of Human Resources Development, 
for example, cutting UI and old age pension benefits and setting 
women's benefits on the basis of family income. We know full well 
that benefits are often based on men's higher wages, and we fought 
against this.
<P>
	What does this mean for a woman who receives her first old age 
pension cheque at 65 and whose husband earns a certain salary? It 
is often the first cheque these women have ever received. This 
cheque also represents economic independence, a little bit of 
economic independence for women.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
indeed a pleasure to rise in the House today to recognize and 
commemorate the Persons case from 1921, especially in the midst 
of great parliamentary diversity of opinion and focus as we speak 
today.
<P>
	I would like to first congratulate all of the women today who 
received Governor General's awards: Marthe Asselin Vaillancourt, 
Dr. Mary Cohen, Ruth Flowers, Sheila Kingham, Carolyn Thomas, 
and Alice Taylor, who are all being recognized for their efforts 
toward making Canada a place in which all are treated equally. 
These women stand for everything that has gone right in Canadian 
history.
<P>
	Look at the progress that has been made in Canadian society 
since 1929 when women received the right to vote. Today I refer 
and indeed also defer to those five Albertans, women all, who 
challenged successfully the convention of their day to bring the 
vote to women.
<P>
	The secretary of state briefly mentioned the importance of 
family in society. This is a message that is sometimes forgotten or 
passed over when we are caught up in the singular focus of 
women's issues. As a party we affirm the value and dignity of the 
individual person and the importance of strengthening and 
protecting the family unit as essential to the well-being of 
individuals and society. Hopefully, this is a principle about which 
we may all agree, because once we have agreement we will have a 
fundamental basis from which to move forward.
<P>
	We constantly hear comments and stories about women doing 
things differently and having different approaches to 
communicating. This is true, and perhaps more so for the women 
we recognize today as they receive the Governor General's award 
for their contributions to society.
<P>
	Let us also look to history and in particular to Agnes Macphail 
and Nellie McClung, extraordinary women indeed. They broke 
ground for women today and they did it because they were focused, 
had strong convictions, and they also had a creative edge to bring 
their point home.
<P>
	These women of the early suffrage movement had a sense of 
humour, were thoughtful in their world view, and for the most part 
could handle themselves well in difficult situations. For example, 
at a rally held in 1915 a heckler yelled at Nellie McClung: ``The 
Prime Minister would quit politics if a woman were ever elected''. 
Well, Nellie did not wilt. Instead, she replied: ``This proves what a 
purifying effect a woman would have on politics''.
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	McClung was no shrinking violet. She was fair minded, good 
humoured, and determined. These qualities typify Canadians and 
also my colleague from Yukon who was honoured by the House 
today.
<P>
	We still need to work to guarantee equal opportunity for all. We 
may disagree on the quality of outcome, but whether we agree or 
not, when we as women engage in debate we must still struggle to 
relay our message.
<P>
	McClung staged demonstrations to make her point in her time. 
In recent memory, one member of this House is said to have hiked 
up her skirts and jumped over a desk to make her point. Another 
member, this member, sat on the hood of a sports car to make hers. 
John Crosbie and the modern feminist movement are still shaking 
their heads.
<P>
	Let us look at Agnes Macphail. When she first entered the House 
of Commons as Canada's first woman MP in 1921, a Commons 
employee tried to stop her at the door  of the Chamber. She entered 
anyway, while he shouted, ``You can't go in there, Miss''. Once 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15414"> 15414 </A></B>
<P>
inside, Macphail was touched to find a bouquet of roses waiting on 
her desk, but was humiliated later to learn that they were the 
penalty a male MP paid for betting she would lose the election in 
her Ontario riding.
<P>
	Since women were given the vote in 1929, tremendous 
advancements have been made. Some of them have come 
amazingly late, but still we achieve. We have gone through periods 
when women and men toiled apart as changes occurred. We are 
finally coming to a place where we recognize that men and women 
together and as equals can create the kind of country we all want to 
live in.
<P>
	I would like to extend again my congratulations to all the 
recipients of the Governor General's awards today.

Speaker, pursuant to Standing Order 36, I am pleased to present a 
petition from my riding of Prince George-Bulkley Valley that 
deals with an opinion and a belief that is shared by a majority of 
Canadians right across this country. It deals with the fear that the 
privileges society extends to heterosexual couples could some day 
be extended to same sex relationships.
<P>
	The petitioners pray and request that Parliament not amend the 
human rights code, the Canadian Human Rights Act or the charter 
of rights and freedoms in any way that would tend to indicate 
societal approval of same sex relationships or of homosexuality, 
including amending the human rights code to include in the

Question No. 193-<B>Mr. Hanger:</B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>What was, in fiscal year 1994-95, the total cost to the Department of Health of 
providing health care to claimants of refugee status in Canada; what was the 
projected amount for this line of spending in the 1994-95 estimates or 
supplementary estimates; and how does the Department of Health expect to 
cover any shortfall resulting from refugee health spending overruns?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> It should be first mentioned that as a result of 
a memorandum of understanding between the former departments 
of National Health and Welfare and Employment and Immigration 
Canada signed on March 1, 1993, resources relating to the interim 
federal health, IFH, program, formerly the non-insured health 
benefits, NIHB, program were transferred to Citizenship and 
Immigration Canada, CIC, from Health Canada, HC, effective 
commencing in 1993-94. It was also agreed at that time that HC 
would continue to deliver the program on the department's behalf. 
Subsequently, CIC assumed responsibility for the delivery of the 
IFH program on April 1, 1995.
<P>
	In fiscal year 1994-95, under the interim federal health program, 
Citizenship and Immigration Canada spent $7.1 million in 
providing health care services, mainly to refugee claimants across 
Canada. Until January 1, 1995, Ontario was the only province 
which provided health care coverage to refugee claimants. As a 
result of the recent decision of the Ontario government no longer to 
provide health care coverage to refugee claimants and given that, 
starting April 1, 1995, only emergency/essential services will now 
be provided under the IFH program, it is estimated that total 
program costs will increase by $15.0 million for a total of $22.5 
million in program spending in 1995-96. This level of spending is 
expected to continue in future years.
<P>
	Pending Treasury Board approval, additional program funding 
will be obtained through the supplementary estimates process as a 
result of Ontario de-insurance of refugee claimants. Specifically, 
the department's 1995-96 reference levels will be increased by an 
amount of $15.0 million as will the future years' reference levels.
<P>
	The projected amount for this line of spending in the 1994-95 
main estimates and supplementary estimates was $7.5 million.
<P>
	At present, in light of CIC's additional appropriations as a result 
of Ontario de-insurance, no shortfall exists within program 
funding. Should costs exceed available funding due to an increased 
number of program beneficiaries and the health status of these 
persons or as a result of amendments to provincial fee tariffs upon 
which IFH payments are based, it is planned that additional 
resources will be obtained through the estimates process.

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="EMPLOYMENTEQUITYACT">EMPLOYMENT EQUITY ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-64, 
an act respecting employment equity, be read the third time and 
passed.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Finestone (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism) 
(Status of Women), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, Bill C-64, the new 
employment equity act, was designed to resolve longstanding 
problems with the existing legislation and meet our government's 
red book commitments. It is part of the government's work toward 
achieving an open and inclusive society.
<P>
	The legislation reflects the values of the government. It reflects 
the values of respect and understanding. The legislation is about 
fairness. It is about providing an equal playing field. Above all, the 
legislation is about making sure that all self-identified, qualified 
Canadians have a fair chance to compete for federal public sector 
jobs based on their merit.
<P>
	The legislation continues to cover a total of 350 private sector 
employers and crown corporations that operate in federally 
regulated industries such as banking, communications and 
transporta-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15416"> 15416 </A></B>
<P>
tion. The legislation  expands coverage of the employment equity 
act to the public service immediately. It also includes the Canadian 
Armed Forces and the RCMP.
<P>
	There are four designated groups which continue to be 
designated: aboriginal peoples, members of visible minorities, 
women and persons with disabilities. The principle of self- 
identification is reaffirmed and definitions of the groups are in the 
legislation.
<P>
	The legislation carries enforcement measures. It ensures that the 
Canadian Human Rights Commission has the mandate to conduct 
on site compliance reviews. It also confirms the administrative 
responsibility for the federal contractors program to the Minister of 
Human Resources Development. It makes use of the Canadian 
Human Rights Tribunal which when hearing employment equity 
complaint cases will be called the employment equity review 
tribunal. This body will hear appeals from employers and referrals 
from the CHRC and ensure the final enforcement of the act.
<P>
	With regard to the designated groups under the legislation they 
continue to be under represented as well as under valued in federal 
agencies and in federally regulated industries.
<P>
	A recent study conducted by Krishna Pendakur of Simon Fraser 
University and Ravi Pendakur entitled ``Earning differentials 
among ethnic groups in Canada'' found that similarly qualified 
Canadian born visible minorities earn about 11 per cent less than 
Canadian born white people and that immigrant visible minorities 
earn 15 per cent less than Canadian born whites.
<P>
<B>(1605 )</B>
<P>
	We are also familiar with the term glass ceiling, barriers to upper 
level management faced by many women and minorities in 
companies and agencies. This issue is addressed in applying more 
effective employment equity legislation.
<P>
	We also found through partnership with the Canadian 
Advertising Foundation, the Asia-Pacific Foundation and the 
Conference Board of Canada that being sensitive and responsive to 
diversity is good for business. It makes economic sense and it is the 
fair thing to do. Companies that are sensitive to the diversity of the 
reality of Canada, that is the Canadian population, and companies 
that have made a commitment from the top down that they will be 
reflective of the people of this land have the key to the future: 
economic security. This is real at the local, national and 
international level.
<P>
	Fairer access, meritorious advancement and equality of 
opportunity are key for all corporations that want to compete in the 
global marketplace. Our Canadian people often reflect and know 
the cultures of the new global markets. Why not use our diversity 
as a valued competitive edge to our mutual benefit? Global 
business is multicultural, multilingual and multiracial. Anyone  
travelling would know that; anyone in international business knows 
that.
<P>
	Applying the rule of self-identified employment equity laws is 
an important tool to effect real institutional change, which is in the 
best interest of all Canadians and is an incentive for people to 
self-identify or to identify themselves.
<P>
	This is a bill with a heart, one that recognizes the reality of 
Canadian business life. It clarifies existing obligations and helps to 
widen the circle of inclusion in our workforce at all levels. It does 
not force employers to create new positions, require the hiring or 
promoting of unqualified individuals, or contradict the merit 
principle in the public sector. It is about fairness and merit. It 
would be worthwhile if members opposite would keep all these 
issues in mind when speaking to this matter and tell the truth about 
what is in the bill.
<P>
	It is about fairness and merit. It is about quality, not quantity. 
The bill does not call for nor is it about quotas for non-qualified 
members of designated groups.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Since the bill on employment equity was tabled for first reading, 
the members of the Reform Party have had a great deal to say about 
it.
<P>
	In fact, it would be more accurate to state that they have had a 
great deal to say against it. They are rejecting the bill and the 
reason for their rejection is either that they are against measures in 
favour of employment equity or that they do not grasp the nature 
and scope of this bill.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Hon. members must recognize that this will simply not happen 
by crossing our fingers and hoping that we will achieve our goals of 
access, equity, fairness and a starting chance for self-identified 
minorities who wish to have consideration and to be included in the 
enlarged circle of the family of Canada.
<P>
	In order to reach this goal some of the CHRC's responsibilities 
are education, awareness and sensitization to our multicultural 
reality. It will enable companies touched by this law to effect 
institutional change over time. We broadened the circle of 
representation through encouragement and education rather than 
through coercion. We do it because it is the right thing to do for 
Canada's qualified population by addressing whatever systemic 
barriers may be present that inhibit the representation of our 
diversity.
<P>
	Before I close I highlight the Bank of Montreal as an example of 
a corporation that has demonstrated its commitment to create both 
an equitable workplace and a workforce that reflects the 
community it serves and a leadership that believes in fairness and a 
widened circle of service to the grassroots, the people they want to 
do business with.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15417"> 15417 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1610 )</B>
<P>
	It has published a report of its task force on the advancement of 
visible minorities. I would recommend close reading of the report. 
The main purpose was to identify barriers to advancement faced by 
members of visible minorities who were in business by the way and 
were earning well, and to develop action plans to eliminate those 
barriers for further upward mobility.
<P>
	The task force recommended that the bank refine its workforce 
planning process to foster a workforce that reflects the diversity of 
the community at all levels. It recommended increased 
participation of visible minorities in leadership roles and the 
removal of barriers to the advancement of these persons and all 
other employees. It recommended the bank take action to further 
enable employees to take charge of their own career advancement 
and to increase competency based on non-subjective candidate 
selection. Its final recommendation was to enable employees from 
all backgrounds to develop the knowledge, skills, attitudes and 
behaviour critical to success in a diverse workforce.
<P>
	When one wants to look at employment equity and when one 
wants to examine the fairness of the approach in the bill, the 
self-identification, the reality of who we are as a people, the 
greatness of our diversity and the differences from place to place 
across the land, it makes more and more sense that more and more 
Canadians will want to report origins other than British or French 
because that is who we are. Most of us have origins different from 
British or French.
<P>
	The legislation will help set a framework within which all 
Canadians will have a fair and equal chance to participate in the 
economic prosperity of our country and in which all Canadians 
have an interest and a purpose to participate.
<P>
	I wholly support the legislation. I hope all members of the House 
join me in ensuring a truly just, fair, equitable and prosperous 
society, one with which Canada can continue to be the world model 
it is today.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
my pleasure to address the House on a topic that has thus far 
provoked spirited discussion.
<P>
	As its preamble states, Bill C-64, an act respecting employment 
equity, was introduced by the government with the intention of 
achieving equality in the workplace and amending the 
disadvantages experienced by certain groups.
<P>
	Underlying the bill is an approach to equality which suggests we 
measure success in terms of results or outcomes. Herein lies a 
difference in definition as we disagree on the bill. There are two 
opposing ideologies in the debate: one focused on equality as a 
process and the other on equality as an outcome.
<P>
	Process people of which I am one direct their energies to the 
supply side. They encourage people to train and educate, to deal 
with values and habits, to promote an open environment where 
specialization is fostered, to reward merit and to reject 
discrimination on the basis of extraneous factors. Process people 
accept the results of a world operating in this fashion, one where 
the outcome is not predetermined but where individuals have the 
capacity to manufacture their future. Process people believe in 
remedial action but choose to limit their response to those truly in 
need.
<P>
	Outcome people, such as those who support the bill, are not 
satisfied with creating equal opportunities for this is not enough. 
They prefer to manipulate a process, to consciously intervene and 
to create the results they believe are justified. They construct laws 
to ensure their overt interventions are safeguarded against legal 
challenges. The government has already done this, providing a 
constitutional guarantee that the principle of equality can be 
supplanted for intrusive and sometimes coercive state goals. I am 
speaking to section 15.2 of the charter which rejects in plain 
language the brave assertion of its companion clause 15.1 
guaranteeing to all Canadians equal treatment before the law.
<P>
	The question of defining equality lies at the heart of this debate, I 
believe. Unlike the equality of outcome as described in Bill C-64, 
the equality of opportunity nurtures an environment where 
outcomes are predetermined, allowing society to reward enterprise 
and initiatives. Opportunity is the cornerstone of a prosperous, 
creative and thriving culture. It provides a foundation for personal 
fulfilment and self-actualization. Most important, it enables people 
to believe in themselves in the sense that they alone control their 
destiny.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	Bill C-64 corrupts this conceptualization of opportunity by 
placing a higher premium on premeditated intervention to fashion 
outcomes. This wounds all Canadians and cannot be supported.
<P>
	Let us focus on the goals of employment equity for a moment. 
The very goals on which this legislation is premised are flawed, 
confused and contradictory. Notions of equality, numerical targets 
and diversity are fraught with problems. Bill C-64 offers equality 
for some at the expense of others. Numerical targets are flawed by 
their very design. Establishing targets obscures numerical goals 
with the idea of equality.
<P>
	There is a substantial difference between recognizing that certain 
groups have encountered historical barriers and assuming that all 
social inequalities are attributable to discrimination.
<P>
	We must ask ourselves whether men and women would fill 
occupations in equal numbers in a world of perfectly free choice. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15418"> 15418 </A></B>
<P>
The answer is probably not.  Similarly, would ethnic minorities 
appear equally in all work environments? Again, most likely no. A 
numbers game simply circumscribes choice and counters any 
notion of equity.
<P>
	Searching for the ideal of diversity is yet another confused goal. 
Does anybody know what diversity in this context really means? 
As someone aptly suggested, it merely reflects a language of willed 
ignorance in which the words mean only that the speaker has good 
intentions.
<P>
	How can we even begin to consider seriously such legislation 
when its foundation is constructed on such faulty principles? There 
is a serious danger in beginning a task when its objectives are 
distorted by contradiction and imperfection. If I measure a value 
and our sense of direction is unclear our efforts will surely be 
wasted.
<P>
	Another concern relates to the basic question of whether a need 
for employment equity exists at all. Evidence has surfaced in recent 
years which calls into question the reasons on which employment 
equity is based. By making reference to this evidence it is not my 
intention to disavow the existence of racism and discrimination. 
Instead I wish to make clear that discrimination and gender alone 
are not enough to explain the vastly dissimilar outcomes different 
groups experience in the course of their lives. Culture, religion and 
family patterns are other reasons which keep people out of certain 
occupations.
<P>
	For example, economist Thomas Sowell found that teen 
marriages are more prevalent in certain ethnic populations. He 
maintains that women who marry at very young ages do not pursue 
post-secondary education and therefore limit the range of jobs for 
which they might qualify. The answer then is not numerical goals 
and timetables but one of culture and education.
<P>
	Recent data from a 1995 Statistics Canada study reinforced these 
ideas further. While it was found that visible minorities were less 
likely than any other Canadian to be employed in managerial 
occupations, most likely explained by the fact that they are on 
average younger than other adults, members of visible minorities 
were as likely as other Canadians to be employed in professional 
occupations. In essence the report is confirming that at all levels of 
the economy visible minorities enjoy rates of employment 
comparable to those of other Canadians.
<P>
	How then do we justify Bill C-64? Like other employment 
equity legislation it treats members of visible minorities of 
homogeneous groups having the same character, composition and 
history. This is fundamentally wrong. For example, data reveal that 
13 per cent and 19 per cent of Japanese Canadians are employed in 
managerial and professional categories respectively, while only 8 
per cent and 9 per cent are found in manual and service categories. 
This type of breakdown will necessarily be different when 
compared  with the experience of Filipinos and East Indians for 
example. All groups are different with compelling reasons 
explaining their variable representation in the workplace.
<P>
	Are there alternatives to employment equity? There is 
considerable evidence to suggest policy alternatives based on 
equality of opportunity do exist. Many are already an entrenched 
feature of the Canadian work world. The systemic discrimination 
found in many areas of an organization's structure suggest we can 
approach problems without the use of quotas. For example, we can 
do more as federal legislators to foster equitable hiring in both 
public and private sectors through the improvement of education 
which includes special training programs for target groups, 
academic upgrading, pre-apprenticeship programs, training of all 
staff in cross cultural awareness to promote a positive working 
environment.
<P>
<B>(1620 )</B>
<P>
	We can look at dismantling systemic barriers, which would 
include policies promoting flexible hours which can be of 
particular benefit to women with young children, people with 
disabilities who need special transportation systems and workers 
whose religious requirements may conflict with typical hours of 
work, and support measures dealing with employment problems 
including daycare facilities and revised rules for parental leave.
<P>
	We can emphasize individual achievement so that an 
individual's training, performance and knowledge, skills and 
ability are considered paramount in all workplace decisions.
<P>
	My remarks have addressed equality of opportunity, the 
confused goals of Bill C-64 and the question of need, highlighting 
the inherent problems with employment equity and Bill C-64. 
Social democrats have historically sought to forge links across race 
and gender lines in pursuit of a common citizenship with equal 
rights.
<P>
	In contrast, the government's policies reinforce the notion that 
the interests of males and females and diverse ethnic groups are 
distinctive and competitive. Does Bill C-64 really lead us toward 
the better society to which we aspire? I think not.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I wish to inform the House that because 
of the ministerial statement, Government Orders will be extended 
today by 20 minutes.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Beryl Gaffney (Nepean, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is my 
pleasure to address Bill C-64.
<P>
	While listening in the House today I worry that some of the 
members opposite have not really understood the vision for Canada 
or the intent of the bill.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15419"> 15419 </A></B>
<P>
	I have followed with great interest the developments in 
employment equity over the years and it is my contention that 
employment equity is a fundamental building block for creating 
a better Canada.
<P>
	Bill C-64 went before the Standing Committee on Human Rights 
and the Status of Disabled Persons. This committee heard from a 
very broad section of witnesses and in its report endorsed the new 
features of Bill C-64 and recommended additional amendments. 
The act covers all federally regulated companies with 100 or more 
employees. Bill C-64 will bring the federal public service, its 
departments, agencies, boards and commissions, into line with 
standards already set for federally regulated corporations.
<P>
	The changes Liberals will implement to strengthen the 
Employment Equity Act include the federal public service and 
federal agencies and commission under the Employment Equity 
Act. We will also give the Canadian Human Rights Commission 
the legislative authority to initiate investigations of employment 
equity issues.
<P>
	Efforts to eradicate discrimination in the workplace and in hiring 
practices have been underway at the federal level since the 
enactment of the 1970s human rights legislation. In 1993 it became 
evident to the Liberal government of the day that voluntary 
measures toward achieving equity in the workplace were failing to 
bring about significant changes for women, aboriginal peoples, 
visible minorities and persons with disabilities. That is the key 
because they tried to achieve it through voluntary measures and it 
did not work.
<P>
	On December 12, 1994 the human resources minister tabled in 
the House Bill C-64. He stated: ``This initiative is a significant step 
toward ensuring equitable employment opportunities for women, 
aboriginal peoples, persons with disabilities and members of 
visible minorities''.
<P>
	Most of us come into the House with a prepared speech, but 
sitting in my office and watching the TV monitor I heard so many 
nefarious statements from across the floor that I am going away 
from my prepared notes to address some of the things that were 
said. One that concerned me was with regard to quotas.
<P>
	The bill is not about quotas. They kept referring to the charter of 
rights and freedoms and quoting it. The bill is certainly not in 
conflict with what is being said in the charter of rights and 
freedoms.
<P>
	The merit principle in the bill should be and is the sole basis of 
hiring. I think anyone who sees anything different within the bill is 
really not understanding what is being said.
<P>
	I refer to the member from Beaver River, who went on at great 
length saying she is a woman in the House and she came here 
because she is competitive and because of competence. I do not 
argue that point at all. I would like to think I got here that way as 
well.
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
	One works hard, does as one has to do, does the same as anybody 
else running for public office and gets elected. What about all the 
people who want to run for public office who are just as competent 
as I am? Maybe this is what the feminist movement is all about, I 
do not know. Is it not my responsibility to assist if I see someone 
who would make a wonderful member of the House of Commons? 
If that person is competent, has the merit and a reason to be here 
and yet does not have the confidence to project himself or herself 
on the floor of the House of Commons, does that person not 
deserve some assistance from someone? I say they do. I am using 
this in simplistic language to point out not everybody has the 
competence to get into the House of Commons.
<P>
	Getting back to strong women, I want to relate a story in my life 
before I became an elected official. I was an elected official for 10 
years before I came to the House of Commons. Working in an 
administrative capacity I applied for a position within my 
organization. I did not get the position. The human resources 
person said to me: ``You are more qualified than the person who is 
getting the job. You have longer service than the person who is 
getting the job but we must give it to him because he has a wife and 
two children''.
<P>
	I had a husband and five children and I could not understand the 
reason the job was being given to him over me. There was no valid 
reason why he should get the job. Let us consider a visible 
minority. In that same organization I was asked by the human 
resources director to short list the people who were applying for 
jobs in the department I was in. I gave my list of three people. One 
was a Jamaican woman. The director's comment to me was: ``I am 
not sure whether our organization is ready for a black woman''. 
That is why we need to offer our assistance and our support for this.
<P>
	That was not too long ago. I have not been here forever. We have 
come a long way. We have all had examples in our lives of being 
held down or held back for the wrong reasons.
<P>
	Somebody from the other side of the House had said that white 
young males will rise up in anger. My goodness, white young 
women or black young women or whomever should have been 
rising up in anger for years and years and never did until now. It is 
about time they did.
<P>
	I sat on the committee on human rights and the status of disabled 
persons. We heard from people with disabilities about how their 
rights are constantly being violated. I will tell a little story about a 
Saskatchewan farmer.
<P>
	This farmer had lost both his arms in a farming accident. He had 
prostheses from the elbows down on both arms. He relied on his 
son and his wife to help with the farming. When he appeared before 
the committee he  said: ``When I buy a huge harvesting machine I 
have to pay about $60,000 more for this machine than what my able 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15420"> 15420 </A></B>
<P>
bodied neighbour has to pay because I need to have equipment that 
my two prostheses can handle''. Is that fair?
<P>
	That man was in business and he was being discriminated 
against through the cost of the machine because he had two 
artificial arms. That man needs our help. We should offer him our 
help. I love telling all these little stories but I sure have strayed 
away from my speech.
<P>
	Canada today is a very different society than it was 50 or even 20 
years ago. Today we as women want and need to look after 
ourselves financially. At the same time we want to know those who 
cannot are being treated equally. Our aboriginal peoples are 
demanding self-determination and persons with disabilities want to 
be fully integrated throughout society. New Canadians want to 
fully participate in all aspects of Canadian society.
<P>
<B>(1630 )</B>
<P>
	Canada is a changed society, one where these four groups are 
expressing specific needs that must be addressed. It is a society that 
requires the contribution of all our citizens and this piece of 
legislation addresses this changed society.
<P>
	It is through employment equity that we will ensure that the 
skills and abilities of all Canadians will be fully utilized. It is 
through employment equity that we will one day eliminate the 
social and economic costs of marginalizing big numbers of 
Canadians. By ensuring that these four groups take their rightful 
place in the Canadian labour force, a more vibrant and productive 
society will emerge.
<P>
	This bill will lead us toward a fair and just society by making us 
examine our assumptions of what is the right way to do business. It 
will make us question hiring procedures that have in the past 
always found qualified individuals for the job. I will give you an 
example of where it does not always work.
<P>
	It will lead us there by teaching us through awareness training to 
feel what it is like to be excluded from the workplace simply 
because your disability stops you from getting up the stairs to the 
work site.
<P>
	It will lead us there by encouraging us to make accommodations 
for mothers and fathers who take the needed time from work to 
look after their youngsters. It will lead us there by teaching us that 
those people whom we thought would be difficult to manage are 
many of our most valuable employees.
<P>
	For this reason I encourage all members of the House to vote 
with a resounding yes for this legislation, a resounding yes to a 
better nation.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Colleagues, I would ask you please to put 
your remarks to the Chair. The Chair feels very lonely often in 
some of the debates that go on.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak to Bill C-64. I want to preface my 
remarks by making a comment on behalf of all the members of the 
Reform Party. We do not support in any way, shape or form 
discriminatory hiring practices. We do not support the premise that 
a person from one of the four groups mentioned in Bill C-64 be 
denied a job based on the fact that he or she is within one of these 
four groups. To have some of the previous speakers of the Liberal 
Party allude to that is utter nonsense.
<P>
	At the same time, I do not support and I know many of my 
colleagues do not support the fact that someone would be hired 
specifically because he or she is part of one of those four groups. 
Let us be very clear about what the Reform members are trying to 
say in the House today.
<P>
	I was really pleased that I was present today when we saw Ms. 
Alexa McDonough presented to the Chamber today. She was just 
elected president of the New Democratic Party, not because she 
was a woman but because she had the confidence of the delegates 
of the NDP convention that she was the best person for the job. I 
congratulate her for that.
<P>
	We heard today in the House from the hon. member for 
Edmonton-Strathcona about a Mrs. Chicoine who was awarded a 
Canada Volunteer Award Certificate of Merit not because she was a 
woman but because of the efforts that she put into doing the things 
that she truly believed in.
<P>
	We heard earlier today from a member opposite about a woman 
who had just received an entrepreneurship award of merit in an 
international competition for a process that she created and 
developed regarding the use of furs. She did not receive this award 
because she was a woman. She received it because of the creativity, 
the training and the work she put into her business.
<P>
<B>(1635 )</B>
<P>
	We heard about the women from Alberta who were honoured 
today in Ottawa for their service to their country. They were 
honoured, not because they are women but because they believed 
so passionately in something that they readied themselves for the 
task and they succeeded. They succeeded not because they were 
women but because they wanted to succeed.
<P>
	If the principles of Bill C-64 were applied to the women who 
were honoured today in the House, they might very easily find it 
insulting. There could be the allusion that they received these 
awards or accomplished their tasks simply because they were 
women and not because of their own individual efforts.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15421"> 15421 </A></B>
<P>
	All members in the House, including Liberal members even 
though they will not admit it, are aware that Bill C-64 will impose 
employment equity provisions on the public service and on those 
firms that have over 100 employees and do business with the 
federal government. I use the word ``impose''. They use the term 
``employment equity''. The term ``employment equity'' was 
coined by Justice Rosalie Abella in 1984. It is a convenient term 
for our Liberal social engineers since it is much more deceptive 
and less threatening than the term ``affirmative action''.
<P>
	In the United States people call it like it is, affirmative action. 
That is exactly what employment equity really is but it is called 
employment equity to make it a less threatening term.
<P>
	We are all aware that affirmative action or employment equity, 
whatever one you choose, is not working in the United States. 
Recently the U.S. Supreme Court dealt affirmative action a severe 
blow. It ruled in favour of a Colorado company that brought an 
action against the U.S. government because the government had 
awarded a contract to an Hispanic controlled company despite the 
fact that the Colorado company submitted a lower bid and was 
more qualified to do the work. This was because of affirmative 
action or employment equity. Naturally the U.S. government's 
rationale for taking such a course of action was rooted in its 
affirmative action policy.
<P>
	While this recent decision in the states does not spell the end of 
affirmative action in the U.S., I and those who believe employment 
would be better based on merit would hope that it signals a return 
some day to common sense and fairness.
<P>
	The Americans have gone through the process and have 
experienced the detrimental effects of affirmative action policies. 
Here we are in Canada, with a Liberal government that is hell bent 
on pursuing it. Do we not learn from the experiences of other 
countries?
<P>
	We cannot even find common sense and fairness in our 
Constitution. Section 15.2 of the charter of rights and freedoms 
entrenches employment equity in the Constitution. However, if we 
read the section we note that it specifically overrides section 15.1, 
which is intended to promote equality among all Canadians.
<P>
	The charter of 1982 is drafted in typical Liberal fashion. It 
promises something but only if the state can have absolute control 
over it. That is a scary thought. Promise equality but deliver on the 
promise only when the state decides where and when equality will 
exist. Is that not a scary thought, that the state will decide where 
and when equality will exist? This is the effect of section 15.2 of 
the charter.
<P>
	Now we are facing Bill C-64, a manifestation of section 15.2, a 
bill which arbitrarily discriminates against one group in favour of 
another. However, these Liberals will  tell us that discrimination 
will not result from this bill. Just because some groups are being 
promoted over other groups is not discrimination. It is equity. That 
is the Liberal's definition of the word equity. Their social 
engineer's vocabulary does not end there. It goes much further. The 
Liberals argue that Bill C-64 will not set quotas but rather numeric 
goals.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	As David Frum wrote recently, speaking of numeric goals and 
deceptive wording: ``It is also true that undertakers say casket 
instead of coffin and loved one instead of corpse. Does it make 
Aunt Tilly any less dead by changing the words around so that they 
sound a little less threatening?''
<P>
	We must ask if we really need Bill C-64. Where is this 
systematic discrimination that is constantly referred to by the 
proponents of employment equity Bill C-64? Where is the proof? 
Where are the statistics and hard numbers? There are none. In fact 
the Economic Council of Canada, which I am sure the Liberals 
recognize as a respectable body, did studies in 1991 and 1992 
which found Canada successfully assimilates its newcomers and 
that there was no evidence of systematic pay discrimination. 
Furthermore, a Statistics Canada report this summer demonstrated 
that visible minorities enjoy rates of employment and rates of pay 
comparable to that of other Canadians.
<P>
	Therefore, we ask where is the proof. Systematic discrimination 
is in no way entrenched in the Canadian workplace as these Liberal 
social engineers would have us believe. Indeed, in pushing Bill 
C-64 without any hard evidence to back it up, it seems that the 
Liberal government and its special interest group cohorts that 
helped it get elected, would declare Canadian firms simply guilty 
by accusation.
<P>
	I forget that these Liberal members have proven that they know 
little about law and order. Therefore, such concepts as innocent 
until proven guilty would simply mean nothing to them.
<P>
	Ultimately, employment equity or affirmation action as it is 
more correctly known, is in fact a lose-lose situation. People who 
have become victims of employment equity legislation demand 
that it be scrapped and merit be returned as the sole principle for 
hiring and promotion.
<P>
	Typical of the government, it tends to march to the beat of a ``we 
know what is better for you'' attitude, in economic, judicial and 
social matters and therefore it will continue to dictate to us. This 
Liberal government and Liberal governments for the past 30 years 
have been intent in getting in the face of free and independent 
Canadians. I say Bill C-64 is another attempt to do just that. I 
therefore must oppose it.

	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It is my duty, pursuant to Standing Order 
38, to inform the House that the questions to be raised tonight at the 
time of adjournment are as follows: the hon. member for The 
Battlefords-Meadow Lake-Endangered species; the hon. 
member for Mackenzie-Agriculture.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen (Windsor-St. Clair, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to be able to speak today. I have gathered up 
some comments from the speeches of the members for Beaver 
River and Calgary Southeast and the member for the Reform Party 
who just spoke. What they have done is typical of what the Reform 
Party does in debate, particularly on this legislation. They have 
refused to either read it or, if they have read it, to acknowledge the 
actual content of the bill.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	If the bill were operating in a vacuum, if we were making no 
effort in any other area of society or in any other form of legislation 
to improve the lot of Canadians, I might oppose it as well. The bill 
is part of a package. It is part of our platform set out in our red 
book. Beyond that it is part of a package of legislation we intend to 
use to improve the lot of Canadians. By improving the lot I mean 
by making our communities healthier, economically healthier and 
safer.
<P>
	We have tried to take other steps to assist people who do not have 
the same advantage as the last speaker. We have improved our 
student loan programs so that we are offering funds to encourage 
women into areas where they have not traditionally sought training 
in the past. We have a student loan program which encourages the 
participation of persons with disabilities.
<P>
	We are revamping our social programs in order to take away the 
systemic barriers that exist for single mothers who are untrained 
and also unable to go back to work because they have no one to take 
care of their kids. We are taking a look at child care as a form of 
social program which will support our effort to get Canadians back 
to work.
<P>
	Bill C-64 is a clear example of how the Liberal Party delivers on 
its promises. In the red book we said we would strengthen the 
Employment Equity Act and that is exactly what Bill C-64 does. 
This legislation is deeply rooted in our country's conscience. In our 
Constitution every individual has ``the right to equality before and 
under the law and equal protection and benefit of the law''.
<P>
	The Reform Party in general and certainly the last speaker do not 
like the charter very much because they think protection of the 
individual should be limited, that the application of the charter 
should be narrow and that  only those they say are deserving of its 
protection should receive that protection.
<P>
	The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms specifically 
recognizes the rights of the individual and specifically recognizes 
that special programs are needed and that they are allowed in order 
to benefit those who are discriminated against in our society. That 
is what this bill addresses after all.
<P>
	At the end of the day the bill is there because there are people 
who suffer in employment today because of accidents of their birth 
or accidents of their lives, accidents like colour, race, sex, 
disability.
<P>
	We believe employment equity is about building a more caring 
and a more just society. It holds up a mirror to the fundamental 
principles that we all hold dear and it seeks to create a level playing 
field while providing practical and reasonable employment plans 
for employers.
<P>
	Employment equity was conceived under a Liberal government 
initially drawing on the work of Madam Justice Abella and her 
commission. It reflects our party's long history of commitment to 
justice and equality for all Canadians, not just for the privileged 
classes.
<P>
	Yet many insist on making the false assumption that federal 
employment equity is a carbon copy of the American affirmative 
action policy or of the Ontario bill. This was apparent in the 
comments of the last speaker and also in the comments of the 
member for Beaver River.
<P>
	These speakers claim that Americans and Ontarians are now 
rejecting legislative efforts out of hand in the area of employment 
equity. That is simply not true. Bill C-64 is not affirmative action 
U.S. style. It is not the severe imposition of regulations put forward 
in the NDP Ontario bill.
<P>
	Bill C-64 is really about fairness in the distribution of jobs. It is 
not about quotas. It is about levelling the employment playing 
field. It is not about preferential treatment. It is about fairness in 
human resources administration. It is not about complex 
regulations or greater administrative burdens for business.
<P>
	This is a made in Canada, made in Ottawa bill that has none of 
the earmarks of the anti-discrimination legislation we might find in 
other jurisdictions. It certainly does not seek as its goal to attribute 
blame or to right past wrongs.
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	Reformers like to draw parallels to the American experience, but 
our bill differs from American affirmative action bills because our 
experience and our history differ from America's in significant 
ways. Our law has none of the excesses of the American program, 
excesses like inflexible quotas for jobs, quotas on college admis-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15423"> 15423 </A></B>
<P>
sions, quotas on bidding preferences and minority  set asides in 
procurement programs. That is not what is in the bill.
<P>
	Bill C-64 is not punitive. Instead of penalizing citizens it 
encourages employers to recognize and use the largely untapped 
talents of women, persons with disabilities, aboriginal persons and 
members of visible minorities, members of the so-called special 
interest groups the prior speaker mentioned. These four designated 
groups account for 60 per cent of Canadian citizens.
<P>
	Reformers also cited the Ontario experience but they play fast 
and furious with the facts. There are no quotas in the bill. Ontario 
has a third party complaint scheme which is central to the operation 
of its bill. Ours is more like a planning document for human 
resources development.
<P>
	The Ontario bill has very broad regulatory powers which are not 
present in our bill. The threshold for being caught by the Ontario 
bill in the private sector is 50 employees. That catches 17,000 
employers in Ontario. In our bill the threshold is just over 100 
employees and catches only 350 employers. The Ontario bill 
develops new agencies and tribunals to enforce its act. Ours has no 
such new agencies.
<P>
	Just after the Ontario election an omnibus polling of businesses 
showed they have supported employment equity but not that 
particular bill. Our bill, which is on a much different model, is 
much more satisfactory.
<P>
	Another central feature of our system is our firm belief in 
flexible targets businesses can reasonably achieve. Under the bill 
the law is streamlined and clear. There is none of the complex or 
overlapping regulatory channels found in the United States, nor are 
there the tremendous regulatory burdens which one would find 
under the Ontario bill. Enforcement is streamlined, cost effective 
and relies on negotiated solutions rather than expensive litigation.
<P>
	One of the main criticisms of the other systems has been their 
adversarial nature. Bill C-64 takes a consensual approach, an 
approach of compromise; another great Canadian tradition of 
helping to bring people together to work in harmony. It is practical. 
It is well thought out. It addresses inequality in the workplace. It is 
a uniquely Canadian solution to the challenge of getting the most 
potential from our highly diverse workforce.
<P>
	What I am referring to here is the same ethos of fairness which is 
now driving many private companies to diversify their hirings. 
Some of those employers have told us how well this can work. Bob 
Sutherland, executive vice-president of Human Resources for the 
Royal Bank of Canada, said: ``The Royal Bank has undoubtedly 
benefited by gaining access to some very talented members of the 
workforce, many of whom we might not have discovered 
otherwise''.
<P>
	Dan Branda, CEO of Hewlett-Packard Canada, told a <I>Globe and 
Mail</I> reporter that diversity ``is an absolute  business imperative 
because it gives us the edge in attracting the best and brightest 
people''. Are they afraid of the employment equity bill? No.
<P>
	Employment equity is about every Canadian having the 
opportunity to know that dignity and security come with a salary. 
Most of all we are putting into practise the very values which make 
each of us proud to be a Canadian: fairness, justice and equality not 
just for a chosen few but for all Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on the 
third reading debate of Bill C-64, an act respecting employment 
equity.
<P>
	The hon. Minister of Human Resources Development has 
described the new employment equity legislation as follows: ``This 
initiative is a significant step toward ensuring equitable 
employment opportunities for women, aboriginal peoples, persons 
with disabilities and members of visible minorities''.
<P>
	The President of the Treasury Board has echoed the minister of 
HRD, suggesting the legislation is necessary to ensure equity and 
fairness in the workplace.
<P>
	I suggest this is a snow job by the Liberal government which is 
masquerading as a beacon of light when it is moving us back 
toward the dark ages.
<P>
<B>(1655 )</B>
<P>
	I suggest this because governments that have experimented with 
employment equity have found it does not work and it does not 
matter how you couch the term. It does not matter whether you say 
it is not exactly the same as the American employment equity 
program or not exactly the same as Bob Rae's legislation. The 
principle is whether it is working. It has not worked in the United 
States. It was rejected by the voters of Ontario. It was rejected even 
by the Liberal Party of Ontario.
<P>
	Meanwhile its elder brothers and sisters in Parliament are 
pushing ahead Bill C-64, a bill respecting employment equity. It 
talks about numerical targets or goals. It simply is talking about 
quotas and it is federal legislation which means it is the law of the 
land.
<P>
	It is wrong. It is draconian. It is against the will and wishes of the 
Canadian people and it is against the prevailing wisdom of those 
who have experimented with employment equity in its various 
ways, shapes and forms and who have found it does not work.
<P>
	The Liberal government has couched employment equity in 
terms that mask the true intent of the legislation. I heard the hon. 
member before me saying it is not what we think it is, it is sort of a 
wishy-washy, mishy-mushy-wushy piece of legislation.
<P>
	It is employment equity. That is what the bill is called and that is 
what we are talking about here. I wish hon. members on the other 
side would have the courage to say  they are proposing employment 
equity rather than saying it is something new that we have never 
tried that we do not really understand.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15424"> 15424 </A></B>
<P>
	The government is going about to ensure equity and fairness in 
the workplace for all Canadians? I doubt it very much. I believe it 
is imperative to provide the House with a non-biased, general 
definition of employment equity. We picked one that members on 
both sides of the House should agree is fairly accurate.
<P>
	Employment equity could be defined as results oriented actions 
that a government department or contractor by virtue of its 
contracts with the government must take to ensure equal 
employment opportunity. An employment equity program includes 
such goals as correcting underutilization and correction of problem 
areas. In addition, it may also include relief such as payback, 
retroactive seniority, make-up goals and timetables.
<P>
	I could speak on a lot of these but I want to briefly talk about the 
unprogressive manipulation this legislation includes, the goals and 
timetables the government will surely be following to implement 
and cement the numerical targets it talks about.
<P>
	This definition outlines the intent of the legislation. The Liberals 
undoubtedly have timetables to indicate that certain percentages of 
employees must be appropriate to women, aboriginal persons, 
persons with disabilities and members of visible minorities by a 
certain point. The employment equity policies can be viewed as 
results oriented, which indicates the results of proportional 
representation, regardless of qualifications, are the main focus of 
the legislation.
<P>
	The Reform Party's position on this legislation is that an 
employment equity policy is unnecessary. It is ineffective. It is 
very costly. It is unpopular. Governments lose because they have 
tried to implement employment equity. It is discriminatory. It is 
intrusive. It is harmful to designated and to non-designated groups. 
The equality of all Canadians is recognized by affirming that hiring 
and promotion should be based solely on merit rather than on 
gender, race or other distinguishing factors of that nature.
<P>
	Employment competition based on the merit principle is the key 
to both equality and productivity. The Reform Party has no qualms 
with encouraging the recruitment of qualified visible minorities 
and women through advertising and training programs. Visible 
minorities and women should then compete on a 
non-discriminatory, colour blind, gender neutral basis for jobs, 
promotions or educational positions.
<P>
	The Reform Party believes discrimination is a heinous offence 
that needs to be rooted out of our workplace. However, this will not 
be achieved through employment equity legislation being 
orchestrated by the federal government. I believe private 
companies doing contract  work with the government and 
government departments have the proper mechanisms to deal with 
discriminatory practices. Any problems not addressed by the 
company or the government department can be appealed to either 
provincial or federal human rights commissions under the human 
rights code.
<P>
	Private companies in particular have a vested interest in 
maintaining a representative workforce because it makes good 
business sense. According to Fazil Mihlar of the Fraser Institute:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The market solution of the problem as it stands is discriminatory employment 
costs firms money; therefore if an employer refuses to hire the best candidate 
for a particular job, the productivity of the discriminating employer is bound to 
fall and consequently produce less profit. The more competitive the industry, 
the less likely firms are to engage in discrimination.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1700 )</B>
<P>
	The bottom line is that companies are capable of achieving 
employment equity without governments imposing legislation.
<P>
	I could talk about the American experience. We have already 
been criticized in the House for doing that, but if time permitted I 
would.
<P>
	We did a bit of research on the breakdown of electoral success in 
the House of Commons by gender as calculated from the 1993 
federal election. The numbers are interesting and also a bit 
revealing.
<P>
	I will start with the Reform Party. We were successful in electing 
29 per cent of the female candidates our party had nominated. This 
was without any manipulation or any intervention whatsoever. We 
only elected 25 per cent of our male candidates. In other words, one 
quarter of the men who won nomination in our party were elected 
to the House. A higher percentage, 29 per cent, of the women who 
were nominated at the riding level by the Reform Party of Canada 
were successful in the 1993 federal election. This is with no 
manipulation by the leader of the party, no directives from our 
party office telling the constituencies: ``Make sure you nominate 
women. We want a lot of women nominated from our party.''
<P>
	The members of our party who selected female candidates chose 
excellent candidates who garnered the support of their constituents. 
They were more successful than the male candidates.
<P>
	If we look at the Liberal numbers, they are about even. They 
were actually a little less successful in electing female candidates 
than they were in electing male candidates. Now, as we know, the 
Liberals elected a lot more MPs to the House, so the percentage of 
successful male candidates was 60 per cent. That is why they have 
a majority government.
<P>
	With all the manipulation, with the bypassing of the constituency 
nomination process and the anointing of star female candidates, 
they elected 59 per cent of the  females, one per cent less than the 
male candidates they elected. So the wisdom of the Liberal Party 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15425"> 15425 </A></B>
<P>
hierarchy was not the same wisdom as the constituents in the 
ridings, who voted for who they felt was the best candidate.
<P>
	This indicates the whole concept of employment equity, the 
playing around with quotas and jiggering around with results not 
based on merit but based on numerical targets does not work and is 
not effective. It even hurt the Liberals in the last election.
<P>
	I see my time is running out. I want to talk about the party that 
has made the most noise about employment equity in Canada, the 
NDP. Of course, they have suggested very stringent quotas. They 
suggest that there has to be an equal number of women on their 
party councils and committees from top to bottom, inside and 
outside and around the corner.
<P>
	They had 100 female candidates and they elected one, who 
happened to be their leader, the highest profile candidate they put 
forward to the Canadian electorate. So one per cent of their females 
were elected. They did not do so well on the male side either, but 
they did elect four per cent of their male candidates. This is from a 
party that has indicated that there must be employment equity, that 
it must be legislated and written in stone.
<P>
	Instead of having the government on this side and the opposition 
on that side, they would almost want to have men on one side and 
women on the other and make sure it was equal. That is the 
approach they have taken to employment equity, and it just does 
not work. It has not worked for that party.
<P>
	Why would the Liberals, who are intelligent people and a party 
that has been around for over 100 years, want to give us Bill C-64, 
which would try to impose upon companies and government 
departments what does not work in practicality, does not even work 
in their own party, which has been a failure everywhere it has been 
tried and which is disgusting and discriminatory by its very nature 
and is demeaning to the very people it is supposed to help?
<P>
	I like to see visible minorities and female members in the House 
of Commons and in business, who are there because they are 
darned good, the best at what they do. I have a lot of respect for 
those people, whether they be black, white, yellow or red, whether 
they are male or female or whether they are handicapped in some 
way. I have a lot of respect for those people who made it on their 
own. If they are being given numerical quotas by a federal 
government and are given a position just because they happen to fit 
a certain category, it is demeaning to them.
<P>
<B>(1705 )</B>
<P>
	I suggest this government should withdraw this legislation. It is 
wrong, it is immoral, and it does not work.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am grateful for this opportunity to speak to Bill C-64, 
which would amend the current federal Employment Equity Act 
principally in the matter of introducing an enforcement regime. It 
is targeted at private sector enterprises of 100 employees or more 
that do business with the federal government. That encompasses 
hundreds and possibly thousands of private sector companies, any 
in fact who get a government contract.
<P>
	I want to speak as a government MP because I am unhappy with 
this bill. I feel it is my duty to do so, even though I am but a single 
voice perhaps among my government colleagues. I must express 
my deep, deep reservations about this legislation.
<P>
	In my view, Bill C-64 is seriously flawed. It is being rushed into 
law without the benefit of the careful consideration that is due any 
legislation that comes before this House.
<P>
	First let me say that I do not doubt the government's nobility of 
purpose and sincerity of motive in bringing Bill C-64 forward. 
Strengthening the federal employment equity legislation was a red 
book commitment made by the Liberal Party prior to the last 
general election. A government that tries to live up to its promises 
cannot be faulted for trying to do so. Indeed, being faithful to one's 
promise is something all Canadians admire and applaud. Moreover, 
who is to argue against the desire to see that all Canadians have 
equal opportunity for employment and that no one is discriminated 
against on the basis of gender, non-relevant disability, or race? The 
noble purpose is noble indeed.
<P>
	However, the fact that Bill C-64 springs from a promise is 
possibly one of the reasons it has come this far without adequate 
consideration of the huge problems it seems likely to create. It goes 
absolutely against some of the most basic concepts of justice and 
fair play, and in seeking to eradicate discrimination sets the stage 
for encouraging it.
<P>
	I have to believe-and I do-that it has come this far because the 
government bureaucrats who framed it clause by clause did so 
more with a view to satisfying the government's desire to fulfil its 
promises quickly than to writing competent legislation. I find it 
hard to believe that professionals could have drafted something so 
obviously faulty.
<P>
	I am not a lawyer, but it does not take a lawyer to see what is 
wrong with Bill C-64. Any Canadian knows the very essence of our 
democracy and our freedoms is predicated on the concepts that all 
are equal before the law and that everyone is entitled to a fair trial. 
When Bill C-64 is tested against these two principles it fails.
<P>
	Let us consider the fair trial aspect. Bill C-64 requires that the 
target employers prepare equity employment plans and give an 
accounting annually of their progress in  fulfilling these plans. I 
will spare the details, but suffice it to say that Bill C-64 describes 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15426"> 15426 </A></B>
<P>
minutely what it expects of employers when it comes to trying to 
achieve balance in the hiring of aboriginals, women, visible 
minorities, and the disabled.
<P>
	To ensure these employers are fulfilling the requirements of the 
act, Bill C-64 provides for the creation of compliance officers, a 
kind of equity police administered by the Canadian Human Rights 
Commission, who are given the power to enter a company's 
premises and demand to see its books to ensure the company does 
have an appropriate equity plan and that it is acting upon it. Right 
here there is a problem. Mr. Speaker, I would remind you of the 
outcry that swept the nation when Bill C-68, the gun bill, proposed 
similar entry and search provisions to ensure compliance. Here we 
are apparently doing the same thing.
<P>
	I suppose the argument, which I can hardly say is being debated 
either through public hearings or in this House, is that these 
compliance officers are equivalent to inspectors who come onto 
your premises to inspect elevators or read a gas meter. However, 
Bill C-64 gives these compliance officers extraordinary powers. If 
a company tries to deny them, the company can be taken to court, 
but not to any court as Canadians have come to understand the 
term. The court, which decides the guilt or innocence of a company 
and which ultimately decides on fines of up to $50,000, is a 
sub-tribunal of the existing human rights tribunal panel, whose 
president can name from one to three people to hear a case. There is 
no bar exam for these people to pass, no vetting by the elected 
representatives of the people. The president of the human rights 
tribunal panel gets to select whomever he pleases.
<P>
<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
	Tribunal is an appropriate term in this case. The word is very 
ancient, going back to Roman times, but it was in the Middle Ages 
and during the French Revolution that it acquired the connotation 
of drum-head justice, of people being hauled before citizen 
adjudicators who meted out punishment according to the temper or 
the distemper of the times.
<P>
	The only real requirement to be a judge on the equity tribunals 
that Bill C-64 sets up is that the person so named be familiar with 
the equity employment theory and practice. Is that not the most 
eloquent invitation to bias you have ever heard? Will not the 
temptation to appoint employment equity activists simply be 
overwhelming? Will these tribunal judges not have more of an eye 
toward being politically correct rather than fair to the accused, to 
the company contesting the assessment of a compliance officer?
<P>
	It gets worse. The equity tribunals that Bill C-64 sets up are 
courts of no appeal. The legislation specifically states that a 
company convicted by the tribunal has no  recourse to another court 
unless on a technicality. There is no appeal. Whoever heard of such 
a thing? Even convicted murderers have the option of trying to 
appeal, but not an employer who fails to file an equity employment 
plan to the satisfaction of an equity employment tribunal.
<P>
	I should note, however, that the action of initiating the levying of 
a fine against a company is to come from the Minister of Human 
Resources Development. The tribunal's role is to concur or not 
concur. Let us be candid here. The Minister of Human Resources 
Development we are talking about is not the political minister but 
the bureaucrats under him. If action leading to a fine is taken it will 
be by the deputy minister or an assistant deputy minister or an 
assistant to the assistant deputy minister. It will be a decision of the 
bureaucracy based on the recommendation of the human rights 
commission.
<P>
	While I am entirely confident that the current Minister of Human 
Resources Development will always stay on top of his department 
and will personally review any proposal for a penalty against a 
private sector employer, how can we be sure that some future 
Minister of Human Resources Development will not get 
preoccupied and leave such decisions to the deputy minister or the 
assistant deputy minister or so on? This could be even worse than 
the tribunal. The ultimate decision to penalize a company will rest 
with the bureaucrats. They will decide. Although I believe that 
Canada's federal civil service is the best in the world, I question its 
understanding of and sympathy for the problems of private sector 
employers.
<P>
	There is another reality. I hate to sound cynical, but these 
employment equity amendments may give even low-level 
bureaucrats a big stick. Companies vying for lucrative government 
contracts could be stopped in their tracks by the threat of 
employment equity complaints. They could be held to ransom by 
the unscrupulous. This may never be, but while 95 per cent of the 
people are honest, we have to watch out for that 5 per cent who are 
not.
<P>
	If a company is trying to land a $100 million contract and a 
compliance officer suddenly says its employment equity plan is 
inadequate, what will occur? Bill C-64 makes no provision for 
policing the equity police.
<P>
	The other major area of difficulty in Bill C-64 has to do with the 
fact that it exempts employers who would hire only aboriginals. I 
could speak at equal length about this problem, as it is equally 
fundamental and crucial. Suffice it to say that a bill that purports to 
try to eliminate discrimination actually condones it when it 
exempts a large group of Canadians solely by virtue of race. This is 
entirely contrary to the concept that we are all equal before the law. 
It is better to throw out a law entirely if it requires a clause that 
treats one Canadian differently than another based on birth rather 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15427"> 15427 </A></B>
<P>
than merit.  This is exactly what Bill C-64 does. This is 
unfortunate. It sows the seeds of anger and conflict.
<P>
	This all appears so obvious to me. I have to acknowledge that I 
am only a layman in legal matters, as was the majority of MPs who 
considered this bill in committee. Naturally I want to know what 
Canada's legal community has had to say about this legislation. 
Does it share my misgivings? There is no way of knowing. Other 
than the National Association of Women and the Law no lawyers' 
groups testified before the committee. I suspect they were never 
invited. Government funded special interest groups however were 
well represented.
<P>
<B>(1715)</B>
<P>
	There is my dilemma as a government MP. I see fundamental 
problems with Bill C-64 of a legalistic nature but little evidence 
that the legal experts have been consulted. It is wrong to leave it to 
the courts to decide after a bill has passed. We are supposed to iron 
out the problems beforehand.
<P>
	I do not believe this has been done. The trouble is I can do 
nothing but stand here and speak. The bill went to committee after 
first reading, enabling it to be flipped through report stage and 
second reading to a vote in five consecutive sitting days of this 
House of Commons. Five consecutive days, that is all.
<P>
	There were no committee hearings following second reading as 
normally is the practice. There has been no chance for me to see my 
misgivings put to rest by asking the standing committee to summon 
expert witnesses who could comment on my concerns.
<P>
	I would like to have heard the opinion of the Canadian Bar 
Association on this legislation. No chance now. I would like to 
have lobbied my fellow MPs to get them to study the bill and 
express their opinions. No chance now. I would like to have heard 
from retired judges of long experience. No chance now.
<P>
	It is curious. I am a first time MP. I never dreamed, ever, that 
laws were created in this fashion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Comox-Alberni, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
must say that it is refreshing to hear a Liberal talk about some of 
the concerns in a bill rather than just glowing over the top saying 
there are no problems at all. I applaud the member for putting 
forward his comments with the moral fortitude of speaking his 
mind.
<P>
	I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on Bill C-64, an act 
to implement employment equity. Bill C-64 aims to legislatively 
entrench employment equity for the federal public service and 
businesses of 100 or more employees doing business with the 
federal government by setting up racial and sex based hiring 
quotas.
<P>
	Canadians have several concerns with the proposed bill and so 
they should. It is contradictory. It is discriminatory. It is 
patronizing. The underlying  principles undermine the values in 
which Canadians take the most pride, fairness and equality for all.
<P>
	In my view, public service hiring and promotion should be 
guided by one principle and one principle alone and that is merit. 
The government clearly has a role in ensuring equal opportunity 
and employment competition based on merit. In this bill hiring and 
promotion based on race or sex is in direct conflict with merit. If 
the best candidate is to be hired, race or sex should not matter.
<P>
	The bill patronizes designated groups. It assumes their 
mediocrity and presupposes that certain groups of individuals will 
not be hired or promoted in the workforce on their own merit, so 
the only way they are going to get hired or promoted is to give 
special favour to their race, gender or disability. This is nonsense.
<P>
	Employment equity assumes that if people fall within a 
particular category they need assistance. This is not the case. 
Whether a person is male or female, a visible minority, disabled, 
does not define a person's need for assistance and when we jump to 
such conclusions it is called racism or sexism. Clearly entitlement 
to government positions should be based on individual merit, not 
the colour of the applicant's skin or gender.
<P>
	In addition, race and sex based policies can be detrimental to the 
workplace. They create tension and bad feelings among 
co-workers. Equal opportunity means allowing the same 
opportunity to each individual regardless of race, sex or religion, 
not rewarding one group over another because of basic 
characteristics.
<P>
<B>(1720 )</B>
<P>
	Employees should have the right to be free of discrimination in 
the workplace. This right should be protected by government, not 
withdrawn as the bill attempts to do. The bill is not about equality, 
fairness or hiring the most qualified people for the job. It is about 
giving special status to one group over another based on race or 
sex.
<P>
	All Canadians should be equal before and under the law. This bill 
violates those basic Canadian rights. On that basis alone, the bill 
should not be allowed to pass.
<P>
	Rights and privileges should not be based on race or gender. 
These ideas went out in the 19th century with the growth of 
universal democracy and individual rights and freedoms. The 
government talks about equality of opportunity but at the same 
time is introducing affirmative action legislation that is 
fundamentally opposed to equality. How can Canada claim to be in 
the forefront of human rights legislation with such discriminatory 
legislation?
<P>
	Governments have mandated preferential policies toward 
designated groups in the past. Bill C-64 establishes laws and 
regulations that mandate Canadians treat people differently, to 
consider race and gender  when hiring or promoting. In so doing, 
the government 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15428"> 15428 </A></B>
<P>
takes away individual respect and dignity and replaces it with a 
racist or a sexist hiring policy. This is going the wrong way.
<P>
	No one should be accepted or rejected for a job based on race or 
gender. It is simply wrong to classify an applicant on the basis of 
these characteristics. Employees should be judged on the merit of 
their individual day to day accomplishments.
<P>
	Blanket hiring of employees on the basis of race and gender is 
simply not acceptable to Canadians. More fundamentally, it is not 
the business of government to influence employment decisions in 
the private sector. Governments should not be imposing their bill 
on private business. Canadians do not need or want the influence of 
a big brother government watching over the private sector. Once 
again, the Liberals have underestimated the Canadian public. 
Canadians do not want this big brother approach meddling in their 
hiring practices.
<P>
	In addition, I am concerned with the cost of the legislation. The 
government is proposing a program that could cost taxpayers 
billions. The total cost both direct and indirect of employment 
equity could amount to over $6 billion or nearly 1 per cent of the 
gross domestic product because it is going to affect a lot of 
businesses and people.
<P>
	Where are the priorities of the government? It cannot guarantee 
seniors' pension funds, but it is prepared to throw $6 billion into 
employment equity. That is fundamentally wrong.
<P>
	The legislation is misplaced by a government priority. Canadians 
will be most concerned by the enormous amounts of money that are 
going to be poured into this program because employment equity is 
unnecessary. The government claims it is eliminating barriers with 
this bill. It does not eliminate barriers, it creates them.
<P>
	Obviously no one should discriminate against women, visible 
minorities or the disabled in hiring practices. I fail to see why we 
have this over reaction on the part of the government in an attempt 
to correct a problem that Canadians agree simply does not exist.
<P>
	The Ontario election was fought on the issue of employment 
equity and the Liberals were defeated because they tried to force it 
down the throats of the electorate. In addition, this legislation is 
contradictory.
<P>
	Bill C-64 states that no person should be denied employment 
opportunities for reasons other than ability. Yet the very essence of 
this act contradicts this statement. The bill promotes discrimination 
and legislates race and sex bias in the workplace.
<P>
	All Canadians must be able to compete equally for jobs 
irrespective of race, gender or disability. Canadians should not be 
denied employment opportunities for reasons that have nothing to 
do with their abilities.
<P>
	I must also point out that two wrongs do not make a right. Many 
young people today have enough strikes against them as they 
search the job market for whatever employment they can find. 
Employment equity will freeze out more opportunities for young 
people who do not fit into the preferential hiring practices, not 
because they lack the skills or ability but because of their personal 
hereditary characteristics. Any young person who has the 
misfortune of not falling into those categories is left out in the cold.
<P>
<B>(1725 )</B>
<P>
	Applicants should not have to disclose the colour of their skin, 
their ethnic background, their gender or their religion. It is illegal 
to ask a person's age or marital status but to ask a person's race is 
all right? What is wrong with this picture?
<P>
	Recently a Gallup poll showed that 74 per cent of Canadians 
oppose employment equity. If we were to poll Canadians today I 
am sure we would get the same results. In fact, the Ontario election 
is the latest and strongest indication that Canadians reject 
employment equity and are prepared to reject any government that 
proposes it. When will the government stop listening to special 
interest groups and start listening to Canadians?
<P>
	In conclusion, I have to ask why the government insists on 
pushing legislation which is contrary to the views of most 
Canadians. This is the same mistake the last government made. We 
all know the price it paid for not listening. The real question is: Are 
the Liberals listening or are they going to force unwanted 
legislation on Canadians and suffer the same fate as the 
Conservatives? Time will tell.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Eugène Bellemare (Carleton-Gloucester, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a privilege to rise in the House to participate in the 
debate on Bill C-64, an act respecting employment equity.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	When I listen to hon. members opposite, I sometimes have the 
impression that to them, employment equity is just a numbers 
game. That is not the case, The government has taken a holistic 
approach to employment equity. Contrary to what members of the 
Reform Party seem to believe, we are not just in the business of 
adding or subtracting numbers.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	To the contrary, passage of Bill C-64 will enhance 
implementation of the Employment Equity Act so that we can 
continue to fight systemic discrimination and build a federally 
regulated workforce that reflects the diverse composition of 
Canadian society.
<P>
	It is important to note it is not just the government which is 
concerned about diversity in the workforce. We know there are a 
growing number of employers who are getting behind employment 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15429"> 15429 </A></B>
<P>
equity. They are not treating  it as some kind of statistical exercise, 
which seems to be the way members of the Reform Party look on it.
<P>
	Employment equity is helping us to build a harmonious society. 
Employers are learning how to manage diversity. Being able to 
manage a diverse labour force will help business to draw on the 
broad expertise of people from many different social and economic 
backgrounds.
<P>
	There are some fine examples, such as the employer's leadership 
skills course, which is helping managers to understand individual 
differences and how to lead teams made up of diverse members. 
Another employer gathers information on his employee's negative 
experiences to determine the best way to improve their situation.
<P>
	Some employers are providing video training to upgrade the 
computer skills of employees with learning and visual disabilities. 
Some employers are introducing flexible holiday arrangements for 
employees who wish to participate in their own religious 
ceremonies on specific days each year.
<P>
	The point I am making is that employers are working with all of 
their employees to create a productive and harmonious workplace 
which represents the diverse nature of the Canadian population.
<P>
	I submit it is the Reform Party that has a fixation with numbers, 
not the government. The bill refers not to quotas but to equal 
treatment. For example, let us look at the amendment on 
self-identification that the government accepted during the report 
stage of the bill. The amendment accepts the right of the employer 
to make the case that under-representation of a group is due to a 
lack of self-identification and there is a requirement for 
compliance officers to take such information into account.
<P>
	I want to tell the House something about self-identification. 
Self-identification has encouraged individuals in the designated 
groups to come forward. In the past many of these individuals have 
tried to hide their minority status from society. We must remember 
that for years people have felt that they had to keep their disability 
secret and their racial origins to themselves. That is now changing.
<P>
	Since 1987 more people in the designated groups are 
self-identifying because they feel more comfortable about doing 
so.
<P>
<B>(1730)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We know that representation of women and members of visible 
minorities in the labour force has increased considerably. In the 
case of aboriginal peoples and persons with disabilities, the process 
has been slower but there has been an improvement.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Employment equity is not about adding a bunch of numbers and 
throwing them into a statistical report. The Reform Party is 
misleading Canadians by referring to employment equity in that 
way.
<P>
	Bill C-64 accents reality. Its implementation will help us to use 
scarce resources in a way that will enable all Canadians to 
contribute their knowledge and skills to making a better Canada.
<P>
	Many companies are already taking positive steps in that 
direction. Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation has a wide 
range of measures to reach a representative workforce, including 
special initiatives for aboriginal people and for persons with 
intellectual disabilities.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Orth-McNeil, a drug company in Don Mills, Ontario, introduced 
flexible hours so that its female employees can either work at home 
or work part time after their maternity leave. York University in 
North York, Ontario, is always trying to increase representation of 
designated groups on its campus.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Even small and medium businesses recognize the importance of 
employment equity. On my way to the House of Commons from 
my riding office in Orléans at noon I stopped at a fast food 
restaurant for a quick lunch. The lady who served me had a speech 
impediment. I was served with politeness, speed and in a 
business-like manner. I commend the manager for recognizing 
employment equity and putting it into practice in the frontline of 
his business.
<P>
	Bill C-64 is not about adding up a bunch of numbers and patting 
ourselves on the back because they look impressive. It is about 
doing the right thing and allowing all Canadians to feel they belong 
and can participate actively in a just and caring society. It is about 
ending systemic discrimination in the workplace and opening the 
labour force to all who are deserving based on ability. That is the 
thrust of the legislation and I am pleased to give it my 
wholehearted support.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I believe 
Canada is a cultural mosaic made up of citizens with various ethnic 
and religious backgrounds. Many of these people have overcome 
tremendous adversities to be able to reside in Canada where all 
citizens are supposed to be equal in the eyes of the law.
<P>
	This sentiment has not always been shared or fostered across the 
land. At various times in our history certain groups have been the 
target of discrimination and persecution. These have scarred our 
past and from these times we have grown to be a much more 
tolerant and a much more civilized society.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15430"> 15430 </A></B>
<P>
	I am not in favour of a homogenized Canada. I am in favour 
of equal access for all Canadians. Bill C-64 is an impediment to 
such access. By ensuring access to some, Liberals block access 
to others.
<P>
	It is important to ensure Canadians from traditionally 
disadvantaged groups are given access to education and all the 
other benefits of Canadian citizenship, but this should not mean 
that special employment provisions are given to any group or 
individual in lieu of merit.
<P>
	The opinion of the government is that these disadvantaged 
groups need special government legislated programs to be 
represented in the workforce. However legislation is overkill. 
Liberals will never achieve employment equity through divisive 
means even if it is imposed by the heavy hand of the law.
<P>
	As an employer I am looking for a person who will do the job 
best. There is no race or gender attachment to that criterion; only 
merit. Under the government's plan I no longer have to find the 
best person for the job. I now have to find the best candidate from a 
designated group. This is not equal opportunity under the law. It is 
an enforced quota system.
<P>
	The legislation states that employers with a workforce of at least 
100 persons who are in the service of the federal government must 
comprise their workforce proportionately to the make-up of the 
population. The government has a fixation with numbers, quotas 
and statistics, which is why the Minister of Industry is going ahead 
with a census based on race, even on the nation of origin of 
Canadian citizens.
<P>
<B>(1735 )</B>
<P>
	The Reform Party believes in an immigration policy that is 
colour blind and says that immigration based on race or country of 
origin is racism. If that is the case, what is legislation that is based 
on race or country of origin? I suggest respectfully it too is racism.
<P>
	The government would lead us to believe that under 
representation of disadvantaged groups in the workplace is the 
result of discrimination. This is preposterous. In Canada citizens 
are free to choose the career of their choice. How could the 
government impose a plan on Canadians which quantifies access to 
certain jobs? If discrimination is wrong for one designated group, it 
is wrong for all Canadians.
<P>
	To select someone for a job based on race or gender is just as 
wrong as not selecting the same person for the same reasons. All 
people must be equal regardless of race, language, creed, religion 
or gender.
<P>
	Canada's employment practices have evolved to a level where 
we recognize the wrongs of the past. I would hope that we have also 
evolved to a level where we recognize that redemption for the 
oppression of one group should not be the oppression of another 
group. There is still  considerable room for improvement. However 
Bill C-64 is clearly not the answer.
<P>
	I should not expect the government to grasp the concept of equal 
opportunity. Its party has passed some of the most divisive 
legislation in Canadian history. According to Liberal dogma we as 
a country are supposed to find unity and strength by focusing on 
our differences and making exceptions for those differences.
<P>
	Unfortunately we live in an intolerant world. We only have to 
watch the nightly news to see the atrocities that occur daily in the 
name of difference. Why would we in Canada, a country of 
incredible opportunity, focus on the differences of the population 
and legislate employment policies based on race, gender and 
disability?
<P>
	To identify a specific group as disadvantaged gives a perception 
that it is incapable of succeeding on its own. This is clearly untrue 
and is a disservice to those groups.
<P>
	I should mention that many women in my constituency have 
approached me on the issue. Uniformly they see quotas as 
demeaning their personal value, developed skills and work ethic. 
They want government meddling in the workforce eliminated, not 
enhanced.
<P>
	When will the government realize the ramifications of its 
actions? The people of Ontario clearly voted against the unwanted 
employment equity legislation. Does it not see the divisions and 
animosity created by its policies? I wonder if the government has 
taken into consideration the long term effects of its quota systems, 
because they are quota systems. At what point do we reverse the 
discrimination angle and again promote those who have been kept 
down? This is a cyclical effect and the only solution is to end it 
now.
<P>
	The government should be proactive, advocate equality in the 
truest sense of the word, treat all Canadians the same, tax them the 
same and educate them the same. As utopian as that may sound it is 
a positive step for the future.
<P>
	As long as the government keeps legislating discriminatory 
ideology there is no possible means of attaining what is guaranteed 
under the charter, that we are all equal in the eyes of the law.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Murphy (Annapolis Valley-Hants, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak today on Bill C-64, an act respecting 
employment equity.
<P>
	I support the bill. I believe it is an important step in ensuring 
fairness and equity in the workplace. This is especially true for 
women, aboriginal people, persons of disability and members of 
visible minorities, all of whom represent segments of our society 
that have not always been given a fair opportunity. These groups 
continue to experience higher than average unemployment rates, 
lower than average salaries, and are concentrated in the lower 
paying jobs.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15431"> 15431 </A></B>
<P>
	In recent weeks we have had a valuable debate about 
employment equity. It has allowed us to discuss an initiative that 
will help ensure all Canadians have equal opportunities in the 
workplace.
<P>
<B>(1740 )</B>
<P>
	However throughout the debate there has been one recurring and 
unsettling element: the consistent effort of the Reform Party to 
practise the politics of polarization.
<P>
	As I have listened to the debate, far too often members of the 
third party have chosen to misrepresent the intent and practice of 
employment equity. In so doing they have chosen a dangerous 
course. Instead of taking an important step forward they have opted 
for the status quo. Instead of making our society stronger and more 
inclusive they are spreading misinformation aimed at dividing 
people.
<P>
	Before I deal with their politics of polarization, let me begin my 
remarks by noting other elements of the position of Reformers on 
the bill. The key element of their position is that infallible market 
forces are enough to address employment barriers. That was 
summarized in their minority addendum to the report of the 
standing committee. They stated quite clearly that the market 
would punish an employer whose employment practises had 
systemic discrimination built into them. Yet market forces alone 
cannot eradicate systemic discrimination. Voluntary measures 
toward achieving equity in the workplace have not brought about 
significant changes for many people.
<P>
	There is another dimension to the Reform position, that is the 
denial of systemic discrimination in the workplace, discrimination 
that not only results from a conscious bias but from inadvertent 
practices and systems. In other words a seemingly neutral policy 
can have adverse impact on certain groups and individuals based on 
race, gender and disability.
<P>
	The term systemic discrimination refers to this type of 
unintentional barrier to equality. However, when I listened to the 
arguments made by members of the third party, they believe only 
one kind of discrimination occurs when an employer says that he 
will not hire a person because she is a woman, a visible minority, 
an aboriginal person or has a disability. Systemic discrimination 
has nothing to do with any intention to discriminate. Canadian 
employers are fair. Many organizations have already recognized 
the existence of such discrimination in their workplace and are 
working hard to eliminate it.
<P>
	That brings me to my final point, the politics of polarization. 
Time and time again hon. members in the third party have chosen 
to debate the issue in terms that can only create confusion and 
division. They talk about quotas when the bill explicitly rejects 
them. They claim the bill promotes a new kind of discrimination 
when it clearly does not. They harp on this as an attack on merit, 
yet the bill explicitly states that no employer will ever be  forced to 
hire an unqualified person. That bears repeating because the third 
party is trying to confuse the people of Canada. The bill explicitly 
states that no employer will ever be forced to hire an unqualified 
person.
<P>
	I advise my hon. colleagues across the way to take some time to 
sit down and read through the bill. They should read section 5 
where they will see what employer obligations really are. They 
should read section 6 where they will see what is not an obligation. 
They should read section 10 where they will see what an 
employment equity plan really is.
<P>
	Bill C-64 is about making all reasonable efforts to build 
workplaces that respect people. In listening to the arguments of my 
colleagues across the way it is clear they have chosen to ignore the 
experience of many employers covered under the existing 
legislation. They are making employment equity work the right 
way. They see it as a human resource planning pool. They know 
that a key element of an effective equity program is 
communication. People need to know what equity is and 
conversely they need to know what it is not.
<P>
	When members of the Reform Party suggest that the legislation 
is about stealing legitimate opportunities from some to give it to 
the undeserving, what kind of a response do they expect? It would 
seem that they want a backlash. Rather than focusing on the issues 
of real equity in the workplace, they instead focus on 
misinformation about what the bill really stands for. They are 
trying to capitalize on genuine concerns many Canadians have 
about their jobs and their future.
<P>
<B>(1745)</B>
<P>
	Let us be clear. The Reform Party wants short term political gain 
based on the politics of fear.
<P>
	This bill responds to a real problem. It reaffirms our 
government's commitment to equity for all Canadians. Our 
government is living up to its responsibility and we are working to 
make positive changes for Canadians. We realize that denying this 
problem will not make it go away.
<P>
	In closing, Bill C-64 is not about giving unfair advantage to 
certain designated groups; it is about equality and removing 
barriers to employment. When this bill comes to final vote I will be 
on the side of building a stronger and more inclusive society in 
Canada. I will vote in favour of Bill C-64 and I encourage all 
members of this House to do the same.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to be back in the House after a week's 
break. Things have not changed too much. I heard Reform 
mentioned quite often which is music to my ears. We must be 
saying something right.
<P>
	I always say that the proof is in the pudding and to practise what 
you preach. For example, we have tried to  be employed as 
committee vice-chairmen in this House for a number of years. For 
some reason it has not held true that we have been equally treated 
to that extent. We have capable people who should be employed as 
vice-chairs in the committees but it does not seem to work that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15432"> 15432 </A></B>
<P>
way. That is democracy Liberal style, I heard an hon. member say, 
but let us get down to the basics.
<P>
	It is a pleasure to address this bill, an act representing 
employment equity. I would like to add my voice to those of my 
colleagues in opposition to this offensive piece of legislation.
<P>
	This bill sets out to achieve numerical equity by occupational 
groups in the following workplaces that employ 100 or more 
people: the federal public service; federally regulated private 
business; and businesses that undertake contracts with the federal 
government. The bill sets out to do this by correcting conditions of 
the disadvantaged experienced by certain groups through the use of 
racial and gender based quotas.
<P>
	Under this bill all affected businesses would have to comply with 
extensive reporting obligations, including filing detailed analyses 
of their hiring practices and racial breakdowns of their staffs. This 
is a costly imposition.
<P>
	The Reform Party believes that all Canadians are equal under the 
law and all Canadians have the right to be free from discrimination 
in the workplace. No one should be denied an employment 
opportunity for reasons that have nothing to do with inherent 
ability. The Reform Party also believes that merit should be the 
sole hiring criteria in the workplace. To pass over the best qualified 
candidate in order to fill a racially based quota is a denial of the 
merit principle and in itself is racist.
<P>
	We believe in a system that is colour blind and gender neutral. 
Canadians who wish to pursue a certain vocation should not face 
barriers of discrimination. Those with ability and discipline 
deserve the rewards of their hard work.
<P>
	The key assumption underlining the notion of equality in Bill 
C-64 is that equality means equality of numerical representation in 
the workplace. Even in a perfect world it seems unlikely that 
people from designated groups would enter each segment of the 
workforce in numbers precisely equal to their representation in the 
workplace. Yet this government persists in depending on numerical 
equality as the standard of justice.
<P>
<B>(1750)</B>
<P>
	A 1993-94 report on employment equity in the public service 
says that self-identification is the backbone of the employment 
equity program. This raises a serious concern over the reliability of 
the self-identification process. Many people may refuse to identify 
themselves as a member of a designated group because they fear 
they would be seen differently by co-workers. This avoidance 
could then skew the statistical base. If enough people  refused to 
self-identify, then the appearance of discrimination would be 
elevated.
<P>
	For example, the Clerk of the House of Commons appeared with 
the result of a self-identification survey before the standing 
committee studying this bill. This survey was sent to 1,700 House 
employees. Just 23 per cent returned the survey. Of that number, 
less than 50 identified themselves as a member of a designated 
group. Clearly the appearance of non-compliance can be created by 
inadequate data.
<P>
	A 1992-93 report on employment equity in the public service 
stated that the number of visible minority employees may be 
underidentified by one and one-half times and the number of 
disabled by two and one-half times. This has serious implications 
for employers. If some members of designated groups fail to 
identify themselves as belonging to a designated group, the 
employer would have to consistently report an unrepresentative 
workplace. In this case the employer would be forced to report 
non-compliance when in fact he or she might be complying.
<P>
	There is also the aspect that employees would be tempted to 
falsify self-identification surveys. Since no verification is ever 
attempted, no studies have been conducted on the possibility of 
abuse in this regard. However, the 1994 report of the Employment 
Equity Act notes that in 1991, 2.3 million Canadians reported 
having a disability, an increase of 30 per cent over 1986. Only part 
of this can be explained by an aging population.
<P>
	This bill gives Canadians a strong motive to count themselves in 
as disadvantaged. Even more confusing is the fact there is no 
uniform definition of disability used in Canada and disabilities are 
often determined on a case by case basis.
<P>
	This type of legislation results in reverse discrimination. It 
attempts to fight racism or sexism by racist and sexist means.
<P>
	For a while in 1992 the RCMP in Alberta stopped accepting 
applications from white males. The RCMP now operates several 
preferential hiring programs. Out of the 426 cadets in training this 
year, 74 per cent must be selected from three of the four designated 
groups.
<P>
	Polls in Canada have consistently shown that Canadians do not 
want employment equity programs. A 1993 Gallup poll showed 
that 74 per cent said that qualifications should be the sole criteria 
for hiring for management positions. The question is: When will 
this government start listening to Canadians instead of forcing 
legislation on them that they do not want?
<P>
	This seems to have been the Liberal agenda for the last couple of 
years: ``Do as we say or you will not do as you should be doing 
according to your constituents''. This is another prime example of 
the Liberal government trying to force through legislation that will 
be  detrimental not just to this country but to the economy of the 
<P>

<P>
country. It is time we recognized that we have to listen to the 
grassroots people, that we have to listen to the grassroots 
businesses. They have the answers for this country and that is what 
the people of Canada want.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
President of the Treasury Board, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on October 
3 in this very House at the start of the debate on the amendment 
motions to Bill C-64, the hon. member for Edmonton Southwest 
said: ``The private sector by and large is light years ahead of the 
government in its relationship with minority groups''.
<P>
	That comes from one of the more enlightened members of the 
Reform Party. Imagine what the rest of them must be thinking 
when such a glaring error has been made. That is incorrect and 
false information. It was not intended to be. It just happened to be 
because that member did not know as his colleagues do not know 
the truth of the matter. I want to set the record straight.
<P>
	Our latest annual report was tabled in the House by the Minister 
of Human Resources Development and the President of the 
Treasury Board. It shows that for three of the designated groups, 
that is, women, aboriginal peoples and persons with disabilities, in 
representation levels the ratios of designated group members to the 
entire workforce are higher in the federal public service than in the 
whole federally regulated private sector. Those are the facts.
<P>
	The lower representation of visible minorities in the public 
service as a whole is due in part to the fact that the public service 
does not have an equivalent to the banking sector where 
representation is 13 per cent.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duhamel:</B> The Reform Party does not get its facts straight 
because when we attempt to put the facts on the table, Reformers 
will not listen. I am going to continue to give them the facts and 
perhaps some day they will sink in.
<P>
	Jobs in the public service in contrast to the federally regulated 
sector are not as concentrated in large Canadian metropolitan areas. 
These are the urban centres where the vast majority of Canadians of 
a visible minority are residing. However, visible minorities make 
up 8.3 per cent of the relatively well paid scientific and 
professional category of the public service.
<P>
	It should also be noted that right now, one out of five executives 
in the public service is a woman. What is it in the private sector? 
One in ten. I suppose the Reform Party is going to tell me that is 
better. I suppose Reform members are going to tell me that is 
because women have been favoured. No, it is not because they have 
been favoured. It is because there have been open policies  which 
have recognized the systemic discrimination and in part it has been 
corrected.
<P>
	Professor Andrew Hede of the University of Southern 
Queensland in Australia published a comparative analysis of 
women executives in public services. Drawing from the experience 
in Britain, the United States and Australia he wrote: ``Canada is the 
clear front runner in the equity stakes''. Why will my colleagues 
from the Reform Party not admit that we are leaders? I know why. 
It is because they cannot possibly admit whenever the government 
does something right.
<P>
	Make no mistake about it. There is still a lot that needs to be 
done, but we are making progress. These are sound policies. It is 
unfortunate that some people would want to peg them as 
discriminatory for political gain.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Now for my comments on Bill C-64. Some people have a poor 
perception of employment equity and of Bill C-64 in particular. 
They believe, and in my opinion they are wrong, that these are 
radical social experiments. One wonders whether there is no 
awareness or appreciation of the past and present policies of this 
government which are aimed at helping the most vulnerable 
members of our society and thus increasing employment equity.
<P>
	Let me present the facts so that these people will understand the 
historic background of this bill. I hope this will improve their 
perspective and give them a better appreciation of employment 
equity.
<P>
	I will provide a history of the development of employment 
equity at the federal level, with some specific examples of the 
situation, past and present, in the public service.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	What I am about to say will make it abundantly clear, and it may 
even be understood by those who do not want to see it, that 
employment equity is not a revolution that would target and punish 
groups which may have benefited from the employment system in 
the past. Rather, I want to paint employment equity in Canada as an 
evolutionary social policy initiative consistent with the tradition of 
fairness and dignity for all that is so prevalent in the mainstream of 
Canadian society. That is what it is all about.
<P>
<B>(1800)</B>
<P>
	Let me give some examples of a few very significant historical 
milestones.
<P>
	The Royal Commission on the Status of Women was a stimulus 
for early efforts by the federal government in the 1970s to deal 
systematically with issues of representation in the public service.
<P>
	In the early 1980s the federal government introduced a program 
to bring about the equitable representation and distribution of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15434"> 15434 </A></B>
<P>
women, aboriginal peoples, and persons  with disabilities in the 
public service. In 1985 visible minorities were included in the 
program.
<P>
	The government also launched the special measures programs to 
encourage the recruitment of designated group members. A 
service-wide self-identification survey was carried out to provide 
the numerical information for the program.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	And in 1986, following the 1984 report of the Royal 
Commission on Employment Equity, sometimes referred to as the 
Abella Report, the federal government passed the Employment 
Equity Act. The government also introduced Treasury Board's 
policy on employment equity.
<P>
	In 1988, the government appointed the Task Force on Barriers to 
Women in the Public Service whose report Beneath the Veneer was 
published in 1990. The report recommended a broad range of 
measures to attract, train and maintain women in positions at all 
levels. It provided the inspiration for a number of important 
proposals made in the White Paper on Public Service Renewal, 
Public Service 2000, and in the Public Service Reform Act tabled 
in the House of Commons.
<P>
	In 1989, Treasury Board introduced an annual program of 
employment equity merit awards to celebrate outstanding 
achievements by departments with respect to various designated 
groups. That same year the Canadian Centre for Management 
Development opened its doors. Among other things, the centre 
encourages the implementation of key employment equity 
objectives, including diversity management.
<P>
	Also in 1989, Treasury Board adopted a policy on services 
available to persons with disabilities.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In 1990 the secretary of the Treasury Board, with advice from a 
deputy ministerial committee, set goals for the achievement of 
equity for the four designated groups, reviewed accountability 
mechanisms, monitored developments with respect to national 
strategies and initiatives, and gave advice to departments on 
communications strategies and efforts.
<P>
	In May 1992 the government announced its intention to legislate 
employment equity in the public service through amendments to 
the Financial Administration Act, thereby confirming by statute 
obligations on the public service that were comparable to those 
placed on federally regulated employers under the Employment 
Equity Act.
<P>
	On June 18, 1992 royal assent was given to a bill modifying six 
federal laws pertaining to persons with disabilities, two of which 
were a Treasury Board responsibility. These were the Access to 
Information Act and the Privacy Act. The acts were modified to 
facilitate access to government records and to have personal  
information in an alternative format for persons with a sensory 
disability.
<P>
	In December 1992 Parliament passed the Public Service Reform 
Act which amended various federal acts, including the Financial 
Administration Act. As a result of these revisions, the President of 
the Treasury Board is now required to table in Parliament an annual 
report on the state of employment equity in the public service 
during the immediately preceding fiscal year.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In 1993, the framework for better employment equity in the 
public service in the 1990s was published. This framework was the 
product of reflection by the secretary of Treasury Board with the 
support of a group of deputy ministers. It described a new approach 
to employment equity at a time when resources were few and 
managers and employees were increasingly being asked to be 
accountable by focussing service on the client and coming up with 
their own ways to promote a positive corporate culture.
<P>
	In April 1994, Treasury Board approved the implementation of a 
new program of special measures replacing previous special 
measures programs. This new program advocated more innovation 
and flexibility in increasing representation by members of the 
designated groups and changing corporate culture within the public 
service.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Finally, in December 1994 the government introduced Bill C-64, 
an act respecting employment equity. It brings private and public 
sector employers, including the public service, under a single 
legislated regime. Employers would be subject to identical 
obligations to implement employment equity and a uniform 
process. The Canadian Human Rights Commission would be 
authorized to conduct compliance audits.
<P>
<B>(1805)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This is the reality. I have just described it. I hope my colleagues 
opposite will stop using this expression and this program in an 
attempt to claim they hold the key to the truth. I hope that, finally, 
they will stop and look, open their eyes and their heart, and admit 
that, without such programs, women, aboriginal peoples, members 
of visible minorities and other inadequately represented groups 
would not be given favourable treatment.
<P>
	I could go on at length, but I feel I have nevertheless set out the 
facts. If they keep an open mind, something all members should 
have, these hon. members will approve and support a government 
bill in the end.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15435"> 15435 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is not 
a pleasure to stand and address this bill. I know it  is customary for 
people to stand and tell the Speaker and the House that it is a real 
pleasure to be here. However, I can say quite honestly that this is a 
horrible piece of legislation. I cannot believe that members across 
the way would stand in support of legislation that started under the 
Conservative government. I guess we can see that they truly are 
soul mates.
<P>
	I listened with interest to the hon. member from Manitoba 
describe with religious fervour how much he supports the 
legislation. He listed statute after statute, suggesting that somehow 
this was great legislation that would bring about equity and we 
would all be drinking free beer and there would be food and 
happiness across the land. Unfortunately, that is not the way it 
works.
<P>
	The hon. member talked about the need to have all kinds of 
legislation and the wonderful things the government has done with 
respect to employment equity. Long before the government got 
involved in the game, people from different countries came to 
Canada and somehow over a period of time they got along and 
worked together and eventually they all worked together in 
government.
<P>
	I am certain my hon. friend from Manitoba could tell us stories 
about the experiences of his family and growing up on the prairies. 
My family came from the prairies. When the prairies were settled 
75 to 100 years ago there were people who came from all around 
the world. They all spoke different languages and had completely 
different heritages. After a while, as they got to know each other, 
which took some time, they started to work together and they 
became not only co-workers but friends. Eventually, of course, it 
finds its way up the system and it is now seen in government.
<P>
	I would like to point out to my friends across the way that society 
is almost always ahead of the government on these issues. I believe 
it is truly the case, even in the situation we had where a few years 
ago the government started legislating through employment equity 
in those industries that fell under federal jurisdiction. I point to a 
study that was done a few years ago of the broadcast industry, 
where it was found that the CBC was actually far behind some of 
the private sector broadcasters. I refer to CITY-TV in Toronto, 
where it has always reflected that community in the make-up of the 
people who went on the air. The CBC was way behind. Of course 
everyone panicked, because the government was not following the 
legislation. CITY-TV was well ahead on that issue.
<P>
	I worked for the same company that CITY-TV actually belonged 
to. We ran into all kinds of problems with the legislation because, 
among other things, people had to self-identify. Other members 
have spoken on that issue.
<P>
	In the little radio station I ran there was someone who was 
aboriginal but who refused to identify as an aboriginal. And hair on 
him. I think that is great. People do not want to be seen as victims. 
They say ``I can  make it on my own''. In fact, they were already in 
our employ, so obviously we did not discriminate.
<P>
<B>(1810)</B>
<P>
	People have the capability of doing these things on their own. 
They do not need the government standing there at every step, 
saying: ``You are a victim, so we are going to step in; we are going 
to stand on everybody else's fingers just so we can make sure you 
get into the workforce''.
<P>
	I would argue that society is always way out ahead of 
government on these issues. If people want to see rough equalities, 
give it a few years. People will eventually realize it is in their best 
interest to hire people on the basis of merit alone. In fact we see 
that in many successful companies today.
<P>
	I would argue that it is very hard for the government to 
micro-manage people's businesses to the point where they can say 
that it is in the best interests of a company to hire these people from 
such and such a group. The reason I would make that argument is 
because people who are coming from a visible minority of some 
kind perhaps are coming from another country where they have not 
yet had training in a particular area, and until they have been in the 
country for a while they perhaps do not have all the necessary 
skills. But that is a function of education; it is not a function of 
legislation by the government. Let those people find the education 
they need and eventually they will find their way into those 
industries.
<P>
	We do not need the government to stand there and crack the whip 
and say that because 40 per cent of the population in your area is 
made up of blue people you have to have blue people, even if those 
blue people are not necessarily qualified. That is crazy. I think you 
will find that most people would regard that as degrading. It is 
absolutely degrading. I think people will rise on their own merits. 
We do not need to have some kind of a quota system, such as is 
being proposed here.
<P>
	My friends across the way shake their heads and say no, it is not 
a quota system. If you were told that you have to hire from these 
particular groups to fulfil this legislation, then of course ultimately 
it is a quota. The numbers may not be on there, but as my friend 
from Lisgar-Marquette has pointed out, in 1992 the RCMP in 
Alberta were hiring all of their people out of employment equity 
legislation, which means that nobody else had a chance to apply. 
The numbers may not be written down specifically in the 
legislation, but if the scope of the legislation is such that it suggests 
that these are all you have to choose from, then ultimately people 
do not have a choice. They do not have the ability to hire the people 
they want to hire based on merit. That is ridiculous. That is 
absolutely crazy.
<P>
	I would argue that public debate is always the answer in these 
things. Not very long ago, and I could not believe  it, we had people 
suggesting we should have a speech code in the House of Com-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15436"> 15436 </A></B>
<P>
mons, that we should have some little kangaroo court passing 
judgment on whether or not what people say in here is appropriate.
<P>
	Public discourse and public debate will always be the ultimate 
arbiter when it comes to these things. For all the improvements we 
have seen in the country in terms of being tolerant to other groups 
and that kind of thing over the last 125 years, the credit does not 
belong to this place. The credit belongs to intelligent men and 
women over the course of history who have realized that the person 
next door may not be the same as me, but they are my equal and 
therefore I accept them. That is an education process. It is part of 
the public discourse. It is part of the public debate. And in every 
case I can think of where we have brought legislation in here, 
including in 1929, when we finally decided that women would be 
recognized as persons, I would guarantee you that the politicians 
were behind the public.
<P>
	Certainly in 1929 men and women who worked side by side on 
the farm on the prairies respected each other. They recognized each 
other as people. In this place it took us until 1929 to figure that out. 
That is ridiculous. Again, I say we are way behind the times in this 
place on this particular piece of legislation.
<P>
	Let us talk about sauce for the goose and sauce for the gander. 
Let us talk about the fact that the House of Commons, while it 
suggests this is good legislation for federally regulated industries 
and contractors who do business with the government, would never 
bind itself by this legislation. I do not see my hon. friends across 
the way advocating that they should be bound by the legislation and 
should have to hire people from particular groups. I see them 
shaking their heads and looking nervously about.
<P>
<B>(1815)</B>
<P>
	Here we go again. This is just like the MP pension debate. The 
Canada pension plan for seniors has to be cut but MPs are different. 
Somehow the legislation should apply to everybody else but us. 
Now they are shaking their heads. However, they cannot for a 
moment justify why this legislation does not apply to them. Look at 
those guys over here. They are reduced to heckling because they 
cannot justify their position. They cannot justify why this 
legislation would not apply to themselves. That speaks volumes 
about where they stand on this issue when it comes right down to 
their offices. They think it is good in theory. They think it is good 
for the general public in abstract but when it comes to their offices 
there is just no way.
<P>
	Actions speak louder than words. The government by not 
applying this to the House of Commons has shown that it really is 
not as committed as it claims to be. It believes it is good in theory 
for others but not for itself.
<P>
	I believe Canadians have shown that they will reject this. 
Seventy-four per cent of the people across Canada, according to 
Gallup, do not want this type of legislation. We saw it hammered 
down in Ontario. It is time the government woke up and smelled 
the coffee and decided that it is going to get in touch with the 
Canadian agenda, not its own agenda and not the agenda of some 
special interest group or some bureaucrat who is completely out of 
touch with what people think. We would not have this crazy kind of 
legislation in this place any more if it did.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Thalheimer (Timmins-Chapleau, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am appalled at the way hon. members of the Reform 
Party are misrepresenting Bill C-64 to the Canadian public. They 
are consistently using terms that do not apply to this legislation 
either in fact or in spirit.
<P>
	In its minority report, the Reform Party makes it look like 
employment equity and affirmation action are one and the same 
thing. However, any astute Canadian reading Bill C-64 or the 
current Employment Equity Act can see quite clearly that 
employment equity is not affirmative action.
<P>
	I suppose it is fitting, in keeping with its small <I>r</I> republican 
status, that the Reform Party tries to equate everything with the 
way things are done in the United States of America. However, 
employment equity is a fair and just Canadian manner of 
addressing the inequality of opportunity experienced by persons 
with disabilities, aboriginal peoples, visible minorities and women.
<P>
	Of course we know why the hon. members of the Reform Party 
use the term affirmative action. For the Reform Party, affirmative 
action is a code word for preferential treatment and in Reformers' 
convoluted attempts to obfuscate and derail this legislation they 
think they can pull the wool over the eyes of Canadians by taking 
this approach.
<P>
	Canadians are a lot smarter than the members of the Reform 
Party realize. They will not be bamboozled by smokescreen 
language that fails to address the true spirit of Bill C-64.
<P>
	Reform has a section titled ``Are Numerical Goals Really 
Quotas?'' in its minority report. I am delighted to be able to tell the 
hon. members opposite that the answer is no. Numerical goals are 
not quotas.
<P>
	I would like to take a moment to tell members of the Reform 
Party what the difference is between quotas and goals since it is 
clear from their arguments that they do not seem to know. I want to 
say at the outset that Bill C-64 specifically states that quotas cannot 
be imposed. Under the bill a quota is defined as a requirement to 
hire or promote a fixed and arbitrary number of persons during a 
given period. I refer them to section 33.
<P>
<B>(1820 )</B>
<P>
	Most Canadians understand the difference between numerical 
goals and quotas, even if the Reform Party  does not understand. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15437"> 15437 </A></B>
<P>
Goals are based on the availability of qualified people to do a given 
job. Quotas are arbitrarily determined.
<P>
	The bill clearly states that employers will not be required to hire 
unqualified people. Goals are percentages of anticipated hirings 
and promotions that an employer aims to achieve but quotas are 
usually fixed numbers of positions.
<P>
	The bill specifically states that employers will not be required to 
set fixed and arbitrary goals. Employers must make reasonable 
efforts to achieve goals. Quotas must be attained regardless of the 
circumstances. The bill clearly states that if employers make 
reasonable efforts to implement their goals they will be found in 
compliance.
<P>
	This is the Canadian way. The government's approach to 
implementing employment equity can be described as flow based. 
We are asking well-intentioned men and women to work in 
collaboration with one another to achieve employment equity goals 
within a reasonable time frame. That time frame is flexible 
depending on individual circumstances. We know everyone is not 
able to move ahead at the same pace and the commission will take 
that into consideration.
<P>
	We have a process for those few employers who do not comply 
with the legislation. We know from experience that the majority of 
employers bring a very positive attitude toward achieving the goals 
set out in Bill C-64 and the Employment Equity Act.
<P>
	Why is the Reform Party misrepresenting the legislation and 
misleading Canadians regarding its intent? Canadians support 
equality in the workplace for members of designated groups.
<P>
	I can assure hon. members opposite that they will not score 
political points by misconstruing the spirit of the legislation. The 
goal of Bill C-64 is not to place undue hardship on any employer 
who is making an honest effort to meet the spirit of the new act. I 
repeat again, because it seems members of the Reform are having 
as hard time grasping this, we are only asking for and we only 
expect that employers make all reasonable effort to comply with 
the act's provisions.
<P>
	I ask the hon. members of the Reform Party to consider their 
bogus argument about the necessity of meeting quotas. The bill 
specifically rules out quotas. It is that simple.
<P>
	We know from recent studies that the majority of people entering 
the labour force will come from members of designated groups. 
That is simply one more reason that employment equity makes 
good economic sense. It will help employers focus on accessing the 
skills of those productive and hard working individuals.
<P>
	This legislation is a positive step for Canadians. It will help us 
gain a diverse and highly skilled workforce that will ensure Canada 
a competitive edge in the rapidly  expanding global marketplace. 
For that reason I am pleased to be able to support Bill C-64.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Vic Althouse (Mackenzie, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
speak to this bill on employment equity, a concept with which I 
have no problem. We still need in our society, however enlightened 
it might tend to be, some recognition that not all aspects of our 
society are as accepting of visible minorities, aboriginals, females, 
people with handicaps in the workplace or in our society as is 
generally perceived to be most appropriate.
<P>
	I have no objection in society attempting to use the law as is 
being proposed in the equity bill to force this sort of compliance to 
avoid discrimination for any of the reasons this proposal lists.
<P>
	I am therefore basically in support of the idea of employment 
equity and the requirement that employers give equal opportunity 
for all people regardless of the circumstances of their birth or what 
life may have imposed on them by way of disability after birth.
<P>
<B>(1825 )</B>
<P>
	However, the bill has not done a good job of looking at the global 
economy of the new world order we are now living in, which has 
presented a much different form of employment than what this bill 
and what most of the legislation that governments have put 
together deal with. These kinds of bills and laws function on an 
employer-employee relationship. They are virtually toothless when 
it comes to a new world where more and more people are 
self-employed, where contracting, subcontracting and 
subcontracting the subcontracting goes on, so there are three, four 
and five levels of contract.
<P>
	As a consequence of that new practice it is virtually impossible 
to supply the kind of protection this bill proposes to do. If members 
do not believe me they should walk outside of the doors of this 
House. There is a program going on, the Peace Tower project, in 
which we have seen the most blatant treatment of an employee 
because she was female. The House, on whose territory this 
injustice took place, appears to be unable or unwilling to do 
anything about it. It is under the aegis of the Speaker but he seems 
unable to do anything. The job was contracted by the minister of 
public works who cannot find 10 minutes of time to even discuss it 
with me and whose officials actually aided the ejection of this 
woman and her fellow workers from the site. They had to leave 
their tools which they cannot recover.
<P>
	The several times they have attempted to recover the tools 
employees of Public Works and Government Services Canada have 
told them that they are disrupting the building site and that they 
cannot have their tools because the current contractor is using them 
to complete the job. The contractor forced them to leave the job site 
because they insisted on using a female engineer.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15438"> 15438 </A></B>
<P>
	If we are going to be believable in this Chamber in trying to 
deal with questions of inequality in the workplace we are going 
to have to recognize that very often in this new world order the 
workplace is run by people who have subcontracted and 
subcontracted those contracts to the point that it is impossible to 
hold the employer who makes those kinds of decisions, however 
arbitrary, unfair and normally illegal, responsible. We cannot do 
anything about it.
<P>
	As a consequence, the subcontractor has forced the building 
trades people, the masons who were working on the Peace Tower, 
off the job because they persisted in using a female engineer. He 
had no objection to her work. He was only objecting because she 
was female. He made that quite clear. He forced them off the job. 
They left their tools and they cannot recover them. They can go to 
court. They have due process. I have talked to members on the 
government side who have said: ``Use due process, that is what you 
have to do''.
<P>
	Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, you are aware that due process in 
this case is almost useless because her employer, the mason that 
hired her to be the engineer for his part of the project, is not the 
person who is forcing her off the site but the subcontractor above 
him. The Ontario Human Rights Commission has some trouble 
dealing with this.
<P>
	Others have advised me. Others of the legal profession from the 
government side have said: ``Look to the federal human rights 
commissioner. He is obviously the one who has to do this because 
it is on a federal site and it is for the federal houses of Parliament 
for Pete's sake''. Again the person that has pushed her off the site is 
not her employer and there seems to be nothing that the human 
rights commissioner can do in the case of this injustice.
<P>
<B>(1830)</B>

	I raised this briefly at second reading and I remind members on 
all sides that if this kind of injustice is to be permitted on our own 
grounds literally and figuratively and we can do nothing about it, 
what is the point of replicating the same type of legislation using 
the same requirements only on employers versus employees 
without taking into account the contractors and the subcontractors 
and all the other permutations that occur in business?
<P>
	What are we really accomplishing? We are accomplishing very 
little except perhaps to make the whole process and the whole 
political group of us in the House look rather silly.
<P>
	I keep preaching from my far corner. Very few people are in the 
House when I do my little rant on these things, but I hope the new 
ears hearing this each time take this to the rest of their colleagues 
and see if there is some way we can force compliance if not across 
the country at least on the acres of yard in front of the House.
<P>
	This is a great injustice and makes the whole process of 
attempting to get employment equity to permit females equal 
access to jobs as engineers or scientists or doctors or lawyers. It 
makes the whole process of the last 15 or 20 years look absolutely 
ridiculous.
<P>
	This woman is apparently considering going back to washing 
dishes because that is the only employment she can find at the 
moment. She had a job as an engineer. The subcontractor hiring her 
firm to work on the Peace Tower forced it off the job because it 
persisted in employing a woman engineer.
<P>
	For his efforts that subcontractor was rewarded with a further 
subcontract to work on the whole House of Commons instead of 
just the Peace Tower after he engaged in this process.
<P>
	I cannot let any debate or any discussion of an equity 
employment bill go by without reminding members of the House, 
and I hope some of the frontbenchers will take this to heart, that we 
have allowed a grave injustice just outside our doors. If any of the 
laws we pass in this place are to be taken seriously by people 
outside of Ottawa, we should be able to enforce what we have 
already made law numerous years ago when work gets done on our 
buildings on the confines of Parliament Hill.
<P>
	Until that happens I am afraid I will look sceptically at this new 
effort at achieving employment equity.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, listening to the 
last presentation, it proves the point that so much of this comes 
down to enforcement of what we already have.
<P>
	We have laws to protect against discrimination and obviously if 
those laws are implemented we need not to go any further or 
introduce any kind of new laws.
<P>
	I have not heard very much talk about what the business 
community is saying. Coming from that area I have to put some 
emphasis on what it is saying about the job equity program.
<P>
	I am a little annoyed that we should be dealing with this bill in 
the House which will basically institutionalize discrimination in 
the workplace. This is exactly what I feel Bill C-64 does, and the 
Liberal government should be ashamed of promoting this sort of 
archaic legislation.
<P>
	We have heard from many reform speakers now. It is absolutely 
clear why we oppose this bill. We are not racist. We are not sexist 
and those gurus of political correctness who try to pin that label on 
the opponents of affirmative action should be publicly condemned 
for their behaviour.
<P>
<B>(1835 )</B>
<P>
	Reformers know that the huge majority of Canadians are utterly 
opposed to setting up discriminatory quotas for the hiring and 
promotion of target groups such as visible minorities. Such 
discrimination is wrong, no matter what disguise we put on it or 
what name we put  on it. Calling it employment equity and calling 
the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15439"> 15439 </A></B>
<P>
quotas numerical targets does not change a thing. Everyone in the 
House should know that.
<P>
	For those who argue the wrongs of the past have to be corrected 
through measures such as these, two wrongs do not make a right. 
There was discrimination in the past and not everyone got a fair 
shake in life. That is terrible but we have come a long way and we 
are moving very quickly to right those wrongs. We have come a 
long way and now the UN even goes so far as to say we are the best 
country. I agree with that.
<P>
	The kind of big government, social engineering contained in the 
bill is utterly unconscionable. Canadians want less government 
interference in their lives, not more. This is especially true in the 
case of affirmative action. The role of government is to provide 
equality before the law and to prohibit discrimination. However, 
Bill C-64 does exactly the opposite.
<P>
	Bill C-64 enshrines inequality before the law. It encourages 
reverse discrimination. Perhaps worst of all, it propagates a victim 
mentality among our citizens. Minorities and women should think 
of themselves as equal partners in building the future of Canada. 
They should be encouraged to compete, to succeed and to provide 
for their families.
<P>
	Bill C-64 is absolutely terrible because it sends the wrong 
messages. It tells our women and visible minorities they are 
victims, that they are oppressed and that without special legislation 
they will be incapable of succeeding in our society. This message is 
not only false but is extremely counter productive and does nothing 
to build Canada for the 21st Century.
<P>
	Bill C-64 will create a tremendous number of problems for the 
country. They will go on and on and become greater and greater, 
much as the Americans have found since the introduction of their 
legislation in the sixties. Now they are having to remove it. There 
will be social costs and there will be economic costs among many 
other problems associated with this kind of legislation.
<P>
	As far as the social costs of affirmative action, there are many. 
To begin with, the bill promotes an unusual them versus us kind of 
confrontation in the workplace. This confrontation takes place on 
two levels. There is a confrontation between workers who have 
already been hired and there is a confrontation between job 
candidates.
<P>
	For job candidates the situation under affirmative action is very 
clear. If they are not a member of one of the target groups they are 
penalized. If they are they are entitled to special preference. Not 
only does this mean the all important merit principle is being 
overridden, but such discriminatory treatment will foster 
resentment among the majority against candidates who receive the 
special treatment. As the resentment builds it could very  easily 
lead to an ugly backlash against people from visible minorities 
when they are not really the problem at all.
<P>
	The problem is bad legislation. The problem is the government's 
ill conceived social engineering which will have very serious side 
effects.
<P>
	The first major social problem is that merit is not the sole reason 
for hiring under Bill C-64. Once the country slides down that 
slippery slope there is no telling where we will end up.
<P>
	Among those who are already working there are other serious 
problems associated with employment equity. The two most 
significant problems involve promotions and layoffs. In both these 
cases giving preference to certain employees over others can have 
devastating consequences not only for the efficiency of the 
business but for workplace harmony.
<P>
	Imagine a company with 100 employees struggling to make ends 
meet. Under these circumstances it is essential that everyone work 
as a team. The very future of the company depends on it. Let us 
assume ten people have to be laid off. Under market conditions the 
business would get rid of the ten people who are the most 
expendable. Under affirmative action, however, what would the 
company do? If certain employees were seen as exempt from these 
layoffs, how would this affect workplace team work and 
camaraderie? The answer is obvious and everyone in the House 
knows it.
<P>
<B>(1840)</B>
<P>
	The exact same situation would occur in the case of promotions. 
If employees feel their very livelihood and careers are being 
hindered by affirmative action they will strike back, and this is 
exactly what we do not want. The workplace should be an 
opportunity to succeed through skill and hard work. It should not 
be a place where Canadian citizens are penalized or rewarded for 
their skin colour or their sex.
<P>
	Beyond the very obvious social costs, there are also economic 
costs to this legislation. If we use the Ontario employment equity 
law as an example, the Chamber of Commerce estimated that a 
company with more than 500 employees would have to spend 
$100,000 just to comply with the paperwork. This figure does not 
even begin to factor in the intangibles caused by hiring, firing and 
promoting workers on the basis of race, sex or disability.
<P>
	In the U.S., California particularly, the total cost of affirmative 
action has been estimated as high as 4 per cent of GDP. That is 
exactly the same as what is spent on all the education programs in 
that state. Even if this is double the actual number it still translates 
into billions of dollars lost. In a time of global competition we must 
become efficient. We must not tie the hands of our businesses 
behind their backs.
<P>
	The U.S. is now abandoning this system of affirmative action 
because it did not work. It was one of those social  experiments of 
the 1960s. In Ontario the Harris government has decided to scrap 
the lousy affirmative action law of the previous NDP government. 
Why? It was too costly and because it would not work. The Ontario 
<P>

<B><A NAME="15440"> 15440 </A></B>
<P>
Liberal Party agrees completely and would also throw out this 
program had it been elected.
<P>
	I wonder why its federal counterparts are so utterly out of touch 
with the wishes of the Canadian public. Maybe they know what 
Canadians want but they simply do not care. Is it possible there is 
so much arrogance on the government side of the House that it 
thinks it knows better than the Canadian public? Will those 
paragons of political correctness in the Liberal benches rise up to 
save the country from its own folly?
<P>
	There are many flaws in this bill, many things we could explore. 
Unfortunately my time is soon up. It is late in the day. I ask 
everyone to think about Bill C-64 and the institutionalizing 
discrimination it causes. I ask everyone in the House to consider 
before they vote on this and think about the consequences for this 
great country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. With 
unanimous consent may we ask the House to consider it 6.51 p.m.?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is there unanimous consent?

	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 deemed 
to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="ENDANGEREDSPECIES">ENDANGERED SPECIES</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on June 11, 1992 the Canadian government signed the 
United Nations convention on biological diversity in which it made 
a commitment that this country would pass legislation to protect 
endangered species.
<P>
	More than three years later, eight of the twelve provinces and 
territories still have neither federal nor provincial legislation. 
There is no time to waste. Canada currently has 244 known 
endangered species. The number of species at risk has tripled in the 
past 10 years and the list continues to grow.
<P>
	On August 17 of this year the Minister of the Environment took 
the first step toward meeting Canada's obligation when she 
announced the legislative proposal for a Canadian endangered 
species protection act. Unfortunately the minister's proposal fails 
to live up to either the letter or the spirit of Canada's international 
commitment to protect endangered species. The proposal only 
applies to species that live in national parks or on other specified 
federal lands. It covers only 4 per cent of Canada's total land base 
and eliminates the north entirely.
<P>
	On September 28 of this year in the House I asked the minister if 
she would ensure effective protection of endangered species by 
strengthening the proposed new act. The minister admitted that the 
legislation did not cover as many species as the government would 
like and blamed it on the fact that provincial governments had 
jurisdiction in certain areas. Canadians concerned about the 
survival of these species cannot accept this excuse for ineffective 
legislation. A species threatened with extinction is of national 
importance.
<P>
	The federal government has more authority than the minister is 
willing to admit. Effective protection of endangered species 
requires federal leadership when the provinces refuse to act. For 
example, the provisions of the minister's proposal only apply to 
species found in Canada's oceans and not to freshwater fisheries, 
even though the Fisheries Act indicates that freshwater species are 
clearly within the federal government's jurisdiction.
<P>
	The proposed act could also be applied to all migratory species 
and not just those that happen to wander on to federal land. A few 
lucky species will have ``response statements'' prepared about 
<P>

<B><A NAME="15441"> 15441 </A></B>
<P>
them but no time limits  apply and the government will prepare 
recovery plans for affected species only if it feels like it.
<P>
	Truly effective legislation would require recovery plans for all 
endangered and threatened species and would prohibit the killing 
or harming of them. Habitat loss is the number one cause of species 
decline in Canada and is the main threat for approximately 80 per 
cent of Canada's endangered species. To effectively protect 
endangered species the legislation must protect the habitat they 
need to survive.
<P>
	The government has completely ignored the recommendation of 
the federal endangered species task force to prohibit any activities 
that would destroy the critical habitat of an endangered species.
<P>
	Realizing how important it is to identify and resolve potential 
conflicts before development begins, the task force also 
recommended that the legislation require advance review and 
approval for any proposed activity which could affect an 
endangered species or its habitat. This recommendation was not 
followed even though experience in the United States shows that 
advance review resolves almost all potential conflict between 
development and endangered species.
<P>
	I should mention on a related topic that today is the day the 
endangered spaces campaign is releasing its second book, an 
interim report or owner's manual. It is most important we 
remember how integrally spaces and species are tied together. I 
urge every member of Parliament to read the interim report and 
support its recommendations.
<P>
	The government says it is committed to protecting-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Unfortunately the member's time has 
expired.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lyle Vanclief (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the federal 
government is strongly committed to ensuring effective protection 
of Canada's endangered species, which is part of our rich biological 
heritage.
<P>
	Although certain aspects of the proposed legislation directly 
affect only a little more than 5 per cent of Canada's land base, it 
would also apply to federally managed species everywhere and 
federally managed marine areas.
<P>
<B>(1850)</B>
<P>
	The proposed legislation would establish a national listing 
process that would give legal recognition to all species in Canada at 
some risk of extinction regardless of where they occur. It is 
intended to form the federal component of a comprehensive 
national safety net for the country's most vulnerable species, a 
safety net in which the federal government does its part in 
co-operation with the provinces and the territories to ensure that 
species like the polar bear will continue to  grace not only our coins 
but also our vast northern landscape.
<P>
	With the co-operation of federal, provincial and territorial 
governments the proposed legislation would provide a strong 
national approach for the conservation of endangered species. This 
action will not intrude in provincial responsibilities. The federal 
government recognizes the common but differentiated 
responsibilities of the federal, provincial and territorial 
governments with respect to endangered species.
<P>
	The proposed legislation is intended to complement, not 
contradict, provincial and territorial actions. The federal 
government is prepared to do its part and encourages the provincial 
and territorial governments to do theirs to ensure a truly national 
approach for endangered species conservation. We are confident of 
their support.
<P>
	Canadians have a moral responsibility to ensure that future 
generations enjoy and benefit from the presence of diverse wildlife 
species. The federal, provincial and territorial governments must 
provide the required leadership and legislative tools.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="AGRICULTURE">AGRICULTURE</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Vic Althouse (Mackenzie, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, on October 
3, I rose to put a question to the minister of agriculture asking him 
to justify the apparent changes in policy direction that have 
occurred with regard to the $1.6 billion ex gratia payment to offset 
the decline in farmland prices that would result from cutting the 
Crow benefit. It was contained in the budget. It appeared that the 
$1.6 billion would go to land owners free of current capital gain 
tax. It would simply accrue to the land and therefore would not be 
taxable in the year received.
<P>
	Since that time a number of changes occurred. Some of them 
were hinted at in the budget speech but others were simply outright 
decisions that were made, notably changes to permit people who 
were renting the land to apply for some of the payment. However 
there was no similar treatment for those people in terms of a share 
they might negotiate from the land holder. Any share they might 
negotiate from the owner of the land would be taxable as income in 
the year received.
<P>
	They could not apply it to any land or property they might own 
now and were therefore treated differently. Because about 40 per 
cent of land in most provinces is rented it seems to some observers 
like a rather clever and devious way for the government to collect 
income tax on money it had announced was to be paid out on a 
non-taxable basis. That is one complaint that I raised.
<P>
	The other was that there seemed to be a very ill defined standard 
for what lands would be eligible. It looked as if all farmland, 
presumably land that was cultivated at one time or now and used 
for crops, would under the government's estimation lose value. 
Therefore this payment was presumably to go to those lands. Yet as  
the nature of the program became clearer land seeded to permanent 
crops, forage, alfalfa and so on, were not eligible simply by 
definition somewhere throughout the system.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="15442"> 15442 </A></B>
<P>
	Yet crops that were to be used for forage, such as barley or oats 
for cattle feed or livestock feed either as silage or as grain, are 
eligible. Even stranger, summer fallow which grows absolutely 
nothing was eligible on the same basis as land that was growing 
crops. This seemed to run contrary to everything the Department 
of Agriculture had been attempting to convey to farmers over the 
previous 10 or 15 years, namely to get into a diversity of crops, 
to plant crops that would hold the soil in place and keep down 
wind erosion. They were encouraging continuous cropping to keep 
stubble. I would submit that forage crops are also a form of 
continuous cropping. They hold the stubble and the ground. They 
are part of the diversification program, not only for use within the 
country but also for export.
<P>
	The government and perhaps some of the farm organizations that 
were negotiating with the government left those farmers off the list. 
I wanted to raise that in question period and again this evening in 
the adjournment debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lyle Vanclief (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the federal budget 
of last February did contain certain proposals on the payment to 
compensate for the ending of the Western Grain Transportation 
Act.
<P>
	At the time of the budget, the government made very clear its 
intentions to consult extensively with farm leaders on these 
proposals so that the program would be as fair and as workable as 
possible.
<P>
	In the budget we proposed that land which would be eligible for 
the $1.6 billion ex gratia payment was that land producing WGTA 
eligible crops and summer fallow. These provide reasonable 
approximation of the land base which benefit from the WGTA 
subsidy. This proposal was taken to farm leaders for discussion.
<P>
	Through these consultations, farm leaders accepted the 
government's proposal on eligible acres and agreed that forage not 
be included. Adding forage crops to the payment base would have 
significantly diluted the payment.
<P>
	In the case of who should receive the payment, again we took the 
government's proposal to pay landlords to farm leaders for 
discussion. Through consultations farm leaders told us they agreed 
with the proposal but felt those who rent farmland should also be 
somehow recognized in the program.
<P>
	Based on this advice, the application procedures have been 
designed to ensure that owners and renters reach an agreement on 
how part of the benefit may be passed on to renters. It is expected 
that in many instances this will occur through lower farmland 
rental rates.
<P>
	Through extensive meetings with farm leaders, the government 
was able to reach acceptance of the proposals on eligible acres. It 
was able to address the concerns of farm groups by adding a 
provision for renters in the application procedures for the program.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Pursuant to Standing Order 38, the 
motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted. 
Accordingly, the House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 
a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24.
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 6.57 p.m.)
