petition on behalf of about 125 people in my riding.

marriage in this country is indeed the union of a man and a woman 
to the exclusion of all others.  They are concerned that the 
government has failed to define this in legislation that would 
withstand a court challenge. They ask that the government take

second petition is signed by 178 individuals and highlights the 
concern of my constituents that there is legislation that would 
extend benefits based on a person's private sexual activity while 
excluding other types of dependent relationships.  The 
petitioners ask parliament to withdraw Bill C-23 and affirm 
through legislation that marriage is and will remain what it has 
always been, the union of one man and one woman to the exclusion 
of all others.

route mail couriers have not been allowed to bargain collectively 
to improve their wages and working conditions.  Since workers who 
deliver mail in cities have collective bargaining rights, the 
petitioners request that parliament repeal section 13(5) of the 
Canada Post Corporation Act to permit rural mail couriers to 
bargain collectively like urban mail workers.

</I></B></P><P align=left>She said:  Mr. Speaker, today is the day that the Canadian 
Alliance Party is able to set the agenda for debate in the House. 
The topic for debate, the issue which we wish to have debated 
today, is the issue of unlawful and unreasonable delays in 
providing to members of parliament documents under access to 
information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This may at first glance seem like a rather administrative, 
routine matter to be debated in the House of Commons, but in fact 
the issue goes to the very root of democracy.  Democracy means 
rule by the people, but clearly the people cannot govern in any 
effective or meaningful sense if they do not know what is 
happening, if they do not know what is going on, if they do not 
know what government is doing with their money and with their 
affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recent days we have come up against a refusal or delay or 
neglect of the government to follow legislative guidelines, that 
is the law with respect to the provision of information requested 
on behalf of the people of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an extremely serious matter.  I urge all members of the 
House to take it seriously.  If government is able to hide and 
cover the actions it is taking then clearly the transparency, 
openness and accountability which are necessary in a true 
democracy are being undermined and even destroyed.  Therefore we 
have brought forward the motion today for debate.  I will read it 
for the House and for Canadians: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That an Order of the House do issue for all departmental audit 
reports to be tabled within 15 days of their completion and 
permanently referred to the appropriate standing committees, that 
audit reports since January 1, 1999, be tabled within 15 days 
after the adoption of this motion, and that all audit reports 
requested under the Access to Information Act be tabled 
forthwith. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is so alarming about the motion is that it should not have 
been necessary.  Under the law, under the government's own 
guidelines and indeed pursuant to its own promises to Canadians, 
the motion should never have had to be brought before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a treasury board guideline that all departmental audit 
reports are public as soon as they are completed.  We should not 
be having to ask that those reports be tabled.  They should 
automatically be made public, but the guidelines of the 
government are being ignored and flouted by the government 
itself.  It is a shameful situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have asked that when these reports, these audits come 
forward, they be immediately referred to the appropriate standing 
committee of the House. 
Instead they are being hidden and kept under wraps.  We have had 
a very difficult time receiving them.  Even audits that have been 
produced years ago have not been forthcoming to committees of the 
House.

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also asking that all audit reports since January 1, 1999, 
be tabled within 15 days.  Again we should not have to ask that. 
This is a clear guideline already of government which it is not 
following.  We are also asking that all the audit reports we have 
requested under access to information be tabled immediately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are we asking for that?  It is because a number of audits 
the official opposition and other opposition parties have 
requested have not been provided as the law requires. The law 
requires that access to information requests be responded to 
within 30 days.  Contrary to the law, the government has now 
delayed some requests for audit reports for over 45 days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a member of the House of Commons Standing Committee on 
Human Resources Development.  The committee asked for two audits 
which were completed in 1991 and 1994 for the Department of Human 
Resources Development.  It was fully three weeks before a 
committee of the House was provided by that government department 
with the documents requested, documents which were done years 
ago.  There is absolutely no excuse for this lack of openness and 
responsiveness to clear direction and requests from members of 
the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The department kept saying it had to translate them.  In an 
officially bilingual country it is (a) beyond belief that those 
important documents had not already been provided in both 
official languages and (b) unbelievable that they could not have 
been translated very quickly with the first class translation 
services available in the House of Commons.  I have seen the 
government translate reams of material virtually overnight when 
it is motivated, but all of a sudden when it does not want 
documents to be provided to members of parliament all these 
procedural obstacles magically appear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is completely unacceptable.  I hope that every member of the 
House, whether on the opposition side or the government side, 
will be outraged by this abrogation of their clear privileges and 
of the clear duty owed to Canadians for openness, transparency 
and timeliness in the provision of information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are all aware that the government's refusal and delay in 
providing even the most basic information requested is due to the 
fact that it has been caught in the most flagrant and outrageous 
abuse and misuse of public money in the human resources 
department.  There is troubling evidence and increasing evidence 
that misuse and abuse is happening in other departments as well. 
I would like to advise the House that I am splitting my time with 
the member for Nanaimo—Cowichan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has gone into an alarming bunker mode.  That 
alarm was brought forcibly to the committee one week ago by the 
information commissioner, an independent individual appointed to 
be a watchdog over government to ensure that it carries out its 
responsibility to Canadians to be open and timely in the 
provision of information to which Canadians are entitled.

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The information commissioner tabled with the committee what I 
believe is an unprecedented document, a memo from the Treasury 
Board of Canada which essentially said two things.  One was to 
make sure it knew about any access requests brought forward.  Big 
brother is watching.  Instead of information just going out, now 
the highest reaches of the government are making sure they are 
told everything that is being requested.  The memo also asked for 
the audit reports so that it could look them over and decide how 
to deal with them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have some very troubling developments in the way the 
government is operating.  We see a lack of openness and 
transparency that Canadians have a right to demand and expect 
from their government.  We also see the tendency of the 
government to flout the rules, regulations, safeguards and even 
the laws put into place to ensure openness in government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This will be our concern for debate today.  We urge all members 
of the House to support our motion to put an end to what we see 
as a very difficult and unacceptable situation for the House and 
for Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I listened with some interest to the member opposite and 
was quite dismayed that she would use words such as flout the law 
and like skirting around the issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She has tried to grandstand on the precise issue of HRDC for way 
too long and to carve out her so-called 15 minutes of fame.  It 
will not work.  Canadians see through that kind of shenanigans by 
whatever that party is now calling itself, be it Reform or CCRAP, 
or Alliance of whatever nature it tries to be.  She has never 
once apologized to the House and to Canadians for the outrageous 
statements she has made vis-à-vis the HRDC department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here and now in this great house of democracy, the Parliament of 
Canada, I ask the member whether she has the internal fortitude 
to stand on her feet in the House and apologize for the 
outrageous statements she has made against people who are 
disabled and have received HRDC grants, students who have 
received HRDC, and people in need across this great country of 
ours.  Will she stand on her feet today to apologize and say full 
well that it was not, as she likes to say, a boondoggle but 
rather money well spent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of going after us on the government side for investments 
well made in terms of jobs and other things, will she state 
finally and categorically that she apologizes for the outrageous 
statements she has made repeatedly? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is outrageous that a 
member of parliament, an elected representative of the people of 
Canada, would ask for an apology from someone who is doing a job 
on behalf of the Canadian people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the member's constituents were listening to him just now, 
demanding an apology for someone holding his government to 
account and trying to stop it from stonewalling and hiding 
information to which the people of Canada are entitled by law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I notice the member is not dismayed that his own government is 
flouting the law of the land because the law of the land under 
the Access to Information Act says that documents requested must 
be provided within 30 days.  Access requests are now routinely 
delayed far past the 30 day limit.  Some of them, without any 
notice or request, have already been delayed for 45 days.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We have also received letters saying that we will not receive 
the information that we requested which, by law, we must receive 
within 30 days.  That is not being done.  In fact, we have been 
notified that we will not receive it for 60 or 90 days.  In other 
words, we will not receive information to which Canadians are 
entitled until after the House recesses for the summer in which 
case the government will be off the hook. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the member is dismayed by this clear breaking of the 
law by the government and the disrespect for Canadians that 
entails. 
<P><A NAME="LINK40"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo—Cowichan, Canadian Alliance):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to join in this most important debate. The 
motion before us should not be necessary. Unfortunately, the 
Liberal government has taken upon itself to eliminate or reduce 
the ability of any of the opposition parties to effectively hold 
the government accountable for the public good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1993 the government has used one form or another of time 
allocation over 60 times in the House of Commons.  That does not 
include the many times that committees have used similar tactics 
to limit or pre-ordain the witness list and the amount of time 
the committee will spend on a given topic or to select an issue 
and where or if the committee will travel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to the time allocations the government has imposed 
on all opposition parties in the House, I believe that it has 
made every attempt to thwart true democracy.  When the government 
attempts to hide the information that should by law be readily 
available to all members of the public, including the opposition 
parties, then we have a travesty of democracy. It is for this 
reason that the Canadian Alliance has brought forth this motion 
today. It is appalling that the official opposition must be 
forced to bring this motion forward.  Let us look at the 
government record.  Unfortunately it is not a very pretty sight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This past January the Minister of Human Resources Development 
held a hastily prepared news conference to break the bad news 
that an internal audit did not meet the standards that are 
expected by Treasury Board guidelines and more important, the 
standards of the general public. Although the minister has 
unsuccessfully attempted to overshadow the real reason that she 
suddenly came clean on this issue, the truth is easy to see for 
all who want to see it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She did not release the audit simply because she wanted to act 
in a transparent and clear manner.  She did not release the audit 
because the audit had just been completed and an update to the 
general public was therefore appropriate.  She did not release 
the audit because her colleagues in other ministries were 
conducting the affairs of government in an accountable manner. 
That would be too straightforward for the government and it does 
not like to do things in a straightforward manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No, the minister released the damning audit for one simple 
reason. The official opposition had filed an access to 
information request for it.  The official opposition had asked 
for it and both the minister and her officials knew that the 
report must have the government's spin prior to its falling into 
the hands of the opposition. The audit paints the Ministry of 
Human Resources Development in a terrible light.  Full disclosure 
is required; in fact, it is absolutely necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Within days of the access to information request being filed, 
the minister found herself in front of the cameras and media and 
the firestorm had begun.  The minister has felt the heat of the 
opposition in the House of Commons and the heat of the press 
throughout the country.  Even the spin doctors cannot control this 
one. The government has been caught in its own web of arrogance 
and will ultimately fail because of it.  Of that I am certain. We 
only wait for the day when it occurs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know the access to information guidelines.  For the 
benefit of those who do not, let me summarize the overall 
concept. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government maintains a vast database of information on 
everything that it does.  The access to information regulations 
state that the majority of this information is to be available to 
the public. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1035"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT7"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT7"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1035
<A HREF="#LINKT8"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recognize the benefits of the Internet in this part of the 
equation.  Many documents, including the words that we speak 
today, will be on the Internet by tomorrow, available to 
virtually anyone who has access to a computer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The guidelines also state that the citizens of Canada have 
access to these documents.  By filling out a simple request form 
and submitting it along with a $5 administration fee, they can 
ask for almost anything that the government has on record.  The 
guidelines are also very clear in the length of time that the 
department has in order to complete the access request.  All 
requests, by law, must be completed within 30 days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the reality of the situation.  Does the 
government meet its own guidelines?  Unfortunately the government 
does not even come close.  While many requests are submitted, the 
results are often extremely slow in returning. For example, the 
official opposition currently has 29 access to information 
requests that one government department, Human Resources 
Development Canada, is now late in responding to.  That should 
not come as a great surprise.  However, some responses are as 
much as 90 days overdue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some will ask is this is really important; is the opposition 
just being picky with its criticism?  The answers to these 
questions may be found in a quote from the information 
commissioner when he appeared before the standing committee on 
HRDC on March 28, 2000.  He stated, “The right of access is one 
of the cornerstones of our democratic process and one of the best 
tools available to ensure responsible government”.  The 
information commissioner, the person who oversees the access to 
information process for the federal Government of Canada, regards 
the right of access as one of the cornerstones of our democratic 
process and one of the best tools available to ensure responsible 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A cornerstone of our democratic process, that is what the 
government is sadly lacking.  Simply put, the party opposite 
lacks the integrity of a democratic government.  Its arrogance 
and lack of accountability have placed true democracy on the 
endangered species list. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not just some pie in the sky theory that my colleagues 
and I are addressing.  Listen to what Treasury Board stated in 
its letter of decision dated May 26, 1994.  The access to 
information policy is:  “To simplify the process for acquiring 
copies of reports, and to deliver on the government's commitment 
for more openness, the policy requires that departments make the 
final version of review reports, including internal audit and 
evaluation reports, accessible to the public”, and this is the 
really good part, “without requiring a formal access request”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>HRDC and Treasury Board are breaching their own policies by 
withholding this information until an access request is final. 
This is not acceptable.  Furthermore, it is not right.  Public 
access and disclosure is being grossly mismanaged.  Now, as a 
result of the negative report that has slammed HRDC, both 
Treasury Board and the Privy Council Office require that they be 
told what audits have been requested, what bad news is within 
them and what the official spin will be prior to their release. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Listen again to what the information commissioner stated on 
March 28, 2000 when he appeared before the standing committee on 
human resources development.  He said  “The problem, however, 
arises when the communication concerns of the government are 
allowed to take precedence over the public's right to timely 
access to information”.  I hope that the members of the 
government are listening today to what that means and what it 
says. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I respect any member of the House when we have philosophical 
differences of opinion.  When we are collectively trying to solve 
a problem, I may not agree with their proposed solution.  But it 
is a very sad day indeed when members of the public and the 
opposition parties are thwarted in their ability to have full 
disclosure to the government's activities.  With the loss of 
access to information is the loss of trust, the loss of public 
accountability and the loss of true democracy.

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the motion be amended by replacing the number “15” with 
the number “30”. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. For 
clarity's sake, did you read the motion to say the numbers 15 or 
the number?  I heard only number and it is plural. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I believe it is only one number but I 
will check the wording on the motion.  There is only one number 
in the motion.  The number is 15 and it is being replaced I 
understand with the number 30. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question is on the amendment.  The hon. member for 
Waterloo-Wellington.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I listened with some interest to the member for 
Nanaimo—Cowichan.  I was astounded to hear him try to take 
credit for somehow flushing out the government in this 
all-important area when in fact it was the minister herself who 
brought forward the audit results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it somewhat disconcerting that the members opposite, the 
Reformers, CCRAP party, alliance, or whatever they are these days 
would try to take credit.  They should apologize. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  It 
was only a day or two ago that the Speaker ruled specifically for 
the second time that the proper name of our party would be used. 
It is the Canadian Alliance.  I urge you to not allow other 
people to distort that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I had pointed out the name Canadian 
Alliance to the hon. member for Waterloo—Wellington.  I hope he 
will use it since that is the name of the official opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am glad to be told about 
the real name by the hon. member for Elk Island who not so 
recently called me a liar in the House.   It was so recorded in 
<I>Hansard</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I do not think we had better go 
there.  It would be better if we stayed with questions and 
comments on the speech of the hon. member for Nanaimo—Cowichan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I was thinking about the 
grandstanding by the hon. member for Calgary—Nose Hill.  I read 
a comment from her constituent, a Calgary psychologist, Dr. Allan 
Mandel, about her allegations with regard to the HRDC money which 
she raised this morning.   He said, “In my case, I can certainly 
say that this is absolutely not true”, and that he in fact had 
not donated any money especially to the Liberal Party. He said, 
“To me, this is a program to stimulate employment and to 
stimulate getting young workers into the workforce.   I think it 
is great”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Gina Cameron, program co-ordinator for the Beddington Heights 
Community Association in the member's own riding had this to say 
about her MP attacking these all-important programs:  “To say 
that they are a waste of money, she has not been in these doors, 
she has no concept of what goes on, so it is sort of probably an 
empty statement”—coming from the member for Calgary—Nose 
Hill—“I could not run an efficient, well-run program without 
it.  I really could not”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would say to her she should get into her constituency and try 
to see the good work that is done.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  The last presentation was made by the member for 
Nanaimo—Cowichan.  Any member who would like to make a comment 
or ask a question should be referring to the presentation made by 
him, not by the former speaker.  If the member wants to make 
political cheap shots at least they should be directed at what 
the member for Nanaimo—Cowichan said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The hon. member for 
Waterloo—Wellington can ask a question of the member for 
Nanaimo—Cowichan.  It is supposed to deal with his speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It may be a question that arose out of the other speech and 
there may be some connection so the Chair has been patient, but I 
agree with the hon. member that these are questions and comments 
on the speech of the hon. member for Nanaimo—Cowichan and not on 
the speech of the hon. member for Calgary—Nose Hill which is now 
finished.  I know the hon. member for Waterloo—Wellington will 
want to pose his question quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am getting to the hon. 
member for Nanaimo—Cowichan but I needed to build my case a bit. 
I was interested in the first ballot that went out from the 
United Alternative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are speaking now of audits, transparency and accountability. 
It printed 6,000 additional ballots and when it came down to the 
vote all of a sudden, according to one of its executive council 
members quoted in the Edmonton <I>Sun</I>, it ended up destroying 
the ballots.  This is a party that is trying to lecture us about 
accountability and about transparency.  It really is outrageous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I feel very slighted by the member.  I took time to make some 
very valid points and now he is going into the past history of 
the Canadian Alliance and the Reform Party.  He is not talking at 
all about what I had to say.  This again is an example of how 
democracy is thwarted in parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I think the hon. member for 
Waterloo—Wellington will want to come to the point very quickly 
with a question that is relevant to the speech of the hon. member 
for Nanaimo—Cowichan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  I will, Mr. Speaker.  Your judgment, as 
always, is dead on.  When the member for Medicine Hat called the 
programs wasteful, stupid, and garbage, and when the member for 
Cypress Hills—Grasslands called them a manure pile, I wondered 
if the hon. member for Nanaimo—Cowichan agreed with that.  I 
wonder if he agreed that loans to the— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I think to give him a reasonable 
amount of time to reply we will go to the hon. member for 
Nanaimo—Cowichan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am glad we have you up 
there guarding the interest of democracy.  Again I am astounded 
at the member who uses a smokescreen to deflect any kind of 
comments or any kind of good judgment we in the official 
opposition might bring to the motion by raising these kinds of 
issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to talk today about our concern about the lack of 
democracy in the House.  In the opinion of many Canadians, and 
certainly those of us in the official opposition, the House does 
not act upon democratic principles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The matter we are bringing to the House this morning is simply a 
case in point.  We as the official opposition and all Canadians 
across the country have a right to know what the government is 
doing.  We have filed access to information requests time after 
time and we do not get the answers.  That is the problem, and it 
would be nice if the hon. members across the way would address 
the problem and not deal in smokescreens. 
<P><A NAME="LINK43"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am honoured to split my time today with the hon. member for 
Mississauga West.  I wanted to pick up a bit on what I was 
talking about previously, simply that some members opposite have 
called the programs of HRDC, among other things, a manure pile, 
stupid, garbage, and such. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those members opposite do not understand how important money to 
the disabled, to students, to the elderly and to community groups 
across our great country really is.  They should take a lesson 
appropriate to knowing our country and determining that great 
things are done as a result of the money that flows through 
grants and contributions.  I remind them that with their holier 
than thou attitude it seems it is very easy for them to dish it 
out, but it sure seems not so easy for them to take it. 
Given their new alliance with their right wing friends perhaps 
they should try to develop thicker skin.  I think it would be 
more appropriate for the House.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We on the government side have processes and procedures in place 
whereby we fully understand internal audits and how best to 
proceed.  We deal with access in audit reports in a timely 
fashion.  I can say firsthand, as a former vice-chair of the 
public accounts committee and working with the Auditor General of 
Canada who is by the way, I need not remind members, an officer 
of the House, that we have dealt and do deal effectively with 
audits in a timely fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion being presented today is not only flawed, not only 
silly, but is unnecessary, redundant and otherwise unheard of and 
quite out of character.  In addition to creating additional 
paperwork, something members opposite seem to claim that they 
want to reduce, it would actually add to the number of days they 
would have to wait until they got access to this information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us think about that for a minute.  We are talking about 
members of a party that want to have things done quickly and 
efficiently.  They take the moral high ground and say that they 
made it all happen, that they put the minister of HRDC under a 
microscope and therefore must take credit for doing all these 
things.  The very motion they are proposing today would add time 
to the release of audits.  It would add time by approximately 15 
days.  That simply is ridiculous and not worthy even of those 
people opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the way, why should Canadians have to request audits anyway 
when we under government rules have audits released in a timely 
fashion in any event?  The smokescreen members opposite are 
trying to portray is quite ridiculous.  To have to request under 
access to information audits that we would in the normal course 
of events make public in any event is quite frivolous and, in 
fairness, vexatious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to remind the House of something that happened not 
so very long ago.  I was interested in reading in <I>The Hill 
Times</I> that it was one of the Reform members own researchers, I 
believe the name was Laurie Throness, who actually was on record 
as saying that the human resources department was one of the best 
departments in the Government of Canada when it came to 
responding to access to information requests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take full congratulations on behalf of the government from 
that wonderful researcher who seems to know what he or she is 
talking about.  It is appropriate to duly note that.  It was 
interesting to see and I think the researchers who are saying 
that should tell their political masters how important the 
Government of Canada is in this very important area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is somewhat encouraging to have a silver lining in the cloud 
today.  We share the view about the importance of internal 
audits.  The Government of Canada and we on this side of the 
House have always done that.  Audits are a critical tool for 
managers within the public service and an independent and 
objective means for parliamentarians to hold governments 
accountable.  We have had that process for many years and I think 
it has worked effectively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I see the motion before us today I know it is yet again 
that party opposite, the Alliance or whatever it calls itself, 
trying to grandstand and to score cheap political points where 
none can be scored.  After all, it has to do what it thinks is 
best for a party that is sinking fast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly the evidence shows that the government is committed to 
an effective and independent internal audit function.  We are 
taking the necessary steps in keeping with what we have always 
done to ensure that the internal audit function is spread 
throughout government in a meaningful, transparent and 
accountable fashion. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1055"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT10"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997, not long before the audit at HRDC, an independent 
review panel of recognized leaders in the management and 
accounting professions wrote a report on the modernization of 
comptrollership in the Government of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was a very important document.  The report made a number of 
observations about the role and practice of internal audit in the 
Government of Canada.  As a result, the Treasury Board 
Secretariat, to its credit, understood the requirements, 
recommendations and objectives of that report.  It indicated and 
undertook a comprehensive examination of the internal audit 
function. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The objective of that government-wide study was to set internal 
audit practices and policies standards geared to the management 
environment of today.  The study was largely conducted in the 
summer of 1999 and the draft report was completed in January 
2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to take a lot of the time of the House to go into 
the details of the study, but suffice it to say that over the 
last decade, especially and perhaps even beyond, the whole area 
of internal audit has evolved considerably.  That is important to 
note.  Not only do auditors audit under financial statement 
requirements and the rules of financial management. They also get 
into the whole area of management control and the framework of 
management control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I need not remind you, Mr. Speaker, and members of the House 
that it is now an extension of what auditors do not only in the 
Government of Canada but across Canada in other areas as well. 
That is important.  We need to make sure we have the kinds of 
checks and balances in place to ensure that the proper internal 
audits are conducted in a meaningful way which helps and assists 
not only governments but Canadians wherever they live in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the audit that came down there were a number of 
recommendations.  The first priority would be the development of 
a new treasury board policy on internal audit to set the stage 
for further development of the function.  That is important 
because it sets the stage, the foundation, where we now act in an 
appropriate fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second priority would be the development of a new set of 
professional standards to support the expanded role of an 
internal audit.  Again it recognizes that there is an important 
role in this area to play, and I believe rightfully so.  I think 
Canadians expect that.  Certainly we on this side of the House, 
unlike those people opposite, understand fully the importance of 
those kinds of things and do it effectively in the interest of 
all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the third of these cornerstones is that once they are 
in place the Treasury Board Secretariat must then work with the 
internal audit community to address human resource issues.  These 
include determining the required core competencies, recruitment, 
professional development and succession planning.  There are many 
more but I do not have time to go into them.  I would like to do 
so for the record but I cannot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These then underscore the commitment of the Government of Canada 
to move in this all important area in a meaningful fashion that 
underscores our party's commitment, the government's commitment 
under the leadership of the Prime Minister, to ensure that we do 
the kinds of audits necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I need not remind the House as the Prime Minister did not so 
long ago that years ago the auditor general would report once a 
year.  It was under our government that was changed to four times 
a year.  Why did we do that?  It was because we wanted to enable 
that the books of Canada and all audits were made in a timely 
fashion, were done so effectively and efficiently, and were done 
so knowing that Canadians expect transparency and accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By way of conclusion I want to say that the motion as presented 
is frivolous.  It is vexatious.  It is annoying.  It is not in 
the best interest of Canadians and what they should do.  It 
should be voted down because it is simply not something that 
needs to see the light of day. 
<P><A NAME="LINK44"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I listened pretty well to every word the hon. member 
said.  Just in passing, it is ironic that he would take a swipe 
at us and our researchers when he does not even have the name of 
the researcher right.  He cannot seem to get much right today.

<A HREF="#LINKT11"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At any rate, I would like to ask him a couple of questions.  The 
member said that the motion was vexatious, redundant and all of 
those things.  I agree with that.  If this government and if 
those departments were doing what they were supposed to do, as 
required by law, then we would have never even thought of this 
motion today.  We put it forward because it is a response to the 
actual facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other thing that is so very important is, what is the 
government trying to hide?  Why does it not release this 
information in a timely fashion?  It must be because it is not 
proud of what is in it.  Otherwise it would be having press 
conferences and blowing it up to all proportions.  The fact is, 
it is not only not proud of what is in it, it is ashamed of what 
is in it.  That is why it tries to suppress the information as 
long as possible and that is why this motion is very much in 
place today.  We are simply asking the government to behave in 
the fashion prescribed by law and it is not doing so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the member to retract his statement that the motion 
is redundant.  It is in fact very much in place and it needs to 
have the total support of the whole House to assure Canadians 
that there is accountability, openness and transparency in the 
way their money is being spent in this place, which is totally 
lacking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I need not be lectured by 
the member opposite when it comes to accountability and openness 
when his own party had to print 6,000 additional ballots when it 
came to a vote and then, before the real scoop got out, had to 
destroy those ballots.  Talk about duplicitous.  Talk about 
hypocrisy in the extreme.  It really is too much to take, 
especially from the member opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He should be congratulating the Government of Canada.  He should 
be congratulating all of us in terms of the openness and 
accountability that we, on this side of the House, portray on a 
day to day basis, year to year—decade to decade for that matter. 
We have implemented the kinds of checks and balances in our 
system which enable us to conduct internal audits and release 
them in a timely fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of bringing forward this frivolous kind of nonsense that 
only those people opposite seem capable of doing, he should be 
celebrating the Government of Canada and congratulating us for 
the kind of good work we do, not only on behalf of the people in 
this House, but on behalf of Canadians wherever they live in this 
great country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Medicine Hat has repeatedly referred to the 
grants and contributions portrayed by the HRDC minister as, I 
believe his words were, stupid and garbage.  He should instead 
take a lesson from his constituents and understand that those are 
in fact good investments made in the regions of Canada which 
assist Canadians wherever they are.  Instead of bad-mouthing 
people, constituents in the ridings and people across Canada, he 
should be celebrating and congratulating the Government of 
Canada, as should all those people opposite, whatever they term 
themselves as these days.  The member should be celebrating and 
saying what a wonderful thing that we on the government side are 
doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In direct response to the member for Elk Island, I would simply 
say that he should go back and do his homework.  As a former 
teacher he should know that we cannot do the kinds of things that 
members opposite are doing, state the kinds of things they state, 
without doing their homework.  He should do that.  If he did, he 
would begin to understand a little more about what it means to 
govern this great country of ours. 
<P><A NAME="LINK45"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
agree with much of what the hon. member said.  He suggested that 
the audit process is a vital tool for management to bring 
forward, with different eyes, through the auditor general, 
efficiency audits to identify some of the inefficiencies within 
the departments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently the auditor general appeared before the agriculture 
committee with three organizations, three departments of 
government.  The auditor general told the committee that it was 
necessary that committees be there to get the commitments from 
the departments in order that the departments follow what the 
auditor general puts in his reports.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the hon. member have difficulty having those audits 
tabled within 30 days of their presentation to the departments? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to say to the member 
opposite that we on the government side have made a very 
consistent effort to ensure that this very, very important audit 
information is released in a timely fashion, and we have done so 
in a manner consistent with normal auditing practices and in a 
way which underscores the government's commitment to 
accountability, to transparency and all of the things that 
Canadians, wherever they live in this great country of ours, 
determine to be important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am convinced, as are most Canadians, that we continue to do 
the right thing in this very important area and to do so 
consistent with the values of Canadians.  I think it is important 
that we continue to do so and that we do so in an efficient, 
effective, transparent and accountable way. 
<P><A NAME="LINK46"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I want to change the tone of the debate a bit and the direction, 
because I think there is something fundamental in the nature of 
an opposition party which puts forward on its opposition day a 
motion which suggests that the government is being dishonest and 
that funds are not going to the right people in the communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can appreciate the fact that opposition members might disagree 
with government programs.  They might disagree with the direction 
we take.  They might disagree with where the money goes in terms 
of helping certain people in the community.  If I were on that 
side and they were on this side, I might have some questions 
about what was happening.  That is a scary scenario, I admit, but 
it is obviously the role of the opposition to question and to 
hold government to account.  I have no problem with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What bothers me about this almost incessant attempt to get at 
the HRDC grants and other government grants that are community 
based and go to help people in the community is that while they 
may succeed in the public's mind in marking up, if you will, the 
government, they do serious damage to the community groups and 
the people who need the help.  Members opposite know full well 
that the audit procedure has improved dramatically since this 
government came to office.  However, I do not want to stand here 
and spend my time simply defending the government.  I want to 
talk about some of the programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that HRDC, for example, helps to fund the Ontario March 
of Dimes.  What is the role of the Ontario March of Dimes?  It is 
to help adults with disabilities integrate into the community. If 
that program is in jeopardy because the opposition is in 
hysterics about questions to do with audits and things that were 
actually instituted by the minister and the government, then I 
would suggest to members opposite that they do a disservice to 
that organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I received a frantic phone call two Fridays ago in my office on 
Parliament Hill from the chief administrator of the Canadian 
Mental Health Association.  He told me that people in the area 
HRDC office were so frightened and afraid to move that they would 
not release the money so that he could pay the staff.  The 
Canadian Mental Health Association could in fact be put in 
jeopardy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We corrected the problem.  We contacted the office and the money 
flowed in time for people to be paid and for that organization, 
which does tremendous work in all of our communities across 
Canada, to live up to its mandate.  But why should it be put in 
jeopardy so that opposition politicians can simply mark up a 
minister or mark up the government, or score what some might call 
cheap political points? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last Thursday evening in Mississauga I was pleased to be part of 
an event put on by Community Living Mississauga.  Many members of 
the House were part of it, even some members of the opposition. 
A roast is held every year by members of Community Living.  I 
think they have been doing it for 22 years.  This year, as one of 
the roasters said, they scraped the bottom of the barrel and I 
was the one they were roasting.

<A HREF="#LINKT13"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was delighted to be put in that position, mainly because I 
knew at the end of the night that the outcome would be a 
successful fundraising event for Community Living.  Including an 
auction item, we raised close to $70,000 in one evening for 
Community Living Mississauga. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The event is vitally important because of the young people it 
supports, young people with mental handicaps who need help.  Are 
these people funded directly by HRDC?  No, they are not.  They 
are funded by the social services programs at the provincial 
level, which are in turn partially funded by the CHST from the 
federal government.  This is not about claiming credit and saying 
that we are a great government because we are giving all of this 
money to those groups; this is about the bottom line and the 
impact when the rubber hits the road in helping these young 
Canadians and in helping organizations deliver services to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A young man was born 19 years ago by the name of Tyler 
Williamson.  Tyler was born to Laurie and Jane Williamson.  He 
was autistic.  Many people may have seen the movie <I>Rain 
Man</I>, in which Dustin Hoffman portrayed an autistic young man. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many people would recognize the incredible talents of Mr. 
Hoffman in portraying that autistic young man.  Tyler had those 
same types of gifts; not exactly the same in terms of 
mathematical skills perhaps, but he was a very special 
individual.  He passed away a month ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tyler fought a four-year battle with leukemia, but what he 
achieved in his short 19 years, by working with the organizations 
at Community Living, and what his mom and dad achieved, was truly 
miraculous.  His sister, Taylor, actually donated bone marrow 
to him as he went through this very debilitating time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was a young man who, if he had not had Community Living, 
sure, he would have had the support of his mother and dad, his 
sister, and the support of his aunts and uncles and many friends. 
Tyler was known as the guy in charge of the keys around his dad's 
car dealership, Laurie Williamson Pontiac Buick in Erin Mills, 
Mississauga.  He would take care of the keys.  Everybody would 
run to Tyler to get the keys for the car, the back shed or 
whatever was needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was an active young man in the community, but I would venture 
to say, and I am absolutely sure that Laurie, Jane and Taylor 
would say, that without the support of Community Living their 
lives would have been much more difficult.  While it was a 
difficult time for them, and a tragic time for all to lose Tyler, 
there was at least some recognition that he fought a tremendous 
battle, not only against cancer and autism, but against attitudes 
in the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the important goals of Community Living is: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that the whole community is enriched when people who 
have a handicap have opportunities to live alongside their 
non-handicapped neighbours. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is so incredibly important, because the community is 
actually enriched as a result of young people like Tyler 
Williamson being able to participate in community events.  The 
real tragedy, scandal and frightening aspect is the entire 
acrimonious debate surrounding the issue of precious taxpayer 
money.  It should be on what is even more precious, the Tyler 
Williamson and Community Living and all the young people who 
benefit from it.

Wild Rose in it showing less partisanship, having some fun. 
There was a purpose to the video and he understood that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I can disagree strongly, passionately, almost physically 
in some instances with the philosophies, comments and issues that 
are raised by the former Reform Party, I cannot believe that 
individually they are so inhuman as to want to jeopardize the 
good programs that are put in place by the men and women who work 
at places like HRDC or who work at social services departments in 
our provincial governments, funded in part by the federal tax 
grants that are passed on through the CHST. 
The mitigating damage as this flows downstream is 
potentially catastrophic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish members opposite could come up with a motion with some 
teeth to it. The big issue today is health care.  We should be 
debating that issue.  Have we put enough money into health care? 
Are we simply writing a blank cheque to the provinces so they can 
reduce taxes while cutting health care?  These are important 
issues that need to be debated here, not an issue relating to an 
administrative matter such as when an audit gets reported. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask members to think of the Tyler Williamsons of Community 
Living and what this money has done to help Canadians with and 
without disabilities right across the country. 
<P><A NAME="LINK47"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Canadian 
Alliance):</B> Mr. Speaker, the member made the point that access 
to information threatens the programs he described.  I would like 
to know how openness and transparency threatens the programs he 
described and the moneys that government is spending.  How in the 
wide world can accountability of government spending threaten 
these programs? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have to admit that I 
have no idea what the member is talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is open.  Access to information is clearly 
available.  The Internet can be used.  There is no problem 
getting information. The government increased the number of times 
that the auditor general performs audits from once a year to four 
times a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That party's own member is chair of the public accounts 
committee on which I also sit.  The auditor general brings forth 
extremely detailed audits on various departments that he 
determines he wants to audit. It is not the government and not 
the opposition, but the auditor general who determines which 
audits to bring forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The chair does a good job on the committee; I have no 
problem with him. But I am constantly amazed at the lack of 
research and lack of in-depth questions by members of the 
opposition in asking the auditor about his audits. 
In fact, the record would show that as a member of that 
committee, I ask more difficult questions in relation to 
government programs than they do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the opposition members want 
to get information out to their constituents, let them do their 
homework.  Let them dig into the auditor general's reports. There 
is more information in them than they could possibly begin to 
disseminate.  They could at least start by recognizing that 
the programs exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is open and accessible and information is clearly 
available to Canadians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK48"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, there is a contradiction here.  The member says that ATI 
requests, all the things we are doing, are somehow threatening 
these programs. Yet he turns around and says that everything is 
open.  Either it is or it is not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact of the matter is that treasury board gave instructions 
that these documents, including internal audits, should be made 
public without being asked for.  The fact is that is not being 
done.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, he keeps pointing out that these are such wonderful 
programs.  That is a debate for another day.  It could well be. 
I agree that some of these programs are worthwhile but the 
political slush fund programs are not.  They will come to light 
if there is openness and transparency.  However, that is not 
there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the member to tell the House that he will support the 
motion of the day which says that there is going to be openness 
and accountability as already required by law.  He claims it is 
being done but it is not.  Therefore, I expect him to vote in 
favour of the motion today in order to make sure that what is the 
law will be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the very point the member 
makes in referring to political slush funds makes my point.  By 
taking grants that are used to support organizations in our 
community, whether it is the March of Dimes, Community Living or 
whatever, and effectively throwing everything into a big pot and 
calling it a political slush fund, denigrates the use of those 
funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Canadians read the front page of the <I>National Post</I> 
they get excited because they somehow think the government has 
misplaced a billion dollars.  We know that is not true, yet 
opposition members stand in this place every day and consistently 
say it even though it is not true. What they are doing is 
damaging the good work that is being done by all of these 
organizations because people get frightened. They are afraid that 
some reporter is going to show up.  They are frightened to write 
a cheque even though it is a properly approved, sanctioned and 
processed grant that should go to those people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, if I may, Mr. Speaker, I referred to raising money 
for Community Living on the Thursday night.  There was also a 
scholarship fund established, led by Jim Murray of J.J. Barnicke 
in the amount of $5,000 in the name of Tyler Williamson to help 
young people with disabilities.  This is the community helping 
out in addition to government grants.  Anyone who wants to 
contribute to that can contact Community Living.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would be 
remiss if I did not return the serve by the hon. member for 
Mississauga West, who informs us that it is absolutely incorrect 
and totally ridiculous to say that there is a $1 billion hole in 
the HRDC grants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could agree with him to a point that he is not completely 
wrong on this.  We do know, however, that the amount that has 
been lost, wasted or misspent lies between the Prime Minister's 
$252.11 figure and the $1 billion mentioned at one point in the 
media. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it $1 million, $2 million or $50 million?  This is the figure 
the motion is intended to find out.  We know it is perhaps not 
$1 billion; however, as the Prime Minister has already stated, we 
know it was $252.11—but he was slightly wrong in his figures—and 
this is what today's motion is intended to clarify. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In passing, it should be noted that the member never answered 
the question on whether he supported the motion or not.  The 
question was relatively clear, there was no need for 50% of the 
votes plus one, just his opinion, but we will know it in due 
course. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now come back to the motion put forward by the Canadian 
Alliance member for Calgary—Nose Hill. 
For the benefit of the parliamentarians who often talk of 
nothing and everything and who will see that we support the 
motion of the Canadian Alliance—they will think it has to do with 
Quebec's separation—I will read you the motion.  Our friends 
opposite often have very delicate and sensitive hearing.  This 
is why I am going to repeat this motion slowly but surely so 
they may understand what we are talking about today.  The motion 
reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That an Order of the House do issue for all departmental audit 
reports to be tabled within 15 days of their completion and 
permanently referred to the appropriate standing committees— 
</UL>
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1125"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT17"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT17"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1125
<A HREF="#LINKT18"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT16"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does that mean? The motion is asking for three things. 
Under the Treasury Board standards, every federal department 
must complete an internal audit report, as did the Department of 
Human Resources Development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Calgary—Nose Hill is asking that these 
internal audit reports be automatically referred to the 
appropriate standing committees. This means that the report from 
the Department of Finance would go to the Standing Committee on 
Finance, the report from Fisheries and Oceans would go to the 
Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans, and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should not be necessary for an opposition member to make a 
request under the Access to Information Act to have such reports 
released. 
It should be formal, normal procedure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I have time, I will explain later on that this is not just a 
wish expressed by the opposition, but rather a standard set by 
the Treasury Board and also a wish expressed by the auditor 
general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second thing motion is asking for is that all internal audit 
reports since January 1, 1999, be tabled within 15 days after 
the adoption of the motion. 
If passed, the motion would ensure that in the future all 
internal audit reports would be referred to the appropriate 
committees. This requirement would also apply to internal audit 
reports completed since January 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, the motion calls for all access to information requests 
for internal audit reports previous to January 1999 to also be 
made public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As everyone knows, this motion follows on the heels of the huge 
HRDC scandal, which raises many questions about how departments 
operate, and about their transparency as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will list a series of responsibilities that must be recognized 
within departments. First, public officials are accountable. 
Ministerial responsibility ought to be restored. There is also 
the need for the government to be transparent, which is 
emphasized in this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the public have a right to know what is going on in 
the public service and particularly where their money is being 
spent.  Too often, we hear the argument “HRDC's program and 
grants are a good thing because some non-profit agency in our 
riding received assistance, which was helpful”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not have a problem with that.  If $60 of every $100 does 
go into grants, we have no problem with that, as all the 
opposition parties have said.  What we want, however, is for 
$100 of every $100 to be well spent and not $60 to help the less 
fortunate members of society and $40 to reward Liberals.  This 
is clear to everyone.  People want to know where their money is 
going. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members are elected to represent their constituents and not just 
to pat the government on the back, as the member for 
Waterloo—Wellington does all too often, without looking any 
deeper.  For some members, everything is just fine, and they do 
not look any deeper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Opposition members, however, are public watchdogs who must keep 
an eye on the money spent, wasted or badly invested by the 
Treasury.  Officials who are not elected, such as Deputy 
Minister Mel Cappe at the time, must also be held accountable 
because they are spending taxpayers' money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This should not all fall to MPs. 
There are also the unelected, such as the Clerk of the Privy 
Council, Mel Cappe, who was Deputy Minister of Human Resources 
Development, negotiator for the transfer of training programs 
from Ottawa to Quebec, and also Deputy Minister of the 
Environment.  If I remember correctly, I had the privilege of 
travelling across Canada with him on the Environmental 
Protection Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps we also need to look at what went on at Environment 
during his reign.  This deputy minister has a long history in 
the federal government and we believe that unelected officials 
must also be answerable to the Canadian taxpayers for their 
actions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is important. 
I have listened to the speeches of the previous two speakers 
with their references to accountability, and I believe they have 
left out a few things, either by accident or by design. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1130"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT18"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT18"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1130
<A HREF="#LINKT19"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT17"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, it is important to look at how the government is 
obliged to be accountable. This has nothing to do with it being 
a good government, with their being nice guys, with their 
Liberal values properly. There are obligations, laws, 
regulations.  I shall try to be very brief, because one could 
easily take 30 minutes on accountability alone, or even give a 
post-graduate course in public administration on it, but I am 
going to touch on it very briefly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First we have the budget presented by the Minister of Finance. 
At the start of the fiscal year, the Minister of Finance 
presents his budget, which reveals how much money, by 
department, the minister and the officials may spend.  Also, if 
we look carefully at the budget, we can often tell which 
programs will have money invested in them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, on the subject of the budget, we wonder how the 
Minister of Finance can announce his budget for this year, next 
year, the other year and so on, over five years.  The U.S.S.R. 
used to present five year budgets, and we know what happened 
there recently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What can we say about the Minister of Finance, who brings down a 
budget that provides for tax cuts, among other things, and who 
the next day says “Perhaps this will happen faster than what I 
forecast in the budget yesterday or the day before”.  Did he 
present a responsible budget or not?  The Minister of Finance 
presents a budget containing figures for the coming year.  Then, 
something the public knows less about are the estimates, what we 
call the little blue books, which come out each year for each of 
the programs and provide more precisely how the funds in the 
budget will be spent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also—the member for Mississauga mentioned it earlier— 
the Standing Committee on Public Accounts, which examines the 
audits and recommendations of the auditor general. 
I sit on the Standing Committee on Public Accounts, and it is 
true unfortunately that a number of members arrive at the 
committee less well prepared than they should be and that the 
committee should be as unpartisan as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each year, before appearing  before the Standing Committee on 
Public Accounts, the auditor general reports to the House. He 
can now, under legislation, table four reports a year.  The fact 
that he can table four reports a year has advantages and 
disadvantages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the auditor general tabled only one report a year, the 
report was expected and followed up and his recommendations got 
fairly considerable media attention. 
The disadvantage of having an annual report was that if a 
serious flaw in the administration of public funds were 
discovered early in the audit, the auditor general often had to 
wait eight, nine or ten months before tabling his report and 
reporting the flaw to the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, it is a real advantage for the auditor general to be able to 
table four reports every year. However, because the auditor 
general now tables a report every three months, there is 
somewhat less public interest and media attention. Heaven knows 
that what the auditor general's reports say on the sound 
management of taxpayers' money in Canada and Quebec is extremely 
important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the auditor general tables his chapter by chapter report, 
the Standing Committee on Public Accounts reviews each chapter 
with designated officials. The departments must also—and this 
is a rather strict accountability requirement—table annual 
reports. Each department must table an annual report in which it 
explains how it intends to spend the money allocated to it by 
the Department of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to examine the departments' annual reports, to review 
their expenditures, parliamentarians have the right, under the 
Access to Information Act, to ask for documents that are not of 
a public nature, and they can request specific information on 
the management of accounts by departments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general can also reply to written questions received 
from parliamentarians. 
My colleague, the hon. member for 
Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques asked a very 
specific question to the auditor general concerning the 
Department of Human Resources Development and the auditor 
general will reply, not in his next report but in a written 
answer, as to whether he will pursue the matter and investigate 
that department. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1135"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT19"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT19"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1135

<A HREF="#LINKT18"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the Financial Administration Act, with which all 
departments must comply.  We obtain a great deal of information, 
it is true—I have just mentioned several types of information 
that the government and the departments are obliged, by 
regulation, to release to parliamentarians—but this information 
system must also be improved, as the President of the Treasury 
Board pointed out in her report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members, whatever their party—Bloc Quebecois or Canadian 
Alliance—too often face large hurdles when requesting more 
critical information, information more specific to the 
management of public accounts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to remind members of the public that, when the 
auditor general tables his report, he is making observations. 
The auditor general cannot force the government to take specific 
action.  There is nothing binding about his observations: they 
are only recommendations.  So the auditor general recommends to 
the government that it take specific action to correct a 
particular situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In general, the recommendations made by the auditor general, who 
is non-partisan, are implemented by the government.  But, as the 
auditor general pointed out in his last appearance before the 
Standing Committee on Human Resources Development and the Status 
of Persons with Disabilities, in the ten years he has been 
making recommendations about the disbursement of grants and 
contributions by Human Resources Development Canada, these 
recommendations have not been implemented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can therefore see that some departments take the auditor 
general's recommendations into consideration and institute 
specific corrective action.  But there are two departments which 
have long been corrupt and in which a miracle will be needed to 
put things right and they are Human Resources Development Canada 
and National Defence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These will be two of the last departments that I hope and 
believe the auditor general will examine before he concludes his 
excellent work, because he is leaving us in one or two years to 
take up very important duties within an international 
organization.  Perhaps he will be followed by the Minister of 
Finance, who knows? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the United States, for instance, when the auditor general, or 
the person who has the same duties there, submits a report, the 
government and the various departments are required to be 
accountable to the public; accountability is an obligation.  It 
can be seen that his role is far more restricted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here in Canada, what has happened in the past 20 years or so to 
modify the auditor general's role is that he has been instructed 
that, instead of tabling one big document once a year, he should 
divide it in four and report four times a year.  Then they said 
to themselves that everything is fine, that they did not have to 
do anything else for another 20 years.  As the auditor general 
was doing a good job, everything was just great.  In our 
opinion, the auditor general ought to have closer control over 
government administration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the present auditor general, Mr. Desautels, leaves, the 
Liberals will be the ones to appoint his replacement for the 
next seven years. 
I am certain, I am convinced, that the Liberals are going to 
appoint an auditor general on his abilities, not his political 
allegiance.  He may be in place for the next Liberal mandate, 
but he certainly will be there for the next government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This auditor general needs to be recognized as impartial and 
non-partisan.  When he makes recommendations, all 
parliamentarians and taxpayers must assign to them the 
importance they deserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as ministerial responsibility is concerned, there is a 
flaw as far as accountability is concerned.  Only the minister 
currently in charge of a department are be answerable for the 
actions of that department. 
In that context, we saw how the current Minister for 
International Trade washed his hands of any responsibility and 
even refused to answer, this after having said in his adopted 
city of Paris “Yes, I will answer the questions that will be 
asked of me on this issue”. But the Minister for International 
Trade has said nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current Minister of Human Resources Development said “I do 
not have to answer, because this did not take place under my 
administration”. When things start to heat up in a department, 
they change ministers, thus avoiding having to answer questions.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened at Human Resources Development? An internal audit 
report was tabled, as is required. They did not do so because 
they are nice people or because they wanted to see how things 
were going in their department. Internal audit reports are 
important documents and they are compulsory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister had known about the internal audit report for a 
long time, but the information was only disclosed on February 
21. Was there a cover up attempt? We have our opinion on this, 
but let us say that I am merely raising the question. 
As we know, asking the question often brings the response.  Did 
they hope these data would not become public in the House of 
Commons?  What data are contained in the internal audit report? 
It is this report that is the model for the other reports we 
want tabled in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seven categories of programs were analyzed in the report.  The 
programs analyzed totalled grants and contributions of around 
$1 billion a year for three years.  There is therefore $3 billion 
in programs that were analyzed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The internal audit report prepared by officials within the 
Department of Human Resources Development revealed significant 
problems in program management.  Grants were awarded when no 
application had been made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked people in my riding “Is it easy to obtain a grant from 
the federal government before you apply?”.  They replied “It is 
so hard to get one when you have applied that if you get 
$252.11”, as the Prime Minister pointed out, “and you spend 
$250, they want the $2.11 back and they are after you until you 
have paid back the $2.11”.  Management at HRDC is so efficient 
with quotas that they can even cut benefits to the unemployed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At section 6.5.1 of a Treasury Board internal document on 
internal auditing, the President of the Treasury Board asks the 
government and says that departments should expect these 
internal reports will be made public, not only under the Access 
to Information Act, but by the intrinsic desire of the various 
departments to make them public, as the motion by our colleague 
from the Canadian Alliance requests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She asks to have these reports be released to parliamentarians 
and the Canadian public so that we may know where the money goes 
and ensure that the money duly earned by Canadian taxpayers 
which is paid in taxes to the federal government is wisely 
invested. 
<P><A NAME="LINK50"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac—Mégantic, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
member for Repentigny has given us an overview of spending and 
of the money that makes its way into the Minister of Finance's 
coffers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He mentioned the scandal at Human Resources Development Canada, 
with its new minister who is unfortunately not very up on 
matters or familiar with all the issues, because it was her 
predecessor who was responsible.  But since he is afraid to 
answer, it is left to the minister or her parliamentary 
secretary to field questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate the member on giving the background and telling 
us about the one to three billion dollars that were probably 
misspent.  I would also like to know what the member for 
Repentigny thinks about the advertising inserts the federal 
government sprang for in all Ontario's daily newspapers in an 
attempt to pin the blame directly on Ontario's premier, Mike 
Harris. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This advertising appeared in both languages and I cite the part 
in black “Last year, the Government of Canada's share of 
Ontario's health care spending was 55%”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are only numbers of course and sometimes a malicious spin 
is put on them.  What premiers and provincial finance ministers 
want is for payments to be restored to 1994 levels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are not asking for an increase.  They know that budgets 
have been slashed.  Jean Charest, when he was here, said that, 
if Canada's health care system was in disarray, the Prime 
Minister, and he pointed at him, was responsible.  He pointed at 
the Prime Minister, the member for Saint-Maurice, as he said 
this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, the federal government has paid for advertising in all of 
Ontario's daily newspapers. 
This will cost goodness only knows how much, probably the better 
part of $1 million.  Instead of putting this money into health 
care, it is going after Mike Harris, probably to damage his 
credibility with Ontario voters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know what the member for Repentigny thinks about 
this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
Frontenac—Mégantic for his question.  The government shows 
partisan leanings too often, with examples such as this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week, however, there was a federal-provincial meeting of 
ministers of health, focusing on Canadians' urgent priorities in 
connection with the health system.  A consensus was reached—and 
this is often what people hear, or want to hear from the 
government, as my colleague from Frontenac—Mégantic has said—on 
the restoration of transfer payments for health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal Minister of Health said “It is not my responsibility 
any more. It is up to the premiers”.  The Prime Minister said “A 
meeting is scheduled in August or September, and I will discuss 
it with my provincial counterparts at that time”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can see the contempt with which the government treats matters 
that are under provincial jurisdiction, according to the 
Constitution, in this instance health.  When we call for the 
restoration of transfer payments, they come at us with all kinds 
of figures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to say that the government is robbing people, for 
that would be unparliamentary language.  I will, however, give 
an example from outside parliament.  I put it this way to the 
people in my riding “It is sort of like someone stealing $100 
from me, then coming back in a week or two to tell me he would 
give me back $20”.  As if I were supposed to be grateful that he 
stole just $80.  That is more or less what the government is 
saying to us “Come on now, I borrowed money from you without 
your permission, but you need to thank me because I am giving 
one-quarter of it back, or one-third, or some other amount”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are asking is to have back, not the interest on the 
money borrowed without our permission, but the money itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, to complement the motion by the Canadian Alliance 
member, section 6.5 of the Treasury Board manual, which I was 
not able to read earlier, provides, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In accordance with the principles of the Access to Information 
Act, government information should be available to the public. 
Departments should develop cost-effective means— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know what cost-effective means in this context. 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—to ensure that review reports are accessible to the public 
without requiring a formal request under the Access to 
Information Act. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a request by Treasury Board to make public internal 
audit reports “without requiring a formal request under the 
Access to Information Act”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is being asked to do as the President of the 
Treasury Board asks, apply the policies of this government and 
the wishes of this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members will see, consistent as they are, the Liberals will 
not apply their policy, they will not support their request and 
will not apply the standards set by the Treasury Board.  It is a 
bit of a paradox.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
opposition day motion by the former Reform Party, as I understand 
it, calls for an audit of all government programs to be tabled in 
a more prompt fashion and for better and easier access to 
information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our caucus does not disagree with either of those points.  They 
are both valid points.  However, after reading the motion this 
morning at our caucus meeting my first reaction was that it was a 
waste of a good opposition day.  What a terrible thing to 
squander an opportunity to hold the government accountable on so 
many pressing issues.  What a shame that party is so devoid of 
ideas that it has to nitpick about relatively insignificant 
things when there are so many pressing issues that we could be 
talking about in the House of Commons today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After reading the motion I felt that it was very poorly crafted. 
I could hardly understand what it meant, and once I did 
understand, I thought it was a shame.  We could have used this 
time today.  It must be one of the luxuries of being the official 
opposition in that it has more opportunities for these opposition 
day motions.   We do not treat our opposition days lightly.  If 
my party had been given the opportunity to choose the topic of 
debate for a whole day in this hallowed Chamber, I would like to 
think that we would have found something of more significance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could talk for a day about a national housing strategy and 
about being the only developed nation in the world that has no 
national housing strategy.  We could talk about a commitment to 
full employment and about putting the whole country back to work. 
Would that not be a theme worth dedicating one day of debate to? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are so many issues.  We could talk about saving our 
national health care system.  Why are we not talking about that 
in this golden opportunity we have to choose the topic of debate? 
We could talk about cleaning up the environment.  How often do we 
hear that debated in the House of Commons while we, as Canadians, 
are busy poisoning our own nest to the point where we will not be 
able to live here anymore if we do not do something about it? 
That is not being debated in the House of Commons today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Frankly, we are talking about nitpicking.  We are talking about 
little incidental administrative details.  Is that the worst 
thing that party can think of to accuse the ruling party of, that 
they are poor administrators?  How cruel.  What a condemning 
comment.  What a waste of an opportunity and it saddens me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will speak to the motion because, as I said, we do not 
disagree with the idea of more accountability and transparency, 
although those words are getting to be such a cliché that I am 
not sure they have any meaning anymore.  They are the two most 
overused words in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We agree with the whole concept of increased accountability on 
spending on government programs.  We do agree with the former 
Reform Party.  What does one become when one is no longer a 
reformer?  If one is no longer interested in that anymore, one 
must be a conformer.  The opposite of a reformist is a 
conformist.  Maybe that is what we should be calling them now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do come from diametrically opposed positions.  Our party and 
that party may agree on this one issue of increased access to 
information, et cetera, but it is very transparent. The one thing 
that is truly transparent is what motivated the Reform Party to 
debate this motion today.  It is not even a call for greater 
accountability.  It is that it disagrees with government spending 
on social programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What it boils down to and the reason the Reform Party keeps 
hammering mercilessly away at government spending is that it 
disagrees with public investment in a human resources strategy at 
any level.  It disagrees with public spending whether it is for 
human resources, income maintenance or access to services for the 
disabled.  Any public spending is bad.  All things private are 
good.  If one tears down the former Reformers' political 
ideology, that is about as basic as it can be put.  Public bad; 
private good.  No more public spending is really what their 
message is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We disagree wholeheartedly because our party believes that 
government not only has a role in public spending for social 
services but it has an obligation.  One of the finest things we 
do as government is that we do our best to distribute the wealth 
to care for those who need it most in our communities.

former Reform Party is that if it ever did have the authority, 
heaven forbid— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  I 
think it is really a very simple thing to get the name of the 
party right.  The Speaker ruled somewhat over a week ago and 
ruled again when the name was being misused.  The name of the 
party is Canadian Alliance and it is not asking a great deal to 
have the member just follow that Speaker's ruling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I am sure the hon. 
member for Winnipeg Centre is duly admonished. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am happy to co-operate.  I 
will call the party by its proper name. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing I would ask the movers of the motion today to take 
into consideration is that one of the reasons we are having a 
difficult time administering complicated government programs 
might be the fact that the ruling party, the government, has been 
cutting, hacking and slashing jobs in the public sector to such a 
degree that it is perhaps getting more difficult to actually do 
the necessary follow up on these programs.  Under the questions 
and comments portion of my speech, perhaps we could talk about 
that somewhat.  How can we possibly take 50,000 jobs out of the 
public sector, increase the workload and still expect the same 
access to services? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public sector has been cut, reduced and slashed to the point 
where even right-wing analysts are looking at the public service 
and wondering if they have gone too far; if they will have to do 
a massive hiring to try to plug some of the massive holes that 
were left. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every time the government cuts the public sector it seems to cut 
the people who are most valuable, the people in the middle band 
of experience, the people who have been there for 20 years and 
maybe would take an early option, an opportunity to retire 
earlier.  We cannot replace those people overnight.  It is not 
like flicking a light switch on and off.  Once we cut those 
50,000 jobs we cannot just say tomorrow that we went too far and 
we should get them back.  They are not coming back.  They have 
already slipped away and the damage has already been done.  We 
are fond of saying that some cuts do not heal.  The cuts to the 
public sector will not heal easily and certainly not overnight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I will be splitting my time with the member for 
Vancouver East. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the real motivations that the official opposition had in 
putting this motion forward was to draw criticism again to public 
spending programs like the transitional jobs fund.  This is a 
sensitive point for myself as well coming from the riding of 
Winnipeg Centre.  We were horrified to learn, even though we are 
the third poorest riding in the country, with unemployment levels 
of 13% and 14%, the third lowest per capita income per family and 
the highest incidence of poverty, that we did not qualify for any 
of the transitional jobs fund money.  We were just as horrified 
as anybody else that the Minister of HRDC's riding qualified with 
an unemployment rate of about 7% and my riding, with an 
unemployment rate of almost 14%, did not qualify. The public 
certainly needed to know that something untoward was going on 
with that one particular program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the government was pressed on the issue more and more facts 
started to surface, things that people cannot be comfortable 
with.  All Canadians were shocked as the truth started to 
surface.  The House leader for the government side had his binder 
ready and any time a member from one of the ridings stood up to 
question this, it would be thrown back to the member “You 
probably qualify for all kinds of other grants.  You might not 
get any transitional jobs fund grants but you do get other kinds 
of HRDC spending”.  We do and we appreciate that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the process of this debate, we learned that my riding gets 
more HRDC funding than any other riding in the country.  I am 
quite proud of that.  It means that the people in my riding have 
been aggressively trying to get some federal spending going on in 
the inner city of Winnipeg.  As transfer payments are cut or 
reduced year after year, we needed to get that flow of dollars 
coming to us in some way or another.  Thankfully, the people in 
my riding have been creative enough, quite often with the help of 
our office, to avail themselves of the various programs that can 
help the situation in my riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have watched the federal transfer payments dwindle.  In the 
short time that I have paying attention to politics, we have seen 
the established program funding system chucked out the window and 
in its place we saw the Canada health and social transfer.

<A HREF="#LINKT23"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is something that the National Council on Welfare called 
the most disastrous social policy initiative this country has 
ever seen.  It could see the writing on the wall that when the 
Canada health and social transfer came in there was going to be 
trouble.  Really what the federal government was trying to do was 
distance itself from any obligation to social spending across the 
country and to offload that burden on to the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First the government provided block funding for health, post 
secondary education and social services, then it started 
dwindling it away.  From $19 billion worth of CHST, with the bat 
of an eye it went to $11.5 billion per year for all the 
provinces.  Now the government is slowly inching it back up a 
billion at a time.  I think it is back up to $14.5 billion in 
total spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are supposed to toot the government's horn and cheer that it 
is going to put some of the money back which has been cut so 
drastically from that side of social spending, but really it is 
still four or five billion dollars short from when the CHST was 
initiated in 1996. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So it is a bit of a smoke and mirrors game and it leaves us no 
choice but to aggressively go after any kind of program spending 
that we possibly can in the riding of Winnipeg Centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To sum up my brief remarks today, I am disappointed that the 
Reform Party, or the former Reform Party, could not have been 
more creative in choosing a topic for debate today.  It certainly 
must be completely devoid of ideas if the worst thing it can 
accuse the government of is being poor bookkeepers.  There are 
plenty of other travesties that the government is guilty of which 
we would love to point out had we the opportunity to choose the 
subject of debate today. 
<P><A NAME="LINK52"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today after my colleague from Winnipeg Centre, a former 
member of the CCF, to speak in support of the motion that is 
before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to begin my remarks by saying that I just came from the 
human resources development committee where we had the President 
of the Treasury Board appearing before the committee.  It is 
quite an interesting debate that is taking place to really 
examine the relationship of a department like HRDC with the 
treasury board and to try to figure out what rules are in place 
to ensure that there is financial accountability for the 
expenditure of public funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just a couple of weeks ago we had the auditor general before 
that committee.  He said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot help but express frustration with the way the government 
manages grants and contributions in general.  Our audit work in 
various departments back to 1977 has identified persistent 
shortcomings, from problems with compliance with program 
authorities to weaknesses in program design, instances of poor 
controls, and insufficient measurements and reporting of 
performance.  We continue to find many of the same kinds of 
problems each time we audit grant and contribution programs.  The 
recent internal audit at HRDC again pointed to the same types of 
problems. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that is a real condemnation of the way the government 
has managed grants and contributions and the expenditure of 
public funds.  Although this motion before us today is fairly 
narrow in scope, I think it does afford us the opportunity to 
examine in a public realm, and to bring to public light, the 
inner workings of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague from Winnipeg Centre said earlier, obviously the 
issue that we are grappling with is not just an issue of 
financial administration and financial management.  It is also an 
issue of political management of grants and contributions in 
HRDC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the very beginning of this scandal, the members of the New 
Democratic Party have been very clear in calling for a full 
disclosure of information.  In fact, the motion before us today 
is within that realm of trying to ensure that there are 
procedures in place to make sure that audits are tabled in a 
timely manner and that access to information is provided in a 
timely manner. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1205"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT24"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Looking back over the debate that has unfolded in the last more 
than two months, it is amazing that in the beginning weeks 
members of the opposition had a hell of a time even getting 
information about moneys that were spent in the transitional jobs 
funds, the Canada jobs funds and other human resource development 
programs.  Member after member got up in question period and in 
committees, and in the media through access to information, tried 
to pull that information out from the government in order to get 
a sense of what the picture was really about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember the government House leader, with his huge binder, 
slipping the pages to the Prime Minister so that information 
could be doled out little bit by little bit, as it suited the 
government.  I thought to myself, what a travesty of the way to 
do public business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of public disclosure, of transparency in government 
workings, of financial administration as an important part of a 
democratic institution, parliament, is of great concern to 
Canadians.  Maybe a couple of years ago somebody would have 
looked at a motion like this and asked why we would want to 
debate it.  But I think this motion and what is underneath it, 
the substance of what lies beneath it in terms of the very 
political management of these huge funds, is something that more 
and more Canadians are very concerned about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to say that the NDP from the very beginning has not 
only called for disclosure and a full audit by the auditor 
general, it has also made it very clear that from its point of 
view it supports public expenditure of funds on job development 
and job creation programs.  It thinks that it is a wise and 
credible way in which to expend public money but the problem is 
it must be done in a way where the rules are clear, consistent 
and where there is transparency so that Canadians can be assured, 
no matter what region or city they are in, that the rules 
operating in their region are the same as the rules in another 
region, with the understanding of course that there are 
differences across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things that has really concerned me, representing a 
riding that has high unemployment and very high poverty levels, 
is that Vancouver East, my riding, did not qualify for 
transitional jobs funds apparently until we found out that these 
pockets of unemployment existed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has really been a very disturbing exercise to unravel and to 
deconstruct what has happened with the grants and contributions 
program and to learn that not only were audits and 
recommendations from the auditor general's office ignored for 
more than 20 years, but that the rules that have been put in 
place seem to be made up as the government goes along.  They seem 
to be made up in a way that is convenient to suit the political 
fashion of the day, to dole out some money here or there  and, 
interestingly enough, to very profitable large businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Job development and job creation should be community based.  We 
have the reality that of the 100 most profitable businesses in 
Canada, 49 of them received some kind of grant or contribution 
from the federal government.  I think most Canadians would kind 
of scratch their head and ask, what is the priority there?  I 
could think of many other instances where those funds could be 
better expended to create long term sustainable jobs in a local 
community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other matter that I want to mention briefly is, as we have 
now sort of uncovered what is going on in HRDC and recognize the 
magnitude of the problem and the scandal that has unfolded, what 
has not come out very strongly is the fact that the decisions by 
the Liberal government to cut back the civil service has really 
had an impact as well.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just a couple of days ago I had a visit from the Financial 
Administration Offices Association that worked for the federal 
government.  It pointed out some quite alarming facts.  These are 
folks who provide financial administration.  They are the folks 
who within the system should be in a place to figure out when 
things are going wrong and to provide the necessary financial 
controls.  What I found out from the association is that it has 
suffered major cutbacks of about one-third which has seriously 
impaired its ability to work effectively within various 
departments to make sure that the necessary financial controls 
are in place. That is just one small instance of how this picture 
has gone so terribly wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say in closing that the NDP supports the opposition 
motion that is before us today, but clearly we do not believe 
that it goes far enough.  This is just the tip of the iceberg. We 
want to see timely audits that are made public.  We want to make 
sure that MPs and parties are not running around in circles 
trying to get access to information.  We do not want to see 
10,000 pages of material dumped on members that it is very 
difficult to make any kind of sense of.  This is about democratic 
disclosure. It is about ensuring that there is transparency in 
government operations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More than that, it is also about political accountability of the 
minister and of the government to ensure that these public funds 
are expended in a way that is fair, open and consistent.  The 
evidence shows us that this clearly has not been the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will support the motion and we will also continue to bring 
forward other issues and questions about the management of funds 
in HRDC. 
<P><A NAME="LINK53"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will 
be splitting my time with the hon. member for Brandon—Souris. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is with pleasure today that I speak on this votable supply 
motion which will effectively encourage and instil a greater 
sense of accountability in this place.  I think it is extremely 
important that we should expect from governments at least the 
same level of accountability, and I would suggest an even greater 
level of financial accountability that we expect from private 
corporations.  Private corporations and publicly traded 
corporations require through the auditing process a greater level 
of accountability in terms of their bookkeeping and the auditing 
of their statements than in fact this government seems to deem 
appropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been a secular decline in the role of the private 
member since the late 1960s.  Commensurate with that there has 
been an increased amount of power in the cabinet and ultimately 
in the PMO.  As such, there has been a reduction in the level of 
parliamentary scrutiny over spending and again starting in the 
late 1960s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would argue it would benefit all members of the House and all 
Canadians, regardless of political affiliation, if we were to 
restore greater levels of parliamentary accountability over 
spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a time when the estimates for departments were debated 
here in the House of Commons, scrutinized by committee of the 
whole.  I would propose, as we did in the PC party's prebudget 
position last year, that we should restore a system which would 
provide the ability for parliament to actually scrutinize the 
estimates of a certain number of departments each year in the 
House of Commons without a time limit.  This would ensure that 
first, the minister has to be very aware of what is going on 
within his or her department, but also that Canadians who are 
paying among the highest taxes, business and personal taxes, in 
the industrialized world, will be ensured that their 
money—again, it is their money, it is not the government's 
money—is being invested or spent in ways that are consistent 
with the goals and the aims of Canadian taxpayers.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether one agrees or disagrees with the nature of some of the 
government spending is immaterial in some ways.  What is most 
important, and what the motion speaks to, is that whatever 
government spending occurs the government is held accountable 
through an audit process that is open, transparent and clear to 
Canadians on an ongoing basis to show that the government is 
maintaining taxpayer money in a way that is appropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The PC Party is supporting the motion.  The accountability issue 
is critical.  We should not have to go through what we went 
through in recent weeks with the HRDC debacle in trying as 
members of parliament to get information that should have been 
available openly, transparently and instantly, and then having 
the dissemination of an immense amount of information in one day, 
to the extent that it almost became impossible to absorb and deal 
with it in an effective way.  This kind of information should be 
available on an ongoing basis and all Canadians would benefit 
from it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion addresses some of the issues from the perspective of 
parliamentary involvement in this very important area of 
spending, but we would like to see parliament move further in 
this direction.  We would like to see the restoration of the 
right to debate the estimates in the House of Commons and in 
committee of the whole, which would provide greater levels of 
scrutiny over the spending of taxpayer money.  This would also 
increase the role of the private member whether that member was 
sitting on the backbenches of the Liberal government or on the 
opposition benches.  It would benefit all of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In these times of hyper competitiveness on the global stage when 
taxes are comparatively higher in Canada than they are for our 
trading partners, we must recognize it becomes doubly important 
that taxpayer money be spent in such a way that Canadians are 
aware of where the money is being spent.  The government should 
take very seriously its fiduciary role in maintaining the proper 
levels of financial procedural control over these investments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion goes in the right direction, but we should also 
reconsider the involvement of government departments.  Prior to 
the HRDC scandal I was not aware of the degree to which the 
government was clearly involved in projects that it should not 
have been involved in.  I was naive enough to believe that a lot 
of the pork barrelling and use of taxpayer money to buy support 
in an election had subsided.  I thought we were in a new age and 
that all parties in the House recognized the importance of 
creating sound economic policies and environments to create 
economic growth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Direct government involvement in investing in some of these 
businesses may have been considered less important or less 
effective than it would have been at one point.  I saw some of 
the most egregious examples of government spending with HRDC. I 
think $500,000 were given to Wal-Mart to build a store that it 
would have built anyway.  I forget the exact sum but I believe 
$300,000 were given to a company to move 30 kilometres from one 
member's riding to a minister's riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of these examples smack of the type of old style politics 
of which Canadians have been skeptical.  They have lost faith in 
governments and institutions.  Any structure we could put in 
place to ensure greater levels of procedural accountability and 
audit accountability would be very positive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the PC Party are supporting the motion.  We hope it is 
just one of a number of steps that we can take to create in a 
multi-partisan or non-partisan way greater levels of 
accountability and scrutiny over taxpayer money in parliament.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is a pleasure to speak to this supply day motion from the party 
formerly known as Reform.  In fact the motion should have been 
put forward.  I heard a previous speaker from the New Democratic 
Party suggest that it was unnecessary to bring the issue before 
the House and that there were other priorities and other issues 
that we could be talking about which certainly had a greater 
resonance now with Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I disagree to a certain extent because this issue certainly does 
resonate with Canadians.  It speaks to the specific management 
capabilities of the government of the country to control and put 
into place the necessary services required by Canadians.  There 
has to be some control over that either in the House with 
parliamentarians or with administrators at the top of 
departments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a fan of internal efficiency audits.  If I can go back a 
bit into a previous lifetime when I was involved in municipal 
politics, my administrator of the day and I set up a complete 
process by which we would identify specific departments within 
that municipal entity and then put into place internal efficiency 
audits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why we did that was not to witch hunt.  We did not suggest that 
we or outside auditors could do the job any better. We looked at 
the operations with different eyes, especially operations that 
have been in place for a long time.  Whether it be municipal 
governments, provincial governments or the federal government, 
there is a tendency, if the bureaucracy has been in place for a 
while, to do the job by taking the path of least resistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The path of least resistance may not necessarily be the best way 
to attain the necessary efficiencies within the department. 
Bringing in outside eyes allows someone else to see how better 
the operation could run.  It is not a witch hunt.  It is simply a 
matter of listing the way the job is completed now, the numbers 
of steps that have to be taken for necessary approval processes 
and perhaps identifying ways of doing the job better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what happens in the federal government with the auditor 
general's department.  I am a fan of the auditor general.  Mr. 
Desautels does his job extremely well.  Members of his staff are 
extremely competent.  When they go into a department they do not 
go in for a witch hunt.  They go in simply to look at the 
operations and say what could be done better or what could be 
done in a different fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of what has been said today in the House has a tendency to 
focus on HRDC because it has been the audit that has been put 
forward with the most regularity over the last two months and has 
identified certain deficiencies within the particular department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>HRDC is just one of the departments within the federal 
bureaucracy.   Let me give a little example.  The auditor 
general, Mr. Desautels, appeared before the agriculture committee 
last week.   Four specific departments of agriculture were there. 
Mr. Desautels and his staff went through the audit with us as 
members of that committee and highlighted some of the areas where 
we could improve upon the service delivery of those departments, 
whether it be on cost recovery, which we have talked about in the 
House at great length in terms of agriculture, or whether it be 
an accounting process which in fact would bring forward some 
deficiencies within the department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the committee questioned the departments it was given some 
commitments from those departmental heads, which I expected to 
have regardless.  We had an audit.  We showed them the 
deficiencies. They were responsible to put into place in their 
departments changes within their operations to try to comply with 
those recommendations. 
They told us as committee members, as parliamentarians, that they 
would comply with those recommendations.

<A HREF="#LINKT28"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked the auditor general a question and he said that he was 
very glad to hear that the departments would comply with those 
recommendations.  I was a bit shocked because I assumed it was 
automatic that the departments would follow the auditor general's 
recommendations and make the necessary changes, but that is not 
the way the system works.  There has to be a watchdog.  There has 
to be a backstop.  The parliamentarians in committee are the 
watchdog and the backstop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was pleased to be able to say to the departmental heads that 
we would follow up on it on a regular basis over the next 12 
months and that we would insist their operations become more 
efficient.  The auditor general certainly thanked us for the job 
we performed in the whole process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion today speaks specifically to that requirement of 
parliamentarians.  It simply says that when we have an internal 
efficiency audit we must make sure the audit is tabled with the 
committee within 30 days of its being presented to the 
department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot for the life of me understand why any member of the 
sitting government would not agree with that.  It is their job as 
well as our job to make sure that internal audits which give 
efficiency reports are seen and are acted upon.  To hide them or 
not to react to them is a dereliction of duty.  It is an 
abdication of duty.  It is necessary that those reports be 
tabled, so why would the government not agree on its own behalf 
to ensure proper timeline and the process? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we did internal audits at the municipal level we made them 
available to the department to put forward its comments on the 
recommendations.  We then took the audits, the recommendations 
from the auditor and the reports from the departmental heads on 
the way they would comply with the recommendations, to council 
and ultimately to the public.  Those were done in a necessary 
process.  The public demands and the public deserves to know 
exactly how services are being delivered and that the money is 
being expended in an efficient manner.  That is all the motion 
speaks to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the motion says is that when we do an internal audit, which 
we want to have, with which we agree and which we say Mr. 
Desautels has the mandate, the right and the requirement to put 
forward to the public, we should ask him to bring it forward to 
the departments.  That is fair ball.  It should be taken to HRDC, 
to agriculture, to finance, to the treasury board, to defence or 
to any department he wants to, so that the departments can look 
at the recommendations, put their comments forward and in 30 days 
report the audit back to committee.  Where better can we deal 
with an audit than publicly at a committee table?  There is 
absolutely no reason the government should oppose that type of 
resolution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. colleague from Kings—Hants spoke eloquently with 
respect to the private-public requirements and to the fact that 
as a federal government we were the watchdogs of the public 
purse.  That is the absolute essence of what the audit speaks to, 
the watchdog of the public purse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government is not prepared to bring forward audits in a 
timely fashion then it is saying that we as parliamentarians 
should not be the watchdog of the public purse.  That is wrong, 
absolutely wrong.  I would ask hon. members to support the 
resolution as in fact our party will support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk just briefly about access to information. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1230"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Access to information has been a very important tool for us and 
members of other parties.  We require access to information 
because the departments have not been forthcoming when we have 
asked for information with respect to audits and other 
information.  I would prefer not to have to file another access 
to information request in my life in parliament.  Then I could 
honestly say to my constituents and other constituents in this 
great country that there is openness and transparency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier it was said that access and transparency are probably 
the two most overworked words in parliament and I agree. We 
should be working toward correcting the inefficiencies and making 
sure it is open and accessible. 
<P><A NAME="LINK55"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the two members of the party who spoke touched on it 
briefly. Perhaps they would explicitly comment on the response of 
the government today that this is a vexatious waste of time and 
that the motion we have brought forward is unnecessary.  That 
totally ignores the fact, and I stress the word fact, that access 
to information requests are long overdue and are past the 30 day 
limit as required by law. Yet the Liberal government members are 
denying this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to have the member comment on the Liberal 
government's ineptness.  I do not want to use that word but it is 
really mismanaging the financial affairs of the country.  It is 
in continual denial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member for Elk Island 
is absolutely correct.  I would like to indicate to the member 
for Elk Island that the members who spoke are from the 
Progressive Conservative Party rather than that other party, but 
we support the motion before us today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree.  To simply refer to this as vexatious speaks to the 
attitude of the government when it says because we question the 
ability for other members, opposition members as well as 
backbench members, to get information on a particular department 
that we are interfering with the operations of the government. 
That is not correct.  We must make the government and bureaucrats 
accountable for public dollars that are spent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To be perfectly honest, I am surprised that the Liberals will 
not stand up and support this.  It is just good management.  It 
is good management tactics that are done in any private or public 
corporation.  Why the government would hide audits, hide access 
to those audits or not allow those audits to be available to 
members of parliament really disturbs me. It is saying that it 
will reward inefficient management, it will not question it and 
it will continue in the same fashion it has been doing over the 
last seven years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Elk Island is absolutely correct.  The terms that 
have been used by the government should not be used with respect 
to this particular motion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK56"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is again my honour to stand in the House to speak to a very 
good motion.  The motion before us is an interesting one. It puts 
the government of the day into the dilemma of either voting for 
the motion which makes good sense, or voting against it which 
means that it wants to continue its policy of cover-up and not 
dealing honestly and openly with all of the facts on many 
financial issues that have come forward from time to time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the best ways of providing accountability in government 
is to have openness. When some access to information requests 
that I put in were returned to me, we were dismayed that there 
was so much whiteout. In fact there were pages and pages of blank 
paper. 
The code on the blank paper was that it was personal and 
therefore could not be disclosed.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My contention was then, is now and shall continue to be that the 
instant it is public money, it should become public information. 
In other words when I as a member of parliament spend my office 
budget, I believe that office budget should be accessible to the 
public.  The people of my riding should know how their member of 
parliament managed the money that was entrusted to him for 
managing his office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister of a department must account properly not only for 
his or her own expenditures with respect to the manner in which 
the minister handles the ministry but also the expenditures 
within the ministry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I just noticed that my colleague has arrived so I 
now want to inform you that I will be sharing my time with the 
hon. member for Prince Albert.  I did not want to advise you 
until he was physically here because I could easily speak for 20 
minutes on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many years ago when my wife and I were first married we moved to 
a little town in Alberta called Duchess.  It had a population of 
some 200 people.  It was a really good town and had a lot of fine 
people.  One of my friends from the big city asked how I could 
stand to live in that little town with everyone knowing what I 
was doing.  I shrugged my shoulders and said “I do not plan on 
doing anything bad so it does not matter.  Let them know what I 
am doing”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that small town I was the whole math department in the high 
school; I was the department head and the total staff. I did that 
job for three years in that delightful community.  We have many 
fond memories. We are looking forward to going to a reunion of 
the class I had way back in the early sixties.  It is hard to 
imagine that those youngsters are now in their forties and 
fifties.  I will be really interested in picking up on that and 
seeing how they are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was accountable.  When I walked down the street everybody knew 
the math teacher was walking from his home to the school.  It was 
such a small town that I lived on the east edge of town and the 
school was on the outskirts of the west end and it took me five 
minutes to walk there.  It was a wonderful time.  It underlined 
my basic philosophy which I have learned from home which is that 
one deals openly and honestly with people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it distressing that we have this motion today. First of 
all, as one of the Liberal members said, it should be redundant. 
He said it is redundant.  I would change the wording simply to 
say that this motion should be redundant. We should not have to 
use a day of debate in the House of Commons to debate a motion 
which says that the government should obey the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not do that in any other case.  We do not say to citizens 
that today we are going to have a debate and we want people to 
obey the law about murdering others, or on another day we are 
going to debate that people should obey the law and not steal 
from others. We do not revisit old bills, motions and government 
decisions in this way for other things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been a blatant breach of treasury board guidelines and 
of decisions which are properly made and should be enforced. 
Here we are as the official opposition debating whether or not 
the government should actually obey the law, whether it should 
obey the rules.  My very strong contention is that it should. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some time ago treasury board put out a directive saying these 
internal documents which are basically report cards on the 
operation of the departments should be made public. It should not 
be necessary to file access to information requests in order to 
access them. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1240"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT32"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT32"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1240

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is quite ironic that the government will make that decision. 
It will have a big fanfare when announcing that decision and will 
say to the people of Canada “Look how wonderful and accountable 
we are.  Here we are offering information”.   That is wonderful. 
It makes a great press release.  It makes a great press 
conference.  But what happens when it comes time to release the 
document?  It is not released.  The government just does not do 
it, hence the motion today.  Why does the government not insist 
that the departments follow treasury board guidelines?  One of 
them is being breached. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To make matters worse, when some member of the public, or in our 
case a member of the official opposition, files an access to 
information request to get the information that should be public 
anyway, we are stonewalled.  We hit a wall.  We know one thing 
that happens is as soon as such a request goes in, there is a 
heads up to the minister.  We know that.  The very first response 
is “Get the ministerial staff informed. The minister may have to 
answer questions because the official opposition or some other 
member of the opposition is raising a question so we had better 
make sure that we have our spin doctors out”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is absolutely ludicrous that the government is much more 
interested in putting a spin on the facts than simply revealing 
and dealing with the facts.  It is a contradiction of the whole 
concept of accountability.  It basically says that the government 
wants the people to believe what they hope would be true instead 
of the government saying it would like the people to know what is 
true.  There is a vast difference in those two concepts. The 
government often says, “We are so open, look at this 
directive”.  As I said, it looks good on the surface but it 
would look so much better if it were actually practised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To paraphrase the HRDC minister, on numerous occasions she has 
said  “We are so wonderful, we released this request for access 
to information on the HRDC internal audit before it was 
requested”.  To be very blunt, that was not true. We got a copy 
of a memo that had been doctored.  We cannot prove that it was 
but the suspicions are surely there because the document speaks 
of the date of reference and says “We received your request on” 
and I think it was January 23 or January 22, but the date of the 
memo is January 21.  It was the day before.  They forgot to 
change the date on top when they issued the public document. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, to me, is evidence of a cover-up.  What they are saying is 
“Let us quickly produce a document that proves our case”. Using 
a word processor they changed one date but forgot to change the 
date at the top. As a result they were speaking of the next day 
in the past tense. One has to be psychic to do that or guilty of 
forging a document.  It is part of the cover-up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government wants people to believe that it is honest, open 
and accountable and all that.  We want it to be and that is what 
today's motion is all about. 
<P><A NAME="LINK57"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Lac-Saint-Louis, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, would the member who just spoke agree that treasury 
board has in place a directive that all audits once completed are 
released immediately?  Also treasury board went even further and 
said it would review all the internal audit procedures and report 
to the House by June 2000 to make the policy even more effective 
and enforceable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely the member will agree that the very clear intention of 
the government is to make internal audits available as soon as 
they are completed.  Members opposite do not have to wait even 
for 15 days or go to the Access to Information Act.

not agree that the government has this in place.  The answer is, 
yes, to the best of my knowledge it does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The distressing part is that it has had it in place for some 
four or five years.  Treasury board policies announced in a May 
25, 1994 letter of decision read in part: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To simplify the process for acquiring copies of reports, and to 
deliver on the government's commitment for more openness, the 
policy requires that departments make the final version of review 
reports, including internal audit and evaluation 
reports...accessible to the public, without requiring a formal 
access request. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is right from the letter of decision dated May 26, 1994. 
It has been in place for six years and the government is not 
doing it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member asked if I would not agree that the government has it 
as part of its policy.  Yes, I agree that it is part of its 
policy.  The motion today is that the government do it.  That is 
it, do it.  Do it, do not just say it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I want to thank the hon. member for sharing his time. 
It should be noted that all speakers from the Alliance party will 
be sharing their time from now on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was interesting to hear my colleague talk about being 
accountable.  He lived in a small town that took five minutes to 
walk across.  I lived in a town so small that if I looked out one 
window of the house I was on the east side of town and if I 
looked out the other window I was on the west side of town. 
People were really accountable there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are in the opening days of the 21st century.  This is a 
century which has been characterized as the information age, yet 
we are in the House talking about how to get information out of 
the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People would think that rather than being in the information age 
we were in the days prior to the invention of the printing press 
by Gutenberg, for all the response we see to access to 
information requests and audits which are meant to be released as 
a matter of policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To quote from the 1998-99 annual report of the information 
commissioner: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As early as 1986, the Justice Committee reviewed the operation of 
the access law and unanimously recommended wholesale changes to 
strengthen it and keep it current with technological changes.  No 
government since has had the motivation to implement the 
suggested changes and address, through law, the persistence of a 
culture of secrecy in the federal bureaucracy. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was written in 1986 and quoted by the information 
commissioner in the 1998-99 report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nothing has changed.  The official opposition currently has 29 
requests for information filed with human resources development 
which are overdue.  Of those 29 HRD requests, 8 are for 
departmental audits, which are supposed to be public information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said earlier, this is the new millennium, the information 
age.  The government's response times are prehistoric.  They are 
stone age.  There is no information forthcoming from the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quoting from the same report of the information commissioner, 
this statement is still relevant today:  “Frustration over 
weaknesses in the law has recently spilled over to members of 
parliament from all stripes in the House of Commons”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we are here today having this debate in the House. 
No one, not members of political parties, nor people in the news 
media, nor private citizens, nor researchers should have to 
request departmental audits under the Access to Information Act, 
and yet we find that it has become necessary to make such 
requests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even more unconscionable is the fact that the department is 
defying treasury board directives which require compliance within 
30 days of acknowledging the request. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We only have to read the treasury board's words in a letter of 
decision dated May 26, 1999, which has been referred to before. 
Let us put it on the record again, so that anyone interested 
knows what was said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To simplify the process for acquiring copies of reports, and to 
deliver on the government's commitment for more openness, the 
policy requires that departments make the final version of review 
reports, including internal audit and evaluation reports...

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are fine words, but actions speak louder than words, as 
the hon. member for Elk Island stated.  If the government had 
lived up to its stated ideals, this supply day motion aimed at 
ordering the government to open up its information processes 
would not be necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public is probably at home asking themselves why there is a 
log-jam in responding to requests for information from the 
government.  They are asking, are there legitimate reasons of 
national security?  Or, are there problems with protecting 
vulnerable persons from exposure?  Only if we subscribe to the 
view that it is in the national interest to protect ministers 
from public scrutiny, or if there are questions about the 
management of taxpayer dollars that might embarrass the 
government.  All of the legitimate issues could be dealt with in 
an expeditious manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On March 20 the information commissioner testified before the 
Standing Committee on Human Resources Development.  In his 
testimony he stated the reasons for this huge backlog at HRDC.  I 
quote from his testimony: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the audit reports, there has been a slowdown, but 
the slowdown is government-wide, and the reason for that is that 
as a result of the HRDC experience...all audits now go through an 
additional process by Treasury Board and the Privy Council.  What 
has happened is that Treasury Board and the Privy Council Office 
want to know what audits have been requested, whether they 
contain bad news, and what the official media line will be. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a regressive attitude for the government to take.  It is 
not in the people's interest to have government manage bad news 
to avoid accounting for it.  Ottawa is spin city for this Liberal 
administration when it comes to the release of information vital 
to holding it responsible for its actions.  The current attitude 
has always been a major concern of the information commissioner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his recent testimony the information commissioner added “The 
communication concerns of the government are allowed to take 
precedence over the public's right to timely access to 
information”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite ongoing concerns by the commissioner, it appears that 
HRDC had a fair track record when it came to the release of 
public information until recently.  Now it is because of HRDC's 
intransigence that we are debating the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Someone from another planet may not know why this is so, but in 
case there are other aliens who are listening, other than federal 
Liberals who have not figured it out, it can be summed up in 
three words:  billion dollar boondoggle.  That is the reason. 
That is a lot of taxpayer money and it is in question.  Every 
time another audit or response to an ATI request is released 
there is more bad news for the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Being true to their roots, the Liberals are engaging in spin 
sessions to manage the message, when what they should be doing is 
reviewing the need for the programs and how to properly manage 
and account for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Information is crucial to accountability.  If this government 
wanted to be truly accountable it would welcome scrutiny to 
improve its stewardship of the public credit card.  And it is a 
credit card, because we do not have any money in the bank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The information commissioner has rightly stated that the right 
of access is one of the cornerstones of our democratic process 
and one of the best tools available to ensure responsible 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Liberals agree with that statement—and I bet they do 
privately, never mind what they do publicly—they should cast 
their ballot in favour of the supply day motion proposed by the 
Canadian Alliance in the name of the hon. member for 
Calgary—Nose Hill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should be stated again that this is no trivial matter which 
is under consideration today.  We could consider the list of 
outstanding audits and ATIs filed by the official opposition to 
get an idea of it.  Human resources development is late in 
replying to five departmental audits which should be public 
information according to treasury board guidelines.  All five are 
45 days overdue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are outstanding ATI requests with agriculture and 
agri-food, and Canada Customs and Revenue, which asked for a 30

out how to respond to the bad news included within the response.

extension due to third party consultations.  We do not need much 
imagination to figure out who the third party was.  Citizenship

there was an interesting quote.  I cannot remember how it went, 
but it concerned a Tammany Hall organizer from the United States, 
and we all know what that is about.  He said something like “If 
you don't have to speak, grunt.  If you don't have to grunt, nod. 
If you don't have to nod, wink”.  I am not saying that is an 
exact quote, but that is the exact meaning.  That has been the 
attitude of the government when it comes to releasing 
information.  A wink and a nod is all we get, along with a few 
promises and the questions “Why don't you believe us?  Why don't 
you like us?”  The answer is obvious.

Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the member 
for Mississauga South. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to address the House today on this opposition 
motion.  I begin by expressing my disappointment that members of 
the opposition do not understand and appreciate what the 
Government of Canada is doing for all Canadians.  Maybe they do 
not want to understand for political reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I doubt that all members have taken the time to read the 
document tabled in the House last Thursday by the President of 
the Treasury Board, along with 84 reports on plans and priorities 
for all federal departments and agencies.  It is even more 
unlikely that they have taken the time to reflect on the actions 
and accomplishments of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not intend to speak today about the excellent 2000-01 
budget of the Minister of Finance; however, there are a few 
things I must mention.  A few years ago, when the government 
gained power, there was a $43 billion deficit.  The debt load was 
at an all-time high of some $490 billion.  We also took over at a 
time when unemployment was very high, around 11.8%.  It is now at 
a 30 year low of around 6.5%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of money in this budget was directed to the RCMP, which 
very badly needs it across Canada.  It is a good budget.  I 
talked to Deputy Commissioner Watt who said that the budget was 
great and much appreciated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The number one issue was medical.  Health and welfare needed 
more money.  We gave $2.5 billion in the budget.  Our health 
minister has met with all health ministers from across Canada to 
talk about more money and the need to modernize the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the health system, in my community, in British 
Columbia, there are hospitals every four or five miles which have 
a lot of modern, sophisticated equipment.  I suggest that some of 
the equipment which is only being used four or five hours a day, 
between 8 a.m. and 4 p.m., could be used 16 hours a day, until 
midnight, for people who get off work in the evening.  They would 
be able to get their medical attention, their scan or whatever, 
at that time. 
There has been a lot of progress since we took over as far as the 
government is concerned.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the Minister of Health wants to do the right thing with 
the provinces and give them more money for health.  But we must 
work together.  There was a very good comment by the health 
minister of British Columbia, Michael Farnworth.  He mentioned 
the fact that it is going to take time and that it cannot be done 
in a day.  He said that we must work together.  I think that is a 
very fair comment.  If everybody put their political stripes 
aside as far as the provinces are concerned and work with the 
health minister, I am sure we could accomplish a lot.  I am sure 
there would be more money in the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to bring to the House's attention a document from my 
colleague, the President of the Treasury Board, entitled 
“Results for Canadians: A Management Framework for the 
Government of Canada”.  This document sets out a program of 
change providing long term direction for enhancing management of 
the government's affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1997 the government has been working hard to build a 
higher quality of life for all Canadians.  We must constantly 
work toward improving our policies, programs and the framework 
governing the government's activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a solid foundation on which to build our efforts to 
modernize management within government.  This foundation will 
also help all departments to focus on citizens, to draw upon 
values, to build on results and to spend responsibly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians know and appreciate that their government is operating 
from sound values, is results oriented and that it is continuing 
its sound approach to spending.  There is a philosophy that goes 
along with the management framework for the Government of Canada. 
It is an operating philosophy that requires effort and control 
but a control that is achieved through instruments that encourage 
initiative and creativity by the departments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Few people are aware that the Treasury Board Secretariat has 
been working with the departments and agencies since last summer 
to complete its review of the policy on transfer payments and to 
strengthen the internal audit function. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of an internal audit function is, among other 
things, to help identify shortcomings, to learn from those 
shortcomings and to make the necessary changes.  One of the 
priorities of the Government of Canada is to regularly review its 
spending to ensure the responsible use of taxpayer's money in 
terms of results and values.  One thing is certain with this 
framework and this philosophy.  Canadians can continue to enjoy 
one of the best standards of living in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has introduced the millennium fund.  I can tell 
the House that in my community many applications have been filed 
and fulfilled.  Those applications are very helpful to our 
community in building our communities, by bringing people 
together and by employing people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Heritage Square submitted an application under the millennium 
fund for $84,000.  It is outside my riding, however, I was mayor 
there for many years.  The Reform member whose riding this is in 
refused to endorse the application so I endorsed it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was another application submitted for $348,000.  This was 
also in a Reform riding.  I approved it and they received the 
grant.  This project looks after 1,800 kids.  It is in a great 
area in Mallardville where all the residents get together with 
people from other communities.  This facility looks after the 
community.  When I was the mayor we spent $5 million in enlarging 
it and even now it is much too small.  Every room is filled and 
they are looking for more space. 
These are things that are happening.  These are things that our 
government is doing.  I am sorry I referred to the party across 
from us as Reform because it has been changed to Alliance.  They 
had a CCRAP Party and a few other things, so really we cannot 
tell what it really is.

municipalities getting grants in lieu of taxes for government

voted against the municipalities receiving grants for the 
communities.  I am just wondering what side of the fence 
Reformers are really on.  Do they support the municipalities that 
they represent?  Do they really support the ridings that they 
represent, or do they really represent themselves and nobody 
else?

Speaker of the House ruled just a little over a week ago that the 
name of our party is now Canadian Alliance.  When people were 
misusing it, that ruling was reaffirmed and requested.  Here we 
have a member who somehow does not have the ability to even learn 
two words.  I would like to have him repeat three times after me: 
Canadian Alliance, Canadian Alliance, Canadian Alliance.

time that its name is being challenged in court.  I do not know 
what its name will be when it goes to the Supreme Court of 
Canada.  The leader of the Reform Party lived at Stornoway for 
many years.  He said he would never live there and that he would 
open up a bingo hall in there.  It was to become a bingo hall.  I 
wonder how many times a week the party plays bingo in there. 
Another time—

This individual is now so far away from the motion of the day 
that there is no question he is irrelevant, so please call him on 
it.

debates on party names we do tend to get away from the motion. 
The hon. member I know will address his remarks to the motion.

there have been a lot of HRDC grants.  I can assure the House 
that they are well accepted and well represented in my riding. 
There are wheelchair cases, handicapped people and kids who need 
parks in my community.  There are many, many things that can be 
done in my community.  I think it is a great place to spend our 
money and a great accomplishment for our communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance Party members do not realize that.  They 
do not believe in it.  They do not believe in taking HRDC money, 
outside of a few of them maybe who write letters, like I have on 
my file, stating how good it is for their ridings once they get 
the money.  But I do not believe they endorse it, outside of a 
latecomer's letter that will arrive about six months later 
stating how good it is for communities after they wake up and 
spend some time in their ridings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are things that I stand for and this is what our 
government stands for.  I hope that there will never come a day 
when we will lose that identity to be part of all governments 
across Canada, provincial, municipal and otherwise.

across the country. This government made it harder to qualify

contributors to the employment insurance fund can qualify, and 
most do not even have access to social assistance.

have never seen under the Progressive Conservative Party, a 
scandal that could total anywhere from one to three billion

manner. 
Is it reasonable to spend in the Prime Minister's riding to help 
the Placeteco plant, when HRDC paid out $1.2 million, of which 
more than $1 million was transferred directly from HDRC to the 
National Bank to repay a loan, or else the company would have 
gone bankrupt? As for the other $200,000, we do not even know 
where it went, to whom it was paid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is this the member's idea of spending in a reasonable manner? I

quickly give me three examples.

been very responsible for is health care, not like the Bloc 
across the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was with great dissatisfaction that I found out that Quebec 
did not spend the money which was given to it by the federal 
government on health care.  If the money has not gone to health 
care, a report card must be given to the federal government 
explaining where every dollar went.   Quebec has some $8 billion 
from years ago that it did not spend on health.  If it has a 
problem with health care maybe it should dig into that money.  It 
is there for health care.  British Columbia has $471 million, 
Alberta has millions of dollars, and I can go on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the Bloc members why they are not here 
singing “O Canada” with us every Wednesday?  How come it does

Lucien Bouchard.  I want him to give us three examples.

It does not want to be part of Canada.  I wonder when that is 
going to cease and it becomes a party that helps the government? 
It seems to resent us calling it to come aboard.  It wants to 
stay away from here, especially when the national anthem is sung.

have two guests in the lobby, Derek Snyder from your riding of

Mississauga, who are here to observe the process.  I know they 
will have a good time learning about our government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today is a supply day, which means that an opposition party, in 
this case, the Canadian Alliance, has the opportunity to table in 
the House a motion for debate by the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must admit that when I saw the motion I had some difficulty 
with the flow of it and understanding it.  For the edification of 
those who may not have seen the motion, I will take the 
opportunity to put the motion forward again.  It says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That an Order of the House do issue for all departmental audit 
reports to be tabled within 15 days of their completion and 
permanently referred to the appropriate standing committees, that 
audit reports since January 1, 1999, be tabled within 15 days 
after the adoption of this motion, and that all audit reports 
requested under the Access to Information Act be tabled 
forthwith. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a complex motion.  There are some elements in it that deal 
with audit reports, on which I will make some comments.  I will 
also comment on the part about referring information or 
additional responsibilities to committees.  The last thing I hope 
to comment on are some of the rules in the Access to Information 
Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an overriding statement, all members will fully appreciate 
that on behalf of the people of Canada, the Parliament of Canada 
and the government departments of Canada work to the very best of 
their ability to ensure that the best interests of Canadians are 
represented and protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is so very important that we work every day on the integrity 
and credibility of this institution.  The motion raises an 
important issue.  I am not sure whether the motion hits the 
target squarely but I think the motion is important in terms of 
its subject matter.  It is important for us to reassure Canadians 
that there are rules and policies in place that give us and 
Canadians the tools to ensure that credibility, integrity and the 
best interests of Canadians is kept in mind in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion generally calls for audits to be referred to standing 
committees for review.  I want to advise the House that internal 
audits are released by departments to the public domain 
immediately upon their completion.  This has been the policy of 
the Treasury Board since 1995.  This is not a reaction.  This has 
been our policy since 1995.  With regard to accessibility to that 
information, to internal audits, it is a very important part of 
the policy.  The policy states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Departments should make these review reports, or summaries of 
them, accessible to the public in both official languages by 
making use of electronic public networks, timely press releases 
to inform the public of the results, or by placing them in 
departmental libraries. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, the policy does in fact direct itself 
specifically to the concerns raised in the motion, and it has 
been in place since 1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The policy also states that “Completed internal audits are 
available for review by every interested Canadian immediately”. 
Therefore, there is no need for some formal process to make that 
happen because it is already happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It continues to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further, there is no need to make access to information requests 
for completed internal audits. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion calls for that and yet it is already in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of access to information requests does come up with 
regard to other internal audits that may not have been completed 
or other reports that have been prepared by a department but not 
released. 
These audits or other internal departmental material may be 
subject to access to information requests.  Indeed, that is in 
place and it is done.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians should be very assured that mechanisms are now in 
place to safeguard the interests of Canadians.  The principles 
that guide us, in terms of right of access, are:  first, that 
government information should be available to the public; second, 
that necessary exemptions to the right of access should be 
limited and specific; and, third, that decisions on the 
disclosure of government information should be reviewed 
independently of government.  That is directly contrary to a part 
of the motion which asks committees to look at this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Knowing the mover of this motion, the hon. member for 
Calgary—Nose Hill, HRDC has been of particular interest to her. 
I do not know whether there was information that prompted her to 
take some interest in this department through access to 
information or whether it was an audit report that was the 
subject of the information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the HRDC officials appeared at a press conference shortly 
after this issue broached the House, the officials described a 
process whereby HRDC personnel visited over 400 locations where 
applicants had received funds from HRDC programs and projects. 
They described those visits as look-see visits.  They looked at a 
file or something else and they had what was described as a bingo 
chart on which they ticked off what they saw and what they did 
not see.  As a result of that, some 37 files showed deficiencies. 
In a nutshell, that is what happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of a sudden it comes out that there is this damning audit 
report which indicates that money has been misappropriated, 
misused or mismanaged by applicants or someone else.  In the 
first instance, this motion is talking about audits.  I would 
suggest to the House that what kicked off this whole HRDC 
question had nothing to do with an audit.  It concerned 
information that was assembled by HRDC personnel through visits 
but which did not constitute an audit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a chartered accountant, I have been involved in the public 
auditing process.  I was also in charge of an internal audit 
department during my corporate life.  I know what is involved in 
planning, preparing and executing an internal audit. What was 
done by HRDC with regard to those 37 files was not an audit or an 
internal audit by any definition.  I would challenge any member 
to find anybody in the industry to suggest otherwise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proof was in the pudding when the auditors were subsequently 
sent out to these 37 locations to follow up on the points raised 
by the visits from those HRDC personnel.  In all the cases—and I 
believe 34 of the cases are now complete—every single item 
raised as being a deficiency in the file was cleared because they 
asked the questions or looked for the documents.  If an audit had 
been done, those questions would have been asked, the search 
would have been conducted and they would have been cleared even 
before the original visit was completed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Admittedly, the issue here is the credibility and the 
accountability of the government and parliament to the people.  I 
believe that the provisions and the tools are in place for this 
to happen. I also believe it would be inappropriate to suggest 
that we need to have more of the operating information from 
departments come through the House and go to our committees.  Our 
committees are not trained to do this and they would be obligated 
to actually review them and to do reports.  Committees already 
have the opportunity.  They are the masters of their own agenda. 
They can call for this information if they want to look at it. 
They can make the decision themselves whether or not it is 
important to review.  I do not believe that all reports should 
have reviews.  I believe that only those reports that merit 
review by a committee should be reviewed.  That is contrary to 
what is prescribed in this motion.  As a consequence, I will not 
be supporting the motion.

motion, if it were amended, would say that we should release them 
within 30 days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the hon. member possibly stand in this place and say 
that he will vote against the motion that we are putting forward 
that will simply underline the importance of doing what the 
Treasury Board guidelines say?  He is saying “No.  I'm going to 
vote against it. I don't agree with that”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does he propose in its place?  Does he proposed to hide 
them forever?  We have all these audit reports, which are long 
overdue, and they are not available.  We are not getting them 
through access to information.  Does he want to continue to hide 
it?  If he votes against this motion does he have an alternate 
proposal? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B>  Mr. Speaker, as I outlined in my speech, 
the rules of Treasury Board are already in place.  They require 
that internal audits are released by departments into the public 
domain immediately upon their completion.  That cannot be 
clearer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member asked directly why I would not be voting for the 
motion.  I will repeat directly why I will not be voting for the 
motion.  First, it is very poorly worded and, in particular, it 
requires that all these audits from all departments at all times, 
everything that has ever been done, somehow be magically referred 
permanently to committees which would be responsible for 
reviewing them.  It would simply tie parliament up totally and 
not put the priorities of the nation ahead of ordinary day to day 
work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion is flawed not only in its language but also in its 
intent. 
<P><A NAME="LINK63"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I have to take some umbrage with the latter comment 
by the hon. member opposite, who I have the greatest respect for 
and who I think has the highest degree of integrity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we have found, throughout this entire affair that has 
been going on now for some months, that there have been 
incredible efforts undertaken by his government to not only deny 
that the problem existed but to then point an accusatory finger 
across the way at the opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be ludicrous for me to suggest that there was not a 
political element to all this.  However, when it comes down to 
the facts of the case that are before the Canadian public, we 
have the auditor general himself saying that 85% of the programs 
were flawed in one form or another.  We know that when we talk 
about flaws we are discussing things like companies getting more 
money than they applied for, companies applying for money under 
numbered companies and then did not set up the company in the way 
that they were supposed to or create the jobs that they were 
supposed to.  Therefore, there is a very serious undertone to the 
motion that is before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member should not simply shrug his shoulders and say 
that there is a process in place that is doing this work.  He 
should admit that the problem is there.  This motion is worded in 
such a way as to perhaps give Canadians some confidence that this 
problem will be dealt with in a very open and transparent way, 
which is again just a word when it comes to this government and 
is not in fact the practice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think Canadians would like to see—and it applies to 
opposition members as well—the government stand before the 
Canadian public and say that it was wrong, that it made a mistake 
and that maybe, based on the information it had at the time, it 
did something that it would have done differently in retrospect. 
Canadians have now come to expect that from the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the member please elucidate to us why it is that the 
government is not prepared to admit that the problem is there and 
that it will do something in a substantive way to give Canadians 
confidence in the future about this? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his 
kind comments and his words of encouragement.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, the member will readily admit that when the HRDC 
issue came up, whether it was $3 billion or $1 billion or whether 
it was mismanaged by the government or the applicants, a lot of 
politics was being played.  That is unfortunate because it is at 
the expense of the interests of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have a right to know the facts.  The facts are that of 
the original 37 files in the HRDC matter which is what the member 
is referring to, 34 have been completed.  It was found that none 
of the deficiencies in the files were valid and all of the items 
were cleared. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion calls for all audit reports to go to committee.  I 
will not be supporting this.  I am sure the member would not 
support it on that basis.  Certainly the House has the right to 
send audits to committee, but all audits would just grind 
parliament to a halt. 
<P><A NAME="LINK64"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have listened with interest to the 
comments made by the Liberal member. I am a little concerned 
because I get the impression members such as the member for 
Mississauga South do not realize the concern that Canadians have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have watched over a period of time what they consider 
to be democracy and accountability in government diminishing.  We 
have seen how a government has taken authority away from this 
place, the Parliament of Canada, and has placed it in the courts 
of the land and in the orders in council, the executive branch of 
government.  We have seen how the executive branch of government, 
which is really a handful of individuals hand picked by the Prime 
Minister and the Prime Minister himself, is running the country. 
This motion has brought to our attention the fact that not only 
is it running the country, making the decisions and ignoring 
parliament, but it is also refusing to share information which is 
legally available to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think there was some misinformation about the motion.  I am 
going to read it just so Canadians know exactly what the motion 
is about: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That an Order of the House do issue for all departmental audit 
reports to be tabled within 15 days of their completion and 
permanently referred to the appropriate standing committees, that 
audit reports since January 1, 1999, be tabled within 15 days 
after the adoption of this motion, and that all audit reports 
requested under the Access to Information Act be tabled 
forthwith. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the motion is trying to do is to make information that is to 
be public made public through the committee process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Mississauga South was quite right.  This 
motion really should not be needed because treasury board has 
policies under which it is to operate.  I will read from a memo 
from André Robert, the acting director of internal audit division 
of Treasury Board Secretariat.  His memo is quite specific as to 
what the requirements under ATIP, access to information, are: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the issue of accessibility under ATIP as raised in 
the first paragraph of page two of my February 14 memo, I would 
like to clarify that once such reports are completed, they are 
public documents.  This means that when completed, they should be 
accessible to the public without requiring a formal request under 
ATIP. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The memo is very clear.  And, Mr. Speaker, I am sharing my time. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Requests for “draft material” of any kind should be dealt with 
through the normal ATIP process.  Your departmental ATIP 
co-ordinator is familiar with these matters and requests received 
for draft reports should be referred to your departmental ATIP 
co-ordinator for appropriate action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a final point, I would ask that you please disregard my 
previous request to fax a copy— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very clear from this memo that the policy is in place. The 
problem and the reason this motion is before the House is that 
the government is completely ignoring the policy that is on the 
government books. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1335"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT42"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That policy is prohibiting Canadians from accessing information 
they are entitled to.  It is their money that is being used. 
This policy has been in place for a period of time and everybody 
on the government side is aware of it, yet we have access 
requests for audits that we know are completed which are 45 days 
overdue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills:</B>  You do not need access.  We gave you 
the file. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith:</B>  Precisely.  A member on the opposite 
side says we do not need access.  Then why are the audits not 
available to us if we do not need access to information?  The 
truth of the matter is that the government is withholding this 
information.  Why? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Mississauga South claims that the government was 
ensuring its credibility, its integrity and its accountability. 
He did not use the word transparency because he could not. If 
this is true, then why do we have to go through the access to 
information process to get audits that are supposed to be 
available without an access request? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is because the government is hiding information and one has 
to ask why. It is to control the timing of the release of the 
information.  The government wants to withhold this information 
until the summer recess when we are not sitting here and cannot 
draw the public's attention to the mismanagement of government 
departments.  Or perhaps it is withholding this information until 
after the next federal election so the Liberal members do not 
have to hold themselves accountable to the electorate during that 
election. The government is controlling the timing by refusing to 
release these audit documents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most important is that the government is breaking its own 
policies.  It is breaking the policies and the established 
process of releasing government audits.  It is the government 
that is to rule under the law but it seems to have no hesitation 
to break it whenever it is appropriate to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Mississauga South commented that it was 
information that came up, that perhaps it was not an audit at all 
that raised this concern in the Department of Human Resources 
Development.  He also said that it was one audit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not one audit.  Canadians are smart enough to know that it 
is not one audit we are talking about.  It is a number of audits, 
and it is a number of audits that we cannot get our hands on. And 
it is not just one department.  A number of departments other 
than human resources development hand out grants and subsidies to 
individuals and corporations in this country.  It is their audits 
as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our job in opposition is to hold the government accountable for 
spending the good hardearned tax dollars of the Canadian public. 
The government does not seem to be responsible or really care 
whether it is held accountable or whether the integrity of 
government is protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in opposition feel that it is important for the government to 
share information.  Government departments should be available to 
the public for scrutiny.  It is very important that a government 
that places so much control and power with the executive branch 
show itself to be transparent so the Canadian public can have 
some degree of confidence that the government is doing what is in 
the best interests of the Canadian population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everything we have seen in the past three months in the House 
would indicate a number of things, that the government is 
contemptuous of the Canadian taxpayer, the government has no 
intention of being transparent and its integrity is in question. 
The government has to decide whether it is going to continue down 
the path of withholding and controlling information or whether it 
is going to offer to the Canadian public information so it can be 
held to account for how it spends the tax dollars that are 
provided to it to provide programming for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the government members if they intend to uphold the laws 
of the land or if they feel they are above the laws of the land.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview—Greenwood, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to tell the member from British Columbia 
that all of us on this side of the House and in government 
understand it is the opposition's duty and responsibility to hold 
us accountable.  Many of us have been in opposition and we know 
what that role is.  We do not challenge that role. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also would say that we do not know of a business or a 
government in Canada, even this government, that has not made 
mistakes. There will always be mistakes.  That is the way life 
is.  We are not proud of mistakes, but we will admit there are 
some mistakes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is absolutely shameful that the members of the Canadian 
Alliance try to create the illusion that somehow $1 billion sort 
of vanished when— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit:</B>  No, the government is mismanaging $13 
billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills:</B>  Mr. Speaker, now the members 
opposite want to create the illusion it was $3 billion that just 
vanished. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit:</B>  No, it was $13 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills:</B>  Mr. Speaker, most Canadians realize 
that every one of those Canadian taxpayers' dollars went for 
projects in every single riding across Canada for people in our 
communities who tend to be most in need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say with respect to the member, we have to be transparent.  We 
put 10,000 pages of documents out there and I cannot believe that 
members opposite have read all of those documents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point I want to make is that whether we are on the 
government side or the opposition side, we are all here to look 
out for those people in the country who are most in need.  The 
people who are most in need tend to be those clients of HRDC. I 
respectfully ask the member, why would she cast aspersions on 
99.9% of those dollars that go to good causes for children at 
risk, for seniors, for people with disabilities? Why would the 
member or her party do that when essentially her argument is with 
those few files where there have been honest, human mistakes? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thought I made it quite 
clear that HRDC is only one department and that the problems do 
not sit just with one department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about $1 billion, one audit of $1 billion worth of 
projects showed very high instances of non-compliance, of poor 
management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the hon. member talks about those most in need benefiting 
from this government largesse, we know that is absolutely 
misrepresenting the facts.  The Liberals cannot tell me that the 
government in helping Amtrak, the U.S. passenger rail service, is 
helping those most in need, that Bombardier, a very large 
international corporation which has 32 plants around the world is 
in dire need, that they are those most in need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government member is misrepresenting to Canadians where all 
the money is going.  It is not just HRDC.  It is EDC, it is 
DIAND, it is industry, it is HRDC.  The taxpayers' money goes to 
many different areas in government spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All we ask in the motion is that the internal audits done on how 
the government is spending taxpayers' money be made public and 
available to the opposition and to Joe Blow citizen so that we 
can hold the government accountable and be able to decide whether 
the government is spending our money wisely.

I have a brief question, because I know that there is not much 
time left. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the first part of her speech explaining the reasons for the 
motion, the member said that more transparency was necessary. 
She had harsh words for the way the federal government now 
operates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with her, in that the Prime Minister of Canada is not 
elected by the voters of Canada.  Yet the Prime Minister 
appoints judges and senators.  Through his executive power, the 
Prime Minister has almost complete authority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the member tell whether she and her party agree that 
reform is in order on this point? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith:</B>  Mr. Speaker, this party agrees with the 
need for some reformation, some changes in how parliament 
operates and in how the patronage system needs to be corrected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The concern is not just about the appointments.  The concern is 
about how the government is bringing legislation to the House 
that removes power from the House and places it with the 
executive branch of government.  That has to stop.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on behalf of the people of Surrey Central to 
support my colleagues in the official opposition on our supply 
day motion which reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That an Order of the House do issue for all departmental audit 
reports to be tabled within 15 days of their completion and 
permanently referred to the appropriate standing committees, that 
audit reports since January 1, 1999, be tabled within 15 days 
after the adoption of this motion, and that all audit reports 
requested under the Access to Information Act be tabled 
forthwith. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are recommending these actions because we are finding that 
the government is being less than forthcoming with respect to 
reporting and providing information to Canadians on how our tax 
dollars are spent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion we are debating today simply asks this weak Liberal 
government to reaffirm its own regulations.  The wording of the 
motion is the same as the regulations of the treasury board and 
the privy council office.  That means if anyone is opposing the 
motion, he or she is opposing the government's own regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A very serious and disturbing point has recently come to light 
in terms of how the government is governing our nation.  All 
Canadians respect the fact that certain information is not made 
public in order to protect our national security.  That is okay. 
Other information may be kept secret in order to ensure fairness 
in competition in certain cases, but for the most part we expect 
our federal government to come up with the facts and figures on 
the nation's finances in detail and without hesitation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We only expect to be stonewalled if there is something to hide. 
We are proud of and trust our public service employees.  If there 
is something to hide it is the political managers that want to 
hide something.  Who are those managers?  It is the Liberals who 
are hiding something.  They have found out that it is too 
difficult to hide a $1 billion boondoggle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition has received no reply to formal requests 
for audit reports from the following government departments and 
agencies.  I will list some of them.  The official opposition put 
forward many ATI requests to the Department of Human Resources 
Development, and HRDC is late in replying.  It does not want to 
reply.  Five of these requests are for departmental audits that 
should be public information according to treasury board 
guidelines and are now 45 days overdue.

Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation requested an 
undefined extension due to third party consultations. The 
Department of Citizenship and Immigration requested a 90 day 
extension on March 9.  The Department of Fisheries and Oceans 
provided some audits and asked for a 30 day extension for others. 
Similarly the National Capital Commission, the Department of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food and so on are on the list. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to speak about the treasury board guidelines.  Treasury 
board policies were announced in a May 26, 1994, letter of 
decision which stated in part: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To simplify the process for acquiring copies of reports, and to 
deliver on the government's commitment for more openness, the 
policy requires that departments make the final version of review 
reports, including the internal audits and evaluation reports, 
accessible to the public, without requiring a formal access 
request— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The treasury board is now breaking its own policy by withholding 
such information even when a formal request is filed.  HRDC had a 
good record of responding to ATI requests on time until the 
billion dollar boondoggle came along.  As a result of the HRDC 
experience, the Treasury Board Secretariat and the Privy Council 
Office now insist on being told what audits have been requested, 
whether they contain bad news, and what the official political 
media line will be before the audits are released. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In testimony before the HRD committee last week the information 
commissioner attributed the backlog of information requests in 
the department largely to new treasury board and privy council 
rules.  Let me give some quotes from the information commissioner 
to the HRD committee on March 28 of this year.  The information 
commissioner said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The right to access is one of the cornerstones of our democratic 
process and one of the best tools available to ensure responsible 
government. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He further stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the audit reports, there has been a slowdown, but 
the slowdown is government-wide, and the reason for that is that 
as a result of the HRDC experience...all audits requested now go 
through an additional process by Treasury Board and the Privy 
Council.  What has happened is that the Treasury Board and the 
Privy Council Office want to know what audits have been 
requested, whether they contain bad news, and what the official 
media line will be...The problem, however, arises when the 
communication concerns of the Government are allowed to take 
precedence over the public's right to timely access to 
information. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The information commission said as well that it was clear from 
what had been said by the access to information commissioners in 
the various departments that they could not meet the 30 day 
stipulation because of the new process that had been put in place 
by the Liberals.  He also said that information delayed was 
information denied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should have no problem supporting a motion that 
would entrench its own policies with regard to the release of 
audit reports to the public on an order of the House.  That way 
the House would have some recourse if the government failed to 
live up to its recent self-stated commitment to openness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have clearly witnessed in the government time and again a 
lack of openness and a lack of transparency.  We have seen in the 
government time and again a lack of respect for democracy.  It 
has limited debate many times.  It has used time allocation many 
times.  It has beaten the record of Brian Mulroney. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly we have seen changes to the Canada Elections Act 
before the House which favour the governing party, in this case 
the Liberal Party. 
It is so undemocratic that it is almost anti-democratic.

introduce a private member's bill.

we are talking about.  They can analyze other issues and make 
recommendations to the government.

to the media.  I remember that CIDA released a very important

this project will be located in a dynamic community and will 
enable us to contribute to putting to good use a large

revamped to help farmers.  Taxes on fuel and other inputs could 
be reduced immediately.  The Liberals have already broken their

make a commitment to get the remaining $1.2 billion out in the

their crops?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Robert D. Nault (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern

</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that the first nations people will decide what

such desperate situations on reserve.

<P><A NAME="LINK110"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Robert D. Nault (Minister of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to make this 
very clear to the member, because she may not understand what 
government to government relationships mean.  When talking about 
government relationships, we allow governments which are duly 
elected by their memberships to make the decisions as to what 
salaries their elected officials will make.  It is not up to the 
Government of Canada or this minister to make that decision for 
them. 
<P><A NAME="LINK111"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the minister talks about government 
to government relationships.  Surely there is some responsibility 
for government to taxpayers, the people who are footing the bill. 
The amount of $640,000 went to the Acadia reserve chief and 
councillors, over three times what it had been just two years 
before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over that same two year period social services to the people and 
the children on that reserve were reduced by more than $200,000. 
So much for helping the poor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the minister is in this position to actually help people, I 
would like him to realize that these are tragic stories.  Why is 
he ignoring them? 
<P><A NAME="LINK112"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Robert D. Nault (Minister of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as I have stood and 
said in the House a number of times in the last number of months, 
to make it very clear, we are the most audited department in the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things we do is ask the Canadian Institute of 
Chartered Accountants to audit first nations.  Those audits 
include information which any first nation can get.  All they 
have to do is ask the department for the information and it will 
be supplied.

</I></B></P><P align=left>A crisis exists in Canada.  The First Nations National 
Accountability Coalition presented its report, pleading for an 
end to the government's refusal to address the critical needs of 
ordinary people living on reserve.  The coalition reports waste, 
corruption and dictatorship rule. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the minister and his government do the right thing and 
respond immediately to the recommendations of the accountability 
coalition, or will billions continue to be wasted on

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Robert D. Nault (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern

government to government relationships, we allow first nations 
people to make their own decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of years ago white governments made the decisions for 
first nations.  That is not the policy of this government.  The 
policy of this government is to let first nations make their own 
decisions.  Those decisions will be made much better at the 
community level than they will be made by me as the minister or 
by that party across the way. 
<P><A NAME="LINK115"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is too bad it is not government to people.  That is 
what it ought to be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister continues to hear the outcry of aboriginal people 
living on reserve.  Grassroots aboriginal people have been 
begging the minister to stop the gross corruption and waste on 
reserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Others in Canada can access an ombudsman.  Aboriginal people on 
reserve cannot.  Will the minister respond to this request?  Will 
the minister give aboriginal people on reserve the same rights 
and privileges that the rest of us have, and give them access to 
an ombudsman?

the hon. member who spoke yesterday suggested, that is, consult 
people before we make decisions related to a number of issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the same issue.  We do not make decisions on behalf of 
first nations without holding consultations.  We are in the 
process of consulting with the leadership of first nations.  Once

good thing, we will undertake to do that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I would remind the member that this is the first government since 
the enactment of the Canada Health Act to stop payment to a 
province.  In fact it was Alberta, which conducted practices 
inconsistent with the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In relation to MRIs, I can tell the member that we are fully

<P><A NAME="LINK129"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, a

</I></B></P><P align=left>When the evidence is so overwhelming, and the minister knows it, 
why will he not speak up?  Is not the real reason that the

that is nonsense.  More than that, it is offensive nonsense.  The 
Prime Minister is a man whose public career stands in testimony

Act.  It was under his leadership that this government acted to 
stop payment when Alberta conducted practices which were 
inconsistent with the act.

when the people of Newfoundland needed an additional ferry, his

abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Industry has long told the House, day after day,

have come to me over the last year and said “Get more capacity 
for the ferry from Marine Atlantic”.   Now she is saying that 
because we will deliver on our promises that is somehow bad.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Newfoundland were waiting for that greatly needed 
additional ferry to service the North Sydney to Port-aux-Basques 
run, but before they could get it the Minister of Transport 
appointed a new chair of Marine Atlantic who changed the required 
specifications, we are told, at the very end of the bidding 
process.

Mr. Speaker, the important issue here is, will there be

additional capacity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new chair of Marine Atlantic, who is a captain from St. 
John's, an eminent seafarer, somebody who knows the marine 
industry, is an individual who has gone out and got the best deal 
for the Government of Canada.  It does not come cheap.  We are 
spending over $70 million for the service between Nova Scotia and

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>BILL C-206 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK209"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, pursuant to your ruling on a point of privilege raised 
by the then Reform Party, I have again obtained the hundred plus 
seconders for my Bill C-206. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, between the time you made your ruling on February 8, in 
which you said that Bill C-206 should be dropped from near the 
top to the bottom of the order of precedence while you awaited 
the advice of the Standing Committee on Procedures and House 
Affairs, and now after the committee has debated, after it has 
reported and after you have made the final ruling that I should 
again get the seconders to my bill, and my getting those 
seconders, there has been a draw. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1505"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT60"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consequently I find Bill C-206 to be not at the bottom of the 
order of precedence as it existed when the member for Athabasca's 
point of privilege was first raised but now in 28th place behind 
all those bills and motions from the most recent draw. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On March 29, Mr. Speaker, you spoke of fairness to myself and 
all those who prepared items by the hundred signature rule. The 
essence of the member for Athabasca's point of privilege was 
whether Bill C-206 could still command the requisite more than 
100 seconders, given that he wished to withdraw his signature.  I 
have demonstrated that it can and does, despite a very narrow 
timeframe in which to make such a demonstration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore question the appropriateness of dropping Bill C-206 
to the bottom of a second round of order of precedence when all 
seem to agree that I have not acted improperly and my Bill C-206 
continues to have the confidence of more than 100 members of the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of teething problems associated with the new procedure, 
Bill C-206's scheduled appearance before this House has already 
been delayed two months.  Is it fair, not just to me but to its 
100-plus seconders, that it be delayed a further two months?  I 
would ask that it be restored to where it would have been prior 
to the last draw, immediately behind Motion No. 128, the motion 
of the member for Langley—Abbotsford. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The hon. member is correct.  We always seek 
fairness.  However, I thought about the ruling before I made it 
and notwithstanding the fact that it did take a little more time 
I am sure the hon. member's bill will eventually get to the top 
and he will have his chance and his day in the House to debate 
the bill.  My ruling stands.

Speaker, I feel very badly that my colleague's speech was 
interrupted by question period.  He made a very fine presentation 
and put his finger on the problem when he said that the 
government feared accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a real dilemma.  It appears, at least from speakers on 
the government side so far, that the government will actually 
vote against the motion.  I would like my colleague to comment on 
that because the motion is pretty well what is in place now by 
treasury board.  If the government votes against it, it will 
basically say that the treasury board guidelines are not good 
enough.  There is a huge contradiction.  I would appreciate my 
colleague's comments on the Liberal contradictory statements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for Elk Island for asking this wonderful question.  It is 
shameful that the weak Liberal government is opposing the motion. 
I doubt that it will support the motion during the vote, but it 
still has some time to think about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To answer the question as to why the motion was put, it was 
because government members are hiding their incompetence.  They 
are hiding their mismanagement.  They are hiding their wastage 
and patronage and all those things.  The government is hiding its 
arrogance.  The government is becoming more and more arrogant day 
by day.  It has more lame excuses and more delays in providing 
information.  It denies the right to information.  We see gross 
abuse of power by the government, and it will continue.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We are witnessing a continuous lack of willpower to fix what is 
wrong with the government.  It lacks the political will to fix 
what is wrong with the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are witnessing a lack of openness and transparency on the 
part of the government.  We are witnessing day and night from the 
government a lack of respect for democracy.  It has limited 
debate by moving time allocation on all debates in the House. 
Even on the elections legislation that was before the House, the 
government tried to deny amendments that would have made the 
system more transparent, open and democratic.  It is so 
undemocratic that it is almost anti-democratic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have also seen that the government is not keeping its 
promises.  It forgot what Canadians called on it to do.  It 
forgot its promises to Canadians about what it would do.  Who 
does not remember the GST promise it made?   Who does not 
remember the national day care program it promised to bring 
forward?  Who does not remember that it said it would bring 
forward whistle-blower legislation?  So far we have not seen 
anything from the government which would enhance democracy in 
this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are witnessing a cover-up mentality.  Despite the mistakes by 
government ministers, the Prime Minister will stand to defend his 
record and try to support his ministers who have made serious 
mistakes such as the billion dollar boondoggle and the solicitor 
general's actions in the House during the APEC incident. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has a cover-up mentality.  The basic reason 
government members are speaking against the motion is to hide 
their weaknesses and arrogance.  We expect the government to come 
forward with openness, with true democratic principles being 
applied in the House.  Unless we see them, I am sure that what I 
have said is why they are opposing the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Canadian Alliance forms the government there will be 
transparency, openness and democracy in this place.  Canadians 
will heave a sigh of relief when the Canadian Alliance forms the 
next government in the House.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to take part in this debate on the opposition motion. 
If I may, I will begin with a brief review of the proposals 
making up this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It calls for all audits carried out within the government to be 
tabled within 15 days of their completion.  All audits carried 
out within the government are made available to the public when 
they are completed.  Even when they are only at the draft stage, 
they can be obtained via access to information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion calls for all audits to be referred to a standing 
committee.  Any standing committee—indeed any committee of the 
House, as hon. members know—is able to examine whatever audit 
report it wishes, once it is completed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion calls for all audit reports requested under the 
Access to Information Act to be tabled within 15 days.  All 
access to information requests are processed.  There have, 
certainly, been some delays recently due to the very heavy 
volume, but all requests are being processed and responses will 
be forthcoming as soon as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, last year the Department of Human Resources 
Development had an excellent record for responses provided within 
the deadline to access to information requests. This year, 
however, the department is having to respond to four times as 
many requests.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to point out that the information commissioner, 
John Reid, pointed out recently before the Standing Committee on 
Human Resources Development and the Status of Persons with 
Disabilities, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not many people have the skills sought for this sort of work you 
could find on the street.  It is therefore exceedingly difficult 
to find outside contractors to help you deal with this huge 
workload. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The law requires, for example, that we respect the personal 
nature of certain information. We must therefore see whether the 
documents sought contain personal information and check a number 
of other points before we can make them available to those 
requesting them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot believe that the members of the opposition are asking 
us to break the law.  We will certainly comply with it and 
therefore protect personal information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My remarks may be summarized briefly: the motion by the official 
opposition serves no purpose.  What it seeks is already 
available.  I believe that, by presenting the motion we are 
debating today, the official opposition is showing that it has 
not grasped one of the vital changes that have taken place in 
recent years in the way government is managed, in fact all major 
organizations are managed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the hon. members no doubt recall, in June 1997, the Prime 
Minister designated the Treasury Board as the management board of 
Cabinet.  This was recognition that, in an institution of such 
magnitude as the Government of Canada, an inflexible style of 
management cannot be effective.  The old style of management 
based on orders and control simply does not suit today's 
realities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of reasons for this change in the concept of 
management, both in government and outside public administration. 
In the private sector, business and other bodies, for example, 
long ago dropped the style of management based on orders and 
control, which reeked of authoritarianism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Increasingly, decisions are made locally.  Local managers have 
increasing responsibilities. This is the key to greater 
efficiency and the delivery of better services in less time to 
all clienteles, including the Canadians they serve. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Governments must also adopt more modern management practices, 
because our field of operations has changed over the years.  Not 
only have we introduced new and creative policy and program 
directions to better, more efficiently and more effectively meet 
the needs of Canadians, we are also delivering our services in 
different ways; in partnership with other levels of government, 
for example, and in partnership with the private sector and other 
organizations.  These changes have greatly increased the 
complexity of administration and accountability for program 
delivery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In spite of this new complexity in program delivery, the 
government is committed to both modern management practices and 
good service to Canadians.  That means that departments and 
agencies must focus on achieving results in a way that ensures 
clear accountability, proper stewardship of public funds and 
transparent reporting on what has been achieved.  That requires 
effective control, but through instruments that encourage 
initiative and creativity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the one hand, we must be flexible enough on the delegation of 
decision making authority and on administrative rules to support 
initiative and common sense.  On the other hand, we must be 
sufficiently rigorous on standards and control systems to ensure 
clear accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Modern comptrollership means integrating financial and 
non-financial performance information, implementing sound risk 
management, ensuring appropriate control systems and updating 
related management policies.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government is committed to ensuring that public funds are 
managed in an ethical, fair and responsible manner.  This means 
operating transparently.  It also means focusing on the needs of 
Canadians as citizens, clients and taxpayers.  It means taking 
action when problems arise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make it clear, in regard to the motion today, that the 
Treasury Board Secretariat is addressing the task of 
strengthening internal audits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I am sure everyone will agree, the existence of a strong 
internal audit function is vitally important to sound management 
and modern comptrollership.  As part of its ongoing efforts to 
modernize management and comptrollership practices across 
government, the Treasury Board Secretariat began a study of the 
internal audit function last summer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This study was completed in January.  It recommended that 
changes to the internal audit policy are required to reflect its 
role in modern management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the study recommended that each department 
establish an internal audit committee, if it has not already done 
so, to ensure that audit plans address relevant management issues 
and that there is appropriate follow up action taken to address 
and approve recommendations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These recommendations are substantial and the Treasury Board 
Secretariat is now preparing, in partnership with the internal 
audit community across government, a plan to improve our 
professional capacity in this area to ensure we have the right 
people in place with the right skills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also studying ways to improve our ability to actively 
monitor the effectiveness of control systems across government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week I tabled a document which describes the various 
efforts that are taking place to modernize government management 
practices, entitled “Results for Canadians:  A Management 
Framework for the Government of Canada”.  This document sets out 
in a very clear way the management commitments that the 
Government of Canada is making to Canadians.  It also provides a 
clear definition of the roles and responsibilities of departments 
and agencies and of the treasury board and its secretariat in 
helping the government to meet these commitments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Work on the document began last fall and the final product is 
the result of a great deal of collaboration across government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some have suggested that we in government should not delegate 
authority at all.  Some believe that we should return to strict 
command and control regimes.  I do not believe that the command 
and control approach would serve the public interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion before us today would take us backward, not forward. 
Canadians do not need more red tape.  That is clear.  Nor do they 
need simplistic suggestions which ignore the complexity of 
government in the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want the government to continue to modernize its 
thinking and methods, while keeping sight of the fundamental 
reality that tax dollars need to be managed responsibly and 
wisely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the central themes in “Results for Canadians” is that 
we must continue to implement modern management practices.   This 
involves delegating decision making authority to the right level 
to achieve the results, but in a way that ensures clear 
accountability, due diligence and proper control of public funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This framework emphasizes the need for clear standards, sound 
risk management and early attention to control deficiencies. 
It also makes clear what is needed in terms of active monitoring 
to ensure effective control.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As this framework is implemented across government it will 
greatly strengthen resource management, reduce the likelihood of 
serious control failures in the future and provide Canadians with 
a more modern, more efficient and more effective public service. 
That is what I believe Canadians want, expect and deserve, and 
that is what the government will deliver to Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would assert that she is doing a disservice when she implies

stonewalling, putting up excuses and not getting to the bottom of

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very clear that, under Treasury Board policy, internal 
audits from all departments, once completed, are in the public 
domain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does this mean?  It means that there is not even a need to 
apply under the Access to Information Act because the document is 
already public.  It means fewer procedures are required in order 
to have access to the information. It means that any internal 
audit from any department may be made public immediately.  What 
is this, if not transparency?  It is extremely transparent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All these reports can be made public immediately.  There is no 
need for a motion in the House demanding that we make them public 
and refer them to parliamentary committees.

would be a step backward to provide documents which are supposed

simply reiterating exactly what the government is supposed to be 
doing?  Is it because the government is not following the law?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard: </B>Mr. Speaker, I am merely saying that 
the motion is unnecessary.  That is what I am saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion is unnecessary because all internal audit documents 
from all departments are already in the public domain and it is 
not even necessary to make an application under the Access to 
Information Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member is mistaken with his talk of complying or not 
complying with the act.  It is not a question of complying with 
the act or not.  It is a question of complying with Treasury 
Board policies, which say that once internal audit reports are 
completed they must immediately be made public.  So the motion 
before us today is unnecessary.

talks about modern management practices.  Modern management 
practices require some accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The simple intent of this motion today is to make reports that 
are, as she professes, public documents to be made available to 
people within a 15 day window of being completed.  If we are to 
have modern management practices that call for accountability, 
this motion is in keeping with her own department's guidelines 
which she gave us and which she wants us to support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can this motion move us away from what we want?  In fact, it 
moves us closer toward the accountability that she says she wants

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard:</B> Mr. Speaker, one would think the 
official opposition had just suddenly discovered, in the year 
2000, what an internal audit report is.  This is not a new 
Treasury Board policy.  It has been around since 1994. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Has any member of the official opposition on a parliamentary 
committee ever asked to look at the internal audit report of a 
department?  I have never known of a single one.  All of a sudden 
this year, the year 2000, because the Minister of Human Resources 
Development herself has decided to officially make public an 
internal audit report, they are discovering that there is such a 
thing in administration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has always been.  We have a very clear policy that these 
are public documents.  I am therefore saying again that today's 
motion is pointless. If the members of the opposition who sit on 
various committees want to look at these reports tomorrow, they 
are welcome to do so.  They can do so at any time.  They have the 
power of initiative in each of the committees. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK219"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
listening to the minister, she gives the impression to me and to 
Canadians in general that there is a process that is currently 
being followed by the government that in fact if there is an 
auditor's report then the government will table that report 
within a very short period of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked for a Department of Agriculture and Agri-Food audit. The 
deputy minister at the beginning of March said I would have 
access to that audit, but I am still waiting for it.  I find that 
the best way to access the audits of the government is through 
access to information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the impression to be that, in fact, all audits are 
automatically given to the opposition and to the House? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am referring to a 
completed internal audit report, not a draft report.  We make the 
distinction here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As soon as this report is completed, it is in the public domain. 
It must therefore be made accessible to all members of the 
public, and all parliamentarians, on request, without having to 
use the Access to Information Act.  This is a far more open 
approach than to require people to take the access to information 
route. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I say that today's motion is pointless, in that 
these documents are already in the public domain and can be 
requested by any parliamentary committee. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK220"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney—Alouette, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I would just like to follow up with another question 
because the minister has been asked this several times but has 
not answered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She knows that opposition parties have filed access to 
information requests for internal audits because they have not 
been released, even though treasury board guidelines say they 
should be released, and then directives have been sent after that 
within her own department saying to release these internal audits 
because they are supposed to be public.  They are supposed to be 
public, but they are not.  In other words, treasury board is 
hiding these audits, not releasing them or not putting them out 
in a timely fashion.  That is why this motion is before the House 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will ask the minister once again.  Why is it that her 
department is not releasing these audits in a timely fashion when 
there are already access requests which she says do not even need 
to be applied?  She is right on that, but we are bringing this to 
her attention and the government's attention so they will do 
something about this problem and fix it. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard:</B> Mr. Speaker, it seems fairly obvious 
to me that the hon. member does not understand the difference in 
public administration between the responsibility of the 
departments and that of the Secretariat of the Treasury Board.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Responsibility for making an internal audit public rests with 
the department itself and not with the Secretariat of the 
Treasury Board.  Each department is responsible for its own 
management and must follow the policies of Treasury Board.  Each 
department must therefore make public an internal audit report at 
the request of an individual.  This is how the system works and 
it is Treasury Board policy.  We will actively monitor this 
policy. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK221"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, after that interchange, it may be a good time to step 
back a bit and review the rules, the goal line and what we are 
trying to accomplish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some time ago there were some laudable goals put in place by 
treasury board and the government.  These goals and guidelines 
were designed to establish a simple and open process for people 
to get access to public information.  That public information 
included audit reports.  A few years back the treasury board, for 
which the minister who just spoke is responsible, said that it 
required departments to make the final version of review reports, 
including internal audits and evaluation reports, accessible to 
the public without requiring formal access requests. I heard the 
minister say that.  It is a great idea, it is a laudable goal and 
we applaud that open approach to public information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently, the same concept was reiterated by the information 
commissioner.  He said that he regards the right of access as one 
of the cornerstones of the democratic process and one of the best 
tools available to ensure responsible government.  The problem 
today, and why this motion is on the floor, is that something has 
changed in recent times.  Although those are the goal lines and 
although that is what we are trying to achieve, something is off 
the rails.  That is why we brought this motion forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently, there are audits done which are public reports.  To 
get access to these public reports, we have made formal requests. 
It is clear that we do not have to make a formal request, but to 
make it official we have made them formal.  We are now waiting to 
get access to these audit reports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should mention, Mr. Speaker, that I am sharing my time with 
the member for Dewdney—Alouette. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past when we made these requests for information, the 
response was generally not too bad.  In recent times something 
has changed.  In fact, there are reports, which are public 
information and paid for by public money, that we have made 
formal requests for and 45 days later we are still waiting for 
them.  I do not think it is any coincidence that five of these 
audit reports are directly related to Human Resources 
Development, the area where the billion dollar boondoggle was 
exposed by a previous audit report.  There are five more reports 
that we are waiting for.  It has been 45 days plus and there is 
no sign of those reports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not stop at HRDC.  This delay tactic seems to be 
spreading.  It is not only HRDC.  Now we have requests for public 
reports, paid for by public money, from a number of other 
departments and agencies in the government that we are still 
waiting for:  Agriculture and Agri-Food; Canadian Customs and 
Revenue, the new Revenue Canada; Canada Mortgage and Housing 
Corporation; the Department of Citizenship and Immigration; the 
Department of Fisheries and Oceans; the National Capital 
Commission; and the list goes on.  This delay approach is 
spreading to other departments.  That is the reason for our 
motion today. 
It is the government's own guidelines and own rules and we as the 
official opposition have to bring a motion forward to get it to 
respect its own rules because we see a trend of delay in getting 
access to public information in these audit reports.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When did all this start?  I do not think it takes a genius to 
figure out that when the report for human resources development 
came out, when we got access to it and the minister for that 
department was aware that this was going to be exposed, that is 
when it all started. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government now has put in it appears a new vetting process 
of any new audit.  This vetting process requires that audits, 
before they are released to the public as a public document of 
reports and audits, be now cycled through the treasury board and 
the Privy Council Office.  They want to know what has been 
requested, what is being asked for and what this public report 
says.  Then they develop a media spin to make sure that when the 
report is released they have all the answers ready and they can 
package this in a way that can do damage control, which is 
basically what it comes down to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is that this is causing increasing delays.  That 
begs another question.  How big are the problems?  If the HRDC 
audit which has exposed a billion dollar boondoggle is an 
example, I am wondering if perhaps we have just seen the tip of 
the iceberg with that particular boondoggle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are so many audits being held back for so long?  It is 
taking 45 days for the government to figure out how it is going 
to spin some of these audits in the public arena.  It is more 
than 45 days.  We have been waiting 45 days.  How much damage 
control does it take to release a public document which reports 
on the working of the government?  Apparently it is taking more 
and more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of that, let us reflect again on the statements of the 
information commissioner.  He said, “The right of access is one 
of the cornerstones of our democratic process, one of the best 
tools available to ensure responsible government”.   I like 
another quote from the information minister.  He said, 
“Information delayed is information denied”.  That is 
effectively what has been happening with these damage control 
tactics of the Liberal government on reports that expose things 
like the billion dollar boondoggle which we suspect, and could 
make a pretty good case for, is probably the tip of the iceberg 
based on these many audits that we are waiting for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did we find in the HRDC audit when it came out?  What is 
being hidden here?  Let us look at the HRDC audit for a moment. 
This audit of a billion dollars a year in grants and 
contributions handed out by HRDC revealed some interesting things 
which have concerned Canadians across the country: 15% did not 
have an application on file; 25% of these grants that were handed 
out did not have a description of the activities to be supported; 
87% showed no evidence of supervision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To quote from one of the specific examples, McGill University 
submitted a $60,000 proposal.  It received $160,000, but when it 
was audited it should have only been $30,000.  If that is the tip 
of the iceberg, we can see why the official opposition is asking 
that these public reports not be hidden from the public so that 
appropriate action can be taken and these out of control programs 
can be dealt with in the light of the scrutiny of the public.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister who spoke before me talked about modern management 
practices and that being why these delays were put in place.  I 
submit to her that modern management practices are open, 
accountable and responsive to the problems and do not use delay 
tactics to cover up problems and spin-doctoring to misrepresent 
facts to the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of that, if the minister really wants to modernize the 
approaches taken by the Liberal government she would support the 
motion because it is modernization and enforcement of their own 
guidelines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should be easy for government members across the way to 
support the motion on information being given to the public in a 
timely manner from an open and accountable government.  That is 
what the motion is all about.  We look forward to them supporting 
it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK222"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North—St. Paul, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I listened to the end of the debate of the hon. 
member and it occurred to me to call to the attention of the 
House, by way of commentary, that this morning we listened to the 
President of the Treasury Board inform us of the many initiatives 
her department has embarked on to further strengthen management 
control within government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An outline of those initiatives would include assisting Human 
Resources Development Canada, which is proper; strengthening the 
management of grants and contributions; strengthening the 
internal audit system; and active monitoring.  Last Thursday the 
minister tabled “Results for Canadians:  A Management Framework 
for the Government of Canada”.  It is a very important document 
which describes the various efforts that are taking place to 
modernize government management practices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member spoke about tabling all the audit reports.  While it 
is one thing to ask for them to be tabled, it is another thing to 
study the reports.  Since “Results for Canadians:  A Management 
Framework for the Government of Canada” was tabled on Thursday, 
has the member had an opportunity to read the report? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question 
and I am glad to hear the report was tabled.  I hope that the 
five others from HRDC for which we have been waiting for 45 days 
will soon be tabled and that the public reports of the seven 
other departments in government for which we have asked will soon 
be tabled.  Those are the ones for which we have made specific 
requests to be tabled and we are still waiting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member opposite does not seem to understand what the HRDC 
fiasco has exposed.  When grants and contributions are given out 
to certain entities in certain riding and members of parliament 
have a hand in it, there is a concern that there is a perception 
of conflict of interest, that those grants can be used to advance 
certain political agendas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether or not that is the case, the appearance of the conflict 
of interest potential is there.  That is exactly why there must 
be openness in government.  As the commissioner said, the 
openness and availability of public reports must be there so that 
we can protect everyone in the House against the accusations of 
conflict of interest through having access to the audit reports 
on various departments of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am glad to hear that 
the member was alluding only to perception and not to reality. We 
must underscore what he said, but it is not responsible to keep 
repeating the perception with the hope or at least the unwitting 
result of creating a reality out of a perception.  I am sure the 
member did not mean that.  I am glad to note that he indicated 
that it was a perception.  Of course the corollary is that it is 
not a real fiasco.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther:</B>  Mr. Speaker, regarding perception and 
reality, when the perception is continually laid before the 
Canadian public that grants and contributions are going to the 
ridings of certain members and that they have had a hand in it or 
some involvement in it, the problem is that unless there is 
openness on audit reports, unless there is openness to requests 
for information, which is the treasury board minister's 
guideline, there is concern.  They will never get away from that 
perception unless they allow openness in the public reports 
generated by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If they are really concerned about the perception, they should 
deal with it by endorsing the motion the opposition has brought 
forward today and by saying that they will let us have access to 
public reports paid for by public money for which we have been 
waiting for more than 45 days. 
<P><A NAME="LINK223"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney—Alouette, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, government members opposite talk about perceptions 
and realities.  Let us take a look at them.  Of course they would 
like the perception of all Canadians to be that they are prudent 
financial managers and taking care of taxpayer dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is the very opposite.  This has been exposed to the 
light of day through the HRDC fiasco.  It is unbelievable and it 
cannot be hidden.  That is reality.  That is the reality 
government members are running from.  They would like to create a 
smokescreen, a diversion, and make up a bunch of excuses about 
what they are doing, as though they really are prudent financial 
managers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take a look at some of the information that has somehow 
slipped through the minister's fingers, because we know she likes 
to hang on to it very tightly.  Here is some that has slipped 
through the net.  I will read from a letter from the minister of 
human resources when she wrote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It greatly concerns me that Treasury Board regulations were not 
complied with in relation to issuing advances to sponsors and 
carrying over between fiscal years.  This is an unacceptable 
practice that is completely avoidable.  Every officer responsible 
for managing this fund should be cognizant of the regulations 
under which they work. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the minister's comments to people within her 
department.  She acknowledges that treasury board guidelines are 
being broken.  This is the minister and the government that put 
these guidelines in place.  They are the ones who need to be held 
accountable and responsible for what it is they have done.  We 
are bringing the motion forward in the House today to hold the 
government accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The President of the Treasury Board said earlier in the House 
that the motion brought forward by the Canadian Alliance did not 
mean much, that it was meaningless.  I would argue exactly the 
opposite.  The President of the Treasury Board knows that the 
treasury board has been issued with directives to release the 
internal audits for which we are asking, and it has not done so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the official opposition, members of the Canadian 
Alliance, even filed access requests for some of the information 
which should be made public.  It should already be out there in 
the open, and it has not been released. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are bringing forward the motion today because of the 
smokescreen mentality of the government.  It does not want the 
information to flow which should be in the public domain because 
it would expose the government further to what it really is, an 
irresponsible manager of the public purse.  It has demonstrated 
that through its actions throughout the HRDC fiasco. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see it spreading to other departments now.  The government 
would like for Canadians to believe that it is a good manager 
when the opposite is true.  It cannot hide from that reality. 
That is a reality and the government is in the midst of it. 
Canadians are not happy about it at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to read a little more from some of the information 
we have from within the human resources department, some 
questions and some draft talking points given to employees which 
indicate in many ways that HRDC was not complying with the rules. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1555"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT71"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT71"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1555

<A HREF="#LINKT70"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is a question within an internal document: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were told to be flexible and responsive and not to lapse 
funds.  Now we are being told we have to obey the Financial 
Administration Act and Treasury Board guidelines.  Why doesn't 
management make up its mind? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a fairly indicting comment from within the department 
itself about its own guidelines.  It has to issue questions and 
answers to its own employees about why management does not make 
up its mind, be flexible or obey the rules.  That is 
unbelievable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the kind of information that is being exposed in the 
light of day when we get it.  This information is not forthcoming 
from the current government because it has to run and hide and 
get into damage control mode any time information is released. It 
is accountable for Canadian taxpayer dollars and it is blowing it 
in a big way.  The document goes on to say in answer to the first 
question posed: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—the minister and the Deputy Minister have instructed us to 
follow the rules starting immediately. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does that imply?  It implies that the rules were not 
followed previous to this directive.  It is unbelievable that 
employees had to be reminded to follow the rules.  Another 
question was: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>So what are the new rules?  We have to know before we can talk to 
partners/sponsors. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The answer was: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rules are not new.  They are just being enforced. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They were not enforced before.  That is the implication of that 
comment.  Again I would state that this is glaring evidence of 
the problems the government is running from with the whole fiasco 
and why the President of Treasury Board and the government are 
not releasing information as quickly as they need to do.  They 
are over the time limit in releasing information and as a result 
information is not coming forward.  That is simply wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This document from the human resources department goes on 
further with another question: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do we really have to start these measures of enforcing the rules 
before this year's fiscal year-end? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The answer was: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must obey the Financial Administration Act and the Treasury 
Board guidelines.  This is not an option. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is as though it were some new piece of information that they 
should be obeying the regulations and following the rules and 
guidelines, thereby implying that the guidelines were not being 
followed previously.  That is why there are major problems and 
that is why we are bringing the motion forward today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians need to know this.  They need to sift through the 
information screen being placed in their way by the government 
and take a look at the reasons behind it.  The Liberals will 
stand to say one thing but they will do a very different thing 
with their actions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that Canadians judge the government on its actions. 
What are its actions?  Its actions have shown very clearly that 
it is a very poor manager of the hard earned tax dollars of 
Canadians.  Money has gone out through some of the HRDC programs 
without individuals even applying for funding.  Yet they receive 
funding and very few checks and balances have been placed on that 
funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not government money.  The Liberals seem to think 
somehow that it is government money.  They are taxpayer dollars, 
hard earned dollars that people go to work every day to earn, to 
make a living.  The government, which imposes the highest tax 
rate possible on Canadians, then squanders away much of this 
money in an unaccountable fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think people have a problem if dollars are being 
managed wisely.  Canadians are generous people, but they sure 
have a problem when they see their money wasted and they see 
their money blown on programs that do not even have 
accountability measures built in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is unacceptable and that is why we are bringing the motion 
forward.  That is why we are holding the President of Treasury 
Board, the Minister of Human Resources Development, the Prime 
Minister and the entire group over there accountable for 
releasing information.  They need to do that and they have failed 
to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is almost like the Wizard of Oz.  When we pull back the 
curtain and see a little man sitting behind it we wonder how we 
were bamboozled by this individual.  It is amazing. 
I ask Canadians to pull back the screen and examine in the light 
of day the actions of the government and exactly what it has done 
with Canadians' hard earned tax dollars.  They will be appalled. 
The government should be and needs to be held accountable.

why we brought this motion forward.

examine the actions of the government and to make the government

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview—Greenwood, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is amazing to see the happy faces of my friends in 
the Canadian Alliance today.  I have listened to many of the 
remarks by the opposition today and I do agree on the issue of 
holding us accountable.  Many of us have been in opposition and 
we know it is the opposition's job to hold us accountable.  We do 
not have a problem with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would also like to remind members opposite that when they 
asked for all the records relating to the human resources 
development grants that happened across the country, we produced 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The thing that troubles me about this exercise that the 
opposition is on right now is that it goes against the very 
essence of what this Chamber is supposed to be doing.  What do I 
mean by that?  I mean that we were elected to come to this 
Chamber, which I sometimes call the nation's boardroom, to speak 
for those in our communities, those in our country who need the 
most help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I give notice that I will be sharing my time with 
my colleague from the beautiful county of Dundas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not here to speak for the advantaged, although we do not 
ignore the advantaged, but we are here to speak for those who 
need the most help.  In the last few years I think most Canadians 
would agree that we have gone through a very difficult and 
stressful time because of a tough economy.  In a tough economy 
there are a lot more people who need help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my mind, what the opposition members have done over the last 
few months has been to put a spike in the heart of the essence of 
why we are all supposed to be here.  They have taken the human 
resources development file, HRDC, and have tried to cast 
aspersions on thousands and thousands of projects in every riding 
across Canada, projects that have helped young people get into 
the workplace, projects for seniors, projects for the disabled 
and projects for farmers.  The list goes on of thousands and 
thousands of projects right across Canada.  They have tried to 
create a perception that this entire fund was mismanaged. 
They tried to create a perception that somehow $1 billion—one 
member today even went as high as $3 billion—just vanished, that 
it went out the back door.  I think Canadians are beginning to 
realize that in all but a few examples, 99.9% of that money went 
to important community-building projects in every riding right 
across Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members in the House will cite examples where maybe the 
accounting procedures or the accountability of a particular 
project should have been better.  I have no problem when the 
opposition stands up and tries to ask us about a specific 
project. Ultimately, we, as the government, have to take 
responsibility for all the officials.  The notion of blaming the 
officials, in my mind, is awful.  It is terrible to strike out at 
people who cannot defend themselves.  It is our duty as elected 
members to say that the buck stops with us.  We have to speak up 
and defend the officials.  If they have made a mistake we have to 
take responsibility.  However, we do not, for the sake of 40 or 
50 examples out of over 35,000 projects, have to cast aspersions 
on the whole human resources development file.  I, for the life 
of me, cannot figure it out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does this mean that the opposition wants to do away with HRDC 
projects?  Is that what this line of attack means?  Does the 
opposition want to cast aspersions on the $1 billion that went to 
all the projects?  I see one of the members shaking his head no. 
If they do not want to cancel the HRDC file, then why are they 
trying to stain the whole envelope because of a few files that 
they want to challenge?  That is where I take exception to the 
opposition's line of attack and line of accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opposition members have taken 40 or 50 files out of 35,000 
and have tried to cast aspersions on $1 billion and sometimes 
even as high as $3 billion.  I think Canadians see through that. 
If this had been a more straightforward accountability, they 
probably would have had better luck with the public.  However, 
because they tried to take a few examples and say that the whole 
waterfront was money out the back door, I will bet my seat in the 
next election that all of those HRDC projects in my community, 
which I am proud of and which I stand by, will help get me 
re-elected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member across the way talks about this as being 
pork-barrelling. That casts aspersions on the public service.  I 
am not sure if opposition members realize that public servants, 
officials and bureaucrats—and I think it is important for the 
public to know this—are bound by the Financial Administration 
Act of Canada.  Unless a project meets the criteria, there is 
absolutely no way a contract will be processed because these 
public servants risk their own integrity and their own future in 
the public service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to touch on one other area that is separate and apart 
from the human resources development file.  It has to do with the 
Export Development Corporation.  When the opposition members saw 
that the HRDC campaign to discredit all those good projects in 
every riding across Canada was beginning to falter, they began 
turning their sights on the Export Development Corporation. 
Boy, did they ever make a mistake there.  This is an agency of 
the Government of Canada that has a reputation for being one of 
the most entrepreneurial units in the Government of Canada. Its 
economic track record shows us that.  It has a responsibility to 
assist Canadian manufacturers of products to do business in every 
part of the world.  To try to discredit EDC is really a shame.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, I have no problems in being accountable to the 
opposition, but I wish it would deal with the specific facts and 
not cast aspersions on all departments and all the good work that 
tens of thousands of public servants do across Canada on behalf 
of millions of deserving Canadians.

amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK230"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney—Alouette, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr.  Speaker, taking a look at the defence offered by my 
colleague on the Liberal side, he has used two modes of defence 
in his debate.  One is the minimize defence, which is that this 
has not been very much of a problem at all.  So the first tactic 
in his argument is to say that this is not really a big problem 
and that we should not worry about it.  Mismanagement of a 
billion dollars is okay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also say to my colleague that there is between $13 
billion and $17 billion offered up in grants and contributions— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills:</B>  We have him up to 13. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally:</B>  The hon. member will not listen.  I am 
saying to him, and I will say it slowly and clearly so he can 
hear me, that $13 billion to $17 billion is spent in government 
departments in grants and contributions. I am only stating the 
facts.  I do not think he would disagree with that. What we are 
asking is that if there is mismanagement in this billion dollars 
with HRD, is there a possibility that there could be some 
mismanagement in other departments with government funds? I would 
say, yes, there is a possibility of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member's second defence is the casting aspersions 
defence.  He said it about nine different times.  This is an 
attempt by the member to say that those who would ask questions 
might somehow be casting aspersions on individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are doing is holding the government accountable and we 
are holding the minister accountable for her responsibility. 
Individuals within the different departments, the departmental 
officials which he noted, are between a rock and a hard place 
many times because they have to comply with those rules and 
regulations that are ever changing from directives of the 
minister.

<A HREF="#LINKT74"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>After using his aspersions defence and his minimize defence, how 
can the member possibly defend this kind of spending of 
taxpayers' dollars as though it were nothing major and was just a 
minor thing happening— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  That is the 
question.  The hon. member for Broadview—Greenwood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills:</B>  Mr. Speaker, maybe we will get 
unanimous consent to extend this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I would not want anyone in Canada to think that I was 
trying to minimize any mistake.  By the way, I said earlier today 
in the debate that there is not a businessman or woman in Canada, 
there is not a government agency whether municipal, provincial or 
federal, there is not a perfect agency anywhere in the country or 
for that matter anywhere in the world.  The notion that we think 
somehow that everything we do is perfect, forget it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians know that we make mistakes.  What we are defending 
here is we do not think it is proper that in the opposition's 
process of making us accountable for certain files that were 
maybe not up to snuff, it has also cast aspersions on the whole 
Government of Canada process and 99.99% of the work that is 
proper.  That is my point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally:</B>  Mr. Speaker, again we have seen the 
minimize defence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate the fact that my colleague has admitted that the 
Liberals have made mistakes.  Unfortunately the Minister of Human 
Resources Development has not done that.  Had she done that right 
off the bat, then this would have subsided and would not have 
been the huge problem it has become for the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the hon. member talk to the minister and ask her to make 
the same kinds of comments he has just made in this place? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills:</B>  Mr. Speaker, this is really amazing. 
In my mind the minister has been doing a magnificent job. The 
minister's role is to defend not the 25 or 30 files where we are 
being held accountable, it is her responsibility to defend the 
integrity of all those projects in every riding in Canada that 
have been serving millions of Canadians.  That is her 
responsibility. 
<P><A NAME="LINK231"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is late in the afternoon and there have been hours 
and hours of rhetoric.  I think it is high time for a reality 
check.  I do not include the hon. member for Broadview—Greenwood 
in the rhetoric.  I was referring to the rhetoric coming from the 
other side.  I must correct myself on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I would offer that if this is a reality check, that is 
just unbelievable.  The reality is that the government is trying 
to create a perception that is not so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Mr. Speaker, if the hon. member opposite 
would just wait for about two minutes, we will give him his 
little reality check. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The gist of the opposition argument is while acknowledging that 
treasury board practice and policy is to release audits as soon 
as possible, it is suggesting that the government is somehow 
dragging its heels because it cannot get the audits it requests 
under the Access to Information Act in a timely fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality check is that I am going to read from the 
Access to Information Act.  Section 21(1)(a) says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The head of a government institution may refuse to disclose any 
record requested under this act that contains advice or 
recommendations developed by or for a government institution or a 
minister of the crown. 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left> 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, since 1994 it has been this government's policy 
to release the very information that the Access to Information 
Act entitles it to refuse. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1620"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT76"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT76"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1620

<A HREF="#LINKT75"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Read the section again, I suggest to you, Mr. Speaker.  You will 
see it very clearly states that the minister does not have 
to refuse to release that information and yet we have a 
government that, starting in 1994, almost as soon as we came to 
power, opened up that kind of information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, when you resort to the Access to Information Act to 
try to get this type of information and the government is 
withholding it, if you will forgive me, Mr. Speaker, the 
suggestion is false.  I believe that is in order, Mr. Speaker, 
the suggestion is false. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, all that is happening is that of course the government 
when it is doing an audit wants to give time for its officials to 
examine the results of the audit.  That is what timely release is 
all about.  You have to give the government time to consider the 
results and then release it to the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member's colleagues suggest that all these internal audits 
should be released to standing committees.  This government, which 
is very sincere in its desire to bring the best level of 
management possible, does internal audits all the time, not just 
financial audits but performance audits.  If all of those audits 
went out to a standing committee, the standing committee would be 
absolutely smothered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real answer is to put this kind of information on the 
Internet.  Put it on the Internet where everyone can see it, Mr. 
Speaker, and then you will have the type of management control by 
the people of Canada that is the target of this government and I 
think is very, very poorly understood by the members opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, if they really and truly wanted to ensure 
that it was government legislative policy and it was the law that 
the government had to release these audits, then all the members 
opposite would have to do is to support a certain private 
member's bill that is around.  Bill C-206 offers them the 
opportunity to make amendments to the very clause I cited. 
This particular private member's bill, Bill C-206, uses 
that clause and adds the words that public opinion polls are to 
be disclosed automatically.  You could easily add the words that 
government audits should be disclosed automatically to that 
clause, but no, that is too simple. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To think that the Reform Party, or the Canadian Alliance as it 
is now known, would actually take advantage of a legislative 
initiative of a private member in order to bring more openness to 
government is, just too much to ask.  The party 
opposite has made it very clear that it does not support reform 
to the Access to Information Act.  It does not support it at all. 
It will be very amusing as time goes 
on to see it vote against a bill that calls for openness in 
government.  But we will see. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I am glad of the opportunity to speak on this 
particular issue because if they were really interested in 
bringing more transparency to areas that really matter to 
Canadians, then they should be looking at this whole question of 
making the audits of non-profit organizations, charities and 
crown corporations available to the public. This is a huge area 
of secrecy.  We have a President of the Treasury Board who has 
established a policy despite the restrictions of the Access to 
Information Act, a policy that does call for audits to be open 
and yet we have all these other bodies that spend billions and 
billions of taxpayers' dollars, who, when they are audited, can 
keep those audits secret. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest again that there is an incredible 
opportunity for the opposition members if they really want these 
audits made public, and I think the majority of Canadians would 
say that is correct, they should be supporting a certain 
private member's bill, Bill C-206.  If it passes and goes 
through, it would overtake the Income Tax Act and its 
restrictions on the disclosure of the audits of charities and 
non-profit organizations and would make these available to the 
public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask you, Mr. Speaker, what is wrong with the opposition? 
What is wrong with the opposition that it cannot get on board 
with legislation that is supported by 70 backbenchers on this 
side alone and dozens of backbenchers or members of the 
opposition on the other side? For some reason I 
cannot understand, the Reform Party has abandoned the issue 
entirely and so has the Bloc Quebecois.  They do not care about 
openness and I know why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is because a government that is closed is a good target. 
A government that is open, as we have seen from the minister of 
the treasury board as she explains that these audits are 
available now, you can get them now. Well, Mr. Speaker, that does 
not give much opportunity to the members of the opposition. And 
so they come up with a motion, Mr. Speaker, that I can even 
barely understand.  Mr. Speaker, I am in despair with them.  I 
just do not know what I can do with them.

</I></B></P><P align=left>What they do not seem to understand is that our time in this 
House is precious.  They should get behind legislation, either 
government legislation or private members' legislation, that is 
good for Canadians, instead of putting trivial motions on the 
floor that we have to vote against because the 
motion goes nowhere and suggests by implication that the 
government is not doing its job when in fact it is doing more 
than its job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a government that stands for transparency.  We are

<P><A NAME="LINK232"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the hon. member opposite for his impassioned 
plea for the opening up of the Access to Information Act and to 
become more transparent than is currently the case.  I could not 
agree more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also agree with his advocacy that charitable organizations 
open their books to the public insofar as it is desirable to do 
so.  I do not disagree with that at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the hon. member actually is in agreement with everything 
we stand for over here.  The interesting thing which I cannot 
figure out is why in the world he moved from one bill to another 
bill and somehow thinks that the second bill is better than the 
first.  He has not explained that to me at all.  I do not think 
he has explained it to anyone.  I think that is why he is in 
trouble right now, because he has failed to explain exactly what 
it is that he wants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He wants more access to information and that is correct.  So do 
I, as does this whole side of the House, whether it is the 
Canadian Alliance or others. And I would like to educate the hon. 
member opposite that there is a Canadian Alliance and there is no 
Reform Party in Canada.  Would he please remember that is the 
case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the hon. member, exactly what does he understand an audit 
to be? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  I am sorry, Mr. Speaker.  I have 
difficulty grasping this new name, but I believe it is in order 
if I still call it the former Reform Party.  I do not think there 
is any rule in the House that requires me to call it the 
perfidious alliance or whatever it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Apart from that, there are two types of audits. 
There is a financial audit and there is a performance audit. 
Actually since this government came to power in 1993, the civil 
service has been moving more and more toward performance audits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that there has been a 
very serious problem in governments before and we are moving in 
the right direction.  The problem has been that the money has 
been spent and there has not been a decent tracking of whether 
that money has been spent wisely and well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think what we are talking about here in reforming accounting 
practices and reforming the Access to Information Act is keeping 
track of the money and making sure that money is spent well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is really transparency that you must have before you have 
accountability, and I do believe, not just the political 
government but our bureaucracy is headed in that direction as 
fast as it can go. 
<P><A NAME="LINK233"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, to 
the member who just spoke, I find it interesting that there is a 
party now in the House that would like to distance itself so 
quickly from its previous name that members are standing 
constantly and saying there is another name and they must 
distance ourselves immediately from that party formerly known as 
the Reform Party. It is very interesting that they not only 
distance themselves from their name, but from their leader, their 
party and their principles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of the day obviously is audits.  The hon. member said 
that performance audits are a very integral part of management as 
we know it today in our society.  It is true by the way.  I am 
very familiar with performance and proficiency audits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member also said that in previous governments it was seen 
that those departments were not acting in a proper manner. 
Certainly the performance audits being brought in now are the 
ones now functioning in a proper fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the member then answer please why it is that some of those 
performance audits I have been asking for from other departments 
are not forthcoming from his government?  They are not 
forthcoming and access to information seems to be the only way to 
get those particular audits. 
Is there some reason why this member feels that transparency was 
only good in this government and not in previous governments? Why 
can I not get my audits?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think part of the problem 
is the Access to Information Act itself which was passed in 1983. 
It has not been upgraded or overhauled since that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to get at that legislation and make it so that it is 
very clear the type of information that the bureaucrats 
should release automatically.  In other words, if he wants to 
perform his audit, I would say to him that it should not be a 
matter of an access to information request.  It should be so 
defined as being the type of information that should be 
automatically released, and I think better out through the 
Internet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we are headed in the right direction.  I served a little 
while on the government operations committee in 1995.  I was very 
surprised to see how behind the times a lot of this performance 
management, or lack of it, was.  I think we are headed in the 
right direction, but it is really up to us, the politicians, to 
lead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I really deplore it when I see members of the opposition, and 
not the member who just spoke, because I know he is very 
interested in reforming the Access to Information Act, but I 
really deplore it when other members of the opposition do not 
support what Canadians think is the right thing to do, for minor 
political gain, for their party, Reform, former Reform.  I am not 
sure what it is, but whatever it is allied to, I am sorry, I have 
just forgotten.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> It is my duty, pursuant 
to Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the questions to 
be raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows: the 
hon. member for Acadie—Bathurst, Transfers to Provinces; the 
hon. member for Burnaby—Douglas, Criminal Code; the hon. member 
for Brandon—Souris, Agriculture.

<P><A NAME="LINK234"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to advise you that I am 
sharing my time with the member for Kelowna. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we listen to some of the members opposite, we would think 
that there is not even a problem.  But things are so bad that we 
had to bring forth this motion today on behalf of all the 
opposition parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will be revealing something a little bit later on in my speech 
that will probably be like a bombshell thrown into this place. 
But first of all I want to describe my personal experience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I first came to parliament back in 1993, I thought that if 
we spoke the truth and if we put forth arguments that were 
reasonable and analysed the information available, it would 
affect the decisions made in this place.  What a surprise I 
received when I got here.  Government members really do not 
listen.  They invoke closure on controversial legislation that we 
oppose, but most serious of all, we cannot analyse the 
information because it is not available in a timely fashion.  The 
government delays its release. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, I have made about 80 access to information 
requests.  Hon. members will wonder why I even have to apply for 
the information.  They would think that it would be shared 
freely.  In fact, the government boasts that it is doing a good 
job managing our money and running effective programs.  We would 
think that it would be anxious to share that information with us 
and the public.  But there really is a problem with open and 
transparent government.  That is the reason we brought forth this 
motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government, as the President of Treasury Board has said, 
talks about the complexities of government and the need to 
modernize.  Canadians expect a government in modern times with 
the technology available to have information readily available. 
In fact, it appears as if the government is using the modern 
means available to it to hide the information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the examples of government hiding information are almost 
unbelievable.  The information which should be made available in 
30 days sometimes has taken almost a year.  Hon. members have 
heard that right, almost a year.  In fact, after the government 
was stonewalling some of my requests, I had to complain to the 
information commissioner.  It took almost one year to find out 
how much money was being wasted by the RCMP on the gun registry. 
Probably the information was embarrassing, but it is not being 
released as it should be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other problems.  A billion dollar boondoggle is 
unfolding with regard to the gun registry.

<A HREF="#LINKT78"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over $300 million has already been wasted on laying a piece of 
paper beside every gun in Canada rather than improving public 
safety by putting more police on the street, and the government 
does not want the public to know about it.  That is probably why 
I am having difficulty having my access to information requests 
complied with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are some of the other problems?  I revealed on 
approximately March 9 that the justice minister blocked 172 pages 
of the Canadian Firearms Centre budget documents.  The excuse was 
cabinet secrecy.  I did not know about that until I started 
trying to find out how much the government was spending.  It has 
come up with a new excuse, cabinet secrecy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister's departmental officials are even refusing to 
provide the proposed budget allocation for this coming year, 
saying that they do not need to release that information.  The 
government has also used cabinet secrecy to withhold from the 
public a 115-page report on the negative impact of the Firearms 
Act on the economy.  It has done the study but it will not 
release the results of the study and the cost of its legislation 
for businesses, how it will destroy thousands of jobs and all the 
money that will be wasted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It gets even worse than that.  I discovered through access to 
information that not only does the government hide information 
from members of parliament so we cannot hold it accountable and 
tell Canadians what a mess it is making, it even hides it from 
the courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the bombshell I will tell members about.  Here is what I 
found out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give a preamble.  An eight page document was released to 
me entitled “Cost Presentations Options” was dated February 5, 
1998.  Here is what option C, the incremental approach, says when 
it comes to releasing the costs, “If pressed, confirm actual 
spending of the past three years on C-68.  Provide arguments why 
we can't produce a definite cost forecast”.  In other words, the 
government already planned strategy as to why it would not 
release the information as to how it would explain it does not 
want to release the information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under timing considerations it proposed releasing the cost of 
the gun registry at the same time that the government went public 
with the federal budget.  The reason was that “A lot of numbers 
are mentioned during that period,” referring to the budget, 
“and we benefit from the sheer volume of numbers being released 
(i.e. unlikely to attract a lot of attention)”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member said that if the government does things in a 
certain way, put it on the Internet and so on, that will help. We 
have clear evidence here that it will release so much stuff, so 
many numbers will be put out, that it will be mind boggling and 
the public will not know.  This is clear evidence that it is like 
a culture of deceit over there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is the bombshell.  This is what the minister's bureaucrats 
admitted in a document I received through access to information. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the Alberta reference court proceedings, we argued that we 
were not in a position to reveal costs.  Announcing the costs 
before a decision may add a bad `obiter' in their decision. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Documents provided to me in response to previous access to 
information requests proved the justice department had been 
keeping an annual summary of the gun registry costs since 1995 
and even though those detailed financial documents were 
available, they were telling the Alberta Court of Appeal that 
they could not reveal them.  They would not even tell the courts 
and one has to ask why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Deceiving the public is bad enough, but deliberately deceiving 
the Alberta Court of Appeal must surely have some consequences. 
Why should Canadians care about whether we have open and 
accountable government?  Does this debate even matter today? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me say this.  This strikes to the very heart of democracy. 
There must be a free exchange of information.  Without 
information as to how the government operates, we cannot hold the 
government accountable.  Democracy just cannot work. 
Second, it is the money of the Canadian people that is being 
spent.  They should know where that money is.  We are talking big 
bucks.  When almost half of some people's income is going to 
government, that is a lot of money. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1640"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT80"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT80"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1640

<A HREF="#LINKT79"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, if the money is being used to buy votes, that thwarts 
democracy and it should not be happening.  How can proper 
decisions be made if we do not have all the information 
available?  That really thwarts democracy.  If it is being 
misused, that is also of great concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does someone who has been drinking refuse a breathalyser 
test after being stopped by a police officer on a public highway? 
Why do they say “No, I do not want to take the breathalyser”? 
If a person refused a breathalyser, they can be assumed to be 
guilty.  Is that why the government refuses to be open and 
accountable and release the information? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fourth point I want to make as to why Canadians should care 
about what is going on here is the big issue of trust.  Trust 
does not just reflect on the government.  It reflects on all of 
us in this place.  People do not trust the government because of 
the fact that they discover huge boondoggles long after they have 
been out of this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe there is another bombshell I can drop right here. I made a 
request on the cost of the gun registry and Canadians may find 
this unbelievable.  I cannot use a prop in the House but I 
received a budget document on the cost of the gun registry. 
Everything was itemized except the column where the numbers 
should have been.  It was completely blocked out.  Is that access 
to information?  That is what I am concerned about.  That has to 
stop.  We need to have that information because without it I 
cannot do my job and that should be a concern to all Canadians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK235"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, did I really hear right?  I do believe the member 
opposite said that the government is deceiving the people by 
giving them too much information, too many numbers.  That is 
exactly what he said.  I must say he really underestimates the 
Canadian public because there are lots of people who have 
computers.  He may not know about computers but there are lots of 
people with computers who can crunch numbers and check the 
government's numbers if we can only get them out to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened to the member carefully when he talked about blank 
spaces in the documents he was getting via access to information. 
This is not a problem that exists with government, it is a 
problem that exists with legislation that needs to be reformed. 
If he wants that information, then he should get on board with 
the rest of the backbench MPs and change the Access to 
Information Act into an open government act so we can get that 
information.  He should get on board rather than sitting here 
whining in the House and blaming the government when in fact it 
is his Reform Party's lack of initiative, lack of getting behind 
the private members who are trying to change the way government 
operates, trying to make government open.  I do not know why he 
simply stands here and complains when he could get on board with 
the rest of the MPs on both sides of the House and make a 
difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member has asked 
two good questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the first question about the public and all the 
information, what I was trying to explain to the member is that 
the government has a deliberate strategy to put so much 
information into a certain place and to put in so many numbers 
that it is confusing.  The government has a deliberate strategy 
to confuse.  That is the point I was trying to make. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the access to information request that I put forward, I read 
that part of the government's strategy is to try to deceive 
people by putting information in and taking information out. When 
questions are asked, the government indicates that it is 
explained.  The government puts out information that needs to be 
cross-referenced and wiggles out of almost any accountability. 
That is the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as what the member was saying in regard to access to 
information, that is exactly what we are trying to do here today. 
We agree that needs to be fixed.  We do not have a problem with 
that, but it is the government that has to fix it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member knows that a private member's bill is open to a free 
vote and we have no problem with having a free vote on that kind 
of thing. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1645"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT81"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT81"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1645

<A HREF="#LINKT80"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, without our raising the issue, I do not think the 
member opposite would get much support.  In fact I think he only 
has 70 members supporting it so far.  Perhaps we have to start 
putting public pressure on the government to open up the 
information act and make sure that it is available to everyone. 
That is our point and that is why the debate today is so 
important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member 
opposite for his reasoned reply.  We have over 70 backbenchers on 
the Liberal side who are supporting it and about 40 members or so 
on the opposition side.  Therefore, the will is here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to stress that I am a legislator too.  It is not just the 
government that passes laws or creates laws, it is we 
backbenchers.  In fact we are the very bread and butter of the 
laws.  It is right and proper for a bill of this type, of this 
nature, of this importance to come from the backbench.  There is 
nothing wrong with that.  Why should we always rely on the 
government to have the initiative?  Why can we not band together 
and do good things around this place? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz:</B>  Mr. Speaker, give me a break.  I 
cannot believe it.  We are all here to try to improve the lot of 
Canadians and to pass good laws.  For this member to give the 
impression that it is only the government that cares about it is 
demeaning to what we are trying to do on this side of the House. 
I really resent that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make the point that it is an advantage not just to 
backbench MPs on the government side, but to all MPs in the House 
that we have a free flow of information.  With a free flow of 
information and openness in government all Canadians would 
benefit.  That is the bottom line.  The only way democracy can 
function is if we have a free flow of information.  If something 
is hidden we cannot make good decisions.  That is what this 
discussion is all about.  The government hides information so 
that we cannot hold it accountable, and it is the people of 
Canada who in the end suffer.  That is my main point.  Let us not 
lose sight of that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK236"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is really a very interesting debate that is taking 
place this afternoon.  I would like to commend my hon. colleague 
from Yorkton—Melville for the very explicit and detailed 
analysis that he has done and also the very specific examples 
that he used to illustrate and support his particular arguments. 
I appreciate that very much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to focus our attention a little more concisely, 
because information is such a big word.  In fact it has come to 
the point today where to simply use the word information is 
almost ambiguous.  We have to ask ourselves what kind of 
information it is that we want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about audits.  Audits have been divided by 
various groups into different kinds.  There are internal audits, 
external audits, financial audits, performance audits and a 
variety of audits.  What we are talking about, at least in part, 
has to do with financial audits.  In fact I wish to speak about 
financial audits primarily. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These audits have to do with examining in an official capacity 
the financial statements and the financial records and accounts 
that are kept by government, that are kept by business and that 
are kept by individuals.  The audit is a reflection, an accurate 
statement, an official statement of the expenditures that have 
been taking place in a particular government department.  That is 
what we are talking about this afternoon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The audit is the official examination of whether there is an 
accurate statement of the revenues that have been received and an 
accurate accounting and record of the expenditures that have 
taken place.  However, the audit also follows the trail of the 
money:  Where did it come from?  Where is it going?  What was the 
process used in spending the money?  Was it spent according to 
the plan that was originally established?  That has to do with 
the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The audit compares where the money was supposed to come from, 
where the budget suggested that the revenues be collected, and 
where the money was supposed to be spent, and we have the 
official record of the estimates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Invariably, every year there is a statement that is brought 
forward called the supplementary estimates.  These are estimates 
that are added to the original budget.  They change certain lines 
and they add certain amounts of money to certain lines so that 
the intentions of the original budget document can be met. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1650"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT82"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT82"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1650
<A HREF="#LINKT83"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT81"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget is the guiding document.  It is the policy document. 
In fact the budget is a piece of legislation.  It has the force 
of law, it is the law and it must be observed.  The audit is a 
very clear comparison of what the budget said should happen and 
what actually happened.  It has to do with projects, with 
programs and with the intentions of government as to where our 
money should be spent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two words that refer to the audit.  One has to do with 
accountability, that is, to hold the government to account as to 
whether the money was spent the way it was supposed to have been, 
and also to give an account.  To whom should that account be 
given?  That account shall be given to the people whose money was 
spent.  The money the government has is not its own.  Whatever 
money the government has is money that has been collected from 
the taxpayers, either directly or indirectly.  It is money that 
is held in trust.  The whole concept of holding to account has to 
do with giving an account of how the money that was collected was 
spent.  The government said it needed the money for these 
projects and programs.  Did the government deliver the projects 
and programs?  That is the first level of accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second level of accountability is, did the government spend 
as much as it said it would spend, less or more?  If less was 
spent, why were the costs of the project underestimated?  If more 
was spent, why?  Was it inefficiency or were there other reasons? 
The government had better explain why it did not hit the mark 
set in the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget also establishes responsibility.  It says who shall 
get the money:  the Minister of Human Resources Development, the 
Minister of National Revenue, the Minister of National Defence, 
the Minister of Natural Resources, the Minister of Industry, and 
so on.  The budget clearly identifies who shall get the money and 
on which projects and programs it shall be spent.  If the 
minister does not do that, he or she should be held to account. 
The responsibility is his or hers and no one else's. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point has been made that the servants of government, the 
public employees, are doing an excellent job of managing public 
money.  They had better, because it is the minister who holds 
them to account.  If the minister does not hold them to account, 
then the minister is the one whom the audit should reveal and say 
“Mr. Minister, you are the one who had this account.  This is 
your responsibility.  Make sure that it is done according to the 
regulations and policies that have been set up to do the job”. 
That becomes the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget clearly identifies not only what money should be 
spent, how much should be spent, where it should be spent, but 
who is to be held to account, who is responsible for the 
expenditure of that money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we have to look at the honesty, the integrity, the openness 
and the freedom of the people to do what the government said they 
should do, in trust for the people, in the name of the people. 
When the Minister of National Defence spends money, he spends it 
in the name of the people.  The people trust that minister to 
spend the money in such a way that their security and the 
security of the nation will be looked after.  If it is not, then 
the minister is held to account, and the Prime Minister is held 
to account for all of the ministers in his cabinet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is meant by honesty?  It means that the government and the 
minister have to be able to say “This is the financial 
statement.  These are the revenues that we received.  This is how 
they were spent.  This is an honest statement of what happened”. 
There are not two sets of books.  There is one set of books. 
That is honesty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there is integrity.  Integrity is very interesting because 
the minister recognizes that it is his or her responsibility and 
that he or she is accountable.  The responsibility cannot be pushed 
off by saying “I have delegated this to my deputy.  Therefore, I am 
not responsible, it is the deputy's responsibility”.  If the 
minister is a person of integrity the response would be “I 
am responsible”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about openness?  “Sure, here are the books.  Here is 
where I spent the money.  Have a look and see whether it is not 
so”.  They do not bother to white out columns so as not to show 
certain numbers.  Why would they not want to let out this 
information?  It is a cover-up of some kind. 
It is either the cover-up of a number on a sheet of paper or it 
is the cover-up of a decision that is represented by that number. 
In any event, any kind of whiteout, any kind of resistance to 
give information is a lack of openness.  This is all part of 
responsibility.  This is all part of integrity and honesty.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also something else, and that has to do with freedom. 
When it comes to the business of people giving to the government 
their money, which the government is to spend on their behalf, in 
trust, to do the kinds of things that the government said it 
would do in its budget, the people have the right to know.  They 
should have the freedom to ask the minister and to ask the Prime 
Minister if the government spent their money the way it said it 
would.  That openness has to be guaranteed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not just openness for the sake of openness; it is openness 
in a timely fashion.  If a department's books are opened five 
years later, it might be useful, but there would be a totally 
different set of circumstances.  There has probably been an 
election and there may be a different government in power. 
Timeliness is absolutely critical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to be very, very careful when we talk about these 
audits, that they are timely, that they are open, that they can 
hold people to account and determine clearly where the 
responsibility lies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that is the case, then we need to examine why it is that a 
corporation like the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation can 
request an extension because it needs to consult a third party. 
Whose money is this?  Who made the decision?  The Canada Mortgage 
and Housing Corporation made the decision.  It had the money.  It 
kept the books, but it now needs to consult a third party to see 
whether in fact it is an accurate statement.  What is going on? 
Why does it have to consult a third party?  The corporation is 
responsible.  The minister is responsible.  He should be open and 
he should be able to account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debate is very significant.  It is very necessary and it is 
in the interests of the people who are listening.  I am here to 
hold the government to account.  The government should not be 
afraid.  If it is making good decisions, the people will say 
“Yes, the government has managed my money well”. 
<P><A NAME="LINK237"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I followed the member's speech with great attention, but 
I found myself losing the thread slightly in the sense that he 
seemed to be speaking about financial audits and which numbers 
count. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He will realize, of course, that anyone who has anything to do 
with reading the annual reports of any type of company, 
incorporated or otherwise, will know that often these financial 
audits tell us very little, other than the fact that money came 
in, money went out and there was no criminality or fraud 
involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me, when we look at HRDC, that what we are talking 
about and what we want from government are the results of 
performance audits.  The whole kerfuffle about HRDC is not about 
the actual moneys spent; it is whether or not the moneys were 
spent effectively and properly, whether the proper records were 
kept and whether there was proper management of the moneys.  It 
seems to me we are talking about two things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When he is talking about numbers, is he not really criticizing 
public accounts record keeping, criticizing the estimates and the 
way the government keeps the estimates?  If he is, I would agree 
with him that work has to be done there.  However, I am not sure 
that this motion is really focused in quite the right direction 
if it is the numbers which concern him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for 
giving me the opportunity with that question to expand further on 
this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, it is an expansion of the motion to a degree, but it is a 
very necessary expansion.  The audits themselves reveal the 
processes to be used to follow the money to determine if it was 
spent where it was supposed to have been spent.  That is a 
financial audit.  We could call it a performance audit, if we 
wished.  It is a very fine distinction and one which the people 
really do not care about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the people want to know is if their money went where it was 
supposed to go and was it used for that which it was originally 
intended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing they do not want that money to be used for is to buy 
votes.  That was never the intention when the people of Canada 
gave the money to the government and said “I will pay my taxes. 
I want you to look after those who are poor, who cannot look 
after themselves”, as in the case of HRDC.  That is what they 
want. 
By the same token, they do not want that money to be used to buy 
votes to give particular advantage to particular people because 
they live in a particular way and have given money back to a 
political party.  That they do not want.  The audit will reveal 
that kind of thing if it is a proper audit and if it is open and 
timely.  That is exactly what we want.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have a very simple question for the hon. member.  He 
knows that I have a lot of respect for him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am surprised that there is this assumption that voters can be 
so easily bought.  I have never yet met a voter who could be 
bought.  Maybe I have not asked the right questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Voters in Canada are well informed.  They are thoughtful and 
intelligent.  I understand the political point the member is 
making, but are voters in Kelowna really that stupid that they 
can be persuaded to vote a particular way because somebody brings 
a government cheque to them?  I would be surprised if his voters 
are really that dumb. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the best response is 
that is why they never voted in a Liberal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have too much respect for the minister to not recognize the 
seriousness behind the question.  I want to recognize that the 
voters by and large are very intelligent.  After all, that is 
what makes democracy work.  I also know that we are sometimes 
very subtly influenced by getting certain kinds of money for 
certain advantages.  We are kind of selfish people.  Most of the 
people around here have a bit of a selfish interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do have this kind of thing.  We do have a penchant toward 
doing that.  We want to avoid that.  We do not want the 
appearance of public funds being used to influence a voter to 
cast his or her ballot in a particular direction.  That is the 
issue.  I do not think the voter would do so deliberately.  To 
suggest that they are not influenced is not the way it really 
exists out there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  So the hon. member 
is aware, the debate will terminate at 5.15 p.m.  The hon. member 
has about 12 minutes.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John O'Reilly (Haliburton—Victoria—Brock, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, being a former hockey player I was used to ragging the 
puck whenever I was able to get it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Haliburton—Victoria—Brock had a large number of grants in the 
riding, in fact, the most in southern Ontario, next to Toronto. 
With over 200 programs, it was a great concern to me when the 
leader of the opposition started yelling the new word 
“boondoggle”.  I was very concerned because this was a word I 
had never heard before and was one I was not sure if I was part 
of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked the local press to audit some of the programs in my 
riding.  The first one it audited was the Lindsay Boys and Girls 
Club because it was the largest recipient.  It has a number of 
programs that cater to youth in the riding, that cater to boys 
and girls programs and provides a large variety of very 
worthwhile programs.  It was one that I thought the municipality 
and the county could not afford.  Therefore, we were very 
appreciative that these grants came into the ridings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The audit on the Lindsay Boys and Girls Club looked at the 
applications made, the method of what checks and balances had to 
take place in order for them to receive and keep the grant and 
how the money was actually spent.  I felt that that program 
withstood the scrutiny of the boondoggle by the opposition party 
formerly known as the Reform.  As in the largest majority of the 
grants, I felt there were no problems. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1705"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT84"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We wanted to make sure that the minister was well aware of the 
good publicity received in our riding because we honestly took a 
look at just exactly what the opposition was talking about. 
Therefore, in doing our own audits and publishing the names of 
every organization that received grants, whether it was a local 
pizza parlour that was hiring youth for the summer so that they 
could have their first job, so that they could afford to go to 
university, so that they could pay their tuition, I felt that all 
of these programs stood on their own merits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we looked at each one of them and as we looked at the ones 
proposed again this year, we wanted HRDC to know that we are 
quite pleased with the amount of grants, the number of grants, 
and the proportion of them.  Of course we would like more money. 
Who would not?  But we want them to know that these grants mean 
something to ridings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Haliburton we do not have to go very far to find a population 
with a high unemployment rate, with a seasonal work problem.  We 
have as many problems in trying to address that as the east coast 
and, to some extent, the great north. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>HRDC has already provided the results of an internal audit in 
the grants and contributions program and we have done our own 
audit in our riding.  This total audit identifies some 
shortcomings in the management of the department's grants and 
contributions program.  I think that is normal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we take my riding with over 200 grants, we cannot look at 
that and say that there would not be someone who did not dot an 
<I>i</I> or cross a <I>t</I> or send back the wrong form.  That is 
only human nature, but in fact the internal audits are made to 
identify things that need fixing.  That is why organizational 
reviews and audits are basically tools used by modern managers to 
make sure the right structures are in place and the right 
resources are available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are in a changing world.  We are in a world where certain 
pockets need more help than others.  We have to admit that not 
everyone is caught up in the metropolitan Toronto boom.  Not 
everyone is caught up in the high tech industries.  In my mind, 
Ontario is not Toronto.  That is maybe what happens with the 
party formerly known as Reform.  It has kind of looked at Toronto 
as if it were Ontario.  It really is not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the riding of Haliburton—Victoria—Brock, there 
are 46 municipalities, 24 Santa Claus parades and 18 cenotaph 
services.  We never have a time where we are not busy.  In fact, 
last weekend I had the pleasure of accompanying the minister of 
agriculture for Canada as he toured one of the newest operations, 
one of the great new dairy operations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we go to that area we will find 450 active dairy farms.  Let 
us think about that, 450 active dairy farms in my riding alone. 
The member for Wentworth—Burlington is waiting to heckle me 
because he does not have dairy farms.  Does he have dairy farms? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  I do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John O'Reilly:</B>  Okay, he has good dairy farms, but 
when we look at that as a part of Ontario, not many people from 
Nova Scotia would think that Ontario has one of the largest 
fishing industries in Canada.  The internal waterway is a great 
resource. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to think beyond the megacity of Toronto and the problems 
it has, and go out into the ridings and areas which represent 
mainstream Ontario and some of the recreational facilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to note that the minister of HRDC voluntarily 
made the report public.  She did so as soon as the department 
managers came together with an acceptable plan to meet the 
identified deficiencies.  These are not things which were brought 
out by the party formerly known as Reform.  They were brought out 
by good control within the department's own management system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding controlling payments, no payments are made without 
written confirmation that the criteria are met. 
I know that to be a fact in looking at my riding and correcting 
past problems.   Some of these agencies are made up of volunteers 
or made up of people who are not paid to be auditors, who are not 
paid to be managers, so they do the best they can.  There were 37 
projects flagged in the internal audit report and all other 
active files are being reviewed.  I think that is a compliment.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The HRDC people are key to fixing these problems.  It is not 
something that will happen through access to information.  I 
firmly believe we are the most open in the world on that. The 
professional and dedicated people of the government who work on 
HRDC are the ones who will certainly bring this program into 
line, if in fact it needs to be brought into line, or whether it 
is not just the new word “boondoggle” that the Leader of the 
Opposition had a tough time even pronouncing, let alone spelling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When HRDC is ensuring accountability, it has established a 
performance tracking unit to monitor the corrective actions and 
to provide regular reports.  I think that is what is going on in 
each individual member's riding in HRDC offices right across this 
country, access to the best advice available.  HRDC is in fact in 
regular contact with the office of the auditor general and 
several major accounting firms, so it is following up on all the 
things that need to be followed up on and it has made a 
commitment to openly report and to report objectively on the 
progress. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What it boils down to is the six point action plan is certainly 
seeing its way through the system and producing the results that 
we thought it would produce, that is that there are very few 
programs with which we have any trouble, other than in the eyes 
of the party formerly known as the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members of parliament, it is important that we let our 
officials get on with implementing the plan.  Many thousands of 
Canadians depend on these programs.  If I go back to the Boys and 
Girls Club of Lindsay, I do not know how anyone in fairness could 
stand up and openly contest the good work that it does.  I had no 
trouble throughout all these discussions, always leaning back and 
looking at exactly what was going on in my own riding and how 
that was helping the community.  It certainly was helping the 
community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard from Canadians all across the country.  I have 
heard from Canadians in my riding who are in support of making 
sure that we look after people who need to be looked after, that 
we look after people who are less fortunate than ourselves, that 
we look after the needy regions of the country.  They are not 
just on the east coast or in the north.  They are all over this 
great country of ours.  There are pockets that have great need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to speak a little bit about the tens of thousands of 
Canadians who depend on the support from HRDC.  Whether it is 
helping people become more literate or whether it is helping 
people make their way in a world that is certainly difficult for 
people with disabilities, I think that those types of programs 
are in need of our support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recognize, as the member for Wentworth—Burlington has pointed 
out so many times, there are some 73,000 registered charities in 
Canada, all of which write members of parliament every day and 
all of which lobby the government to try to get more money.  Some 
of them are very worthwhile and some of them we have our 
questions about.  Some certainly should be looked at more 
closely.  I think that is an area that the parties in opposition 
could look at more closely and maybe find some result or find out 
exactly what is going on there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Madam Speaker, I know my time is coming to an end because you 
are waving your finger.  I want to wrap up by saying that I do 
think that the auditor general believes the minister and her 
officials are following the right course to improve the 
administration of the department grants and contributions program 
with the six point plan.  I would encourage them to get on with 
it and they will find, as I have, that the plan is working and 
that the problems exist only in the minds of the opposition.

<A NAME="LINK242">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from February 25 consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-222, an act to establish the office of First Nations 
Ombudsman to investigate complaints relating to administrative 
and communication problems between members of First Nations 
communities and their First Nation and between First Nations, 
allegations of improper financial administration and allegations 
of electoral irregularities, be read the second time and referred

<P><A NAME="LINK243"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan—Shuswap, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in full support of the bill by the 
hon. member for Wild Rose, Bill C-222.  We are into the final 
hour of debate.  We have heard a fair bit about the bill and I 
have listened to what members on the other side have had to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am here tonight to tell those members that I have been to many 
of these meetings.  I have listened to the aboriginal people who 
have showed up at these meetings.  I have listened to their 
concerns.  Some of the stories I have heard would bring tears to 
your eyes, Madam  Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had a speech for tonight.  Instead, I will read into the 
record a letter calling for financial accountability.  It states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been working for 5 years trying to get accountability, 
democracy and equality to our First Nations communities.  We 
worked for three years under the name Dakota Action Group and for 
two years under First Nations National Accountability Coalition 
of Manitoba.  To date, we have gone national and are in the 
process of registering our organization under First Nations 
National Accountability Coalition.  We have organizations in 
British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario and 
New Brunswick.  We get calls from all parts of Canada with 
regards to mismanagement of band funds, corruption, nepotism, no 
services, no equality and dictatorship rule in the First Nations 
communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have approximately 200 reserves that have joined our 
accountability coalitions and there are about 213 that have been 
in contact with our organization or affiliates.  These band 
members want their rights restored under the Canadian 
constitution, the charter of rights and freedoms, the Human 
Rights Act and the Indian Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As aboriginal people and as Canadian citizens, we have been 
stripped of all rights by our very own aboriginal leaders as well 
as the department of Indian affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Corbiere consultation process is proof of that.  The supreme 
court ruled in favour of the Batchewana off reserve band members 
to vote in band elections, but they could not do the consultation 
process nor could they get the funding for it.  The government 
gave the defendants—the Indian affairs and the chiefs and 
councils—funding to do the consultation process.  We believe the 
government is letting the fox get security for the hen house. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our organizations, which deal directly with the “grassroots 
people” across Canada, were not informed of the Corbiere 
consultation process or of the funding for it.  Again, the 
grassroots people have been neglected and forgotten.  The 
aboriginal people have no rights.  The majority are ruled 
“dictatorship style” on the reserves.  There is no economic 
development in the First Nations communities.  Most reserves have 
no money and huge deficits with no future in sight for band 
members.  This is one reason the suicide rate has sky-rocketed 
and has reached epidemic proportions on the reserves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The way the chiefs and the council operate their systematic 
government is demoralizing, demeaning and discriminatory.  There 
are very few band meetings, if any at all.  Few band members are 
privileged to be employed. The grassroots people are not informed 
of any developments on how their funds are spent.  They can only 
observe the chiefs and council and their relatives drive new 
vehicles, get new houses or extensions on homes and the chiefs' 
and council's children sent to private schools.  Nepotism is 
widespread.  The band members are not educated and they are kept 
that way.  The chiefs and councillors are not available to be 
accountable or to provide information because they are on exotic 
vacations/trips and they are paid twice for per diems, travel and 
honorariums. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Their cellphones are unlisted while grassroots people are forced 
to live in third world conditions.  Many cannot access money for 
housing, medical, education, transportation, including all other 
programs such as native alcohol and drug programs. Any activity 
or requests for accountability results in all services being 
discontinued.  The aboriginal leaders do not consult with the 
band members.  They do whatever they want.  They spend band funds 
any way they want with little or no sensitivity to the needs of 
their people.  The grassroots people pay dearly and heavily for 
the extravagant squandering of band funds (tax dollars) by the 
chiefs and council.  This is condoned by the department of Indian 
affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the non-native people ran their businesses the way the 
majority of the chiefs and councillors operate the band offices, 
they would be in jail.  This is proof of the double standard that 
exists in a democratic country such as Canada.  To go to Indian 
affairs or the RCMP is futile.  Numerous packages have been given 
to both departments about fraud, corruption, embezzlement, etc. 
A blind eye is turned.  RCMP liaise with Indian affairs and so it 
appears that Indian affairs investigated themselves and controls 
the RCMP.  This leads us to believe that the chiefs and 
councillors are above the law.  Their criminal activities are 
untouchable.  The band members have nowhere to turn for help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We knew the band members needed to have a native ombudsman, so 
we did a proposal and gave it to (the member for Wild Rose) to 
take to the House of Commons on behalf of the grassroots people. 
Without one, there will be more Waterhen, Gustufson and Oka 
crises.  Situations have deteriorated so badly that people are 
threatening to take arms up against their chiefs and council and 
to give up their lives for change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a crisis in our First Nation communities and it is 
crucial that a native ombudsman be enacted into legislation. 
Fortunately for the grassroots people from coast to coast, there 
is an organization like the First Nations Accountability 
Coalition where people can vent their frustrations, hopelessness 
and receive a glimmer of hope that there might be a solution 
which is the native ombudsman who will be there on behalf of the 
grassroots people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We appeal to all members of parliament to support this native 
ombudsman Bill C-222.  If the government is sincere to remain in 
good standing in their special relationship with Canada's First 
Nations people, and if they truly want accountability, democracy 
and equality in Canada, as well as lighten the tax burden, then 
they will support Bill C-222.  We see this as a major milestone 
in building on a new relationship with the grassroots people of 
Canada and we are PEOPLE too!

</I></B></P><P align=left>This letter was written by Leona Freed who has worked very hard 
to bring some of these concerns to the attention of the 
government and to the attention of members of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to quote from another article called “Chief 
Injustices”.  It will give members something to think about.  It 
says “if you dare criticize the abusers, you are ostracized.  If 
you dare speak out in favour of support groups who are off 
reserve for urban aboriginals, if you speak out against the 
aboriginals, you stand the chance that aboriginal goon squads 
will come after you”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not uncommon.  It goes on and on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We went to meeting after meeting.  I attended a meeting in 
Alberta with the hon. member for Wild Rose.  The native people 
came up to us an told us they were threatened.  They were at the 
meeting even though they had been threatened not to talk to 
members of parliament and not to raise those concerns.  Is this 
any way to live in this country when a person cannot take their 
concerns to their member of parliament, let alone the RCMP, 
without threats being made against their family?  This is what is 
going on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not just the communities that are saying this.  I will now 
quote some examples given by a judge.  The most high profile 
example of aboriginal corruption is on the oil rich Stoney 
Reserve, 60 kilometres west of Calgary, where an independent 
audit in financial mismanagement resulted in 43 complaints being 
turned over to the RCMP.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The examples go on and on but does the government listen?  Does 
the government listen to the grassroots people?  No, it listens 
to the people it wants to, the Phil Fontaines who get all the

native people.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John O'Reilly (Haliburton—Victoria—Brock, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, Haliburton—Victoria—Brock is a riding in central 
Ontario that enjoys some prosperity and good relations with some 
aboriginal groups and some that are even better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a pleasure to rise and speak to Bill C-222.  I believe the 
hon. member's motion has been inspired by a sincere desire to 
improve living conditions in aboriginal communities and to 
promote greater accountability for the management of funds or to 
encourage the development of aboriginal self-government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regrettably, his rhetoric today and in the past, and his party's 
well-known and oft-stated position with respect to aboriginal 
issues, leads me to a different conclusion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The party, formerly known as the Reform Party, opposes 
aboriginal self-government.  It would prefer to return to the 
good old days when a paternalistic Ottawa managed the affairs of 
first nations. It does not believe that aboriginal people can be 
trusted to manage their own concerns, make their own decisions or 
determine their own destiny.  When there are different reports 
about poverty on reserves or financial difficulties in some 
aboriginal communities, it seizes upon that as proof that 
aboriginal people cannot be trusted and should not be encouraged 
to manage their own affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We take a different view.  This government believes that first 
nations can be trusted, that they are responsible and that they 
deserve to run their own lives.  Our preference is for 
partnerships not paternalism and for co-operation not control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me remind the House how we came to where we are today, how 
the issue of financial management has evolved over the years and 
why it is so important to demonstrate our continuing confidence 
in first nations as they make their way through this period of 
transition to self-government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Until the late 1950s, the federal government delivered most 
programs and services directly to first nations.  By the late 
1970s first nations were administering some programs in 
accordance with terms and conditions set out by the Department of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 1980s the process of devolution began to pick up steam 
and new funding arrangements were developed.  First nations were 
administering more programs, but still under the mandate of the 
Indian Act.  Today 83% of our department's budget for programs is 
transferred directly to first nations and a further 11% to 
provinces for service delivery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More importantly, in the 1990s, as we moved toward 
self-government, more and more first nations are assuming 
jurisdiction and greater responsibility for these programs.  That 
means more and more they are planning and managing services based 
on the needs of their community.  These new arrangements 
emphasize the relationship between chiefs, councils and their 
members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means that our primary role is no longer to deliver 
services to first nations but to design and manage financing 
arrangements that will allow first nations to deliver their own 
programs and be accountable for those programs for their 
memberships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we transfer more responsibility to the first nations, we are 
also working toward strengthening and building the skills and 
professional capacity within first nations that are needed to 
support these programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As funding arrangements have changed, so too has the issue of 
accountability.  In the old days, when the federal government 
provided most of the programs and services directly, the lines of 
accountability were clear.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The departments involved, through their ministers, were 
responsible to parliament.  Over time, as responsibilities 
devolved to first nations, efforts were made to promote local 
accountability; that is to say, first nations are becoming 
accountable to their constituents for the expenditures of funds 
and for the quality of programs and services they deliver. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In these times of limited resources, Canadians are insisting, 
quite rightly, that we manage tax dollars prudently.  This is 
true of aboriginal and non-aboriginal governments alike.  The 
same principles of accountability which apply to non-aboriginal 
governments also apply to first nations, principles like 
transparency, disclosure and redress.  This means, for example, 
that first nations must disclose to their membership not only 
annual audits, but information such as the salaries of chiefs and 
councils, travel expenses and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has worked with aboriginal governments to 
put in place financial standards that are comparable to other 
governments exercising similar responsibilities.  The emphasis is 
now on making the information within first nations financial 
statements relevant and comprehensible to community members. 
Similarly, the accounting industry is starting to consider the 
needs of first nations when developing accounting standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently, as some first nations have assumed greater 
responsibilities and acquired significant assets, through land 
claims settlements for example, they have recognized the need for 
more sophisticated accounting systems.  What we have seen is that 
first nations have gained the right to manage their affairs. 
They are moving to strengthen accountability and management 
practices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Much of the progress in this area has not received the attention 
or publicity it deserves.  Too often it is only the first nations 
communities that run into real financial problems that make it on 
to the news or into the papers.  In fact, last year only 2% of 
first nations had their agreements placed under third party 
management.  The simple fact is that most reserves are managing 
their finances properly.  I believe this record reflects both the 
determination of first nations to manage their affairs 
responsibly and the creation of proper checks and balances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When problems do arise, the department may intervene in a number 
of ways, depending on the problem.  For example, we may simply 
make sure that the first nation is aware that there is a problem, 
encourage it to find solutions and offer advice.  In other cases 
we will consult with the band more actively or hire a co-manager 
to address the difficulty.  Only in a very few cases, the 2% I 
mentioned earlier, is it necessary to bring in a third party to 
stabilize the situation until a solution can be found.  Some 
intervention does happen, but our favoured approach—and I am 
sure the House will agree it is a good one—is not intervention, 
but prevention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The brief chronology I have sketched today shows the evolution 
of our relationship with first nations as a government.  It 
highlights the increasing responsibility and accountability that 
has been assumed by first nations in recent years as they move 
toward exercising their inherent right to self-government. 
However, we must keep in mind that this is a story that is still 
being written.  Yes, there have been growing pains along the way 
as we make the fundamental transitions in our relationship, but 
if we think that people are not exercising their judgment well, 
is the answer to take away their ability to choose or to inform 
their judgment? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The party formerly known as the Reform Party would have us take 
away the rights of first nations to choose, to grow and, yes, 
occasionally to make mistakes.  Our government would rather work 
with first nations— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  The hon. member knows well that the purpose of this bill 
is to attempt to provide an ombudsman for aboriginal grassroots 
people.  Would he stick to the topic, please? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John O'Reilly:</B>  Madam Speaker, I am glad that I have 
struck a chord with the party formerly known as the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our government wants to work with first nations, not to put them 
down, not to demean them, not to make them crawl into line 
somewhere in the former Reform Party's policies.  First nations 
must have self-reliance.  They cannot have a continued state of 
dependency.  We would rather work with first nations as partners, 
not dictate to them like parents.  In short, we would rather 
build for the future than return to the past.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):</B> Madam Speaker, I would like 
to congratulate my colleague from Wild Rose for bringing forward 
Bill C-222.  The purpose of this bill is to create the position 
of a First Nations Ombudsman to investigate complaints relating 
to administrative, financial or electoral problems between 
members of first nations communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from South Shore—who has been working very hard on 
this—and my colleague from Madawaska—Restigouche have already 
spoken in favour of this bill.  They have said that the 
Progressive Conservative Party supported it because it was 
important for all levels of government and private enterprise, 
including the first nations in this instance, to be accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have all read the newspaper reports about poor administration 
among Canada's first nations.  This problem has drawn media 
attention in the maritime provinces, Nova Scotia in particular. 
Members of two Nova Scotia bands have accused their governing 
councils of mismanaging the funds received from the federal 
government for the welfare of the entire band membership.  In 
some cases, the question is not whether the band has administered 
the funds correctly, but whether it can justify their use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More serious still, an internal audit at Indian and Northern 
Affairs Canada has revealed that the department does not know 
which bands have filed complete, detailed statutory financial 
statements, because of poor co-ordination between the regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The department has no mechanisms by which it can verify the 
administration of these various sectors. Audit has revealed that 
monitoring of compliance was inconsistent and that, as a result, 
the Crown was at risk of additional responsibility if monitoring 
by INAC staff was insufficient or inconsistent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the evaluation, there were four other factors with 
potential negative effects on compliance with the terms of the 
agreements.  In certain cases, indicators of measurable 
performance were not clearly defined in the funding agreements, 
resulting in imprecise reports by recipients and imprecise 
monitoring; post-audit follow up on qualified opinions and 
reports of non-compliance was not uniform; payment authorizations 
were not always supported by satisfactory compliance reports; 
regional quality control assessments of the compliance monitoring 
process were limited. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development gives 
first nations close to $4.6 billion so that they can provide 
their members with social programs and services.  Unfortunately, 
this money does not always reach those for whom it is intended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it is obvious that not all first nations are badly run. 
On the contrary, many aboriginals are very well served by their 
chief and their council.  It also happens that some bands have 
trouble managing their money properly because of a lack of 
training or for a number of other reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some first nations are progressive and have created programs 
designed to help their members achieve social and economic 
stability, and they are to be congratulated.  However, even in 
their case, a ombudsman could provide an important service. 
People need an office to which they can turn for information or 
with which they can lodge a formal complaint and be sure it will 
be investigated impartially and independently.  The establishment 
of the office of ombudsman does not mean that there are major 
management problems to be resolved, although one of the 
ombudsman's duties would be to look into these problems to make 
sure that the money is getting to the right destination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is nothing new.  Many provincial governments, 
businesses and public organizations have created the position of 
ombudsman to improve client relations.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These offices provide people with a means of raising issues that 
they feel have not been appropriately resolved through other 
channels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that the creation of the office of first nations 
ombudsman would be an effective and useful means of responding to 
the concerns of aboriginals, whether they have to do with 
electoral irregularities, or financial or administrative 
problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Aboriginals complain that there is no one to whom they can turn 
to challenge the way their chief or band council is doing things. 
The position of independent ombudsman would be one possible 
solution, since the incumbent would be able to get to the bottom 
of complaints lodged with his office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, it would allow aboriginals to pursue their 
grievances when they felt they had not been listened to by their 
chief or their band council, or when they did not want to discuss 
them openly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under this bill, any first nation member could use this service. 
Some aboriginals have expressed their support for the creation 
of the office of first nations ombudsman.  They recognize the 
role that an ombudsman would play as an intermediary between 
aboriginals and their chief or band council.  It would be a means 
of encouraging aboriginals to suggest ways of improving their 
relations with their chief without fear of reprisals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill sets out how the office of ombudsman would operate. 
For instance, it stipulates that the ombudsman would be appointed 
by the governor in council on the recommendation of the minister 
for a term of five years.  The first nations would take part in 
the appointment process by making representations to the 
committee reporting to the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not go into the details of how the office of ombudsman 
would operate.  I see advantages to creating such an office, but 
I am not sure that it is a good thing to have the governor in 
council make the appointment.  I think this should be reviewed, 
so that members of the first nations have a greater say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is only on the condition of being consulted and involved in 
the entire process that they will have confidence in the position 
of ombudsman.  It is clear that the first thing to be considered 
is their opinion and their suggestions in the process of 
establishing this position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill recognizes that aboriginal peoples must also look to 
themselves and their organizations and their elected bodies to 
protect their rights and access to service.  Instead of 
complaining to the Minister of Indian Affairs, they will be able 
to turn to an independent ombudsman. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On condition that they are part of it, this process may help the 
first nations assume responsibility and accountability for their 
actions.  As I mentioned earlier, I think this is a very valid 
bill.  Misunderstanding and discord may often be resolved when a 
mechanism is in place for such purpose, and the position of 
ombudsman may be such a solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Improved services to band members, increased transparency and 
accountability are three objectives the office of the ombudsman 
can help achieve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government could draw a lesson from all of this. Too 
many departments are totally indifferent to these vital 
objectives all responsible governments must set for themselves. 
In recent months, it has become clear to taxpayers that there is 
a shortage of transparency and accountability in the Department 
of Human Resources Development and in other departments, and 
others to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More recently, similar problems have surfaced in the Department 
of Indian Affairs.  If the position of ombudsman can contribute 
to transparency, efficiency and accountability, our party 
supports its creation.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-222 was presented to the House by the member for Wild 
Rose.  If this bill passes, it will put in place the position of 
ombudsman for aboriginal people to go to if they are having 
difficulties dealing with their leadership or a band dealing with 
another or situations like that.  The member is to be commended 
for bringing this piece of legislation forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was one of the recommendations of the Lakeland aboriginal 
task force which I set up in my constituency in 1997 shortly 
after the election.  After the election, the new part of my 
constituency took in eight Indian reserves and four Metis 
settlements for a total aboriginal population of about 30,000 
people.  I immediately started getting phone calls from people 
who had real concerns about issues like housing, alcohol and drug 
abuse on their reserve and the lack of accountability as they saw 
it on the part of chiefs and councils on their reserves.  It was 
not just one or two isolated calls. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result, I set up a task force made up of four aboriginal 
people and myself.  Over the next several months we met with 
people in a three step process.  First, we met confidentially, 
one on one.  Second, we sent out questionnaires and had several 
returned.  Third, we had three public meetings in the 
constituency.  Some very interesting things came out of this 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will refer particularly to the recommendation which deals 
directly with what we are talking about.  That is recommendation 
number four under the category of democratic accountability.  It 
says that “the government must establish an arm's length body, 
an ombudsman or agency to hear and act on the confidential 
concerns of aboriginal Canadians”.  This proposal came from 
people who made presentations to us throughout this process.  It 
was a recommendation that was almost unanimously supported by the 
hundreds of people who took part in this process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The suggestion came up because there were many people who felt 
alienated from their band or settlement leadership, as well as 
from the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development. 
Some speakers at this meetings said they did not feel comfortable 
in approaching Indian Affairs and Northern Development because 
they had seen people who had felt negative repercussions when 
they did so in the past.  Even when they approached Indian 
affairs in confidence, often the exact message that they took to 
it got back to the chief and council.  They did not feel they 
could trust Indian affairs to keep their confidential issues 
confidential.  That is why they felt they needed an ombudsman. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In many cases, they felt the problem was with the leadership of 
the chiefs and councils.  That is not the situation in every 
case, nor would I ever say that is the case.  However, it is a 
very common problem and we cannot ignore that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal member who spoke previously said that it was very 
unusual to have problems of the lack of accountability on 
reserves.  He either does not understand the reality or he is 
trying to minimize the problem.  It is a very common problem 
across the country.  It is not only the eight reserves in my 
constituency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what was said in one presentation: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“A lot of people in my community have been discriminated against 
(by chief and council),” said one participant.  “Where do you 
go in your community for help?  Higher government just refers it 
down to the local elected officials.  We need something for 
grassroots people who can't speak out right now, because they 
know there is a price to be paid.  An advocate, or an 
arm's-length agency.  A hearer of all injustices within the 
aboriginal community.”

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what this person said when presenting to the aboriginal 
task force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They did acknowledge that the logistics of setting up the 
ombudsman position might be quite difficult, but it is something 
they felt was worth the effort.  That was a point which was made 
very clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They suggested that the ombudsman should be in place for a time 
period very similar to what this private member's bill suggests. 
That is part of the reason I suggest this is a good bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister of Indian affairs on several occasions has said in 
the House that he really cannot deal with issues when they arise 
on reserves.  He cannot deal with problems on reserves because 
that is the responsibility of the leadership on the reserves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an interesting point because the first thing is that the 
minister of Indian affairs absolutely has responsibility for what 
happens on reserves.  It is clear in Canadian law.  He is 
abdicating his responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, how is it that the chiefs and council members are going 
to deal with problems brought to them when the problem in many 
cases is themselves?  It is the chief and council.  That is where 
so many members who presented before the task force made the 
point as strongly as they possibly could. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“It seems like a hopeless situation”, they said. “We can see 
a situation where our council, including the chief, is 
misspending money.  We know this is happening and we have nowhere 
to go.  We see situations where we know elections have been 
unfair and we can point to particular problems in the election 
process, but we feel we have nowhere to go.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the type of feeling which came up again and again.  I 
believe this ombudsman position will help deal with part of that 
problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate the member for Wild Rose for bringing this forth. 
I know that he brought this bill forth because he heard from 
grassroots aboriginal people right across the country, including 
the members in the gallery.  He heard from them that the 
situation is desperate, that they do need someone to go to, that 
they cannot always go to leadership because in many cases the 
leadership is the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the minister of Indian affairs suggest when we bring 
these problems to him?  He says, “Well, you know, you have to 
leave it up to the band because we have self-government”.  He 
talks as if the bands in this country are a separate level of 
government, that they are somehow an equal government, to be 
treated equally with the federal government.  That is the way he 
talks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we raise these issues, he says that he has no way he can 
deal with the problem.  He says that the answer to the problem is 
self-government and more responsibility to chiefs and councils. I 
believe that that is the case.  That is part of the answer, more 
ability on the part of leadership to deal with the problem, but 
in terms of fiscal accountability, electoral accountability and 
fair elections on reserves, we can only go to a system where 
there is more self-government where these issues are dealt with. 
They have not been dealt with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting what people at one of the public meetings said 
on exactly this issue.  One member speaking at one of the public 
meetings, and this was covered on television, said, “Ron Irwin 
has sent a memo out to reserves saying that no one would be 
forced to take self-government until everyone was ready.  We had 
a referendum and said no.  Now Jane Stewart, we are feeling, is 
being pushed into it.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At a public meeting of about 70 people in St. Paul, Alberta, I 
asked this question.  I asked, “How many of you think that we 
should be moving to a system of self-government now?”.  One hand 
out of the 70 went up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked the question another way:  “How many of you feel we 
should not be going to self-government until the problems of 
accountability are dealt with?”  All the hands went up except 
one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Self-government is not the answer until accountability is put in 
place.  This ombudsman will help deal with the situation of a 
lack of accountability.  I applaud the member and I will support 
this bill.  I hope everyone in the House will support this bill.

Mr. Speaker, I want to say that this is a very personal issue to me. 
My wife and I visited the home of an aboriginal family.  We were 
confronted by six women.  One of the women there was just 
completely shaken with the fact that the chief and council had 
removed her family from her.  She had no place to go.  The host 
who convened this meeting had helped her get her family back by 
going to the provincial authorities.  By doing so, this woman now 
has her family back.  She was really shaken with the concept of 
self-government because with self-government, where would she go? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not the end of the story.  The end of this particular 
story is that the host of this meeting and her family were then 
told that they must leave the reserve because the people on the 
reserve, the chief and council, said that they had a requirement 
for housing, notwithstanding the fact that there are 11 vacant 
houses on that reserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She was not only required to leave, but she was literally frozen 
out of her house last winter when the chief and council saw to it 
that the power and water were turned off at her home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of the ombudsman is a real issue.  It is a gut level 
issue that I have seen and I have experienced.  This is something 
that absolutely must happen if the government is set on the idea 
of going ahead with self-government.  Along with self-government 
there must be the position of ombudsman. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Iftody:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I understand and I have agreement with the members from the 
opposition, and I am sure that the House would agree, that the 
mover of the bill, the member for Wild Rose, be given the last 
few minutes remaining to speak and summarize on the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Do we have the 
unanimous consent of the House that the hon. member for Wild Rose 
will have until 6 p.m.? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK248"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I want to thank all the members in the House of Commons 
who participated in the debate.  I appreciate their opinions. 
Although we may not agree with some of them, we certainly do 
appreciate hon. members having a say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to especially express my appreciation to the 
thousands, and I mean thousands, of grassroots natives across 
this country who have taken the time to support the bill and have 
input with Leona Freed to put together a final 200 page report 
that we have released today which is available to all members of 
the House of Commons.  I encourage each and every one of them to 
get a copy of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am making a last plea on behalf of the aboriginal grassroots 
people, many of whom are with us today in the gallery.  I am 
pleased to have them here.  We are looking for support on the 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to remind all members that this is a very serious 
consideration.  There is not one member, you, Mr. Speaker, 
myself, every member in the House of Commons, any citizen in 
Canada who does not have access to am ombudsman to help deal with 
grievances in their lives.  The only people that does not apply 
to are natives who live on a reserve.  Is it not about time that 
these people who live on the reserves have the same equality that 
each and every one of us in the House and across this land enjoy? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These kinds of inequalities must not exist.  If hon. members 
vote no, they are saying no to equality and they should remember 
that.  Hon. members do not want equality on the reserves if they 
vote no.  I encourage hon. members to support these people and I 
encourage them to remember that the basis of all of this is a 
plea for accountability.  A no vote means no to accountability. 
I will remember how hon. members vote.

<P><A NAME="LINK266"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst, NDP): </B>Mr. Speaker, on December 
14, 1999, I asked a question about transfers to the provinces. 
My question read as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, on Wednesday, December 8, the Legislative Assembly 
of New Brunswick unanimously passed a motion calling for 
re-establishment of social transfers to the 1994-95 level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the Minister of Finance prepared to listen to his Liberal 
cousins in New Brunswick and to restore transfer payments to 
their 1994-95 level in order to ensure that the people of New 
Brunswick may benefit from better social programs? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance responded as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member must realize that, including the 
tax points, or in other words all transfers together, we are 
already where we were five years ago. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason I referred to “his Liberal cousins in New 
Brunswick” was because a motion in the New Brunswick legislative 
assembly was passed unanimously. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1900"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT101"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal Party of New Brunswick was even in agreement with 
the Progressive Conservative Party in saying that the transfers 
to the province of New Brunswick were—and we know this, for it is 
the same everywhere in the country—not as high as those received 
in 1994-95, because of the cuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, according to the figures available, the federal 
government is paying only 15% of health costs.  Up until 1969, 
the federal government paid 50%, as compared to a mere 15% 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hear our Liberal friends across the floor saying “No, no, not 
true”.  If it is not true, the Liberals of New Brunswick are 
telling untruths, because the provincial Liberals of New 
Brunswick voted along with the Progressive Conservatives members 
in order to tell their cousins in the federal government “We 
want the same transfers as in 1994-95”. 
So which ones are telling the truth?  The provincial Liberals or 
their federal Liberal cousins?  This is a question that must be 
raised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The one thing we do know is that, in the health field, people 
are suffering.  Hospitals have been closed and patients are 
being forced to go to the United States for treatment.  This we 
know, and we know what suffering it is causing.  Every day, the 
Minister of Health gets up in the House to tell us “New methods 
have to be found”.  Might this new method be to go the American 
way?  That is the question that must be asked. 
Answers must be found and they must be found fast, because we 
are paying the Americans millions and millions of dollars to 
look after Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, this is going on in every province.  People are 
forced to go to the United States for treatment.  I is sad to 
say but, here in Canada, animals are treated better than people 
in the health system.  A dog or a cat would not be allowed to be 
mistreated the way the sick are in the health care system of 
this, of which we are supposed to be so proud. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This country should be able to look after our health care 
programs so that the provinces are not paying up to 85% of 
costs.  I am talking about costs, not just the tax points the 
Liberals keep coming back to, but real day-to-day costs. The 
government should look at the bill and pay half. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tomorrow, I am sure that we could have better health care in 
Canada, and our friends and families would not have to go to the 
United States for treatment. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK267"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I cannot speak for the New 
Brunswick provincial Liberal Party, but perhaps the day they 
voted there was a full moon because it is a well-known fact that 
the federal contributions are more like 32% or 33% and that the 
federal contributions were never 50%. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government restored social transfers to their 1994-95 
level. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Total CHST cash and tax transfers will reach an all-time high of 
close to $31 billion in 2000 and 2001, and it will continue to 
grow.  This is up $900 million from the previous peak in 1995-96 
and up $1.8 billion since the government took office in 1993-94. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thanks to the solid performance of the Canadian economy, the 
other major transfer payments to the provinces also increased 
substantially.  Equalization payments to the less prosperous 
provinces are up $500 million this year from the forecasts in the 
1999 budget. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Total transfers will reach an estimated $39.4 billion this year 
and will continue to grow over the next four years.  The increase 
in total transfers means that provincial governments can 
strengthen social programs that are important to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does it mean for New Brunswick?  In 2000 and 2001, 
transfers to New Brunswick will exceed $1.7 billion, will account 
for about 37% of New Brunswick's estimated revenues and they are 
expected to total about $2,348 per person, about 78% above the 
national average. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the next five years, New Brunswick will receive over 
$9 billion in transfers.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>CRIMINAL CODE 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK269"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby—Douglas, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, on December 13 last year I rose in the House to ask a 
question of the Minister of Justice.  My question related to a 
young law student at the University of New Brunswick, Robbie 
Peterson. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Robbie Peterson was brutally attacked in the early hours of the 
morning the previous month on a downtown street at a major 
intersection.  He was attacked for one reason—because he was 
gay.  Similar gay bashings occur across this land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I called on the Minister of Justice to recognize that this is a 
serious problem and specifically to bring forward an amendment to 
the Criminal Code of Canada to outlaw hate propaganda which 
promotes violence and hatred based on sexual orientation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Justice recently tabled an omnibus bill in the 
House amending a number of statutes, including the criminal code, 
but unfortunately she did not include that important amendment to 
expand the sections of the criminal code on hate propaganda to 
include sexual orientation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the current provisions of the criminal code, those who 
incite hatred against any identifiable group where such 
incitement is likely to lead to a breach of the peace can be 
subject to criminal sanction.  Identifiable groups include those 
distinguished by colour, race, religion or ethnic origin. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That law has not changed since it was brought into force in 1966 
and the silence of the code on this important issue sends a very 
destructive message.  I believe that the silence of the code is 
unconstitutional. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 15 of the charter requires that the equal benefit of the 
law, including the criminal code provisions on hate propaganda, 
be extended to gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender persons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does it mean for the criminal code to be silent on this 
important issue?  It means, for example, when a hatemonger like 
the Reverend Fred Phelps wants to come to Canada to burn the 
Canadian flag and to promote hatred and violence directed at gay 
and lesbian people, the police in Ottawa cannot stop that man 
from crossing our border.  In fact, it was Sergeant Callaghan of 
the Ottawa Police Force who said and I quote “If this was done 
against a Catholic or a Jew or a black person, charges could be 
laid.  If we had that legislation, we would not have to put up 
with this nonsense on Monday.  We could have told him `If you 
show up and you start spreading this hate, we will arrest 
you'.”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I plead with the government to give our law enforcement officers 
in Canada the power to take that important action.  It is 
important because if we say it is all right to promote violence 
and hatred based on sexual orientation, that is a licence to the 
thugs in our country.  It is a license to the thugs who get 
involved in gay bashing.  It also sends out a negative message in 
terms of self-esteem for young gay, lesbian, bisexual and 
transgender people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to note that a gifted artist in Peterborough, Spencer 
Harrison, has pointed out that under the current provisions of 
the criminal code and the denial of equality, this leads to 
hatred and to violence.  He has put together a project called The 
Queer Project that documents the impact of this hatred. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call on the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice 
to do the right thing, to join with provincial and territorial 
attorneys general to listen to the premier of Ontario, the Leader 
of the New Democratic Party in Ontario, Howard Hampton, to amend 
the criminal code provisions on hate propaganda to include sexual 
orientation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK270"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Maloney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the government takes the issue of hate crimes and hate propaganda 
very seriously and has been working actively to address this 
issue.  There are a number of measures already in place at the 
federal and provincial levels to ensure that Canadians are 
protected from discrimination and crimes based on hate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995 the government enacted legislation in the form of Bill 
C-41 on sentencing reform which made it clear that hate 
motivation is an aggravating circumstance to be factored in at 
the time of sentencing.  Paragraph 718.2(a)(i) of the criminal 
code provides that evidence that an offence was motivated by 
hate, bias or prejudice based on race, national or ethnic origin, 
language, colour, religion, sex, age, mental or physical 
disability, sexual orientation or any other similar ground shall 
be considered an aggravating factor in the sentencing of an 
offender. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, if there is evidence that an assault, damage to 
property, threatening, harassment or any other criminal offence 
was motivated by hate, bias or prejudice, it is an aggravating 
factor for the purposes of sentencing and it should result in a 
more severe sanction. 
In addition, in 1996 the government brought forward legislation, 
Bill S-5, which resulted in amendments to the Canadian Human 
Rights Act and added sexual orientation as a prohibited grounds 
of discrimination.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. colleague will also be happy to know that as part of our 
ongoing discussions at the federal-provincial—territorial level, 
the minister and her colleagues have been discussing Canada's 
hate crime laws and recommendations to improve them.  Given the 
nature of the criminal law in this country with federal 
responsibility for the enactment of the law and provincial 
responsibility for the administration of the criminal justice 
system, there is a collaborative process in the development and 
implementation of criminal law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Federal-provincial-territorial ministers responsible for justice 
have approved for consideration, subject to an in-depth charter 
review, a number of recommendations which would further ensure 
that hate crimes are dealt with firmly.  Many have suggested an 
expansion of the criminal code definition of identifiable group 
used for purposes of the hate propaganda offence provisions to 
include sexual orientation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to remember, however, that changes to the 
criminal code are only a part of a much broader strategy which 
must be taken to combat hate motivated activities in this 
country.  This approach recognizes the importance of public 
awareness and education on the values of tolerance and respect 
which are fundamental to Canadian human rights and Canadian 
citizenship.

<P><A NAME="LINK272"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, on 
March 17 I posed two questions to the minister of agriculture and 
I am very pleased to see the parliamentary secretary to the 
minister in the House tonight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As usual, the two questions I posed were very valid questions. 
They were very succinct questions.  They were very simple 
questions.  I expected an answer from the minister of agriculture 
but as usual, there was a lot of doublespeak, there was a lot of 
beating around the bush and in fact no answers to those very 
simple questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first question was rather interesting because at that time 
there were a number of supporters who were in town supporting 
this particular party.  A number of people in that particular 
group of people wanted to reinstate what was known as the GRIP 
program, the gross revenue insurance program.  Lo and behold, 
when they went to this huge gathering, all of the people in that 
gathering supported the fact that the government should reinstate 
the GRIP program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For your information, Mr. Speaker, the GRIP program was a farm 
support program put into place prior to 1993 when this government 
took power and when it got into power in 1995 it in its short 
term mind decided to get rid of the GRIP program for in fact 
short term gain but for long term pain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we have a wonderful group of individuals who support the 
government saying unanimously, “Bring us back the GRIP 
program”.  So I asked the minister a very simple question: 
“Will you support that particular comment and resolution and 
will you in fact bring back the GRIP program”.  There was no 
answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From there I then went on to very simply say that if the 
minister does not want to support the GRIP, then let's identify 
and let's analyze the program that was put in its place and that 
is the AIDA program.  We recognize by the vote itself that AIDA 
was not being supported by the people who it was meant for, the 
farmers of western Canada.  So we looked at whether there were 
some advantages to this AIDA program over the GRIP and we looked 
at the administration costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lo and behold, the administration costs of the AIDA program to 
deliver some $500 million in 1998 came to a grand total of $35 
million, about seven times what the administration costs were to 
administer not only GRIP but the NISA.  NISA and GRIP were less 
than 2% of all of the program dollars delivered under those 
programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We now have here a program that the government's own supporters 
say is not good, that it is costing huge dollars that could be 
going to agriculture and to the farmers themselves and now going 
to bureaucrats to administer the program, so we ask ourselves, 
why would the minister of agriculture not want to answer those 
two simple questions.  Why not reinstitute GRIP, a program that 
is being accepted by all those who wish to have it back, and in 
fact the government could save money by putting the GRIP program 
back and not having to spend those exorbitant sums on bureaucrats 
in the department to administer and deliver the AIDA program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the parliamentary secretary if he can to perhaps 
just stick to the subject, not talk about previous deficits, not 
talk about previous policies or previous parties and governments, 
just stick to the questions and the issues that are before him 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why not reinstate GRIP and please talk to the administration 
costs of that program. 
<P><A NAME="LINK273"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe McGuire (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to 
thank the member for Brandon—Souris for his St. Patrick's Day 
question and for his interest in our policy convention.

previous election so I will not belabour him in that regard, but 
I am glad he is watching what we are doing in our policy 
conventions.  I hope his party adopts some of our programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada is willing to consider various options 
for farm safety nets.  The national safety nets advisory 
committee has been asked to look at a variety of proposals 
submitted to the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food over the 
past few months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few of these proposals share some similarities to the former 
GRIP program.  All of these proposals will be reviewed by the 
committee and will be measured against criteria the committee has 
established for an income disaster program.  The criteria it has 
established is split between essential and preferred criteria. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first element is that any new disaster program be whole 
farm, that is, applicable to all farm production.  As well, the 
committee is looking for proposals which will complement current 
safety net programs.  As safety net programs are cost shared with 
provincial governments, any new programs must also meet their key 
principle, which is that safety net programs are equitable, fair 
and generally available, and that these programs do not put 
producers at risk for trade actions or countervail threats.  All 
of the programs which have been submitted, including those based 
on the former GRIP program, will be measured against this 
criteria. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The national safety nets advisory committee will prepare a 
report for the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food after it has 
met with the organizations or individuals who submitted each 
proposal.
