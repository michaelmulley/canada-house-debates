</H3><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK3"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cannis (Scarborough Centre, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize the company whose headquarters have 
just relocated to my riding of Scarborough Centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearnet is a Canadian controlled and managed company which is 
on the leading edge of wireless communications.  In just three 
short years Clearnet has increased its employment by more than 
six times to well over 1,000 employees and is expected to create 
several thousand more jobs across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This company's success is an example of what our government 
hopes will be the future for all Canadians in the next 
millennium.  Our commitment to invest in knowledge based 
economies such as telecommunications will help success stories 
like Clearnet become the norm.  Keeping Canada and Canadians on 
the leading edge is our ultimate goal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only do I want to welcome Clearnet, but I congratulate it on 
its tremendous success which I hope will continue in the future.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CANADIAN WHEAT BOARD 
</H3><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK5"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
looks like the minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board 
has a death wish for the board.  How else can we explain his 
erratic behaviour?  Let us review the facts which go back several 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers are unhappy and want change so the minister hand picks a 
committee to make recommendations.  When he does not like the 
recommendations, he asks for direct consultation.  He asks people 
to write him.  He does not like that either. Then he holds a 
plebiscite but he does not ask the question that captures the 
debate in the farming community.  Then he introduces Bill C-72, a 
bill that nobody likes.  It dies on the Order Paper.  Then the 
phoenix that rises from the ashes is even worse.  In the new 
bill, Bill C-4, he has made provisions to include commodities 
such as canola, oats and flax that are not presently under the 
jurisdiction of the board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just when you think it cannot get any worse, it does. If there 
is anything that is going to cause the Canadian Wheat Board to 
die, it is a minister who has shown how little he understands 
about what farmers want.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>TERRY FOX RUN 
</H3><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK7"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, once 
again this year Canadians and people around the world took part 
in Terry Fox runs to support cancer research.  In Peterborough 
riding, runs in Havelock, Lakefield and Peterborough itself 
raised thousands of dollars.  So once again did inmates of the 
Warkworth Institution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But this year as last, our high schools deserve special mention. 
Nine schools, among them St. Peters, Crestwood, PCVS, Lakefield, 
Norwood and Bethany Hills raised more than $130,000 and beat last 
year's record of $118,000. St. Peter's alone raised $40,000. 
Crestwood is the leading high school in Canada for Terry Fox 
contributions during the last decade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Terry passed through Peterborough city and county 17 years 
ago, he could not have imagined the outpouring of good he was 
triggering.  Our thanks to all those who take part in Terry Fox 
runs around the world.

General-Tower of Cambridge, a leading North American manufacturer 
of vinyl car interiors and other vinyl products, today received 
the Environmental Management Award from the <I>Financial Post</I>. 
CGT's environmental management plan impacts on every decision 
that is made from the top of the company through to the plant 
floor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A founding sponsor of the Ontario Children's Groundwater 
Festival, Canadian General-Tower is a company with vision, a 
company with pride in its home community of Cambridge and above 
all a company always ready to face challenges and to lead by 
example.  I congratulate CGT on this and its many other 
achievements.  I also welcome Mr. Gord Chaplin to the House 
today.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CHILD LABOUR 
</H3><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK11"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, a meeting is 
being held this week in Oslo, where ministers, and leaders of 
labour organizations and NGOs are discussing the serious problem of 
child labour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Representatives of more than 40 countries will be trying to 
find solutions to the most serious forms of child labour: slavery, 
prostitution and unsafe work.  The Bloc Quebecois salutes and fully 
supports this endeavour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois is aware that forced child labour is 
primarily the consequence of poverty and underdevelopment. 
The drastic cuts to government aid to development imposed by the 
Liberal government are not likely to lead to any improvement in 
this situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We call upon the government to act promptly to follow up on 
the report by the Committee on Foreign Affairs and International 
Trade on the exploitation of child labour and to conclude 
development pacts to eliminate what we consider a blot on the 
record of humanity.

I am proud today to rise and advise you of a special occasion 
which occurred on October 25 and October 26 in New Hamburg, 
Ontario.  The New Hamburg Branch 532 of the Royal Canadian Legion 
celebrated its 45th anniversary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The members of this branch are widely recognized for the many 
hours of community service which they perform each year. In 
particular their support of minor sports programs is truly 
exemplary of the important role they play in the development of 
the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of all constituents of Waterloo—Wellington I wish to 
commend the New Hamburg Royal Canadian Legion on its record of 
public service.  In particular the 10 continuous and charter 
members from 1952 to 1997 should be acknowledged for their 
dedication.

that GST rash is still burning butts across the country. Now the 
Prime Minister has adopted that diaper rashed baby as his own and 
Uncle Brian is smiling.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mauril Bélanger (Ottawa—Vanier, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
October is IDD month.  IDD stands for iodine deficiency disorder, 
which is the single greatest cause of preventable brain damage 
and mental disability in the world today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More than 1.5 billion people, including approximately 500 
million children, in more than 115 countries are estimated to be 
at risk of having IDD. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To prevent IDD a person needs just one teaspoon of iodine over a 
lifetime.  Every 5¢ raised will save a life by providing one 
person iodine in their diet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Kiwanis International has taken on the challenge of eliminating 
iodine deficiency disorder by the year 2000.  As an honorary 
member of the Ottawa-Vanier Kiwanis Club, I am proud to be a part 
of this effort.

</H3><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK19"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, scientific 
analyses that have been unearthed by Greenpeace indicate that PVC 
plastic items manufactured for use by children contain dangerous 
concentrations of two toxic metals: lead and cadmium.   The list of 
such products that can be bought in Quebec and in Canada speaks 
volumes: toys, rain wear, backpacks, and video game cable 
coverings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lead poisoning is widely recognized as one of the most serious 
threats to children's health. 
Exposure to even extremely low doses causes permanent nervous 
system damage and decreased intelligence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this context, how can this government explain that, this 
very morning, thousands of children went to school carrying toxic 
backpacks?  It is unacceptable for there to be only voluntary 
measures in this area.  The government must take its head out of 
the sand and concern itself with children's health, not only 
through the anti-tobacco legislation but also through legislation 
to protect them from products containing toxic metals.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In the red book, on page 34, we read that “a new Liberal government 
will create a Trade Promotion Agency that builds on the Team Canada 
approach to international business”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To follow up on this commitment, the Minister of International 
Trade announced a few days ago a series of new measures to better 
co-ordinate trade promotion initiatives by Canadian businesses 
already on the export market or looking to be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the umbrella of Team Canada Inc., all public and private 
stakeholders interested in exports will form an on-going network, we

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Eastern Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, recently Canadians have been treated to the spectacle of 
two Atlantic Liberal premiers opposing federal Liberal policies 
they once supported when they were members of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When he was a member of this House, the premier of Nova Scotia 
supported the HST.  Now that he sees that the HST does not work, 
he comes to Ottawa with hat in hand asking the finance minister 
to reduce the HST premiums. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When he was federal Minister of Fisheries and Oceans the premier 
of Newfoundland allowed the department's policy to destroy the 
livelihood of Newfoundland fishers.  Now that he sees how wrong 
he was, the premier wants the Standing Committee on Fisheries and 
Oceans to go to Newfoundland to re-examine the early cutoff of 
the Atlantic groundfish strategy that would devastate fishers in 
his province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given this double flip flop, Canadians now wonder if the present 
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans or the Minister of Finance ever 
became the premier of a province whether they would oppose their 
own policies because they do not work.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today on the concerns Canadians have about our food 
inspections. Consumers need to be assured that the food they eat 
is as safe as it can be.  There are a number of reasons for this 
cause of concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the creation of the Canada Food Inspection Agency, the 
government has estimated that it will save $100 million over the 
next few years, hopefully not at the expense of the consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recent reports have suggested that food imports arriving at 
Canada's borders are not being inspected thoroughly enough.  The 
November 1996 auditor general's report stated that the level of 
inspection activity aimed at different food products may not be 
consistent with their potential risk to human health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time for the federal government to recognize that there 
are improvements which should be made to our food inspection. The 
questions that have been raised about our food inspection system 
deserve to be examined by a parliamentary committee.  The CFIA 
must take a stronger federal role in the area of food safety.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Kyoto deal reminds Canadians a lot of the failed Meech Lake

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>PROGRAM FOR OLDER WORKER ADJUSTMENT

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
next Saturday the BC mine in Black Lake will close down, leaving 
300 workers without jobs.  More than a third of these workers are 
aged 55 and over and their chances of finding other work are 
extremely slim, given the high unemployment rate in the region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An application under the Program for Older Worker Adjustment, 
or POWA, was filed on March 17, 1996, while the government did not 
terminate the program until March 31, 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the active measures the Minister of Human Resources 
Development is so proud of do not apply in this case, does the 
minister intend to reactivate the application—

<P><A NAME="LINK49"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not agree with the assumption 
by the Leader of the Bloc Quebecois that active measures do not 
apply in this case.  I do not think that we should underestimate 
workers who, over the years, have acquired experience and skills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not underestimate these workers.  On the contrary, I 
think they are still capable of re-entering the job market, and our 
government has made a perfectly generous and flexible offer with 
respect to certain active measures to help them in the coming 
weeks. 
<P><A NAME="LINK50"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it is not a question of underestimating these workers.  I met with 
them.  I, for one, took the trouble to meet with them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But I remember when the Liberal Party was in opposition and 
kept on tabling petitions to extend the POWA program.  The Minister 
of Human Resources Development should remember that.  He should ask 
the member for Saint-Léonard to fill him in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why will the Minister of Human Resources Development not agree 
to the offer made by Minister Harel in a letter dated October 6 in 
which she asks that the POWA program be extended? 
<P><A NAME="LINK51"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the POWA application was withdrawn 
at the express request of the workers' union, which felt that the 
program's benefits were not sufficiently generous later on.  Let us 
be reasonable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the contrary, what has been proposed until now is an 
improved POWA program.  One of the reasons the program was 
terminated was that it was very often unfair and inequitable, 
particularly because it applies only to workers over the age of 55. 
In the present case, the average age of workers is under 55 and the 
program would therefore not even apply to most of the workers we 
are talking about.

these people. We put together a $2.5 million package of active measures

country, even though older workers generally fare better than the 
younger ones who want to join the labour force.

will be fairer than POWA. Under that program, a seamstress losing her 
job was not entitled to any protection, unless she lost her job as a 
result of a mass layoff. POWA was too restrictive.

the finance minister acknowledged that women are forced to depend 
disproportionately on benefits they receive from the Canada 
pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know the CPP changes will affect survivors benefits, death 
benefits and reduce benefits overall by 10%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the minister acknowledge that the cuts to CPP benefits 
disproportionately affect women?  Does the government really 
believe it is legitimate to penalize women for the fact they live 
longer than men? 
<P><A NAME="LINK58"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, precisely because women depend on the public pension 
plans more than do men it is important that we guarantee not only 
their survival but their success. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of that this government along with the provinces put in 
place a series of measures which will guarantee to Canadians 
young and old, both men and women, that the public sector pension

conducted a gender impact analysis on the CPP changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that I have seen the study I can understand why the

advertisers have quite a new friend in our health minister as he 
allows tobacco ads to be put on racing cars again.  He does not 
think it is a very big deal.  Let me read what one of the tobacco 
advertisers had to say.  “This Formula One car is the most 
powerful advertising space in the world.  It will carry your 
brand to 1.8 billion TV viewers in 102 countries”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the health minister has publicly admitted that he knows 
this decision is not right, why has he caved in to the tobacco 
companies? 
<P><A NAME="LINK68"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I hope the hon. member knows better than to swallow the ad copy 
of advertisers.  Let us instead look at the facts of the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government committed last April to amend the Tobacco Act in 
order to permit Formula One racing to happen in Canada.  As the 
hon. member knows, this is a government that respects its 
commitments. We are going to respect it.  We are going to 
introduce an amendment in the House of Commons to change the 
Tobacco Act to that effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me also point out that Formula One races last 90 minutes 
more or less.  The Tobacco Act works 365 days a year to 
discourage smoking in this country. 
<P><A NAME="LINK69"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the letter 
they sent in April was a stupid idea then and it is a stupid idea 
now.  The minister actually admitted in public that he is 
uncomfortable with this decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting that the health ministers of England, Germany 
and France were also uncomfortable with race car ads.  What did 
they do?  They stopped them and their Grand Prix races are just 
fine today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did the minister cave in to tobacco companies so that the 
health of our youth is affected? 
<P><A NAME="LINK70"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
we are respecting a commitment.  The health of our youth, when it 
comes to smoking, will be protected by the $100 million the 
government is going to spend over the next five years on a 
tobacco reduction strategy.  That is the way to get kids to stop 
smoking.  That is the way to prevent young people from starting. 
That is the effective measure the government is going to take.

favour of the director and the biker gang members were

not in allowing in two, ten or a dozen Hell's Angels.  That is not

my question is for the minister of fisheries.  As the minister

communities wonder whether their livelihoods will survive another 
season of U.S. greed and violations of the treaty and MOU.

impasse this summer which is left over from the Mulroney 
negotiated treaty of 1985. We certainly think he has outlined a 
situation, an historical build-up and the issues of equity and 
conservation effectively. Shortly after I took office I indicated 
my support for Mr. Fortier's work and I still have full

rise today on a question of privilege to bring to your attention 
an issue which I think compromises the rights and privileges of 
all members of this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I speak in particular of a news release dated Thursday, October 
23 brought to my attention last night in which the Government of 
Canada announced that provincial and federal governments had 
constituted a nominating committee to nominate candidates for the 
new Canada pension plan investment board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This nominating committee consists of 10 members and will be 
responsible for drawing up a list of recommended candidates for 
the new CPP investment board proposed by Bill C-2 presently 
before this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From this list the federal Minister of Finance will select 12 
directors, including a chairperson for this board.  This is what 
the finance minister is quoted in his release as having said, 
that “the nominating committee will play a key role in selecting 
the CPP investment board”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The press release ends by saying that the nominating committee 
is expected to submit its list of recommended candidates to the 
federal finance minister and the finance ministers of the 
participating provinces before the end of this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The nominating committee I have just described is provided for 
under clause 10(2) of Bill C-2 which reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister may establish a committee to advise the minister on 
the appointment of directors.  The committee shall consist of a

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On March 9, 1990 Speaker John Fraser ruled on a question of 
privilege brought by the member for Kamloops in which a pamphlet 
regarding the GST was disseminated by the government prior to the 
passage of the GST legislation. Speaker Fraser ruled it not to be 
a question of privilege but only because the pamphlet stated 
within it that the legislation was before the House and that the 
information in the pamphlet was only a proposal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second precedent also concerns the goods and services tax. 
The member for Cape Breton—East Richmond brought a point of 
privilege on March 16, 1991 on exactly the same point. Speaker 
Fraser once again ruled on March 25, 1991 that it did not 
constitute a point of privilege, on the grounds that the 
newsletter indicated that the information it contained were 
proposals only. Specifically he decided that the minister had not 
acted as if the House had already passed the budget measure 
approving the GST and that the advertising did not prejudice a 
future decision of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The situation before us is similar but much, much more serious. 
Obviously the Minister of Finance has already designated a 
committee defined under clause 10 of the bill. He clearly expects 
the committee to meet, to incur expenses and to make important 
decisions that will obligate the Government of Canada in various 
ways, in other words to perform a function that is essential to 
the thrust of Bill C-2. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question of privilege arises in that the bill only went to 
the Standing Committee on Finance for consideration on second 
reading yesterday.  Members of the committee may want to alter 
clause 10 of the bill and the government is proceeding as if 
Parliament has already given the minister authority to act under 
that section when it clearly has not done so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government is allowed by the House to proceed to enact a 
bill that has not been passed by the House, a dangerous precedent 
will have been set, a precedent that undercuts the authority of 
Parliament and derogates from the rights and privileges of every 
member to have input into legislation prior to its enactment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again the action considered today is a matter of privilege 
for the reasons I have already stated.  The minister has actually 
designated a committee under an act yet to be passed or even 
considered in the standing committee, and the nominating 
committee has already been given a deadline to submit names as 
the bill directs if it were to be passed in its present form. 
Since the bill only went to committee yesterday, this matter is 
very timely and is very time sensitive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I would urge you to give this matter careful 
consideration so that the rights and privileges of all members of 
Parliament and ultimately the rights and privileges of all 
citizens of Canada will be protected and preserved and that the 
proper constituted authority is followed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK142"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, there are a number of things 
that the Chair may want to consider before it rules as to whether 
or not this a prima facie question of privilege. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First the member referred to proposed Bill C-2 and that 
recommendations would be made by the minister.  In other words, 
in both instances where the hon. member across the way made such 
references, he made references to things that were not 
definitive, namely a proposal and a recommendation as opposed to 
a specific action of appointment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, when referring to the March 9, 1990 decision, the hon. 
member recognized that the action at that time did not constitute 
a question of privilege. Again in 1991 the advertising at that 
time was not deemed to be a question of privilege because, 
according to the hon. member and I agree with him, it did not 
jeopardize the passage of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One would have to be pretty hard pressed today in the House of 
Commons to arrive at the judgment that the House would be 
influenced to pass or not pass the bill, as to whether or not a 
proposal has been made or recommended to have people to sit on an 
advisory committee to recommend others to sit on a future 
committee to be put in place after the passage of the bill.  As 
such, it would be overstating the facts considerably. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one is saying that the government in that advertisement will 
put this bill in place or put in place the eventual board of 
directors whether the bill is passed or not.  That is not claimed 
at all by the government. As a matter of fact, I say to the 
people across the way that this is an advisory committee to 
recommend people to sit on a future committee.  Of course the 
future committee would only exist with the passage of the bill.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously if the bill does not pass there is no need to have the 
permanent committee in place.  Nor do I think the government 
would ever consider putting such a permanent committee in place 
if that were the case.  It is an advisory committee to select 
members to sit on the future permanent committee which is not yet 
in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One has to hold the following proposition before Canadians and 
before Your Honour this afternoon.  The bill if passed, and I 
would like to say when passed, will come into force next January 
1.  If it does not pass, it will cost Canadian taxpayers the sum 
of $400 million if there is a delay of one year. Therefore the 
government has to be ready with all the proper recommendations 
just prior to the January 1 tentative implementation date. The 
implementation date will only be firm once the bill is finally 
passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once the bill is passed, the government would only be prudent to 
take the necessary lead time to make the necessary preparation in 
order to then have at that time the final nomination of the 
people for the permanent committee.  It is the prudent thing to 
do.  It is one that saves taxpayers dollars which is essential 
not only in the eyes of the federal government but in the eyes of 
the eight provinces that have signed on to the agreement and even 
in the eyes of the other two that have also said they want to 
place people on the board of directors should it come into place 
once the bill is adopted.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Colleagues, as I mentioned the last 
time, I want to have a look at any question of privilege that 
impinges on members of the House.  The hon. member for Fraser 
Valley quoted from a document which I have not seen.  I would ask 
him to please leave me the document so I can read it.  I want to 
have a look at this thing and I want to reserve judgment on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the House will grant me, I will return to the House if and 
when it is necessary, but I want to have a look at the document 
before I make a ruling.

</I></B></P><P align=left>You will recall, Mr. Speaker, that since the opening of 
Parliament, the House leaders of the various political parties 
have taken steps to ensure that processes—for instance, the size 
and the number of standing committees—be adjusted to ensure that 
the work of parliamentarians is supported by a fair and 
reasonable system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have also taken measures, in co-operation with the Speaker, 
to ensure that a system is in place to have a question period 
that was functional, given the five political parties presently 
in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have adjusted budgets for research offices and support 
services for members of Parliament, reflecting the same kind of 
change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This leads me to believe that those who predicted that this 
would be a form of pizza Parliament, with members of Parliament 
unable to co-operate with each other, were wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have different points of views in the House of Commons.  We 
will disagree with one another on various issues of substance, 
but we were all sent here to represent our constituents.  The 
members of the five parties were sent here by Canadians not to 
make this Parliament dysfunctional.  We were all sent here to 
make Parliament work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to congratulate the House leaders of all parties for 
their work in that respect thus far.  I also congratulate the 
Speaker for his excellent work and for his guidance from time to 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed changes to the Board of Internal Economy will 
essentially do the following.  They will create a situation 
whereby five members of the government will sit on the Board of 
Internal Economy: two ministers and three members.  The Leader of 
the Opposition, or his delegate, will be represented on the 
board.  In addition, a member of the official opposition caucus 
will be on the board and also a member from all other parties, 
duly recognized, in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also a formula in the new bill by which such amendments 
will not be necessary in the future, were there to be more 
changes in the numbers of of parties sitting in the House of 
Commons, either after the next election or in the event that a 
party ceases to be a political party within this Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These changes have been made with the support of all the parties 
involved.  I want to reiterate my appreciation for the support 
and co-operation of everyone. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Negotiations of this type are never easy. Still, it is important to 
note that all political parties, regardless of their ideology, agree 
that we must work together to ensure the proper operation of this 
Parliament and to provide the best possible government to Canadians, who 
sent us here to represent them during this 36th Parliament.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is a pleasure to speak to Bill C-13 which amends the 
Parliament of Canada Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This amendment provides for members of the Progressive 
Conservative Party and the New Democratic Party to be 
full-fledged members of the Board of Internal Economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe in any organization in our democracy, matters which 
affect employees or members of any organization should work by 
way of input from those members.  I do not believe that the House 
of Commons should take a different approach than that which is 
taken by any other organization in our country.  In fact, we 
should set the trend and the style for those kinds of things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The act did not previously provide for membership on the board 
for those two parties and this amendment corrects that situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we may differ in the House from time to time on many 
issues, I do not believe that the Board of Internal Economy is a 
place in which differences occur by way of motions.  I believe it 
is a consensus organization.  In fact, it is a management 
organization that keeps the members' interests at heart and, in 
particular, keeps the members' interests, on an ongoing basis, 
regardless of party politics.  Presumably it is non-partisan.

</I></B></P><P align=left>New members should be reminded that the Board of Internal 
Economy operates on a consensus basis.  Therefore, with the new 
membership and the more people we have on the board, it is 
imperative to keep the consensus building ideal and not get into 
motions and partisan issues.  We should manage the way any good 
organization should manage.  Hopefully that is what this 
amendment to the bill does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We wholeheartedly agree that these two parties be active members

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
address Bill C-13, an act to amend the Parliament of Canada Act, on 
behalf of the Bloc Quebecois. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is definitely appropriate and timely for Parliament to amend the 
Parliament of Canada Act, so as to reflect what happened on June 2, when 
Canadians and Quebeckers elected 301 representatives from five different 
political parties to the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This reality was not recognized in the former act, or in the 
current Parliament of Canada Act, until the tabling of this amendment, 
whereby the Board of Internal Economy, which is basically the 
administrative body for the House of Commons, now recognizes two new 
official political parties in the House, namely the New Democratic Party 
and the Progressive Conservative Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we would have liked the amendment to also recognize that 
Canadians and Quebeckers elected to this House not only members from 
five different political parties, but a specific number of MPs from each 
of these parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that if there is one conclusion we can draw from the June 
2 election, it is that it has shown how fragmented Canada really is, 
with five parties, basically representing the five regions of Canada, 
being elected to this place. The Liberal Party, of course, is primarily 
concentrated in Ontario; the Bloc Quebecois, as we know, is primarily—in 
fact exclusively—concentrated in Quebec; the Reform Party has its 
stronghold in western Canada, except for a few small pockets of 
resistance from other political parties, and the maritimes are divided 
between the Progressive Conservative Party and the New Democratic Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That having been said, the point I was making is that there is, in 
this House, a certain level of party representation that we would have 
liked to have seen reflected in every body of this House. 
We have fought to have the Bloc Quebecois adequately represented on the 
House of Commons Board of Internal Economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must recognize however that, while the bill before us today, to 
amend the Parliament of Canada Act, recognizes the fact that five 
parties are represented in the House of Commons, it does not recognize 
the level of representation of each party in this House for the Board of 
Internal Economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give an example. In the June 2 election, the Bloc Quebecois 
won 44 seats, or approximately 14.7% of the seats in this House. Under 
the formula proposed by the government, the Bloc Quebecois ends up a 
level of representation of 9% on the Board of Internal Economy, which is 
less than its level of representation in this House. 
Compared to the representation of all other parties, the Bloc Quebecois 
is the only one to be penalized in any significant way by the 
distribution of the seats on the Board of Internal Economy.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. government House leader was right in pointing out that the 
negotiations between the various political parties were long, 
painstaking and difficult, but also fruitful. He is right in saying that 
they were fruitful, because we in the Bloc Quebecois wanted to show our 
good faith in allowing this Parliament to function properly. We 
especially wanted to allow the two political parties that have made a 
new beginning in this House, in this 36th Parliament, to sit on the 
Board of Internal Economy, as provided for in the bill under 
consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, as I pointed out, the Bloc Quebecois is being penalized to 
some extent because we gave the Bloc Quebecois, the Progressive 
Conservative Party and the New Democratic Party the same representation 
on the Board of Internal Economy, that is to say, one representative. 
This means that the Bloc Quebecois, which has a few more elected members 
than the Conservative Party and the New Democratic Party combined, now 
has one less member on the Board of Internal Economy than the 
Conservative Party and the New Democratic Party combined. It is evident 
then that the principle of proportional representation is not being 
respected at that level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would say—I see my colleague, the chief government whip, 
nodding to me, and he agrees with me on this—that the negotiations 
were difficult but also, as I said, fruitful. These negotiations on 
proportional representation have been held in just about every area 
since we arrived here on June 2. 
Of course, on the Board of Internal Economy—and we can see the result 
today—but also in the case of the Parliamentary Internship Program, the 
Bloc Quebecois is penalized again by the formula that the various 
political parties in this House have chosen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for House committees, proportional representation was of course 
recognized for each committee, but when you take all the committees 
together, the Bloc Quebecois has exactly the same number of members as 
the New Democratic Party and the Conservative Party. Following these 
negotiations which were, I repeat, difficult but fruitful, this 
principle of proportional representation was finally recognized when the 
Bloc Quebecois was allowed two more representatives, one on the foreign 
affairs and international trade committee and another on the human 
resources development committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the same problem still crops up, also in connection with the 
composition of the parliamentary delegations.  With all of the good 
faith that has led us to a consensus on Bill C-13, I am calling 
upon the good will of all of the colleagues in this House so that, 
in all of the bodies of the House of Commons, we will acknowledge 
the will of the people of Canada and of Quebec that was manifested 
in the composition of this House, which gives Bloc Quebecois 
members 14.7% of the representation in this House.  We would like 
to see that proportion respected as far as possible in all bodies 
of this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That having been said, to pick up on the words of the hon. 
leader of the government in the House, it was our desire, along 
with all the political formations present, to ensure that, to 
demonstrate that this Parliament can function properly, doing 
things well regardless of the differences of opinion which separate 
us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But, as the House leader of the Reform Party has also said, 
the Board of Internal Economy is a body which operates on a 
consensual basis.  In other words, the partisan aspect, the 
confrontational aspect, does not exist within the Board of Internal 
Economy and this, I believe, has fostered the desire of all 
political formations to move ahead with this amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last of all, and the point on which I shall conclude since it 
appears that the wish is to move through all of the business of the 
House quickly today, on Bill C-13, and the amendments in which my 
colleagues and I had a hand, is that I wish to make a 
clarification. 
The government was rather understanding when it agreed to not increase 
its representation on the Board of Internal Economy and it deserves 
praise for doing so.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Still, Bill C-13 includes an amendment allowing the government to 
include a member of the Privy Council on the Board of Internal Economy, 
which was not the case before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 52 of the current Parliament of Canada Act reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>52. (2) In the event of the death, disability or absence of the 
Speaker, five members of the Board, of whom one shall be the Deputy 
Speaker or a member of the Board designated by the Speaker or the 
Deputy Speaker to chair the meeting, constitute a quorum. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>No reference is made to a member of the Privy Council. Until 
now, it was of course the government's prerogative to decide 
whether of not to send a member of the Privy Council. However, 
the proposed amendment expressly provides for the presence of 
such a member in the above-mentioned situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment reads: “In the event of the death, disability or 
absence of the Speaker, five members of the Board, of whom one shall be 
a member of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada appointed under 
subsection 50(2), constitute a quorum. The members present shall 
designate a member from among themselves to chair the meeting”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a change to include something which, until now, was not 
expressly provided for in the Parliament of Canada Act. The amendment 
formally includes a member of the Queen's Privy Council on the committee 
made up of five members of the Board of Internal Economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude by thanking all those who took part in the 
negotiations leading up to today's consensus. We are pleased to be a 
part of this consensus, in spite of everything I pointed out.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I too rise in support of Bill C-13, an act to amend the 
Parliament of Canada Act to permit New Democrats and Progressive 
Conservative representatives to sit on the Board of Internal 
Economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment of this piece of legislation is in keeping with 
the spirit of parliamentary reform that brought the Board of 
Internal Economy as we know it into existence.  I refer to the 
reforms of the House of Commons which followed from the special 
committee on the reform of the House of Commons, chaired by the 
Hon. Jim McGrath in 1985-86. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fewer and fewer of us will recall that prior to that time the 
Board of Internal Economy was run entirely by the government. 
Cabinet ministers and government backbenchers sat on the Board of 
Internal Economy.  There was no opposition representation on the 
board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This had dubious advantages in the sense that opposition members 
never had to take any responsibility for the management of the 
House of Commons or for the decisions taken in that context.  It 
was the feeling of the special committee on the reform of the 
House of Commons that the House, like other parliaments in the 
democratic world, should involve the opposition in the management 
of its affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A recommendation was made in the report of the special 
committee, sometimes known as the McGrath report, which led to 
legislation that permitted members of the opposition to sit 
on the Board of Internal Economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As with many things we tend to be creatures of our own time and 
context.  The legislation drawn up at that time assumed a three 
party House for ever and ever.  The legislation was drawn up to 
reflect that reality, which turned out to be a contingent and 
temporary reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We found ourselves in this Parliament with five recognized 
parties and a piece of legislation that did not permit the spirit 
of reform to be lived up to unless there was an amendment such as 
the one we now have before us.  Once passed it will enable all 
five parties to be represented on the Board of Internal Economy, 
the spirit of the McGrath report to be respected in its entirety.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very glad, as the last surviving member of the McGrath 
committee in this House, to see that this report is still alive 
and well, in some respects anyway, and that the Parliament of 
Canada Act is being amended accordingly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To a couple of things that were said by my colleague from the 
Bloc Quebecois I would want to take issue with at least one thing 
he said when he spoke about the regionalization of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know he was not intentionally oversimplifying but I want to 
remind him that there are New Democrats from the west.  It is not 
only Reformers in the west.  In my home province of Manitoba NDP 
members outnumber Reform members four to two. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I notice the obsession with proportionality.  Agreed that the 
Bloc has put aside this attachment to proportionality just as the 
government had to put aside its initial position in respect of 
the Board of Internal Economy in order for us to come to a 
workable solution on this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend the Bloc for that but I ask the member to reflect on 
the fact that the position of the Bloc and of Quebec in general 
is not always one of strict proportionality when it comes to 
other matters having to do with the Constitution, having to do 
with amending formulas, having to do with the percentage of 
Quebec seats in Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In many other debating contexts it is not the traditional 
position of Quebec that proportionality is the first principle 
that needs to be held up.  Perhaps that is why, in the final 
analysis, the Bloc was willing to make the compromise that it 
did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometimes groups or provinces or institutions are entitled to 
representation by virtue of their status as opposed to their 
numbers.  What we are representing here today is that all 
political parties need to be on the Board of Internal Economy. 
That fact has been recognized and I welcome this development.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I rise to lend the voice of the Progressive 
Conservative Party to supporting Bill C-13 as well.  I will be 
brief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to thank the government House leader as well as all the 
House leaders present for their participation and co-operation 
with respect to this agreement.  I think it does show an 
important sign to this House and to the Canadian people that 
there is a spirit of solidarity and co-operation that can help to 
facilitate bills such as this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is important particularly when there is a breakdown 
in the House as we experience here where there are five parties 
for the first time in Canadian history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also extremely important democratically to have 
representation on behalf of the Progressive Conservative Party as 
well as my friend in the New Democratic Party to participate in 
the important decisions that are made at the board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill continues with a floor level of 12 members of a party 
that gains access to the board.  I believe that the House, at 
some point in the future, should take a look at this number after 
an election because it may help to avoid some unpleasantness that 
arose in the last Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing particularly significant about 12 other than 
the fact that this happened to accommodate the political 
situation decades ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill will also make amendments to provide for the operation 
of the board in the event of the demise or the disability of the 
Speaker and to ensure that a minister of the crown is included in 
the quorum of the board if it should have to select a new 
chairperson. Obviously we hope and pray this will never occur. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will also acknowledge, as did my friend in the NDP, the spirit 
of co-operation and the concession that was made by the Bloc.  We 
appreciate that.  With respect to the proportionality, there was 
a concession made and we do acknowledge that.

<P><A NAME="LINK191"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Chairman, further 
to my earlier intervention regarding clause 2, and for the benefit 
of members of the House and all those now listening to the debate, 
I would like to ask the minister a question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In view of the information provided by the House leader of the 
Conservative Party, can he explain to us the addition to section 52 
of the existing Parliament of Canada Act of the words “a member of 
the Queen's Privy Council for Canada”, in the event of the death, 
disability or absence of the Speaker, for the purpose of appointing 
a new Speaker? 
<P><A NAME="LINK192"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Chairman, the explanation is a rather simple 
one.  As you know, the amendment to the bill means that there will 
henceforth be an equal number of government and opposition members 
on the Board of Internal Economy, which is of course chaired by the 
Speaker of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the event of a death, and we all wish the Speaker a long 
life, but in the event of a death in another Parliament, perhaps, 
it must be pointed out that the following situation could arise: 
there could be a quorum on the Board of Internal Economy consisting 
entirely of opposition members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron:</B> Which is highly unlikely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  I know it is highly unlikely, as my 
colleague opposite quite rightly points out, and we all wish the 
Speaker of the House the best of health, making it even more 
unlikely. A situation could nonetheless arise in which there could 
be a quorum consisting entirely of opposition members on the House 
of Commons Board of Internal Economy.  The addition of this clause 
means that there would be at least one government member, in this 
case a minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is merely in order to ensure that there could not be a 
quorum composed entirely of opposition members.  That is the 
purpose.  Naturally, with the Speaker in the Chair, the situation 
does not arise, but should there be no Speaker, it is still 
technically possible to have a quorum without government members. 
The amendment in question is designed to ensure that such a 
situation, however unlikely, cannot arise. 
<P><A NAME="LINK193"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu, BQ):</B> Mr. Chairman, what the 
minister is saying surprises me. He is saying that of course this will 
not happen, because the Speaker is there. Are you assuming that the 
Speaker is partisan? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B> No, Mr. Chairman, the situation is this: the 
Speaker is not partisan. Of course no one wants to imply that. The fact 
is that with the new board, the quorum is six, that is half of the 
members plus one. Therefore, since there are only five members from the 
opposition, this will mean the five members from the opposition plus a 
sixth member, who must be a government member or the Speaker.

<A HREF="#LINKT23"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>So the fact is that they are not all members from the opposition, 
since the Speaker, as the member from Richelieu pointed out, is at least 
neutral by definition. So he is not partisan in favour of the 
opposition.

<P><A NAME="LINK194"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Chairman, I want to pose the question again to the government 
House leader that is this not covered by the fact that the Deputy 
Speaker could fill that role. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This seems to be the omission with respect to this.  The Deputy 
Speaker would automatically assume the position of the chairman. 
I have never seen a situation where there Deputy Speaker would be 
anyone other than a government member. This seems to be an 
automatic ascension to the chairperson's position. This would 
prevent any concern on the part of the government side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Mr. Chairman, there was a certain 
gleefulness in the chair, I seem to detect, when the hon. member 
was making that statement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No, that is not the case because the bill in question removes 
the reference to that effect.  From here on in it will be a 
number of members of the governing party and opposition party, 
plus the Speaker.  There is no longer a reference to the Deputy 
Speaker from here on in. That is why that is necessary because 
the deputy speakership will no longer be referred to in the act 
once we pass this amendment. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK195"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Chairman, on the same 
question, would it not have been wiser to provide that in such a 
situation, the Deputy Speaker would automatically take charge of the 
Board of Internal Economy to ensure that its operations can continue, 
instead of requiring that a member of the Queen's Privy Council be 
present, because it is clearly specified that it must be a minister and 
not simply a government member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the question following my colleague, the House leader of the 
Conservative Party. Would it not have been better to include in the 
proposed amendment on those present in such a situation that we do not 
want the Deputy Speaker to take over the duties of the Speaker until a 
new Speaker has been appointed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B> Mr. Chairman, this issue of the Speaker and of 
the number of members from the government and from the opposition has 
been dealt with in lengthy negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without going into the details, because these are negotiations 
between the House leaders, this was in fact an issue in the 
negotiations, where it was finally agreed that there would be five 
members from the government, two members from the official opposition, 
in this case the Leader of the Opposition, who can of course be its 
representative, plus another member, and a representative from each 
other political party. That was one of the issues in the negotiations 
and it was in fact the last issue that was resolved, so that today we 
have this agreement.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>MACKENZIE VALLEY RESOURCE MANAGEMENT ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK197">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from October 28 consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-6, an act to provide for an integrated system of land 
and water management in the Mackenzie Valley, to establish 
certain boards for that purpose and to make consequential 
amendments to other acts, be read the second time and referred to 
a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK198"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo—Cowichan, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is with pride and pleasure that I rise in the House today to give 
my first speech in the Chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By way of my opening remarks, I thank the voters of 
Nanaimo—Cowichan for allowing me the privilege to serve as their 
member of Parliament.  It is an honour for me to be able to 
represent the views of my constituents in Parliament, and I will 
do so to the very best of my ability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In debating Bill C-6, which is before the House today, I feel it 
is necessary to discuss the background of the legislation.  In 
this regard, Bill C-6, the Mackenzie Valley Land and Water 
Management Act, is the reincarnation of Bill C-80 which was 
tabled in the last parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As with Bill C-80, the bill provides for the establishment of 
management boards to co-ordinate environmental assessment as well 
as land and water regulations in the Mackenzie Valley of the 
Northwest Territories.  In this respect it fulfils the 
requirements under a land claims agreement reached in the 34th 
Parliament calling for such co-ordination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-6 requires that 50% of the new board members be nominated 
by first nations, with the other 50% by the governments of the 
Northwest Territories and Canada.  The intent is to give 
aboriginal people and other northerners a stronger role in 
resource management decisions.  This is a very commendable goal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a Reformer I have no problem with giving our aboriginal 
peoples more control over their destinies.  When we in Reform 
talk about equality for our aboriginal peoples, it is to put them 
on the same footing with their fellow Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must say, however, that in this regard I do get rather tired 
of pious criticism of Reform Party policy on aboriginal affairs. 
It comes mostly from a Liberal government which in the main has 
not put its money where its mouth is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For many years now a number of us in this party have taken a 
grassroots interest in our native peoples.  From a personal 
perspective it has been an experience that I have shared with my 
wife over the past 18 years.  During this time, and even now, we 
have cared as foster parents for many aboriginal children with 
medical problems.  Three of our eight children are aboriginal. We 
love them as much as we do our first family of birth children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What really gets me is that we have had to care for these little 
ones as a direct result of the Liberal and Conservative 
mismanagement of a system which has effectively abused our native 
population for decades. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind members of the House that when they start to attack 
Reform Party policy in this area they ought to be prepared to 
walk in my shoes and in the shoes of others who have actively 
helped and supported our native peoples.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I criticize the bill before us, when I indicate that I will 
not vote for it in its present form, when I state that changes 
must be made, when I do all this, it is not because Reform is 
insensitive to the needs of aboriginal people as my Liberal 
friends believe.  To do so would be insulting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge hon. members across the way not to attack my position 
because they somehow construe it to be anti-native.  It is not 
that at all.  It is because the bill is flawed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Aside from aboriginal concerns, the issue we are addressing also 
seems to be one of environmental and economic concern.  The media 
communications office of the minister of aboriginal affairs seems 
to want this to be the focus when it claims that industry will 
benefit from improved efficiency and cost effectiveness of a 
regime which purports to build a single environmental impact 
assessment process and to streamline the process of obtaining 
water licences and land use permits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform recognizes the validity of the goals in the legislation, 
in particular the need to resolve commitments made by Canada 
under land claims agreements.  In this regard agreements on land, 
water management and protection of the environment in the 
Mackenzie Valley are issues of importance to residents of the 
region and Canadians in general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform's objections to Bill C-6 centre on the creation of yet 
another level of bureaucracy and the resulting duplication of 
services.  In addition there are specific industry concerns which 
need to be addressed, as the Northwest Chamber of Mines notes, 
“before the confusion, delays and cost of this new system grind 
mineral exploration to a painful halt”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The chamber of mines points to the recent decision by Inco to 
defer development at Voisey's Bay because of the onerous and 
poorly defined regulatory demands, and this in a system that is 
ostensibly far better defined and more unified than that which is 
being proposed for the Mackenzie Valley. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform is further opposed to Bill C-6 as it erodes the standards 
of resource management regulation for the perception of stronger 
northern influence.  But it does so at a price.  The new system 
would repeat the difficulties present within the existing system 
and would compound them with additional burdens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me illustrate.  First, it will create yet another layer of 
interjurisdictional confusion.  Second, there will be even less 
clarity in the rules and standards.  Third, all this will result 
in an inevitable increase in the costs of compliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Northwest Territory Chamber of Mines speaks for business and 
individuals active in the area.  It outlined its concerns 
following an information session held by the Department of Indian 
Affairs and Northern Development officials in Yellowknife on 
September 25, 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The chamber stressed a number of points.  There would be new 
obstacles for resource development including the potential for 
interference with staking of mineral claims, the change in the 
role of leases and land use permits, new powers to boards to 
suspend permits and leases, poorly defined terms for new rights 
to compensation, and a confused enforcement policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They also felt the lack of clarity would instigate litigation. 
In this regard attendees at the Department of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development information session in September raised many 
questions and far too many were answered with uncertainty.

<A HREF="#LINKT26"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Far too often they were given the worrying response that such 
matters would have to be settled in court.  If legal recourse is 
now recognized as the only way to settle matters the chamber says 
regularly arise in the north, surely this is the time to amend 
the legislation before it ever gets that far. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Critics also point to the vulnerability to deliberate, delaying 
tactics inherent in the legislation.  There is the fear that 
deficiencies in the act will encourage parties to use delay as a 
tactic to impede environmental review.  It is believed that this 
would be done in order to rest concessions that are largely 
unrelated to the protection of the environment or to the 
specifics of the proposal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development 
officials dismiss this concern as improbable, the chamber pointed 
to the region's recent experience with federal environmental 
reviews.  It referred to them as growing pains encountered in 
Nunavut and to current difficulties in Fort Providence as 
evidence.  On these matters the chamber said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is our extensive experience with operating in this region that 
leads us to put such a high priority on clarity, fairness and 
consistency in the rules and their application. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Northwest Territory Chamber of Mines also had reservations 
about public representation on public boards.  In this respect it 
feels there is also a lack of clarity in the process for 
selecting members to serve on various panels and boards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-6 introduces three new board levels, but it does not 
spell out what criteria will be used in determining who is a 
proper representative of the public interest.  A process that is 
not open and clear can surely lead to a perception of mistrust 
and bias. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some conclusions reached in regard to Bill C-80 will ostensibly 
apply to Bill C-6 as well.  In particular, conversations with 
other industry representatives consulted by the Department of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development during the development of 
Bill C-80 confirmed their belief that a single review process 
which avoids duplication of time and effort is the single most 
important issue.  The bill does not address this concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the Canadian Energy Pipeline Association and the 
Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers have not made comment 
since the fall of 1996.  At that time they too stressed the need 
for an agreement with the goal of efficiency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In view of all of this, amendments at committee stage may well 
save the day for the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The chamber of mines represents about 600 companies and 
individuals currently engaged in mineral exploration, mine 
development and mine operation in the Northwest Territories.  The 
chamber of mines has called for substantial amendments in two 
areas which we in the Reform Party can support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the lack of clarity in the law and in the rules is likely 
to produce very uneven regulations.  It will do so across the 
region from one applicant to the next, resulting in a highly 
litigious process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the new system is seriously under-resourced, especially 
in its technical capacity.  This will likely prove to be a 
disadvantage in dealing with the large workload created by 
transitional arrangements.  It will also affect changes to 
leasing.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, unless there are changes which address the 
shortcomings of this legislation, I serve notice of my intent now 
to vote against this bill. I urge my colleagues on both sides of 
the House to do the same.  As I said earlier, voting against this 
bill does not somehow mean you are insensitive to the needs of 
aboriginal people.  It does however mean that you recognize that 
the bill is flawed and that there are changes which are 
necessary. 
<P><A NAME="LINK199"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Patry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I would like to thank my colleague from Nanaimo—Cowichan for his 
speech and his dedication to the First Nations. I would like to 
tell him some of the features of the Mackenzie Valley Resource 
Management Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, an advantage to the Mackenzie Valley First Nations 
without land claims settlements is that the aboriginal and treaty 
rights will be protected. The act will also be reviewed in 
consultation with First Nations with respect to any 
self-government agreements that might be negotiated.  It does not 
affect the Indian Act.  First Nations may also nominate members 
to the boards, providing a much stronger voice in resource 
management decision making throughout the Mackenzie Valley.  It 
also allows for permanent regional land and water panels upon 
settlement of claims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are the changes for the industry?  The implementation of 
land claims brings the certainty required to enhance the 
investment climate.  The integrated resources management brings 
efficiency and consistency to the Mackenzie Valley.  The land and 
water system is based on familiar regulations: the Northwest 
Territories Water Act; the territorial land use regulation with 
some changes to reflect the land claims; aboriginal water rights, 
clauses 73 to 79; modernizations from security deposits in clause 
71; and a penalty for offences clause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, it encourages and provides for co-operation to 
eliminate duplication and environmental reviews. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know the people living and working in the Mackenzie Valley 
are in favour of this bill. We know the large majority of the 
population of the Mackenzie Valley is from the aboriginal 
population, and the Northwest Territories government with a 
majority of members coming from the aboriginal people is 
supportive of this bill. The Council of the Gwich'in First Nation 
and the Council of the Sahtu Nation are in favour of this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Knowing that this bill brings many advantages to the actual 
situation, my question to my colleague is, why is it that the 
Reform Party wants to impose its solution knowing that this 
proposed solution is one drafted with and for the population of 
the north? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the hon. 
member very much for his comments and question.  I am sure that 
the hon. member would agree that in our parliamentary democratic 
system it is the responsibility of a good opposition to take a 
very constructive look at government legislation.  We would be 
remiss if we did not say here is an area where we feel there 
needs to be some changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have already pointed out, there are some very good things 
in this bill.  At the same time we know there are some concerns. 
I would hope that the government would take a good look at the 
concerns that have been raised by the chamber of mines and 
others.  After all, if we run into problems in this thing later 
on and it is seen that this kind of bill actually does impede the 
development of mining in the north, then all the people are going 
to suffer, natives and non-natives alike.  It will mean fewer 
jobs and less money going into our northern areas.  No one would 
want that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the Reform Party are saying we should take a little closer 
look at this bill.  Let us see some areas where there are flaws. 
Hopefully in committee work we will be able to iron some of these 
out.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to commend my colleague from 
Nanaimo—Cowichan for a very powerful and eloquent speech on this 
issue.  He has worked for many years with aboriginal peoples and 
has given more than most people ever will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague brought up a number of very interesting questions 
relating to this issue and also on the larger issue of aboriginal 
peoples in this country.  I am very interested to know his views 
on the following. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the social parameters among aboriginal peoples in 
this country rival those in third world nations:  a lifespan 
which is eight years shorter; an infant mortality rate which is 
1.7 times higher; a tuberculosis rate that is eight times higher 
than that of the non-aboriginal community; and a diabetes rate 
that is three times higher. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member mentioned in his speech, this bill has actually 
prevented a lot of employment from taking place in the north. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the hon. member the following question. Does he believe 
that the inability of government policies to work with aboriginal 
peoples in creating jobs has been a prime motivating factor in 
contributing to the social ills that they see in a lot of these 
communities? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask whether or not he believes that the factor of aboriginal 
people not having responsibility and control over aboriginal 
people's affairs and their inability to develop long term 
constructive employment within their communities has been a prime 
factor in contributing to the despicable and horrible situation 
one finds in some of these aboriginal communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague 
very much for both his observations and his question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been my experience in my own lifetime of observation and 
working with our native peoples that indeed over a large period 
of time now, government mismanagement in this whole area has led 
to the terrible conditions that exist on many reservations across 
Canada. We in the Reform Party have had a number of concerns in 
this area for a long time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What concerns us about a bill like this in regard to our 
aboriginal peoples is that far too often the negotiations go on 
with the band chiefs and the band councils and if I might use the 
term, a band elite.  They have very little reference to the 
ordinary aboriginal person who makes up the majority of the band 
population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When speaking to aboriginal peoples, their concerns differ very 
little from yours and mine.  They want a good job. They want to 
be a useful productive person in society. They want to live a 
good and peaceful life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately the kind of mismanagement of aboriginal affairs by 
consecutive Liberal and Conservative governments has just driven 
our native peoples into a land of despair and one that is without 
hope.  It grieves me tremendously to see what is happening with 
our aboriginal peoples today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Somehow we have to fix this problem.  We have to work with our 
native brothers and sisters to do something about it.  From my 
perspective it really does start at the grassroots level, our 
making constructive contacts with native peoples to work at this 
whole concern. 
<P><A NAME="LINK201"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, let 
me start by congratulating the minister for introducing Bill C-6. 
It is a very fine Liberal initiative in the tradition of modern 
Liberal thinking.  It will go a long way in the long overdue 
recognition of the rights of our native people.  It will provide 
for a land claims agreement which we have all wished would see 
the light of day and finally the day has come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-6 would implement the terms of the Sahtu Dene and Metis 
comprehensive land claim agreement as well as the Gwich'in 
comprehensive land claim agreement. 
This is to be done in terms of land use planning and land and 
water management.  Also it takes into account environmental 
impact review as to the implications of certain specific 
proposals.  This is a long overdue initiative as the land claim 
agreement in question deserves full implementation as soon as 
possible.

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of important issues that should receive the 
attention of the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs and 
Northern Development.  I would like to indicate a few through 
this intervention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee could study ways and means to ensure that there is 
an integrated system of management of land use planning, land and 
water management and environmental impact assessment.  This is 
the first and most important consideration if the bill is to live 
up to the considerations and goals relating to sustainable 
development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second point is the committee would be very wise in 
examining the effect of this bill on the quality and type of 
environmental assessment that will be done in the Mackenzie 
Valley.  It might be worthwhile noting that the Mackenzie Valley 
covers quite a wide territory.  It includes everything north of 
60, south of the Inuvialuit claims area, east of the Yukon border 
and west of the Nunavut settlement area.  It is a huge area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At present the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act applies in 
much of the land north of 60.  Together with other existing and 
proposed regimes we could over time end up with a patchwork of 
environmental assessment regimes as they apply in the north. That 
is something we would like to prevent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The existing regimes include in addition to the federal act, the 
process under way under the Inuvialuit land claims agreement 
process and the James Bay and northern Quebec agreement.  The 
proposed regimes include the Yukon development assessment 
process, better known as DAP, and the process to be administered 
by the Nunavut impact review board, plus the framework proposed 
in part 5 of this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before such a patchwork is to emerge, it might be worthwhile for 
the committee to examine certain questions.  For instance is the 
system which is currently in place working?  Will the proposed 
additional regimes improve the situation?  Will each of the new 
regimes address transboundary, international and environmental 
impacts? A cursory review of clause 141 of the bill which is 
entitled “Transregional and External Developments” seems to 
indicate the need for stronger wording so as to ensure a 
comprehensive review of potential effects whenever they may 
occur. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mandatory rather than permissive language will also make for 
greater certainty of the process to be followed which is in the 
interests of all participants.  This is a point of discussion in 
almost every piece of legislation relating to the environment. 
They are more effective when mandatory rather than permissive 
language is used. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fourth point has to do with the following question.  Is 
there adequate provision in the bill for participant funding in 
environmental assessment?  Participant funding is a critical 
component for decision making because it requires meaningful 
public participation.  Members of the public do bring important 
contributions to the discussion of what comprises their health 
and what effects there may be on the environment of an area where 
industrial development is proposed. 
In addition, the public can bring important input to whether 
there are health and environmental trade-offs for the development 
that is being proposed.

<A HREF="#LINKT30"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has many environmental assessment regimes.  The federal 
act provides for funding for participants. We are very proud of 
that fact.  This funding was introduced by Liberal legislation 
some years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to add that the co-management bodies established 
under this bill will constitute institutions of government. 
Therefore, it will be essential for parliamentarians to become 
involved. This will require thorough committee reviews.  Of 
course, the availability of funding for participants is very 
essential. With that thought in mind, might I say that the 
aboriginal affairs and northern development committee would be 
well advised to travel to the northern communities to hear the 
views, which I am sure are diverse, on this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To save time in this debate, because this is a fine measure 
which ought to be given speedy passage, I would like to 
congratulate the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development for introducing the bill.  I would reiterate my 
suggestions for the committee, namely to consider how it can 
ensure that environmental assessment, as well as land and water 
management, are conducted in accordance with the principle of 
sustainable development as outlined in the Brundtland report 
entitled “Our Common Future”.  In doing so we will achieve 
something of lasting value for many generations to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  It is my duty 
pursuant to Standing Order 38 to inform the House that the 
questions to be raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Patry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of

I would like to thank the hon. member for Davenport for his 
speech, knowing his dedication to environmental issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have one question.  Is the member supportive of the provisions 
of Bill C-6 where it provides for joint environmental reviews, 
co-operation and co-ordination, by the National Energy Board, the 
Yukon and Nunavut territory, a province or the Minister of the 
Environment under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Charles Caccia:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
parliamentary secretary for his question which relates to joint 
reviews. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In reading that passage of the bill I was struck by its broad 
scope and its imaginative approach.  I think it can only lead to 
very positive results.  Therefore, my answer is in the 
affirmative. 
<P><A NAME="LINK203"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to make a few comments on what the hon. member on this side 
previously said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened very intently to— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. member must 
direct his comments to the hon. member who is engaged in the 
debate at this time.  We will be calling for debate again after 
the time allotted for questions and comments.  Perhaps the hon.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  It is tough some 
days.  The microphones, as hon. members know, pick up any little 
sound.  I recall one time when an hon. member had a clock timing 
his speech and we were all looking around wondering what that 
little beep was.  Again, on questions and comments, the hon. 
member for South Shore. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, thank you for your 
patience.  I will put my paper down.  I am not going to grind my 
paper and I am not going to grind my teeth but I will rub my 
hands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, because of the size of the Mackenzie River Valley and 
the fact that the people in the Northwest Territories and along 
the Mackenzie River Valley have waited since 1973 for some action 
on this matter, 24 years, that is why we need to support the bill 
and that is why this bill needs to move forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can listen to the criticism and we can listen to the debate, 
but I would like to make one point on this for the House. Are we 
going to move forward on this very important matter?  Are we 
going to have some devolution of power in this House to the 
Northwest Territories or are we going to wait another 24 years, 
as some would seem to think we should, or are we going to move 
ahead?  I suggest we move ahead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Charles Caccia:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think that everybody 
in the House today would agree with the hon. member that it is 
time to move ahead and with speed.

</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, as this is my first opportunity to speak 
with you being in the Chair I would like to congratulate you.  I 
know you are going to do a great job.  I enjoyed very much our 
working together in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to speak today to the motion to refer Bill C-3 to 
committee before second reading.  Bill C-3 provides for the 
establishment of a national DNA data bank.  The DNA 
identification act will make Canada one of only a handful of 
countries in the world to have a national DNA data bank. 
I am also pleased to inform the House that with this 
groundbreaking legislation we have reached a major milestone in 
the government's safer communities agenda.  Forensic DNA analysis 
has been instrumental in securing convictions and has also helped 
to exonerate wrongly convicted individuals.  It has already 
proven to be one of the most accurate methods of obtaining solid 
evidence in criminal investigations. However, DNA analysis also 
raises important privacy concerns because it has the potential to 
reveal much more about a person than does the analysis of a 
fingerprint. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the scope of the issues surrounding the use and potential 
misuse of DNA profiles and samples, we want to ensure detailed 
and careful study of this legislation.  The introduction of the 
DNA identification act marks the second phase in the government's 
DNA strategy.  The first phase was implemented in July 1995 when 
amendments to the Criminal Code were passed to allow the police 
to obtain DNA samples from suspects in criminal investigations 
with the use of warrants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With those provisions now firmly in place we are now creating 
the legal framework for storing both the biological samples and 
using the identifying information that they hold.  It is another 
concrete step toward protecting Canadians from violent criminals. 
I wish to share what has been done to bring us to this point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The former solicitor general began a process of consultation in 
January 1996 with the release of a DNA consultation document to 
various groups and individuals across Canada. Input was sought on 
several key issues, such as whose DNA profile should be banked, 
under what circumstances and whether biological samples should be 
retained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year consultation sessions were held across the country and 
written comments were received from over 70 respondents. The 
results of those consultations were summarized in a report that 
was released in February 1997.  A tremendous amount was learned 
through this process.  The consultations indicated strong support 
for the creation of a national DNA data bank.  However, a number 
of concerns were raised in relation to privacy and charter 
considerations associated with the collection of biological 
samples and the storing and use of DNA profiles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The views of those who participated in the consultation process 
have been carefully considered.  We are confident the bill 
strikes the appropriate balance between privacy and charter 
concerns and our goal to do more to protect Canadians from 
violent crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The national DNA data bank will be an important tool that will 
help police link a suspect with evidence left at the scene of a 
crime.  It will be much easier for police to identify repeat sex 
and violent offenders and help eliminate innocent suspects in the 
course of their investigations.  Combined with the DNA warrant 
legislation, which is already in place, the ability to store and 
later retrieve DNA profiles will shorten investigations and help 
prevent further victimization from repeat offenders.  It is the 
next logical step to ensure that the warrant legislation is used 
to its fullest potential. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will briefly explain how the proposed data bank will work. 
Biological samples will be collected from offenders convicted of 
designated criminal offences.  These include the most serious 
personal injury offences, including homicide and sexual offences. 
Young offenders will be treated in the same manner as adults with 
respect to the taking of DNA samples for the purposes of data 
banking.  The DNA extracted from the sample will be analysed with 
the resulting profile entered into a convicted offenders index in 
the data bank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The DNA data bank will also contain a crime scene index that 
will contain DNA information retrieved from unsolved crime 
scenes. The data bank will be established and maintained by the 
RCMP.  It is very important to note that access to the DNA 
profiles contained in the convicted offenders index and to the 
samples themselves will be strictly limited to those directly 
involved in the operation of the data bank.

<A HREF="#LINKT33"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The benefits of using such a system are numerous.  Police will 
be able to identify and arrest repeat offenders by comparing DNA 
information from a crime scene to the convicted offender's index. 
They will also be able to determine whether a series of offences 
was committed by the same offender or whether more than one 
perpetrator was involved. Police will be able to cross-reference 
and link DNA profiles to other cases within and across 
jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Using DNA profiles will help focus police investigation by more 
quickly eliminating suspects whose DNA is already in the data 
bank in a case where no match with the crime scene evidence is 
found. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, we anticipate that the knowledge of DNA testing to 
solve crimes may also deter offenders from committing further 
offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are keenly aware of the significant privacy concerns 
associated with the bill, particularly in relation to the 
retention of biological samples. Strong arguments have been 
advanced by the scientific community indicating that in its view 
the retention of biological samples is essential for the DNA data 
bank to be able to adapt to technological changes in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are aware that the field of forensic DNA analysis is 
developing rapidly and forensic scientists have told us that as 
the technology evolves the DNA profiles of today are likely to be 
come obsolete later on. If samples are retained, they can be 
reanalysed using new technology, thereby ensuring that Canada's 
data bank is able to keep pace with technological advances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill includes strict prohibitions and criminal penalties in 
relation to any misuse of either the samples or the information 
contained in the samples.  However, despite the safeguards 
included in the legislation there continue to be concerns 
regarding the retention of biological samples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe there are compelling arguments on both sides of the 
issue and this is one of the reasons why I am asking the House to 
refer the legislation to the justice committee prior to second 
reading to allow for detailed study and full public debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To conclude, there is no doubt that over the past few years we 
have made enormous progress in our efforts to contribute to a 
safe, just and peaceful society. The addition of forensic DNA 
analysis and the ability to store DNA profiles will help us 
target those who commit the most serious crimes and hold them 
accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians can continue to enjoy the safety of their streets and 
have a sense of security knowing that police forces across the 
country have access to one of the most sophisticated tools 
worldwide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge hon. members of the House to support the motion to refer 
Bill C-3 to committee prior to second reading. 
<P><A NAME="LINK210"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Allan Kerpan (Blackstrap, Ref.):</b>  Mr. Speaker, I 
congratulate you on your appointment. This is my first 
opportunity to say this publicly with you in the chair.  As do my 
colleagues, I look forward to this session with you in the chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about Bill C-3.  No one from our party would be 
opposed to a national DNA registry.  The theory is sound and 
solid.  No one in this party would disagree with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, my concern is that I do not believe the bill takes us 
far enough into the future and makes arrangement for a DNA 
registry that will encompass all the things that should be in it. 
We think the bill at very best is a half measure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just spent a week in Washington meeting with officials of the 
justice department.  One of the issues we talked about at some 
length was the issue of DNA evidence and registry.  I would like 
to quote from a book of case studies carried out and issued by 
the U.S. department of justice about how important DNA evidence 
can and will be.  I quote Rockne Harmon, senior deputy district 
attorney for Alameda County, California: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The introduction of forensic DNA typing into the legal system 
was heralded as the most significant event in criminalistics 
since dermal fingerprint identification.  Few developments ever 
live up to their advanced billing—but DNA has. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Cases are now being prosecuted that never would have been 
possible before the advent of DNA typing.  Many states have 
created DNA data bases on known offenders that they can compare 
against unsolved crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>—the results occasionally exonerate a suspect or suspects. 
Such cases rarely are front page news because the tests have 
served their purpose.  Investigators can redirect their efforts 
to alternative suspects.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I use that quote because Canada is on the cutting edge, the 
leading edge of this type of technology.  Our thinking on this 
side is why would we want to cut that process off at the knees. 
Let us make this DNA registry supply the tools that the people in 
our justice system need in order to carry out their jobs more 
efficiently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Equally important for a DNA registry is the ability to exonerate 
someone who is actually not guilty of a crime.  I use a well 
known case in Canada, from the province of Saskatchewan, the 
David Milgaard case.  This past summer with the use of DNA 
evidence David Milgaard was released from prison.  He was 
released because through DNA testing it was found that he did not 
commit the crime he was accused of and for which he spent 23 
years in jail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The evidence is so conclusive that the Saskatchewan government 
immediately entered into negotiations with Mr. Milgaard on how 
much they were going to pay him in compensation.  Very few 
governments would take that route without convincing evidence. 
The province of Saskatchewan had no doubts about the 
conclusiveness of the DNA test. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To quote from the same book I quoted from a moment ago, Walter 
F. Rowe, professor of forensic science at the George Washington 
University said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>An unforeseen consequence of the introduction of DNA profiling 
has been the reopening of old cases.  Persons convicted of murder 
and rape before DNA profiling became available have sought to 
have the evidence in their cases re-evaluated using this new 
technology.  In some cases, DNA test results have exonerated 
those convicted of the offences and resulted in their release 
from prison. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point I am getting at is this technology is so critical and 
crucial to law enforcement agencies that we must do the very best 
job we can to put this registry together so it serves the 
purposes of those involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our plan on this side of the House would be to go much further 
than the Liberals in their original draft of Bill C-3.  We would 
like to make the DNA registry and Bill C-3 completely parallel to 
the current fingerprint legislation whereby a suspect at point of 
arrest would have a sample of DNA taken.  That sample would then 
be used in order to either convict or exonerate that person 
accused of the crime.  Anyone found not guilty of a particular 
crime would have the right to ask the department to remove their 
DNA sample from the registry, as they are allowed to do under the 
fingerprint legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the arguments we get from some of the civil libertarian 
groups is that it goes too far.  What is too far?  That really is 
the question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My answer to that is if you are going to make a mistake, if you 
are going to err, it is far better to err on the side of victims 
than on the side of accused criminals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other argument I hear is why would you want to take this 
sample at point of arrest. You are certainly not convicted of a 
crime at that point in time.  That is true, of course.  Law 
enforcement agencies have better things to do than arrest people 
without some justification.  The police I talked to, the men and 
women protecting this country, have reasonable grounds before 
they arrest any person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other argument I hear is about the security of the registry 
itself.  Of course there is no guarantee and there cannot be any 
guarantee that the system would be fail safe.

<A HREF="#LINKT35"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The good part of this bill, and I agree there is a good thing in 
this bill, is that it does have very tough penalties for the 
unauthorized use of the registry.  That must be continued and 
strictly enforced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I look back through the history of fingerprint legislation, 
we have never had a problem, to my knowledge, of a breach of 
security for the fingerprint system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill should be a very critical part of our justice process. 
That goes without saying.  It must be a major part of our 
process.  It is not the be all and the end all of solving cases 
or exonerating people from crimes they have convicted. However, 
if used properly, it can go a very long way toward making the 
justice system, which many people in this country are very 
frustrated with, more appealing to the Canadian people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we give the police and the justice system all the tools 
available, we could put those resources, both human and 
financial, to better use.  We can put those people back on the 
streets where they need to be and where they must be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, as I mentioned before, it also gives people 
wrongly accused of crimes all the tools available in this day and 
age to ensure them a fair and conclusive trial.  That does 
happen. We have seen evidence of that in Canada during the last 
few years. That is something no one can argue with in this 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know we are going to have the opportunity to speak about this 
bill as it goes through the regular parliamentary process.  I am 
looking forward to that.  I expect that our party may well put 
some amendments forward to this bill and we will discuss those in 
the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge the government to take heart as to what is said in 
committee from those witnesses who come forward, to take heart 
and take note of what is said in this House as this bill goes 
through the rest of the process. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK211"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):</b> Mr. Speaker, the bill 
before us today deals with a very important issue, something that 
cannot be taken lightly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must decide today, in our consideration of the bill, what 
is most important: the fight against crime or the respect of 
individual rights and freedoms, including respect for an 
individual's private life and person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In principle, the Bloc Quebecois supports the bill, because 
the crime rate in this country can never be too low, because the 
number of unresolved crimes is never too low and because the work 
of the police is too important for them not to have all the tools 
they need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know that a DNA profile is the best way to identify 
someone.  It raises some questions, however, first because it 
involves an individual's person, second, because we are talking 
about people's DNA profile and, third, because the possibilities of 
improper use are limitless.  We must therefore ensure a very high 
level of confidentiality for the bank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What sort of questions might we have?  There are some I would 
mention here today.  First, the bill contains provision for the 
storage of bodily substances taken. 
I would like to know why a sample will be kept once the genetic 
information has been taken, because the comparison is not done with 
the sample, but with the information taken from the sample.  The 
point of having the bank is to establish a relationship between an 
individual and the scene of the crime, which can be done without 
the need to keep the sample once the analysis has been done. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1700"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT37"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT37"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1700
<A HREF="#LINKT38"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT36"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who is to say that, if these samples are preserved, there will 
not be pressure from a segment of the population saying “Let's do 
genetic testing to see if there is not some genetic predisposition 
for becoming a criminal”.  Once again, these are huge ethical 
questions.  Where will it stop? This is a slippery slope, one which 
we ought not to embark upon, in my opinion.  By destroying the 
samples, while keeping the information gleaned from them, we will 
be able to resist the temptation to carry out unnecessary testing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have another concern. The bill provides that samples may be 
taken by a law enforcement officer. 
In the opinion of the Bloc Quebecois, samples ought to be taken, 
not by a law enforcement officer, but by a health professional, 
either a physician, a nurse or a qualified medical technician. 
I have good friends on the police force and I respect their law 
enforcement work, but if they came after me with a needle I would 
feel pretty uncomfortable.  Let us give sample collection over to 
qualified medical personnel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the question of the disclosure of profiles.  It 
is possible, and somewhat normal in today's world, for information 
to be transferred between countries or between organizations.  I am 
thinking of such things as the FBI or Interpol.  Once a foreign 
state or organization has been given information, what assurance is 
there that if a file is sealed in Canada it would be sealed 
elsewhere? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps there could be a notification process whereby foreign 
states to whom information had been forwarded could be told that 
the file had been sealed in Canada and asked to seal it as well. 
Agreements could also be drawn up between Canada and these states 
so that once a profile is sealed here in Canada, it could also be 
sealed in the foreign state to whom we transmitted the information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another question we have concerns access to the information in 
the data bank.  As it now stands, the bill gives commissioners 
considerable leeway.  This raises certain problems of 
confidentiality of data. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps we could put measures in place, or require the 
commissioner to make public the list of persons with access to this 
bank so that there are certain limits to the commissioner's 
discretionary authority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, we support the bill in principle, but feel that 
there should be very serious consideration of certain provisions, 
some of which I have just mentioned.  It merits serious 
consideration and we in the Bloc Quebecois would be very pleased to 
take part in such consideration. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK212"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney—Victoria, NDP):</b>  Mr. Speaker, 
as indicated by my colleague, we will be supporting the bill in 
principle but with some very serious reservations and concerns 
that have to be addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will comment on some of the remarks made by a previous 
speaker, but first I welcome the debate initiated by the 
solicitor general.  I take him at his word that he wants to 
ensure a detailed analysis of the legislation because it is 
crucial legislation.  As my colleague has already indicated, we 
are trying to find a balance between information that can be 
vitally important to both the police and prosecution services and 
at the same time protecting the civil rights and liberties of 
individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to debate on the retention of DNA samples.  The 
solicitor general indicated there were compelling arguments on 
both sides at the current time.  My own feeling would be that 
retention causes real problems. 
I look forward to that debate in the House as well.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be remiss if I did not also comment on the remarks of 
the hon. member for Blackstrap who indicated that the bill did 
not go far enough for his party.  I respect his opinion on that. 
I can see we will have lively debate when the bill comes before 
the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He quoted some information from the United States.  Again with 
the greatest of respect I am very cautious of that kind of 
information because our systems are so different in many 
situations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate when he says we should err, if we must err, on the 
side of victims and not criminals and therefore their support to 
take the DNA samples at the time of the charge.  I remind my 
colleague, as I am sure he is aware, there is no criminal until 
such time as a court determines guilt.  At the time individual 
are charged they are the accused. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that time the person we are calling the victim is the 
accuser.  If I come before a court and say that the hon. member 
has done something to me, at that time I am not a victim and he 
is not a criminal.  At that time I am the accuser and he is the 
accused.  As I indicated we will have a lively debate on that 
aspect of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been stated that an opportunity has been presented to 
find that balance and I think we will.  History is fraught with 
examples of situations where societies and communities felt they 
had the answer to solving crime problems and investigative tools, 
only to be proven down the road that scientific evidence was not 
as accurate as we might have hoped and that many innocent people 
suffered as a result of what society thought was the perfect test 
for guilt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must approach this kind of scientific information with some 
scepticism because it deserves to be treated carefully and 
critically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certain sections of the bill require real examination.  As the 
solicitor general indicated, many groups made presentations to 
him.  Many groups opposed the legislation.  Among them were the 
Canadian Association of Sexual Assault Centres, the Elizabeth Fry 
Society, the National Action Committee on the Status of Women, 
and women's organizations like the Feminist Alliance on New 
Reproductive and Genetic Technologies.  Several other groups felt 
the legislation was not necessarily the best way to use 
government funds.  As indicated previously civil liberties 
associations had real concerns about the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can point to specific examples in the legislation where I 
think the solicitor general and the government have gone too far, 
or sections that require very careful consideration and debate. 
Clause 7, as my colleague has indicated, provides for tremendous 
discretion on the part of the commissioner to provide access to 
information about an individual's DNA index to other groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The very taking of the DNA samples is questionable.  Why would 
we do it automatically instead of perhaps suggesting that an 
application be made by the prosecution or by the defence? 
Certainly there are benefits to the accused.  Why should an 
application not be made to the judge hearing the case who could 
then exercise his or her discretion accordingly with procedural 
safeguards for the civil liberties of the individual charged? The 
automatic taking of the sample is something I have some problems 
with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 10 which provides for further testing if there are new 
developments is fraught with real problems.  On the storing of 
the substances which has been referred to, especially the storing 
and keeping of the substances when an individual is pardoned, 
when a higher court overturns a conviction, I think we must ask 
the question why we would keep the substances once an individual 
is determined to be innocent of the crime.  Then the sample ought 
not to have been collected in the first place. 
Why we would continue to keep that index and the information 
derived from the samples is something we have to look at very 
carefully.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The application to young offenders and the keeping of the 
samples for 10 years is a portion of the legislation we have to 
look at very critically.  As well we should look at the offences 
to which the taking of DNA samples will apply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those concerns will demand very real examination in committee. 
As I have indicated, the NDP will support the bill in principle 
at this point and will certainly support referring it to 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, if I can summarize, a number of issues need to be 
addressed such as the indefinite period of keeping the DNA on 
file; the inclusion of young offenders in the act, in every 
single portion of the act, to be treated the same way as adults; 
the issue of who has access to the DNA databank and how the 
information may be used; the fact that the DNA may be taken even 
while a case is under appeal or kept while the case is under 
appeal; and the taking of DNA be mandatory upon conviction rather 
than at the discretion of the judiciary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot stress that enough.  I feel very strongly about that 
point.  I am willing to listen to other arguments and debate, but 
it is something we have to be very careful about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that a person can be detained for a reasonable amount 
of time for the taking of the samples, as opposed to a clearly 
defined period of time during which the samples could be taken, 
requires consideration.  Who will be taking the samples?  Will it 
be a member of the police force or a trained individual? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another very real question that has to be addressed is the 
funding formula and the costs of establishing the DNA databank. 
Who will pay for it?  Obviously the commissioner will be a member 
of the RCMP.  The RCMP will have a huge influence on the way the 
legislation is dealt with.  All those questions deserve very 
careful consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have indicated I look forward to the debate.  I think it 
will be lively.  I especially look forward to the comments of the 
next speaker, the hon. member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough.  He is a former prosecutor.  I 
am a former defence counsel.  The two of us worked in the same 
province.  We did not have the opportunity to lock horns in the 
courtrooms of Nova Scotia, but I look forward to our debate in 
committee.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</b> 
Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak to Bill C-3, the DNA identification 
act.  As my learned friend in the New Democratic Party pointed 
out, I was a crown attorney in the province of Nova Scotia and 
had the opportunity to deal with a number of cases which featured 
DNA evidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although this may give lawyers, both prosecutors and defenders, 
a unique perspective on the legislation, I would suggest that DNA 
evidence is something that has a tremendous effect and impact on 
the criminal justice system for all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has truly been a number of changes within our legal system 
and DNA type testing is certainly the next generation of 
fingerprinting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1988 trial judges have allowed DNA evidence from the 
accused to be identified in several criminal prosecutions 
throughout the land.  Indeed forensic DNA analysis has been 
instrumental in securing convictions in hundreds of violent 
crimes, as well as resulting in the release of wrongfully 
convicted persons, as referenced by the Reform member.  He 
mentioned the Morin case as well as the Milgaard case in his 
province.  The key here is that both an inculpatory and 
exculpatory notion arise from the use of DNA evidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the early years of DNA evidence there existed a vacuum in 
regulating the collection and use of DNA data.  In a number of 
cases judges allowed DNA samples which were taken from 
individuals without their consent.  This is something which is 
addressed within the proposed legislation.  It is something which 
will certainly lead to more lively debate with respect to 
individual rights, as opposed to the rights of the victims and 
their families.  Caution must always be exercised in the use of 
this type of technology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Organizations such as the Canadian Police Association have 
warned the Liberal government that legislation would be needed to 
ensure proper and effective use of DNA evidence similar to the 
type of evidence that is introduced through the identification of 
criminal acts with photos and fingerprints and of the need to 
potentially purge the samples if a person was found not guilty.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In December 1993 the Canadian Police Association met with the 
then justice minister and in January 1994 met with the then 
solicitor general.  The purpose of the meetings was to raise the 
urgent need for updating the evidence laws, including DNA 
technology. Despite the warnings from the country's top law 
enforcement personnel, the men and women who are on the front 
lines enforcing the laws, the Liberals decided to wait.  They 
dragged their heels until the Supreme Court of Canada intervened 
in 1994,  much the same way they continue to drag their heels on 
the faint hope clause, the Young Offenders Act, victims bills of 
rights and impaired driving legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The supreme court ruled that in the absence of federal 
legislation the police did not have any lawful authority or means 
to obtain a search warrant for the seizure of bodily substances 
for the purposes of DNA typing.  This lack of legislation led the 
Supreme Court of Canada to determine that DNA evidence obtained 
without the consent of the accused risked being excluded at 
trial. I did see this happen in a case that arose within my 
constituency of Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, the Queen vs. 
Borden. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government finally took the step to provide a legal 
framework for DNA evidence in 1995 by passing Bill C-104.  That 
bill gave the police the right to seek a warrant that, if 
approved by a provincial court judge, would authorize the 
collection of bodily substances for DNA analysis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-104 also legislated the criteria for our judges to 
consider when reviewing DNA warrant applications. Police 
officers, lawyers and judges finally had some guidelines, albeit 
very broad guidelines, to govern the collection and use of DNA 
evidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With Bill C-104 in place the obvious question arose of what 
would the government do with the DNA samples once they were 
collected. The logical answer was the creation of a national DNA 
data bank in which the collected samples could be stored for 
future reference in the use of criminal investigations or trials. 
Even the justice minister at the time, when not preoccupied with 
cracking down on law abiding gun owners or launching politically 
motivated witch hunts, did concede that the importance of a 
national DNA bank existed.  He felt that it was so important that 
when Bill C-104 was approved he promised complementary data bank 
legislation for the fall of 1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That promise bit the dust when the government decided to start 
consultation again in January 1996.  A discussion paper entitled 
“Establishing a National DNA Data Bank” was tabled. 
Interestingly enough, the cover note on the news release which 
accompanied the discussion paper of the day stated that the 
government would bring in DNA legislation within the coming year. 
We all know what happens when these promises are made on justice 
issues.  The coming year seems to be stretched into 16 months and 
the promised legislation was tabled in April this year just in 
time for its inclusion in the writing of the order paper. It was 
also introduced in time for inclusion in the red book. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thankfully the Liberals did not use this as an election excuse 
to delay the potentially important piece of legislation before us 
today.  With some minor exceptions, technical language that is, 
Bill C-3 is essentially the same bill that was introduced in 
April during the dying days of the last Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The solicitor general has outlined many of the positive elements 
of this bill, of which there are several.  The national DNA data 
bank, to be managed by the RCMP, will consist of two main 
components, a crime scene index that will contain DNA profiles 
obtained from unsolved crime scenes, as well as a convicted 
offenders index which will contain DNA profiles of adult and 
young offenders convicted of designated Criminal Code offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because police officers would be able to cross-reference these 
data from certain convicted offenders with unsolved crimes, the 
DNA identification act is a great improvement over the vacuum 
which previously existed in terms of storing the DNA data. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But will this national data bank established under Bill C-3 
provide police officers with an effective tool to solve crimes 
and keep our streets and communities safe as referred to by the 
solicitor general? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Police officers, particularly those involved in the Canadian 
Police Association, do not feel it will.  The Canadian Police 
Association, which has been at the forefront of lobbying the 
government to establish this DNA data bank, is concerned about 
the effectiveness of Bill C-3.  In essence, it is opposed to the 
legislation in its current form.

<A HREF="#LINKT40"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The major concern of the Canadian Police Association is the 
timing of DNA collection.  According to the CPA, a national DNA 
data bank will only be successful if the collection of DNA 
evidence from a person charged with an indictable offence is done 
at the time of arrest.  Why is this the case?  Because the only 
guaranteed opportunity to obtain DNA evidence from an individual 
charged with an indictable offence is when the police have actual 
custody and possession of this individual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed convicted offenders index, while somewhat useful, 
would not help police with unknown murderers and rapists.  It 
might even encourage suspected offenders to skip bail.  Most 
people charged with offences do receive release pending trial. 
Our criminal justice system grants bail in more than 95% of cases 
when individuals are charged.  According to </I>Juristat<I> in 
1995, 66,000 people broke bail or failed to appear as required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consider this example of what might happen if a person were 
arrested with respect to an offence related to juvenile 
prostitution, a designated offence for which the DNA collection 
would apply.  If that person had also committed an offence such 
as a murder or a sexual offence in another part of the country 
from which the offender's unidentified DNA was to be collected, 
that person would know that if convicted for juvenile 
prostitution, an offence not as serious as the prior offences I 
have mentioned, the DNA analysis would be obtained, 
cross-referenced with the crime scene and then that person could 
potentially face a murder charge.  It does not take a rocket 
scientist to figure out that under the bill in its current form 
the offender would certainly have an incentive to skip bail 
knowing that he was going to face more serious charges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As it stands, this bill is a huge loophole that we do not need. 
We certainly do not need more unnecessary loopholes in our 
justice system.  I understand the fears of individuals in Canada 
with respect to privacy but I believe there are ways to deal with 
this without compromising the collection of samples and the 
ability to solve serious unsolved crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I respect the fact that many members in the opposition have 
posed serious questions that will be debated at the committee 
level.  I also look forward to taking part in that rigorous 
debate and to seeing that this bill is brought forward in such a 
way that it will aid our law enforcement agents throughout 
Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Nick Discepola (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General of Canada, Lib.):</b> Mr. Speaker, we have seven or eight 
minutes left.  I will try to conclude my remarks by 5.30 p.m. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to speak to Bill C-3 today.  It is entitled the 
DNA Identification Act.  It concerns an issue never before dealt 
with in Canadian legislation.> 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The registration of DNA profiles in a bank and the storage of 
samples and bodily substances raises many ethical and legal 
questions and warrants thorough consideration in an open 
discussion. Rest assured that the Government of Canada is taking 
these questions seriously.  That is why the Department of the 
Solicitor General last year consulted widely on the creation of a 
DNA data bank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In January 1996, the solicitor general at the time made public 
a consultation paper on a national DNA data bank.  This document 
was used as the basis for consultation across the country, in which 
a number of questions were asked, including: what genetic material 
should be included in the bank; when should samples be taken and 
who should do so; should we keep biological specimens and DNA 
profiles; and how should the DNA data bank be funded? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The document was given to provincial and territorial 
governments, to police departments, to national police 
organizations, to those responsible for privacy, to lawyers, to 
representatives of correctional services, to women's groups, to 
victims' groups and to experts in the field of forensic medicine. 
You can see a broad cross section was consulted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The number of participants in consultations and the number of 
briefs received raised considerable interest in the creation of a 
national DNA data bank. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1725"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT41"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the whole, the consultation also showed that there was 
strong support for such a bank, particularly from the police. On 
the other hand, those concerned with privacy issues and jurists 
stressed the necessity of adopting balanced legislation which would 
include the necessary guarantees, limits and protections to ensure 
that privacy is respected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Department of the Solicitor General summarized the results 
of the consultation process in another document titled “Summary of 
consultations”. 
This report stated that there was no true consensus among 
respondents on such questions as preservation of biological samples 
of bodily substances and the range of offences involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the complexity of this matter, and the diversity of 
views on this aspect of how the data bank would operate, I must 
take advantage of this opportunity to congratulate the Solicitor 
General of Canada for introducing legislative provisions which 
reflect both the necessity to improve protection of the public and 
the obligation to respect the individual's right to privacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The national DNA data bank will offer police forces an 
invaluable tool to assist them in their battle against violent 
crime. 
Police investigations will be facilitated by the use of DNA 
analysis and by the possibility of comparing genetic data from 
biological samples from convicted criminals with those found at the 
scene of unsolved crimes. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will help ensure that those guilty of serious crimes, such as 
repeat violent sexual offenders, are identified and apprehended 
much more quickly.  At the same time, the bill contains strict 
rules governing the collection, the use, the retention of DNA 
profiles and biological samples in order to ensure that privacy 
interests are protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Building on the success of the DNA warrant legislation passed in 
July 1995, the current bill includes similar safeguards and 
processes related to the collection of the samples. To date, we 
all know that the DNA warrant scheme has withstood charter 
challenges and thus provides a solid foundation on which to build 
the DNA data bank scheme. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation includes numerous safeguards. For example, as 
has already been stated, the RCMP will be responsible for safely 
and securely storing all biological samples.  In addition, the 
legislation limits access to DNA profiles contained in the 
convicted offenders index and access to the samples themselves 
will be limited to only those directly involved in the operation 
and maintenance of the data bank. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to ensure the appropriate use of information 
contained in the data bank, the bill states clearly that only the 
name attached to the profile may be transmitted to the authorities 
responsible for implementing the legislation in the course of 
criminal investigations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also provides for prison terms of up to two years 
less a day for infractions.  Infractions involving unauthorized use 
of the data bank will also be included in Canada's Criminal Code 
and in the legislation on identification by fingerprints. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an extremely important bill that will be invaluable to 
the police in combatting violent crime. 
As my esteemed colleague, the Solicitor General of Canada, has 
already said, however, the complexity and innovative nature of the 
bill require the full attention of members and of experts with the 
necessary experience and knowledge to advise us on issues relating 
to technology, privacy, law and ethics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, therefore, I support the motion of the 
Solicitor General of Canada to refer Bill C-3 to committee before 
second reading, and I urge all my colleagues in the House to do the 
same.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. John Herron (Fundy—Royal, PC)</b> moved: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, 
the government should actively develop an innovative 
National Shipbuilding Policy which focuses on making ship 
yards internationally competitive by providing tax 
incentives and construction financing comparable to what is 
being provided elsewhere in the world and which ensures 
reasonable access to foreign markets, particularly the 
United States of America; and should recognize that such a 
policy would not provide direct subsidies, but create 
alternatives methods of support to ensure the growth of the 
industry. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, it is with the utmost of honour that I 
introduce my motion which calls on the government to review, 
revitalize and renew Canada's shipbuilding policy.

<A HREF="#LINKT44"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the past number of months various sectors have been 
pleading, in fact demanding, development of a national 
shipbuilding policy.  A focused and unified consortium of 
stakeholders recognize the industry is in need of governmental 
leadership and initiatives to ensure the future of a strong, 
self-sufficient and export driven industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These stakeholders include the Shipbuilder's Association of 
Canada and the Canadian Ship Owners Association.  Labour is 
represented by the Marine Workers Federation and even all 10 
provincial premiers are on side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion addresses the need for policies and initiatives to 
ensure Canadian shipyards have reasonable access to international 
markets.  Today's debate brings the issue to the forum where 
change must and can only be delivered, on the floor of this 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My objective is for the House to recognize through constructive 
debate what others know to be true, that the federal government 
has a responsibility to respond to the needs of Canada's 
shipbuilding industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I stress the need for all members to reach a consensus so this 
issue will reach the desk of the Minister of Industry in an 
urgent fashion.  Reaching a consensus would be a major step 
forward for the shipyards and individuals who earn their living 
in this high tech industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before we get into detail, the support and changes that I and 
the industry are advocating are not about subsidies.  We are 
calling for changes to simplify regulations to enable our 
shipyards to compete.  These changes would do more for the 
industry than any subsidy ever could. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The industry recognizes the way it has been supported in the 
past by government contracts will not continue.  It is eager to 
find new markets internationally where it knows it can compete. 
This is the key to the success of a shipbuilding industry and our 
ability to be competitive in a global marketplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's marine industry employs 40,000 people nationwide and 
adds over $2 billion to gross domestic product.  Canadian 
shipbuilders have rationalized 40% of their shipbuilding capacity 
over the last decade.  They have become more efficient and are 
lower cost producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The industry has evolved and modernized.  What it needs now are 
initiatives to use this modernization to be able to compete. 
Canadian shipyards are now high tech companies supporting 
Canada's ocean and marine shipboard technology and are part of an 
industry with a future, yet we continue to impede their progress 
with a paternalistic approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has no specific industrial or trade 
policy dealing with shipbuilding.  The international trade 
business plan, Canada's integrated plan for trade, investment, 
technology and development, does not include shipbuilding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While this motion does not call for subsidies, I think we need 
to recognize that all other shipbuilding nations have direct 
subsidies or a variety of programs that enable them to compete 
internationally.  Canada does not.  This forces us to compete on 
an uneven playing field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, Canadian shipyards have become more 
competitive by incorporating new technologies and processes, 
adding new equipment and modern facilities.  The fact is that 
Canadian shipyards could be cost competitive with other European 
Economic Community and United States shipyards building naval 
ships today and have the potential to become competitive building 
merchant ships if we had the opportunity to compete on a more 
level playing field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Shipbuilding is a relatively labour intensive activity, thus 
labour costs have a major impact on the total shipbuilding cost. 
Over the past 10 years hourly wages in Canada have gone from 
being among the highest in the mid-1980s to near the lowest in 
1996 when compared to European and American shipyards.  This is a 
result of significant currency exchanges, improved Canadian 
efficiency and rising labour costs abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Due to excess subsidies, low cost shipbuilding nations such as 
Korea, China, Poland, Ukraine, Brazil and Spain target low 
technology ships such as crude tankers and bulk carriers with 
high steel content and low outfitting needs.  Canadian shipyards 
cannot, would not and have no interest in participating in this 
aggressive market. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1810"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT45"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>While some nations are losing their market share in 
shipbuilding, others are finding success in specialty niche 
construction.  Canadian shipyards would focus on product 
carriers, chemical carriers, offshore vessels and specialty ships 
requiring special paint coatings, improved steel treatment and 
specific instrumentation, navigation and communication systems. 
These ships are presently built in high wage areas, such as the 
EU, Japan and the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the past decade Canadian government procurement has been 
the main source of work for domestic shipyards.  However, because 
of shrinking government budgets and reduced government 
requirements for ships, new markets must be found. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>International markets provide the only possible military and 
commercial shipbuilding opportunities for larger Canadian firms. 
In the near term the commercial market offers the best prospects 
for maintaining and/or expanding production. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Considering the fact that only 2% to 3% of Canadian shipyard 
capacity is exported today, there is a real opportunity for the 
government to assume a leadership role and empower the industry 
to grow. Canadian policies must support both international market 
entry and sales to Canadian operators and owners.  We must agree 
that the future of the shipbuilding industry in Canada is tied to 
its ability to compete in the international commercial 
shipbuilding markets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Shipbuilding construction has shown consistent increase in 
demand since the early 1980s.  Shipyards around the world are 
preparing for continued growth.  The longer Canadian shipyards 
wait, the more difficult it will be to enter these international 
markets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian officials continually point to the need to follow the 
1979 OECD agreement, yet we are the only country to abide by 
these terms. Members of the EU generally provide direct subsidies 
to their shipyards of up to 9% of construction costs.  Other 
assistance, such as research and development, tax benefit 
programs and export financing are also provided. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Providing subsidies is not a solution that I am advocating.  It 
is not a made in Canada solution.  There are alternatives which 
would enable Canada to compete on a more level playing field 
which do not involve subsidies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The premiers, the Canadian Shipbuilding Association and other 
stakeholders believe that there are financial mechanisms used by 
the Americans which could form part of our Canadian solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, the U.S. federal ship financing program, known as 
Title 11, is a good example.  After a long absence from the 
international commercial market, U.S. shipbuilders have appeared 
in the world order book compliments of Title 11.  This financing 
program recognizes the common practice of ship buyers demanding a 
financial package as part of the total sales package. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Title 11, established in 1936, provides for federal government 
guarantees of private sector financing for the construction of 
U.S. ships for both domestic and foreign ship owners.  The 
success of the Title 11 export financing and loan guarantee 
program is an indisputable success. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fiscal year 1996 more than $1 billion U.S. in U.S. ships were 
exported and delivered courtesy of Title 11 guarantees.  It is 
worth noting that there has not been a default under this 
program.  There has been no cost to the U.S. government since it 
was established in 1936. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A second initiative which the shipbuilding stakeholders support 
involves revisions to Revenue Canada leasing regulations.  Leased 
financing has become a predominant method of financing 
significant capital items.  The current regulations make the 
ownership of leased financing of a Canadian ship uneconomical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Accelerated depreciation was the backbone of the shipbuilding 
industry only a few years ago and resulted in many ships being 
built.  The industry is imploring the government to visit this 
initiative immediately.  There is no reason the government cannot 
take that step right away.  It is not precedent setting and it 
would make a significant difference in additional activity and 
reduce social costs to the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Major items of capital equipment are already exempt from 
existing Revenue Canada leasing regulations, such as computers, 
rail cars, trucks and others.

<A HREF="#LINKT46"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The industry also wants to see the one-sided aspects of NAFTA 
eliminated.  The American 1920 Jones Act legislates that cargo 
carried between American ports must be carried aboard American 
ships that are American built, registered, owned, crewed, 
repaired and serviced exclusively by American firms.  Otherwise 
they are open to free trade.  This legislation was exempted from 
the FTA and from NAFTA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian shipbuilders do not have access to the American market 
which is our natural market, yet American shipbuilders have the 
right to sell to the Canadian market duty free.  This unfair and 
imbalanced version of free trade puts Canadian shipbuilders at a 
severe disadvantage.  The chances of reaching a quick resolution 
with the Americans are slim because protectionism has pervaded 
U.S. shipbuilding policy since 1920, as we found out in FTA and 
in NAFTA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However it is possible for us to revisit the Jones Act using a 
strategic piecemeal approach.  We need to push for bilateral 
agreements on certain types of ships and vessels.  I think all 
members would agree that some form of market penetration is 
better than none. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently U.S. grain exporters are unhappy with the Jones Act as 
they perceive the legislation to be an infinite tariff that has 
reduced competition and driven up shipping costs.  This 
represents an American chink in the Jones Act armour which may 
enable better dialogue on possible bilateral agreements later on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When referring to the government strategy for better economic 
and industrial development in Atlantic Canada the Minister of 
Industry stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The emphasis has to be on working with community strengths and 
building on community advantages, and not on wielding a pot full 
of cash and dispensing it to people on the basis of who they know 
and who they voted for in the last election. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the Minister of Industry on this issue.  If he 
wants to work with the community strengths and the community 
advantages he need not look any further than Canada's modernized 
state of the art shipyards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have highly tooled yards and highly skilled labour.  What we 
do not have is access to markets.  Subsidies, or as the minister 
said a pot full of money, are not needed but a national policy 
that faces up to the realities of the global marketplace is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The industry has proven that it is competitive.  What it needs 
is export financing, revisions to Revenue Canada leasing 
regulations, and attempts at bilateral trade discussions to 
ensure we have access to our natural markets.  A combination of 
any one of these initiatives would create jobs and make the 
industry more viable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The development of a national shipbuilding policy has widespread 
support.  The member for Saint John has been a tireless supporter 
of the shipbuilding industry since she has become a member of 
Parliament and during 20 years in municipal politics as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the first ministers meeting in July the premiers recognized 
the challenges currently faced by Canadian shipbuilders in their 
efforts to become internationally competitive.  They recognized 
the need for a national shipbuilding policy.  The industry and 
the ship owners association are calling for a national policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current finance minister stated in 1988 as owner of Canada 
Steamship Lines why he had to have ships built in Brazil: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I fought hard to have the ships built in Canada but was unable to 
convince the government of the need to have an aggressive 
shipbuilding policy.  If we are not going to do that we will 
never be a factor in commercial shipping. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>All these folks are not wrong.  Simply put, we need to develop a 
modern policy to give Canada access to international markets. 
While I am pleased that constructive debate is taking place, I 
believe it is a great injustice that we are not able to vote on 
this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore I would like to seek unanimous consent of the House to 
make Motion No. 214 a votable motion.  This is a national policy 
that benefits shipyards in Vancouver on the western coast, inland 
shipyards whether in Quebec or Ontario, and in Atlantic Canada as 
well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a national policy.  All we are imploring the government 
to do is to begin dialogue.  Everybody wants a national 
shipbuilding strategy: the ship owners, the workers, the premiers 
and I believe members of Parliament. 
<P><A NAME="LINK221"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</b>  Mr. Speaker, this is a motion respecting the 
shipbuilding industry in Canada. 
The shipbuilding industry has a long and rich tradition in the 
country.  It continues to play a key role in many coastal and 
port communities, from major yards in Saint John, New Brunswick, 
to Levis, Quebec, to smaller ones dotted across the country in 
Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, P.E.I., Newfoundland 
and British Columbia. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1820"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT48"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT48"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1820

<A HREF="#LINKT47"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As has been stated earlier, overall the major shipyards employ 
about 4,000 workers.  They are highly skilled, well paying jobs. 
The smaller yards and facilities employ many other workers. All 
these people can take great pride in the work they do and the 
contribution they make. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The shipbuilding industry is a small but important component of 
Canada's overall marine industry, making a significant 
contribution to Canada's economic growth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Shipbuilding is one of only a few industry to benefit from 
comprehensive government initiatives.  Essentially there are 
three elements to the policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, we made a commitment to use Canadian shipbuilders for the 
renewal, repair and overhaul of government fleets.  We will 
continue our policy of domestic procurement on all federal ships 
and repairs where it is possible to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, we have a 25% tariff on all non-NAFTA foreign built 
ships over 100 tonnes entering Canadian waters, with the 
exception of fishing vessels over 100 feet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, between 1986 and 1993 we spent $198 million on an 
industry led rationalization process.  The industry decided that 
it was necessary to reduce its capacity so that the remaining 
shipyards could survive and stay competitive.  Therefore the 
structure of the Canadian shipbuilding industry has changed 
dramatically since 1986 due to this rationalization.  Certainly 
in the last five years there has been no real change in the 
domestic international market situation to support reversing the 
approach of the current government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the Government of Canada has several other key 
initiatives to support this sector.  There are tax measures 
available to ship owners in the form of accelerated capital cost 
allowance on new ships built in Canada.  Shipbuilders are also 
encouraged to keep pace with new technology through the research 
and development tax credit system.  Through government 
institutions there is financing available to this sector like any 
other sector for commercially viable projects.  For example, the 
Export Development Corporation can provide financing for export 
sales of Canadian products including ships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We recognize that the international playing field is not level. 
First, major distortions in the marketplace result from massive 
subsidies from foreign governments to their shipping industries. 
To defend our domestic industry we will continue our efforts to 
eliminate foreign subsidies through the OECD.  At the same time 
the European community is looking at eliminating its country's 
subsidies by the year 2000.  Things are slowly changing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, let me address the U.S. situation and the Jones Act. 
Under the legislation only vessels built in the United States and 
operating under the U.S. flag can engage in U.S. domestic trade. 
This prohibits building or rebuilding any vessels for the U.S. 
coasting trade in non-U.S. shipyards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the member for Fundy—Royal that he was not a member of 
the House at the time the previous government led by his party 
negotiated the free trade agreement and did not work out any 
details to change this awful protectionist system under the Jones 
Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However there are opportunities for Canadian yards to capture 
some of the U.S. ship repair markets which will become more 
accessible as the standard U.S. 50% tariff on repairs continues 
to decrease over time and will be eliminated in 1998 under NAFTA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is still important to continue our efforts to encourage the 
U.S. government to update an archaic 77 year old Jones Act in 
line with NAFTA and WTO principles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the majority of U.S. legislators are supporters, a growing 
number of legislators as well as other organizations such as 
citizen tax groups are attacking the act on the grounds that it 
is effectively a subsidy paid by the consumer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1996 the International Trade Commission estimated the Jones 
Act raises the price of water borne transportation by 26%. 
The extra costs get passed along to consumers in higher prices. 
This constitutes a hidden Jones Act tax of between $3.8 billion 
and $10 billion a year.  There is a result of subsidies.

</I></B></P><P align=left>A U.S. senator has recently introduced the legislation to allow 
foreign flagships to operate between two U.S. ports, if the 
operator or charter of the ship is a U.S. citizen or is eligible 
to engage in business in the U.S., and if the operator operates 
regularly scheduled freight service in the ocean trades including 
the Great Lakes.  This is a very slight improvement but still not 
good enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However all parties in the U.S. are acknowledging this is a long 
term issue with no immediate solution.  That is what they say 
every year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is little doubt the Canadian shipbuilding industry has 
faced some hard times in recent years.  However recent 
developments might help to stimulate new business in Canada for 
shipbuilding and marine construction.  They include the need to 
revitalize the aging Great Lakes shipping fleet and the 
development of high speed ferry services in offshore oil and gas 
developments such as Hibernia, Terra Nova and Sable Island. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly new opportunities are out there.  There is evidence 
that the international shipbuilding industry has come out its 
global recession.  The deep sea shipping fleet is aging and needs 
replacement.  Double hauling will soon be mandatory for ships 
entering U.S. ports, requiring modifications to newer ships and 
possibly the replacement of older ones.  Each of these 
developments may provide some opportunities to Canadian shipyards 
in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must be prepared to compete in the global marketplace.  To 
become globally competitive Canadian shipyards must aggressively 
continue to adopt modern technology.  Acquiring the latest 
technology in shipbuilding will help reduce production costs, 
increase productivity and reduce labour.  A lot of work has been 
done but a lot more has to be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Around the world Canadian shipyards have earned a sterling 
reputation in specialized markets such as coastal ferry systems, 
icebreakers and self-unloading bulk carriers.  Canada enjoys a 
significant technological advantage and market edge because of 
its experience in the construction of these specialized vessels. 
Many new opportunities are looming on the horizon for 
shipbuilding and the refit and repair industries in Canada. There 
is much work to be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although I cannot support the motion as submitted by the member 
for Fundy—Royal, I congratulate him on his preparedness and his 
desire to continue to work on behalf of the Canadian shipbuilding 
industry.  I hope we can continue to do so in the months and 
years ahead. 
<P><A NAME="LINK222"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):</b>  Mr. Speaker, I too 
congratulate and commend the motion presented to the House, the 
depth of the research that has been done and the understanding of 
the industry.  I also commend the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Industry for his light on the subject. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The intent of the motion is probably one we could all support. 
There ought to be a sound industrial policy not only with regard 
to shipbuilding but with regard to all industrial development in 
Canada.  That is what is lacking in the government currently in 
charge of the affairs of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot help but to refer back to a particular response the 
Ministry of Industry made as recently as yesterday.  It is no 
wonder people are confused, particularly the hon. member who 
proposed the motion.  The Minister of Industry in reply to a 
question by the member for Halifax West said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If he is asking me to announce that Canada will get into a 
subsidy bidding war in shipbuilding, the answer to him as it was 
for the member for Saint John last week is absolutely no. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The interesting contrast is that the same Minister of Industry 
is quite prepared to enter into a subsidy bidding war when it 
comes to the aerospace industry.  How is it that the same 
minister will unequivocally say “absolutely no” to the 
subsidization of the bidding war with regard to shipbuilding but 
it is absolutely okay when it comes to the aerospace industry?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the same minister who does this.  The unfortunate part 
of it is that is not unusual.  It so happens that this is a 
Liberal government right now.  There was a PC government before 
it which did exactly the same thing.  It also subsidized the one 
but not the other.  So there is nothing new here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What this motion does is allow us to articulate 
rather clearly that while there is nothing new, the PCs did the 
same thing as the Liberals, Liberals do the same thing as the 
PCs, now they are saying the government needs to have policy. 
That is right.  It does need to have a policy but so do the PCs 
because they do not have one either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is just one of those crazy back and forths.  One would 
think it was a ping-pong game we were involved in here.  The 
unfortunate part of it is that the people who are suffering in 
this are those working in the shipyards, the families involved, 
the lack of work for these people.  That is where the problem 
lies for not having a good policy come to the floor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to read this motion.  The motion is a very 
interesting study in semantics.  It reads something like this. 
They want the policy to focus: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—on making shipyards internationally competitive by providing 
tax incentives and construction financing comparable to what is 
being provided elsewhere in the world and which ensures 
reasonable access to foreign markets, particularly the United 
States of America; and should recognize that such a policy would 
not provide direct subsidies, but create alternative methods of 
support to ensure the growth of the industry. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What other alternate forms of support would their be than 
subsidies, maybe not direct but certainly indirect? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member said that there are all these other programs. 
Indeed there are.  In fact, there is the foreign investment 
opportunity company and all kinds of other programs that exist 
which do allow countries that want to buy these ships to get 
financing from the Canadian government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing new here.  What there is, and I commend the 
member for this, is to articulate very clearly what the problem 
is in certain parts of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I happened to be at the vision conference in Moncton, New 
Brunswick and I was particularly impressed by the tenure and 
discussion that took place at that conference.  There were 
premiers and business leaders from the Atlantic provinces who all 
had one theme at this vision conference, a vision for the 
Atlantic provinces.  It was led by the premier of New Brunswick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today this gentleman has retired from his position but he said 
to the assembled group “we want the federal government to get 
out of the subsidy business, get out of the grant business and 
give us that money in the form of tax breaks or reduced taxes”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party has talked about this for the last eight years. 
We know that is the answer.  The answer does not lie in subsidies 
or grants.  Grants and subsidies create dependency and operations 
that are now competitive, operations that do not search out 
markets, that do not have the incentive to apply the most recent 
technology, the most efficient ways of applying that technology 
and the most efficient deployment of personnel and people who are 
skilled. That is what is wrong with subsidies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has to happen here is that the environment needs to change. 
We said limit things like ACOA and grants and subsidies and then 
these industries could become indeed competitive, search out the 
markets and do the kinds of things that really matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From that point of view I support the motion but unfortunately 
that is not what it states.  It states one thing and I am not so 
sure that it totally explores it the way it should. Perhaps the 
motion could be reworded in such a way so that we could fully 
support it and be enthusiastic about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The specific questions with regard to the shipbuilding industry 
really could be summed up in two questions.  First, is the 
shipbuilding industry in trouble because it did not remain 
competitive?   Second, is it in trouble because there is not 
enough of a market or the market is not large enough to sustain 
another international global shipbuilder? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1835"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT50"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are two absolutely critical questions.  They lie at the 
very base of a Canadian shipbuilding policy.  What ought it to 
be?  I think the hon. member will agree that those are the key 
questions.  I do not have the answers to those questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suspect that the Canadian Shipbuilding Association does not 
have an answer to that question either, but I think it needs to 
address those two questions and then come to wherever the policy 
ought to change so that indeed the competitiveness of the 
marketplace can be established as far as the shipbuilding 
industry is concerned and the size of the market identified as to 
whether the capacity for building ships ought to be expanded. I 
think that is a major issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. parliamentary secretary indicated that there was a 
rationalization of the shipbuilding industry.  Part of it was to 
reduce the number of ships, and that is fine.  However, what we 
now need to do is not only rationalize in terms of the numbers of 
ships that are to be built, but the kinds of ships that ought to 
be built and the technology that exists in those ships so that 
they can become competitive in the international marketplace and 
that they will then build the kind of profit picture into the 
people who own those shipbuilding yards so that they can hire 
people and give them work so that they can supply their families 
and friends with the things they need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder as well whether we should not become very serious about 
this whole business of how industry ought to run in this country. 
What kind of an environment ought the government to create for 
this country so that business could compete? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The number one issue it seems to me is to have a level playing 
field.  We do not have a level playing field in Canada.  It is 
anything but level when the government interferes in the 
marketplace with agencies like regional economic development 
agency like ACOA, western economic, FEDNOR or whatever it is. 
That creates an artificial intrusion into the marketplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the government intrudes into the marketplace in giving 
specific grants to particular industries that are not repaid, 
that create an unfair advantage to the manufacturing agents 
receiving that money over and against a group that does not. It 
also raises the question of providing certain kinds of guaranteed 
loans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand under title 11 in the United States, which is 
what I believe the member referred to, there have been no 
defaults on the money that has been granted since 1936. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The significant aspect here is that we know that in Canada there 
have been many defaults of various kinds of government repayable 
loans.  This is a double whammy on the taxpayer.  First the 
taxpayer is asked to give the grant or subsidy to a particular 
industry.  When that industry defaults, the taxpayer has to pay 
again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what is wrong with this kind of system.  We cannot 
afford to do that.  I encourage the member to go back and reword 
his motion slightly so that we could support it and recognize 
that subsidies and grants are anathemas to good business.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport—Montmorency—Orléans, BQ):</b> Mr. 
Speaker,I am pleased to speak to this motion in my capacity as the 
Bloc Quebecois transportation critic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me begin by telling my colleague for Fundy—Royal that our 
party finds his motion very interesting and is in favour of it. 
Unfortunately, that support cannot take the form of votes, because 
this motion is not votable.  The debate this evening is, however, 
highly relevent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec we have the wonderful motto “Je me souviens”, but 
sometimes unfortunately we do not use our memory effectively.  I 
will explain with an anecdote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the 1993 election campaign, I had the opportunity to 
represent my party in a debate on Radio-Canada, participated in by 
Jean Pelletier, the executive assistant of the current Prime 
Minister, and the ineffable or unspeakable Pierre Blais, erstwhile 
Minister of Justice in the Conservative government, a man very 
taken with his own importance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You will not be surprised to hear that, since this debate was 
held in the greater Quebec City area and was apparently broadcast 
as far away as the Magdalen Islands and the Portneuf region, the 
question of the survival of MIL Davie Shipbuilding at Lauzon was 
raised. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1840"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT52"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT52"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1840

<A HREF="#LINKT51"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Remember, this was 1993.  I recall very clearly that Pierre 
Blais, a Conservative minister, and therefore in the same party as 
the member moving this motion, said to me  “For the nine years that 
the Conservative Party has been in office, it has given contracts 
to MIL Davie”.  I asked him how much they had given and his answer 
was $1.2 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I told Pierre Blais, the Conservative minister at the time, 
that, while the Conservatives had given $1.2 billion to MIL Davie, 
they had given $11 billion in contracts to shipyards in the 
maritimes.  This shows that, Liberal or Conservative, it makes no 
difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Naturally, we agree that the government should provide tax 
incentives to revitalize shipyards, but I would remind all our 
listeners—and I am sure they include former employees of Canadian 
Vickers in Montreal, Marine Industries in Sorel and present 
employees of MIL Davie in Lauzon—that no more than 12 or 15 years 
ago, Quebec had three major shipyards.  They were responsible for 
50% of the shipbuilding in Canada, and the only province that has 
rationalized its shipyards is Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian Vickers was shut down; Marine Industries in Sorel 
also shut down, leaving only Mil Davie.  Meanwhile, the 
Conservatives encouraged the founding of shipyards in the 
maritimes.  The people at MIL Davie in Lauzon did their bit.  They 
rationalized. 
Recently, when this shipyard was sold, when the present Government 
of Quebec encouraged a private promoter to take it over, the men 
and women of MIL Davie scrapped their collective agreement and 
showed their complete flexibility in order to create a climate 
conducive to building.  All that remains is to deliver. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to tell you that the management of MIL Davie or Les 
Industries Davie, as it is now called, has shown leadership.  Last 
August 30, the Port of Quebec received the world's second largest 
drilling platform, the </I>Spirit of Columbus<I>, which will be repaired 
in the port by people from Les Industries Davie, providing 
employment for 400.  Les Industries Davie has shown that it can 
land international contracts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am concerned about, however, is having certain tax 
incentives to encourage our Canadian shipowners to build ships here 
and repair them here, in Quebec and in Canada.  It is on this point 
that I agree completely with the motion moved by my colleague, the 
member for Fundy—Royal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would remind members that, during the term of office running 
from 1993 to 1997, the Conservatives, with a leader and one member, 
were not very visible in the House of Commons.  But I will tell the 
member for Fundy—Royal that the Standing Committee on Transport, 
of which I was then a member, tabled a report in May 1995 that was 
essentially the precursor of Bill C-9 now before us.  This report 
led to Bill C-44, which, as we know, died on the Order Paper, in 
the Senate.  That is why we are debating Bill C-9 again today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Standing Committee on Transport had tabled a report 
entitled “A National Marine Strategy”.  This report included a 
recommendation, Recommendation No. 22, which I think is relevant. 
The report gives an indication of the Liberal government's 
willingness to go in this direction. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1845"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT52"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what the Liberals promised in 1995.  Recommendation 22 
provided: “In order to ensure the long-term viability of the 
Seaway, the federal government—this is the Liberal majority 
speaking in committee—should give serious consideration to the 
development of an incentive program to stimulate new construction 
and refitting of Canadian and foreign flag Seaway-size ships based 
on the essential condition that the work is done in Canadian 
shipyards”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the Bloc Quebecois prepared, with my colleague, a 
minority report containing, if memory serves, 26 or 27 
recommendations.  There were some recommendations we certainly 
could not live with.  That is why we tabled a minority report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what the dissenting report of the Bloc Quebecois said 
with respect to Recommendation 22: “The Bloc Quebecois members on 
the Committee are pleased to note that the majority of members 
agreed with this proposed recommendation—that was our position. 
They fervently hope that the minister will consider it as it is 
vitally important to the future of the St. Lawrence Seaway and to 
shipyards in Quebec and in Canada”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, bouquets aside, it is very important to note the Bloc's 
concern.  What we would like and what we want from the Liberal 
government is for it to behave like Bernard Landry, the Quebec 
minister of finance, in its next budget. 
Minister Landry was congratulated by the shipbuilding industry on 
the measures in his May 9, 1996 budget to encourage the building 
and repair of ships here, in Quebec particularly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget included four points that are of interest: a new 
tax credit for builders; financial guarantees that would be given 
through the SDI; a reduction in the capital tax on the acquisition 
of ships; and, finally, a tax holiday for Quebec's sailors.  These, 
I think, are measures that encourage shipbuilding in Quebec and in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The present Minister of Finance would do well, because we know 
his links with Canada Steamship Lines, to propose these sorts of 
incentives. 
We are trying to fight a war with water pistols, because we know 
that owners turn to other countries that have incredible tax 
benefits to build their ships, and we are unable to compete.  That 
concludes my remarks.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Eastern Shore, NDP):</b>  Mr. 
Speaker, I rise to speak in favour of the motion brought forward 
by the hon. member for Fundy—Royal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague, the member for Halifax West, stated yesterday 
in the House, we in this party believe that Canada is in 
desperate need of a national shipbuilding policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Shipbuilding has a vital place in the economy of this nation, in 
its heritage and, more importantly, in the lives of numerous 
coastal communities.  To let it wither on the vine would be a 
wanton act of industrial sabotage that would haunt the present 
government for generations to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada was once a key player in the global shipbuilding 
industry.  As a major coastal nation and a central partner in the 
Allied military effort during the second world war, Canada 
entered the post-war years with a robust and healthy shipbuilding 
sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, after decades of short-sighted Liberal and Conservative 
stewardship, the industry is on its knees.  The industry which 
once was a vital part of our industrial base is now barely 
afloat.  We have reached the stage where we can barely meet our 
own modest shipbuilding needs, let alone aspire to become a major 
provider to the global market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More sadly, the tragic lack of foresight and innovation 
exhibited by successive Liberal and Conservative governments have 
condemned thousands of highly skilled workers to unemployment or 
idleness.  Since the beginning of this decade alone, the 
workforce in this sector has fallen from 12,000 to less than 
5,000 hourly and salaried workers in 1996. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a shameful performance. 
It is especially so when we reflect on the fact that these same 
workers have made tremendous strides in improving their value 
added and productivity per worker, increasing it by almost 
one-quarter between 1986 and 1993.  Alas, no such vision or 
dynamism has been apparent in the approach taken by the 
government to the future of this strategic sector.  Apathy, 
resignation and ineptitude have been the hallmarks of its 
approach.

<A HREF="#LINKT53"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government approach has had devastating consequences.  Total 
sales of the Canadian shipbuilding sector have declined by about 
one-half since 1991, from $1.5 billion to less than $800 million 
in 1996.  The decline in the value added of of the shipbuilding 
industry to the Canadian GDP has been even more dramatic, falling 
from $450 million in 1990 to less than $200 million today.  While 
other countries continue to make the necessary investment in 
upgrading their shipbuilding yards and technology, with some 
exceptions Canada has continued to rely on outdated capital 
equipment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most forecasts suggest that the demand for new ships and marine 
technology will grow rapidly in the coming years.  The need to 
modernize our Great Lakes fleet, the requirement for high speed 
ferry and commuter services, developments in the offshore oil and 
gas sector all point to a renewed demand for ships.  However, 
every indication at present is that Canada is in no position to 
meet this renewed domestic demand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are ill-equipped to meet domestic demand, our preparedness 
to meet global demand is even weaker still.  As world trade 
grows, demand for new, economically efficient ships to replace an 
aging world fleet will be strong.  Close to one-third of the 
world fleet is more than 20 years old.  In sectors such as oil 
tankers this figure is much higher.  There is also demand for new 
cruise ships from the expanding leisure industry. Opportunities 
for economic growth in jobs in the coastal shipbuilding yards 
abound, yet the minister sticks to his banal and naive view that 
he will not be dragged into a subsidies bidding war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can assure the minister that while he clings to these 
doctrinal absurdities, other nations are busily preparing 
themselves to meet the renewed demand.  The U.S. with its Jones 
Act ensures that cargo carried between U.S. ports is carried 
aboard U.S. ships that are U.S. built, U.S. registered, U.S. 
owned, U.S. crewed and repaired and serviced by U.S. firms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>European nations use innovative tax credits, competitive bank 
financing, share purchases and tax shelter programs to encourage 
investment in shipbuilding.  In Germany, for instance, 
individuals or corporations who invest in ship shares receive 
total deductions equal to 100% of the total investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The do nothing approach taken by this government to date is no 
longer acceptable.  Canada must show some audacity and seek to 
develop new markets for our industry in niche areas such as 
ferries, icebreakers or specialized cargo ships.  Canada must get 
out of the business of subsidizing foreign shipbuilders, many of 
whom utilize cheap labour and fail to comply with fair social and 
environmental standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the completion of the frigate building process and the 
refurbishment of Tribal class destroyers, Canada's shipbuilding 
industry has been waiting in vain for direction from Ottawa. Hard 
pressed coastal regions are looking to Ottawa to abandon its 
dismal hands off policy which has been so fatal to the industry. 
As it is increasingly obvious that neither the minister nor his 
senior officials have any idea how they might begin to 
re-invigorate the industry, let me suggest some basic life 
support measures which would benefit the industry over the medium 
to longer term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, let us rid ourselves of the short-sighted and damaging 
notion that private market forces alone should determine the 
future development of this important industry.  While we do not 
endorse an escalating subsidy war, it is time to recognize that 
governments have a role to play in managing a fair allocation of 
shipbuilding production between competing countries.  A managed 
trade approach, akin to the auto pact, would ensure that the 
Canadian shipbuilding industry would receive an overall volume of 
new orders consistent with our own shipbuilding requirements. 
This would amount to the extension of the U.S. Jones Act 
principle to international shipping and would ensure that each 
major seagoing nation would achieve a certain target level of 
shipbuilding activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the government should lobby for the inclusion in any 
future international agreement regulating shipbuilding of a 
social clause.  The problem in the past was that the term subsidy 
had been defined too narrowly.  In many countries anti-union 
laws, low wages and non-existent health and safety laws amount to 
a subsidy to private shipbuilders.  In these cases a subsidy is 
paid by the workers through lower wages or less safe working 
conditions rather than explicitly by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We recommend that future international agreements in relation to 
subsidies take a broader view and include a social clause 
requiring participating countries to respect basic social,

</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, we must recognize and co-ordinate the close links that 
exist between the regulation of the shipping industry and 
government efforts to support the shipbuilding industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past, shippers have been given too much discretion to 
select companies on the basis of price alone. The result has been 
that considerations relating to Canadian content, basic health 
and safety and environmental concerns have been neglected.  In 
many cases the trade in Canada has become dominated by foreign 
flag vessels, flying flags of convenience from low tax 
jurisdictions such as Panama. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, it is alleged by observers of the industry that Canada 
Steamship Lines, a company owned by the finance minister, has 
made use of these tax evading measures in the past.  We believe 
that to be simply scandalous.  It is time for Canada to implement 
a Jones like act that would require minimum levels of Canadian 
content in shipping activities.  Furthermore, it is time that we 
insisted that ships traversing Canada's inland waterways be 
Canadian built and Canadian flagged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, Canada has long been relying on its production and 
export of natural resources. We now recognize that greater value 
must be added to these raw, unprocessed resources here in Canada. 
It follows that Canada should be more involved in constructing, 
maintaining and operating the vessels that carry our natural 
resources to their destination markets. Canada is a great trading 
nation and it makes obvious sense that we have shipping and 
shipbuilding industries that reflect our stature as one of the 
top ten exporting nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, it is time the government paid greater attention to 
maintaining appropriate levels of investment in our coastal 
infrastructure.  Liberal cutbacks to lighthouses, coast guard 
search and rescue services, port upkeep and other maritime 
services have been highly detrimental to the safety, security and 
efficiency of our maritime communities.  New public investment is 
needed by the coast guard and would generate additional work for 
Canadian shipyards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I would like to state that we reject the view 
that the key decisions affecting the shipbuilding industries 
should be left to private shipbuilders and the private shipping 
companies.  It is time for the government to embrace the public 
interest in promoting a vibrant, domestic shipbuilding sector. 
Shipbuilding workers, coastal communities and Canada's status as 
a major maritime nation are too important to be left to the 
vagaries of the marketplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To my colleague for Fundy—Royal, I too endorse your request 
that this important motion be a votable one.  I will do what I 
can to support the motion.  I beg your indulgence, Mr. Speaker, 
to look into that aspect. 
<P><A NAME="LINK225"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</b> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to be able to participate tonight in the debate on the 
motion of my colleague for Fundy—Royal which urges the 
government to develop a national shipbuilding policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard the hon. member from the government talking about money 
that has been invested in shipyards.  The shipyard at Saint John 
is the most modern shipyard in the whole of Canada and perhaps, 
in the world.  That is because of what the Liberals and the 
Conservatives have done in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The investment is there but now the shipyard cannot compete. 
There is no work and it is sitting idle.  The private industry 
people who own the shipyard are very frustrated and are saying 
that changes have to be made.  They have spoken with a number of 
members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I rose in the House this past week and asked the Minister of 
Industry if he was going to look at a shipbuilding policy to put 
our people back to work.  His statement was that the government 
is not in the subsidy business. I want to make it clear that we 
are not advocating subsidies at all.  We are seeking the 
simplification of regulations to enhance the industry's export 
capabilities. That does not mean subsidies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two specific areas where the industry can be helped to 
be more competitive: improvements to export financing and loan 
guarantees and the exclusion of newly Canadian constructed ships 
from the present Revenue Canada leasing regulations.  For the 
life of me I cannot understand why the government would not look 
favourably on that.  It is done for rail cars, for vans, trucks 
and computers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over 10,000 people in the country would be put back to work. 
The Liberals can become heroes.  When they do it, we will stand 
up and applaud. Those trained people are being told to go to 
Calgary, Alberta and look for work, or go to Texas and look for 
work.  And what happens then?  The families come to us saying 
“Daddy is gone. Daddy is not coming back.”

opportunity to do that.   We have an opportunity to make use of 
the tremendous investments that have been put into Canada in all 
our shipyards.  So we are saying to them please, please.  We are 
not saying subsidies, no.  I understand the Minister of Industry 
has heard form the private sector this week to clarify that when 
that was his answer to my question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lease financing has become a predominant method of financing 
significant capital items.  However, the regulations as presently 
stipulated make ownership and lease financing of a Canadian 
constructed vessel very unattractive if not uneconomical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am saying tonight that we can all work together on this.  This 
must be a votable item.  Like my hon. colleague from 
Fundy—Royal, I would like to seek unanimous consent to declare 
this motion votable.

<P><A NAME="LINK228"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</b>  Mr. 
Speaker, my comments today flow from my question to the Minister 
of Health on October 3 pertaining to the influence of 
multinationals over this government's drug policies and drug 
pricing policies. Perhaps the fact that we are discussing this 
issue on the same day that the Minister of Health publicly caved 
in to the tobacco industry says it all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a very disturbing pattern taking place with respect to 
Liberal style government and Liberal legislative priorities. The 
influence of multinational corporations over policy development 
and decision making is apparent in every area and pervasive 
throughout this government.  On every turn the public's interests 
have been subsumed by commercial interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whatever happened to the idea of government as an instrument of 
the people, as a truly democratic institution reflecting the 
collective interests of society, the institution protecting the 
common good?  It is increasingly apparent that this government is 
beholden absolutely to the big corporations, the bankers, the 
stockbrokers and the bondholders in the global community today, 
that it is no longer able to distinguish between the public 
interest and the commercial interest.  Nowhere is this more 
apparent than when it comes to drug policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think anyone can dispute the fact that this government 
is absolutely controlled by the big brand name drug companies. 
Let me refer to the evidence, the complete flip-flop by the 
Liberals on Bill C-91 legislation to extend patent protection to 
20 years for multinational drug companies.  When in opposition 
Liberals stood up and talked about government siding with 
multinationals on drug policy.  What did they do when they became 
government? They simply carried on with Bill C-91. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That brings me to my second concern.  What did they do when the 
standing committee reviewed this issue last year?  What happened 
to the draft report of that committee? 
Why was it watered down so that all meaningful recommendations 
were eliminated?

<A HREF="#LINKT56"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, let us mention the elimination of the drug research lab, 
the one independent bureau we have in this country for research 
into drugs. This government eliminated it and put the 
responsibility into the hands of the drug companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me also point to the refusal of this government to ensure 
that the work of the Patented Medicine Prices Review Board is 
open and transparent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, let me refer to the backing away by this government 
from a promise made as recently as the last election for a 
national drug plan.  In that campaign the Liberals promised to 
look at a publicly funded, universally administered single payer 
drug plan, provided nationally. What did we get in the Speech 
from the Throne and what have we heard from the minister and this 
government since then?  They are looking into the feasibility of 
studying the possibility of better access to medically necessary 
drugs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question today is why has this government changed its mind so 
quickly on such an important program to Canadians.  Is it so much 
influenced by the big brand name companies and by the money that 
those companies provide the Liberal coffers that it cannot put in 
place good public policy? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why has this government not taken seriously the concerns we 
raised in the House on October 3 about an obvious and apparent 
conflict of interest with employees from its own Patented 
Medicine Prices Review Board— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</b> The hon. 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Health. 
<P><A NAME="LINK229"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</b>  Mr. Speaker, this is a great place because you 
can get rhetoric and fiction or you can listen to parliamentary 
secretaries and get fact and reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to have the opportunity to give this House the 
government's plans with respect to a national approach to 
pharmacare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the recommendations of the national forum on health was 
the expansion of medicare to include other medically necessary 
services such as home care and drugs.  The federal government 
intends to pursue the examination of these future directions 
recommended by the national forum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On drugs, for example, we will develop a national plan, a 
timetable and a fiscal framework for providing Canadians with 
better access to medically necessary drugs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On pharmacare, the federal government recognizes that as a 
country we can do better with how we deal with prescription drugs 
in the health care system and with respect to the coverage that 
is provided; in other words, with compliance and prescription. We 
can do better with respect to integrating our health care system 
and in allocating resources among drug therapy, hospital therapy 
and medical care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Drugs have become a medically necessary component of health care 
and it is time for us to start talking about how we are going to 
ensure that all Canadians have access to this care. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the dialogue has just begun.  The federal government has 
no ready made national pharmacare scheme secretly prepared in 
Ottawa.  Canada's health care system is a partnership.  The federal 
government is counting on working fully with the provinces and the 
territories to explore the possibility of pharmacare. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As part of the new health transition fund, $150 million over 
three years announced in the last budget, the Minister of Health 
will be co-hosting a national conference on pharmacare with the 
minister of health for Saskatchewan. This will be an important 
step in our discussions on a national approach to pharmacare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government wants to do what it can to promote 
optimal drug therapy for all Canadians and a national approach to 
pharmacare will make a significant contribution.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>PUBLIC WORKS 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK231"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique—Mactaquac, PC):</b>  Mr. Speaker, 
on October 7 the auditor general released a report chronicling 
serious deficiencies in the internal controls regulating the use 
of government credit cards, also known as acquisition cards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1992 the use of acquisition cards has grown from 2,000 to 
over 20,000 this past year, representing $172 million in 
purchases in 1996 alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The idea behind the use of acquisition cards is sound. They 
reduce the need of individual departments and public works to 
process numerous cheques and purchase orders for small purchases 
and thus save the government badly needed dollars. I believe any 
idea that can save taxpayer money is definitely worth looking 
into. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem with these cards, however, arises with the 
implementation and administration of a proper control system and, 
as documented so clearly the auditor general earlier this month, 
the government has been at best sloppy, at worse apathetic, in 
implementing such a system. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1910"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT58"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT58"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1910

<A HREF="#LINKT57"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, in his report the auditor general noted that credit 
cards are not issued based on need and that the the credit limits 
on cards seldom reflect the use of the cards.  People who do not 
need cards are getting them and people who should have cards are 
not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further, employees do not accept responsibility for cards and 
are not required to follow regulations.  Employees are not 
properly instructed on the use of acquisition cards.  When an 
employee leaves, cards are not properly cancelled.  Even more 
alarming is that government organizations do not monitor and 
follow up card accounts that are inactive or that are suddenly 
used after lying dormant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Organizations do not monitor, verify or audit their employees' 
purchases even though Treasury Board requires them to do so. 
Often an employee can certify the payment of their own account 
without management double checking to ensure that all purchases 
are valid ones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general also observed that cards were being used to 
make unauthorized purchases.  In many cases it was difficult to 
tell if the card was actually being used by the employee to whom 
it was registered or used by some other unauthorized person. 
There was even evidence that items had been purchased on 
government cards that were for non-government use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report went on to condemn the fact that quite often 
departments do not know how many credit cards under their control 
have been lost or stolen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally to add insult to injury, during three months last year 
the government was so shabby with its record keeping that it 
racked up late payment charges of almost $80,000 because the 
government could not pay its credit card bills on time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I own a small convenience store in Tilley, New Brunswick.  I can 
say without prejudice that if I ran my store the way this 
government goes about its business without proper control over 
expenditures, I would certainly have been out of business years 
ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week the minister stated that he felt there was not a 
problem yet and that eventually the government would get around 
to fixing it.  If you have a leaky roof, is it good enough to say 
that since it is not raining you do not have a problem? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me ask the minister once again.  What steps is he prepared 
to take to stop this reckless use of acquisition cards and 
thereby save taxpayers from having to foot the bill for the 
government's carelessness on this matter? 
<P><A NAME="LINK232"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Parliamentary Secretary to President of 
the Treasury Board, Lib.):</b>  Mr. Speaker, the government 
welcomed the report of the auditor general on this issue.  We 
were pleased that no significant amount of damage or loss was 
found at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The acquisition card program was implemented in 1991 in an 
effort to introduce greater efficiency in the way the government 
procures small value goods and services such as office supplies. 
Since the beginning, regular monitoring activities have been 
introduced by the Treasury Board Secretariat.  As well, clear 
policy guidelines on the do's and don'ts of using such cards have 
been provided to departments and employees and are updated 
regularly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our times of restraint, departments are identifying better 
ways of operating.  The acquisition card program has proven to be 
a very cost-effective method of procuring and paying for goods 
and services.  In fact since its inception we have had a savings 
of some $6.5 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general's report will help us in focusing on further 
improvements to the policy guidelines.  In the coming months the 
Treasury Board Secretariat will publish new guidelines designed 
to address the concerns of the auditor general and to provide 
departments and employees with comprehensive information and 
guidance on the use of the acquisition cards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, further to a competitive processes, new contracts 
will be awarded for acquisition cards.  These new contracts, 
effective January 1, 1998, will provide departments with 
electronic tools to better control the use of the cards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government intends to monitor closely the acquisition card 
program to prevent any abuse or losses.  The government also 
intends to continue to use the method of procurement and payment 
which has proven to be both efficient and cost-effective for the 
citizens of Canada.
