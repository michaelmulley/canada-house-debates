Larry Bagnell (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Natural Resources, Lib.): </b>Mr. Speaker, thank you for the opportunity to introduce at third reading Bill C-39, which provides for $41 billion in new funding for provinces and territories under the ten year plan to strengthen health care.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians are justly proud of their social programs and are determined to see them maintained and improved. In particular, Canada's publicly funded, universal health care system stands as a clear testament to its commitment to ensuring equality of opportunity for all Canadians.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government of Canada recognizes the importance of providing growing and predictable funding for Canada's health care system to ensure its vitality.  It also recognizes the importance of improving transparency and accountability of health care spending.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all, Canadians want to know that their tax dollars are being spent wisely.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, the government is committed to strengthening Canada's publicly funded health care system. It is committed to working with the provinces and territories to make sure that happens. As the Prime Minister has said,  Canadians want solutions to health care problems, problems in their communities, problems that affect their families. Canadians also want to know that the health care system will be able to provide the services they need in a timely fashion. They also  want to know that the health care system is secure for future generations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Governments  recognize  the need to strengthen our health care system.  We understand the challenge.  It is a challenge that falls to us  and we must act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last fall, federal, provincial and territorial governments all signed the 10 year plan to strengthen health care. Bill C-39 would implement  the federal commitment  supporting this plan by providing $41 billion in new federal funding for provinces and territories for health.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, the 10 year plan will strengthen ongoing federal health support provided through the Canada health transfer, or CHT, as well as to address wait times to ensure that Canadians have timely access to essential health services  and to provide additional funding for diagnostic and medical equipment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I outline the details of this ambitious new plan, I would like to first provide some history of recent federal health care funding in Canada.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In September 2000, hon. members will recall an agreement by first ministers for an action plan to renew our health care system. In support of that agreement, the federal government invested $23.4 billion through the Canada health and social transfer and targeted spending, including funding for medical equipment, to accelerate and broaden health renewal and reform.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drawing on that agreement, first ministers met again in February 2003, committing to the first ministers accord on health care renewal.  In response to the important reform and reporting objectives it contained, the 2003 budget increased federal support for health care by $34.8 billion over five years. It also contained an additional payment of $2 billion  contingent on funds being available in 2003-04.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January 2004, the Prime Minister announced that an  additional $2 billion would be provided to the provinces and territories. This brought the total increase in federal support over the five year period of the 2003 health accord to $36.8 billion. The majority of this funding was provided to the provinces and territories through increased transfer payments, including $16 billion over five years through the new health reform transfer; $14 billion, including the $2 billion in additional funding, for increases to health and social transfers; and $1.5 billion for diagnostic and medical equipment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining $5.3 billion was allocated to meet other commitments made under the 2003 health accord, notably increased funding for health programs for first nations and Inuit; the creation of a compassionate care benefit under employment insurance; support for research hospitals; and improved health care technology and pharmaceuticals management.</p><A NAME="T1010"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1010"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1015"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1005"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1010)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government of Canada's investments over the period covered by the health accord, and its other investments in health and social programs, were implemented as part of a long term legislated framework of predictable and growing support for provinces and territories that includes both cash and tax transfers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to move on to the 10 year plan to strengthen health care.  Last September the Prime Minister and premiers signed a 10 year plan to strengthen health care.  As I have already mentioned, the plan will provide $41 billion in new health care funding over the next decade.  It also illustrates what we are capable of achieving when the federal, provincial and territorial governments work together toward a common goal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the heart of the 10 year plan is the commitment for stable and increased funding starting with immediate funding in 2004-05, to provide an additional $1 billion in this year through the CHT as well as an additional $2 billion in 2005-06.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These investments lead me to the second step, which is the establishment of a new $19 billion base for the Canada health transfer, beginning in 2005-06.  The new and higher base level of $19 billion for the Canada health transfer includes $500 million in targeted funding for home care and catastrophic drug coverage, clear priorities for many Canadians.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plan also proposes a 6% escalator to the Canada health transfer, effective in 2006-07, which will ensure predictable and stable growth in federal transfer support, an unprecedented move to ensure predictable and stable growth in support from the federal government. This commitment fully satisfies the recommendations of the Romanow report on the future of health care in Canada.  In fact, this commitment exceeds the recommendations of that report.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just what action does the 10 year plan take to improve our health care system?  It makes investments in these areas:  reducing waiting times and improving access, which I know are big desires in my constituency; providing funding for medical and diagnostic equipment; and improving access to home care and catastrophic drug coverage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to talk in more detail about reducing waiting times.  What united all the first ministers was a commitment to a meaningful reduction in wait times for health care services.  The plan provides funding of $5.5 billion over 10 years for wait times reduction so that Canadians can see tangible progress, particularly in key areas such as cancer, heart treatment, diagnostic imaging, joint replacements and sight restoration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to mention that the government recognizes that not all provinces and territories are in the same situation regarding the implementation of their wait times reduction strategies.  Funding of $4.25 billion from the total of $5.5 billion will be provided through a third-party trust.  Therefore, as part of the 10 year plan, provinces and territories will have the flexibility to draw on the funding according to their individual priorities in meeting their wait times reduction commitments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The funding can be used according to the respective priorities of each province and territory, such as clearing backlogs, training and hiring more health care professionals, building capacity for regional centres of excellence, expanding appropriate ambulatory and community care programs, and tools to manage wait times.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beginning in 2009-10, $250 million will be provided through an annual transfer to provinces and territories in support of health care related human resources and tools to manage wait times.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I will talk about medical and diagnostic equipment, which is also very important in my riding.   No health care system would be effective without medical and diagnostic equipment to support it. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why, as an integral part of a 10 year plan, the government will provide to provinces and territories a further $500 million for diagnostic and medical equipment in 2004-05.  This funding builds on previous investments in diagnostic and medical equipment under the 2000 and 2003 health accords. It will help the provinces and territories continue to improve access to the diagnostic services their citizens need.</p><A NAME="T1015"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1015"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1020"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1010"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1015)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I want to talk briefly about home care and catastrophic drug coverage.  Access to home care and catastrophic drug coverage is a concern for Canadians.  As I mentioned earlier, the new $19 billion base level for the Canada health transfer includes an amount of $500 million, which is specifically aimed at addressing these concerns.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to mention that the first ministers were committed to improving access to home and community care services and catastrophic drug coverage. Hon. members will appreciate the importance of improving the quality of life for many Canadians and ensuring that no Canadian suffers undue financial hardship in accessing needed drug therapies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I will talk  briefly about reporting to Canadians on these expenditures. As I mentioned earlier, Canadians want to know that their tax dollars are in fact supporting tangible improvements in the health care system.  That is why Bill C-39 contains a provision for a parliamentary review of progress made in implementing the 10 year plan. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I have described is not all the funding that is available to the provinces and the territories.  In the debate about federal health funding to the provinces and territories, it is important to remember that this is not their only source of funds from the federal government. For example, equalization payments, which have been in existence since 1957, address horizontal fiscal disparities among provinces by ensuring that less prosperous provinces can provide reasonably comparable levels of public services at reasonably comparable levels of taxation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon. members will recall that last fall federal officials met with their provincial and territorial partners as part of the government's commitment to increase equalization and territorial formula funding by more than $33 billion over the next 10 years. Bill C-24, which is currently before Parliament, sets out this new framework.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This represents a fundamental reform of these programs and establishes the foundation for our commitment to bring greater predictability to the federal government's payments to the less prosperous provinces in support of key public services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The $33 billion committed to equalization and territorial formula financing payments, when combined with the $41 billion ten year plan to strengthen health care, will result in federal transfers to the provinces and territories of $74 billion.  This significant increase in federal transfers illustrates the government's commitment to provide stable and growing funding to provinces and territories.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the 10 year plan to strengthen health care makes it clear that money alone cannot sustain health care, the government fully understands the importance of stable and predictable funding to the provinces and territories in support of health and social priorities. In short, the $41 billion 10 year plan represents the best of what the Canadian federation can accomplish and underscores how cooperative federalism has built a country with a standard of living that is the envy of the world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before closing, I would emphasize the importance of the bill receiving passage by the end of this fiscal year so that the provinces and the territories can have access to 2004-05 funding and begin to plan for the future.  I therefore ask that hon. members continue to provide the bill with timely consideration.</p><A NAME="T1020"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1020"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1025"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1015"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1020)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1140767"></A><a HREF="#Int-1140788"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1140752"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Rob Merrifield (Yellowhead, CPC): </b>Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to speak on this very important piece of legislation, Bill C-39, an agreement worked out between the provinces and the federal government. It is the third accord we have had since 2000. We have had the 2000 and 2003 accords and now this 2004 accord, all giving money back to the provinces, money that was ripped out of the provinces' hands unilaterally by the government. In fact, the Prime Minister of this country is the only  individual politician, provincial or federal, who has ever taken money out of health care over the last decade.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is amazing to see the numbers put before us and to hear the rhetoric that I just heard coming from the government side here a few minutes ago, with the government side talking about this being all about accountability and transparency. I would like to explain why it is about neither of these.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What it is about  is an amount of money going back into the health care system, which we agree with. In fact, the numbers that are put forward, the $41 billion put forward in this health accord, are closer to our numbers. They are very much identical to our numbers for the first six years, but are only half of what the Liberals promised in last year's June election. During that election, the Liberals were not being honest with the Canadian public with regard to the number of dollars available for health care, nor were they honest about the number of dollars they were going to give to health care.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the numbers that are here, thank goodness they are twice what was promised. These numbers are what the provinces asked for and what we suggested during that election. It is interesting to note that during the election we were criticized because we said that we would have to increase taxes before we could fulfill the promise we made to the Canadian people during that campaign.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All that aside, it is time to put our swords on the table and deal with health care in a non-partisan way, but before we can even get into a debate on health care we have to understand the situation of health care in this country. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was not a fix for a generation, as was trumpeted by the Prime Minister. He went across the country and said that this is what we had to do, that we needed a fix for a generation to put health care on a sustainable course. Before we can do that, we have to understand that health care cannot be fixed in the next 10 years. The pressure will not even start to hit our system with the intensity that it is going to until we get to 2020, 2030 and up to about 2040, where it will begin to peak. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pressure will intensify from now until that period of time because of the demographics and the baby boomer population that is going to hit the system. The baby boomers will be consuming large amounts of dollars during that period of time as they become elderly. It does not matter which area we want to look at in our health care system. Whether it is pharmaceuticals, cancer, Alzheimer's or heart disease, we can talk to any of the organizations across this country and they all will tell us that the high costs of these treatments, plus the numbers of  patients afflicted with these kinds of diseases, including HIV-AIDS, are going to intensify over the next significantly short period of time and will continue to intensify over the next 40 years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, how we sustain our health care system during that 40 year period becomes the true debate. Until we understand what is coming at us, we cannot possibly even start to open up an honest debate on health care.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are going to paint the picture honestly, and that is what I think we should do here, it is not only demographics that will inflict a significant blow on and a challenge to our health care system, but it is the obesity situation we have within our country. We have surveys showing us that almost 20% of our students are overweight, almost 8% of them at obesity levels. These individuals will be hitting serious problems, whether it is diabetes or heart and stroke problems, in their thirties, not in their fifties, sixties and seventies. When we couple this with the demographics we are headed into in our health care system, when we understand what is about to hit us, we see very clearly that the challenge will intensify because of more than just an aging population.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been talk of a fix for a generation. That is what the member and the Prime Minister have suggested, but we have been given nothing to change the dynamics and the paradigm of health care. We must do this. We must look not just at the health care system, which is crisis management, but upstream much further, and we must start talking about preventative health care.</p><A NAME="T1025"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1025"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1030"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1020"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1025)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back in the early seventies, we had television advertisements stating that  a 30 year old Canadian was  not as fit as  a 70 year old Swede.  That is very much the case today.  We see an epidemic of obesity in our population, which suggests that we have to do much more than  crisis manage our health care if we are  to sustain it over the next 40 year period.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have talked about what is coming.     However, what does the health care system look like today?  Emergency rooms are absolutely crowded. Patients cannot see doctors or they wait  for unbelievable amounts of time to see them.  Some of them are reported as having passing away in emergency rooms while waiting for a doctor.  A significant number in our population cannot obtain a family practitioner.  I think 3.6 million individuals are without a family practitioner at the present time, and 2.4 million of those have given up trying to find a one. We have some very serious problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us compare Canada to some of the OECD nations, which it is important to do when it comes to diagnostics.  Let  us talk about MRIs.  That seems to be what people like to talk about when discussing diagnostics.  We do not rate very well.  We rate 13th out of 20 for MRIs and 16th out of 21 for CT scanners. When we look at our health are system, we can see we have a significant problem with trying to access services. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the papers yesterday and on headline news last night, it was reported that six doctors walked away from their practices in small town Quebec.  With the amount of stress on the family practitioners and the nursing population, we can understand full well why we have these kinds of problems.  We have a shortage of human resources.  People have to understand that our health care system is 75% to 80% human resources.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are told that 100,000 nurses will be leaving or retiring over the next five year period.  There are only a little over 300,000 nurses in Canada today.  A third of them are over the age of 50, and the average nurse retires at the age of 55.  We have a crisis when it comes to the number of nurses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To talk about nurses for a second, we have to understand that the most unhealthy workplace in all of Canada is in the hospitals.  Nurses are the ones who take the most number of sick days off of any occupation in Canada. That is because of the stress they are placed under by the amount of work we ask them to do.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was at a meeting last week with the nurses on the Hill.   They explained to us that if they were asked to work beyond 55 to 60 or 65, we would have to create an environment for them so they could function well within that job.   To do that, we will have to provide some relief and help for them.  It is not only about paying them more dollars.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to doctors, we have a significant problem. A decade ago, when the government took the money out of health care, the ideology was that the doctors drove the costs.  Therefore, if we removed the doctors from the system, we would remove the costs. The Canadian Medical Association said at that time that if we did that, in a decade we would run into trouble.  We are now a decade from that time and we are in serious trouble with a shortage  physicians in the system.  That goes back to the kinds of headlines yesterday. More are on their way.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need  2,500 doctors per year to sustain our physician profession.  At the present time, we only educate 2,200 of them per year.  We have to understand that the problem is not just educating more of them.  They have to stay and work in Canada where they are needed.  We have a three-prong problem.  When we look at the legislation, do we address any of them?  I would like to look at the legislation and ask those questions.  </p><A NAME="T1030"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1030"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1035"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1025"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1030)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has said that it has  $5.5 billion to deal with the wait list problem.  The money is in a separate trust fund, and over a 10 year period the provinces can draw down on that money whenever they like. It is quite ridiculous when we look at the  legislation and see how that is done.  Of those dollars, $4.25 billion of those dollars can be pulled down by the provinces immediately.  Why set up a separate trust?  We might as well just write them a cheque because that is exactly what they will do,  draw down that money.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The money is to go into  waiting  lists.  What does that really mean?  What criteria is on that money?  They are to apply it to wait lists.  There are two chronic problems in  the health care system, and that is   the shortage of human resources, the nurses and doctors, as well as the long wait lists.     How do we address it?  There are no criteria for  how we will address it.  It is a provincial jurisdiction, and I think that is appropriate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the good things  about  the legislation is it would  not tie    hands, as was tried  with some of  the other past accords, with regard to some of that money.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However,  why not be honest?  Why not just be clear to the population of Canada and the health care system.  Why does the government not say   that it will give the provinces the money and that they should use it where they see fit  in order to help the system.    However, it should not say that it has a great  fix for the wait  list  problem, which is to put  $5.5 billion into a separate  trust fund that the provinces can draw down.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are going to be transparent, let us be transparent. If we are going to be honest, let us be honest with the numbers.  No longer is there any room for playing politics in health care.  What I see with this accord is it is not a fix for a generation.  It is a way to buy another election.  That is really what it will come out   to be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If  members will remember, the 2000 accord came in just months before an election. The 2003 accord was an attempt, after the Romanow report, to do something. With regard to this one,  the spin is to fix it for a generation.  It has nothing to do with fixing a generation, it is to do with buying another election.  We are doing it with taxpayer dollars and we are doing it in a very dishonest way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dollars need to be there.  That is why we support the legislation.   However, we have to do it in a way that is clear,  honest and is not confrontational.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other thing that is so dishonest with the legislation is the idea of a catastrophic drug coverage.  This was supposed to be done long before now.  In fact,   with catastrophic drug coverage and home care, in the 2003 accord with the provinces there were performance indicators and a timeline as to when these were supposed to be triggered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this legislation, when it comes to catastrophic drug coverage, it is pushes it back, and not to 2006 when the other was supposed to be implemented.  The only thing that will come forward In July 2006 is a report suggesting that we might be able to proceed with some sort of a catastrophic drug coverage plan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to home care, it is the same thing.  It is pushed back again in this  accord.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My hon. colleague talked about  $500 million to medical equipment.  The last time that a fund was set up for medical equipment was in the   past two accords.  When we traced that money  to find out whether it went to medical equipment, we found  that much of it went to, what we would say,   pretty marginal medical equipment like lawnmowers and ice cube machines. We thought that if it hit the headlines, the government would  put in more accountability measures if it were to trigger and target  a specific amount of money to go to medical equipment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However,  in the finance committee meeting this last week I  challenged the Liberals on this.  No further accountability measures have been established. The way the fund is set up in this legislation is exactly the same as the other one. If we  do the same thing the same way, we can expect the same kind of results. It is unfortunate that we have to play these kinds  of games with health care.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could go on   and on about   the significant lack of accountability within the accord.  I want to just say   that  there is some accountability, perhaps, and that will come from the Health Council, which was struck in the 2003 accord.  The Health Council  of Canada is probably our best hope for full disclosure from the provinces and the federal government, with regard to what happens with taxpayer  money.  Whether it is provincial money or federal money, it is all taxpayer  money.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My suggestion, as we move forward into health care, is to stop this nonsense of playing politics with health care.  We could not afford it before and we cannot afford it now.  Yet we still see the kind  of spins   coming  from the government side.</p><A NAME="T1035"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1035"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1040"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1030"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1035)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Liberals are going to be honest, the first thing they should do is stand up and apologize to Canadians for the way they have treated health care over the last decade. They should give that the money back.  Then they should consider how they will work together with the provinces in a collaborative way to make it happen. They should look at how we will  deal with the next 40 years in health care.  They should look beyond the political cycle.  Politicians like to work in four year cycles because that gets us elected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can no longer do that with health care. We cannot do it provincially nor can we do it federally. We need a paradigm shift. We have to get away from crisis management on health care.  We need  to start looking at how we deal with the needs of the individual patient ahead of the system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We think  we have a great system in Canada. The World Health Organization suggests that we are 30th in the world.  Every time  we get into a health care debate, somebody wants to promote an American health care system. Why would we do that? The Americans rate 37th in the world.  However, 30 other countries are better than us.  Why do we not take some of the examples from those countries and use them pattern a health care system that will be in the best needs of the Canadian population?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a good health care system, but we will be unable to sustain it on the course we are on. We have to do more than just come up with one-off accords that do not address accountability or the health of the nation.  They deal with crisis management. We agree with the dollars in this accord, and we will support the legislation in that respect. We are frustrated about how we got here and we are frustrated that  we have a government that is not more long-sighted than this  legislation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is even more of a pleasure for me to speak today on a bill which, you will recall, the Bloc Québécois opposed at second reading.  We did so because of the provisions of the bill at that point.  In fact, we pointed out one fundamental flaw at that time, and this was corrected in committee. Consequently, we will be able to support it most enthusiastically today. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe it would be a good idea to start with the health agreement entered into between the federal government, Quebec and the provinces and territories.  We need to take a few moments in order to have a proper understanding of the nature of Bill C-39.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, additional funds have been put into the health care system by the federal government, but it must be acknowledged that they are insufficient. I will return to that point later.  We must also acknowledge that the federal government has concluded a separate, specific agreement with the Government of Quebec, which stipulated the following, in particular:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right"></td>
<td><small>—resting on asymmetrical federalism, that is, flexible federalism that notably allows for the existence of specific agreements and arrangements adapted to Quebec's specificity—.</small></td>

</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>Quebec will apply its own wait time reduction plan, in accordance with the objectives, standards and criteria established by the relevant Quebec authorities—</small></td>

</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>The Government of Quebec will report to Quebeckers—</small></td>

</p><p><table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small></small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be certain that there could be no confusion, the communiqué went on to say: </p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>Nothing in this communiqué shall be construed as derogating from Quebec's jurisdiction. This communiqué shall be interpreted as fully respecting its jurisdiction.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we have to acknowledge that a specific agreement with Quebec was entered into.  This was to be described—as it is in the communiqué—as asymmetrical federalism.  A few days ago, the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs referred to my having praised the health agreement, to having nothing but good to say about it.   Let us not get carried away, here. Yes, I did have some good things to say about it, to which I have referred here, but it must also be said—and the minister took care not to—that the agreement suffers from certain shortcomings.   We have expressed a number of reservations about it. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, reference was made to the so-called asymmetrical federalism. Let us be clear that for the provinces and territories, except Quebec—but a way including Quebec—there is an understanding that the federal government can encroach on a jurisdiction  that is exclusive to Quebec and the provinces. We cannot exactly call that asymmetrical federalism. In fact, we should be calling it asymmetrical interference.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nine provinces and three territories have had no problem recognizing from the outset that the federal government has a role to play and can interfere in their exclusive jurisdictions. In  a way, Quebec has recognized that the federal government has a role to play, but that its role needs to be well defined. We could only talk about asymmetrical federalism if the federal government allowed the provinces and territories to encroach on federal jurisdictions. Only then will it be possible to talk about asymmetrical federalism.</p><A NAME="T1040"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1040"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1045"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1035"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1040)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, this side deal has been presented as quite an extraordinary innovation. Need I remind this House that this side agreement with the Government of Quebec is not a first.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government of Quebec has already negotiated side deals and special administrative agreements with the federal government  on immigration with the Cullen-Couture agreement, on the pension plan, or on the creation of the Caisse de dépôt et  placement du Québec, to name a few. This type of negotiation is nothing new in the history of Quebec and Canada.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also notice that this asymmetrical agreement, described as asymmetrical federalism, has yielded relatively modest results. The Prime Minister had announced with great fanfare that he wanted to resolve the problems in the health care system for a generation. We can conclude at least that the government is apply a band-aid to the problem in health care for the next few years, or maybe even months, but it certainly has not solved anything for a generation.   </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to look at the numbers simply to understand the limits of this agreement reached among the federal government and the provinces, Quebec and the territories. For the Quebec government, this represents $502 million, or 2.5% of a health budget of over $20 billion. In concrete terms, this amount will run the health care system for nine days. Thanks to this injection of federal funds, the so-called health  system will be able to operate for nine days. If, to the Prime Minister, these mere nine days constitute resolving health care problems for one generation, this agreement is obviously quite limited.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is all the more surprising since the federal government has been literally swimming in the surplus for the current fiscal year. In fact,  this surplus is said to be close to $12 billion. So, it is hard to understand the government being so tight-fisted when it comes to ensuring that our constituents have access to the reasonably  acceptable health care services they deserve.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to come back to the concept of so-called “asymmetrical” federalism. It must be concluded that this concept was strongly contested, in short order, within the Liberal Party ranks. The Prime Minister was even criticized in the newspapers by certain Liberal Party luminaries, such as John Manley and Senator Joyal. So he was criticized for apparently having been too generous to Quebec. Too generous. What an idea. The Prime Minister was too generous to Quebec.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, what happened—as later events attest—is that a few weeks later, there was another federal-provincial conference, which was supposed to focus on the much larger issue of the fiscal imbalance, which some people, on the opposite side of the House, call the “financial pressure” on the provinces, Quebec and the territories.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The federal government, however, had  first set the terms, given its habit of being very authoritarian, to ensure that this conference focused only on equalization. The federal government gave only crumbs to the provinces, Quebec and the territories. As a result, the so-called “asymmetrical federalism”  proved its  flaws, weaknesses,  and shortcomings just a few hours or days after being celebrated  amid great fanfare and praise.</p><A NAME="T1045"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1045"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1050"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1040"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1045)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The release regarding the agreement between Quebec and the federal government said that  the funding made available by the Government of Quebec would be used by the    Government of Quebec to implement its own plan for renewing Quebec's    health system.It also said that the Government of Quebec would report to Quebeckers on progress in achieving its objectives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, it said that Quebec's health commissioner was responsible for reporting to the Government of Quebec on Quebec's health system and that he would cooperate with the Canadian Institute for Health Information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The agreement was very clear. But when we   saw Bill C-39, to our astonishment and irritation and disappointment as well, I must say, we noticed that the bill made no reference  to the side deal with Quebec. To be fair,  a very slight reference was made to it on page 4 of the bill,   in section 25.9, dealing with parliamentary review, the only reference to this side deal with the Government of Quebec.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naturally, the Bloc Québécois  checked with the government, suggesting that there had probably been an oversight, a little something left out. The government took the matter under advisement  and came back with a rather terse response, saying that it would look into it. To  make sure that the government would indeed look into it, on February 10, I rose in this House to  put a question to the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs. The answer came from the  Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Health.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the arrogant, condescending and authoritarian attitude this government is known for, the parliamentary secretary rose in this House—of course, whenever remarks are made or an opinion expressed by an opposition member, the people opposite suggest we are not quite with it because, by definition, an opposition member cannot be right. So, the parliamentary secretary rose in the House and said that my concerns  were unjustified. According to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Health, my concerns about the provisions of the side deal with the Government of Quebec not being reflected at all in the bill were totally unjustified.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is strange. There is a side deal with the Quebec government.  The bill makes not mention of it. We are saying there is something wrong, but we are told that there is no reason to be concerned, that there is no problem, and they wonder why I am complaining again! Of course, we pointed out to the government that the parliamentary secretary was probably out to lunch himself, because the bill is indeed totally silent on this side deal with the Quebec government. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, the necessary adjustments were made in committee, at the request of the Bloc Québécois, which had identified this problem, this flaw. The government agreed to amend the bill and made the necessary adjustments, so that Bill C-39 reflects, in its essence, the agreement reached with the Quebec government, even though we realize that this agreement is not perfect. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us be clear here, Nirvana, it is not. We will always agree with the federal government investing more of its huge budget in health, so that our fellow citizens can have access to proper care. We will always agree with that and with the federal government respecting its own Constitution and, consequently, the jurisdictions of the provinces and territories, even though, in this particular case, this respect may be tarnished by ill intentions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, we agree with this agreement. However, we realize that it is flawed. It is incomplete.</p><A NAME="T1050"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1050"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1055"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1045"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1050)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said earlier, the money invested by the federal government will only last nine days in the health care system. This is not enough. The need is much greater. The Quebec government was expecting something on the order of $3.3 billion in federal transfers, for 2004-05 alone. However, as we know, the transfers are far below this figure, both under the equalization program  and the health care  agreement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result is that the Quebec government is still confronted with a shortfall of some $2.4 billion. Therefore, the agreement is not adequate. The federal government must further increase its transfers to the provinces, to Quebec and to the territories. Having said that, we are of course pleased, as I mentioned a few moments ago, that there is more money and that the federal government reached a specific agreement with the Quebec government.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is very clear that the fundamental problem has not been fixed. This fundamental problem is the fiscal imbalance that some members across the way continue to call “financial pressures”. The fiscal imbalance problem has not been fixed. We are hoping that the federal government, in the budget that it will bring down next week, will correct a few things and start to redress once and for all this fiscal imbalance where the federal government collects more tax money than it needs to meet its constitutional responsibilities, while the tax base of the provinces is far too small to meet their responsibilities, such as health and education.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to correct this fiscal imbalance. The problem will only get worse, the result being, according to the Conference Board, that, by 2015, the federal government will have accumulated a surplus of some $166.2 billion while the provinces will be running deficits as high as $68.7 billion. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is what the fiscal imbalance is all about. While the federal government shamelessly amasses surpluses, the provinces must scrape the bottom of the barrel or even borrow  to discharge the  responsibilities that are  within their jurisdiction and that address directly the needs of the public in terms of health, education and  welfare, for example. This is totally unfair and inequitable.  Whatever happens to Bill C-39, which we will support this time, we must fix the problem of fiscal imbalance once and for all.</p><A NAME="T1055"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1055"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1100"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1050"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1055)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1140799"></A><a HREF="#Int-1140801"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1140788"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Pierre Paquette (Joliette, BQ): </b>Mr. Speaker, I would like to use my few  remaining moments to congratulate my colleague on his speech. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year marked the 87th anniversary of the independence of Lithuania. It is on this day in 1918 that Lithuania declared its independence from Russia and once again redeclared its sovereignty in 1990.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After World War I this small nation achieved freedom and proclaimed itself the Lithuanian Republic. On February 16, 1918 the founders of this great nation asserted their country's independence and commitment to a government based on justice, democracy and the rights of the individual. For decades, Lithuanians have been commemorating this event, during Lithuania's independence, oppression and subsequent independence.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of National Revenue is harassing senior citizens who receive grants from the Ontario special services at home program to care for disabled adults at home. This is a throwback to the days when all developmentally disabled children were institutionalized.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The federal government insists on collecting payroll deductions, and now penalties, from the parents of disabled children for grants that are paid by the province for the support workers. These grants allow disabled children to live at home rather than be institutionalized.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I call on the federal government to stop harassing these disabled adults and their families. Drop the government court actions that are causing undue anxiety in what are already very stressful situations.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kevin was out playing with his cousin when the ice gave way and he fell in. His cousin ran to look for help. At the same time, Mr. Stiles was out with his wife and heard the youngster crying for help. He acted right away. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the help of another man, Mr. Stiles tied pieces of clothing together so he could safely crawl along the crackling ice. This way the boy was able, after a few attempts, to pull himself closer to Mr. Stiles, who grabbed his hands, while the other man pulled them to shore. The boy was treated for mild hypothermia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to recognize and congratulate Mr. Todd Stiles, a resident of Orléans, for his presence of mind and unselfish act of bravery. He is now one of our local heroes and we are all very proud of him.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so we are still wondering why nine RCMP detachments in Quebec have been closed, including one in my riding and a number near the border, and why the RCMP is bothering with satellite television signals rather than illicit comings and goings at the border.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do agree that the theft of signals is an offence that  deprives the economy—and the companies, particularly—of millions of dollars each year. Nevertheless, our borders have not had any police surveillance since the RCMP withdrew, and that means reduced security for the local population.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of its mandate, the RCMP must enforce the law, prevent crime and maintain order and security. The last point is the one I wonder about. The RCMP appears to prefer protecting the incomes of businesses rather than  ensuring the safety of Quebeckers.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. de Monchaux's sculpture, called <i>Song</i>, was unveiled in Parliament's historic Westminster Hall on Wednesday, February 9, 2005. It is the first contemporary sculpture ever to be displayed there.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response, Amnesty International and Oxfam Canada initiated a twinning program between Canadian and Zimbabwean MPs. Along with 15 other MPs of all parties, I am a member of this initiative, which seeks to protect parliamentarians by drawing enough attention to their situation to cause the authorities to back off.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes this works and sometimes it does not. Last year my twin, opposition MP David Mpala, died of injuries sustained under police torture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the rise in state sponsored violence which seems likely to occur in the run-up to the March 31 Zimbabwean elections, Foreign Affairs must abandon its hands-off approach to human rights and appoint a special representative to Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only a strong response from Canada will prevent my new twin, MDC National Youth Chairman Nelson Chamisa, and other brave opposition MPs from being subjected to the same kind of human rights abuses.</p>

The saddest part of that is it could have been prevented.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every working day in Canada there is a car-train collision. Many of these occur at night because railcars are not properly equipped with reflectors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My urban colleagues need to understand that over 20,000 crossings in this country, mostly located in rural areas, are uncontrolled.  There are no overhead lights, no bells, no flashing signals, no protective arms, no advance warning. There is just the person in his or her  vehicle on a quiet snow covered gravel road on a peaceful night and without warning, suddenly out of the darkness a train appears and it is too late.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberal government is fazing in reflectors over seven years.  The Conservative Party asks why phase in something that could save lives today?  The government should do it now. The cost to equip a train car is less than $200.  The tragic cost of failing to do so is eternally higher.</p>

There has never been an injustice on this scale or of this duration in the country. In spite of a national consensus to apologize with compensation and reconciliation, of the $125 million spent, only $1 million has actually gone to compensation of the victims.  The rest has been burnt up by  administration costs and legal fees fighting these claims.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish all members could have heard the testimony of 88-year-old elder Flora Merrick at the House of Commons Indian affairs committee  yesterday.  Her award of a paltry $1,500 is being appealed by the federal government. It cost the government  $30,000 to fight her claim.  She was awarded $1,500 and the government is appealing.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I  implore the government to stop victimizing the victims of the residential school tragedy; stop spending millions of dollars trying to paint the abuse victims as liars.  Eligibility for compensation should be based on attendance at the school.    We believe the victims.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I refer to the record from the blues of yesterday wherein the Right Hon. Prime Minister in responding to a question during oral questions regarding the status of Lebanon said, “Mr. Speaker, I  said in French and I said in English that the Syrians should withdraw from Syria. I have now said it three times. How many more times need I say it?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tapes will confirm that the blues were correct in the manner in which they recorded this statement, as have media reports.  However, today's <i>Hansard</i> reveals that apparently somebody, presumably from the Prime Minister's Office, submitted a substantive change to the transcript so that it now reads, “I have said in French and I have said in English that the Syrians should withdraw from Libya”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Your Honour will know, Marleau and Montpetit makes it clear that only editorial changes ought to be made, and that “substantial errors must be brought to the attention of the House by means of a point of order as soon as possible after the sitting if the member wishes to have the verbatim record changed”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would submit, Mr. Speaker, that the change which was made in the official transcript was out of order and inappropriate, and I want to bring this matter to your attention so you could ensure that such substantive changes are not made in the future.</p><A NAME="T1205"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1205"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1210"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1200"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1205)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1141144"></A><a HREF="#Int-1141150"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1141142"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon.

If you would check in that very answer to which the member is referring, the Prime Minister repeated Lebanon I am sure once and perhaps more than that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, we are quite comfortable, Mr. Speaker, that once you have reviewed perhaps the tape, the blues and <i>Hansard</i> that you will see that the Prime Minister has been very consistent.</p><A NAME="Int-1141150"></A><a HREF="#Int-1141319"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1141144"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Jason Kenney: </b>Mr. Speaker, in the spirit of my own point of order, I need to correct the record.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-39, an act to amend the Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements Act and to enact an act respecting the provision of funding for diagnostic and medical equipment, be read the third time and passed.</p><A NAME="Int-1141172"></A><a HREF="#Int-1141202"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1141171"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Pierre Paquette (Joliette, BQ): </b>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak to Bill C-39 because it shows the true nature of this Parliament. It is unfortunate, but despite the fact we have a minority Liberal government, the Liberals, as you know, have not lost any of the arrogance that has been their trademark for 9 or 10 years, under Mr. Chrétien and the new Prime Minister.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We saw this arrogance when we found out that Bill C-39 was not consistent with the special agreement signed with Quebec at the conference on health. As a matter of fact, Bill C-39 contained only one mention of a specific agreement with Quebec, in clause 25.9. Also, Quebec was not specifically excluded from other requirements in the bill, like the  Canadian Institute for Health Information or the dedicated funds. Bill C-39 showed once more this arrogance of downplaying the importance of a specific agreement with Quebec. The agreement was quite clear. I will have the opportunity to deal with this later on. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mentioned at the start that Bill C-39 shows the true nature of this Parliament because the Liberals, even though they are a minority government, seem unable to suppress this arrogance towards Quebec and this Parliament. Fortunately, the Bloc Québécois and its members in this House immediately sounded the alarm and sent a clear message to the government and the whole Parliament  that the bill was not consistent with the intent and the letter of the special agreement with Quebec. Thanks to this intervention, especially by the member for Verchères—Les Patriotes, the Bloc Québécois critic for intergovernmental affairs, and despite the reluctance of the government, we were able to pass an amendment, and Bill C-39 is now consistent with the intent and the letter of the agreement. We think the bill is now quite acceptable and we will support it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just imagine what would have happened had the Bloc Québécois not been here. Bill C-39 would probably have been passed unchanged, and Quebec would have been penalized. This goes to show how important it is to have members who stand for Quebec's interests first and promote an exciting collective project--the sovereignty of Quebec.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mentioned that it cannot be by chance that the government brought forward the original draft of Bill C-39 without taking into account the specific agreement with Quebec, because that agreement was very clear. For the benefit of people watching us, I would like to cite it. In the specific agreement with Quebec, there was a very clear written statement:</p>

</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It could therefore not be any clearer than what I have just read. However, the Government of Quebec, even though it is led by federalists, knowing the reflexes of the federal government, particularly when Liberals are in  power, even had the following disclaimer added at the end of the communiqué, to ensure that there would be no confusion possible, and I quote:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">

</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will understand that we were quite surprised to see that, in the original draft of Bill C-39, there were not more references to the clause 25.9 in terms of that specific agreement. Let us recall that, when that specific agreement was signed, for a few days, people believed there really was a new approach on the part of the federal government, which  the Bloc Québécois leader, like MNA Louise Harel, had called asymmetrical encroachment.</p><A NAME="T1215"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1215"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1220"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1210"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1215)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The federal government was therefore agreeing, in this specific agreement, to respect Quebec's jurisdiction over health issues, as set out in the Canadian Constitution.  It was however an innovative approach.   In the recent years especially, with the fiscal imbalance and the Liberal government's  tendency to impose a federal presence in all areas of Quebec's and the other provinces' jurisdiction, particularly if there was some sort of visibility or political points involved, this   asymmetry in terms of  intrusion seemed to be a step in the right direction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, this respect of Quebec's jurisdictions lasted only a few days. Nothing new there. As I was saying, the defence of the 1867 Constitution caused an outcry in Canada. The member for Verchères—Les-Patriotes was talking about that. The former finance minister, Mr. Manley, condemned that. All the dyed in the wool  Trudeau supporters told English Canada that the direction we were taking posed a threat to Canada's unity.  Since then, we have seen no new asymmetrical intrusion initiatives since the one made at the health conference.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, a few weeks later, during the funding conference, the federal government unilaterally decided  to restrict the conference to the issue of equalization. It announced the amounts available, right at the start, saying that the formula that had been unilaterally imposed before the latest elections would continue to be used. It dealt with none of the provincial concerns, particularly those of Quebec. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we saw the first draft of Bill C-39, which did not take into account the distinct nature of the agreement entered into at the health conference,  the member for Verchères—Les-Patriotes asked a question on February 10, 2005,  of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Health in order to  alert  the Minister of Health to the fact that there was no explicit reference to the specific agreement with Quebec, except, once again, section 25.9, which was clearly inadequate.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parliamentary secretary answered that the member's concerns were not justified. We were heading  toward a dead end. You will recall that, at second reading, we had opposed Bill C-39. Given the inadequate reference to the specific agreement with Quebec, we could not have supported it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Québécois proposed amendments to Bill C-39, in line with the accord signed in September. First, we reincorporated  in the bill the fact that the funding made available by the Government of Canada will be used by the Government of Quebec to implement its own plan for the renewal of Quebec's health care system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who have been following the politics of Quebec for the past few years, know that there have been many studies to reform the health care system, just as in a number of  Canadian provinces. First, there was the Rochon Commission, then the Clair Commission. The reforms are now well underway. The so-called expertise of the federal government in this domain is not needed at all. It manages only a few veterans hospitals, which are constantly being criticized.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, in our approach regarding the amendments to Bill C-39, we made sure that the Government of Quebec would be accountable to the population of Quebec. We excluded any hierarchical relationship where the federal government thinks that it is supposed to decide on the validity of the actions of the Government of Quebec. The Government of Quebec is accountable to the nation of Quebec, to the people of Quebec only. When elections take place, Quebeckers express their view of government management of health care and many other things.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So our second concern was about the Government of Quebec informing its own population of the progress achieved in the pursuit of its goals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third aspect is the Health Commissioner of Quebec being responsible for reporting to the Government of Quebec on Quebec's health system.   The Canadian Institute for Health Information should not, therefore, be informing the public on advances by the Government of Quebec, the health department and the other players in the health care system, with respect to the concerns of the public and issues such as the modernization of our health system. These issues must take a number of challenges into account, in particular the challenge of demography, which, as you know, is linked to the aging of our population.  </p><A NAME="T1220"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1220"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1225"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1215"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1220)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There obviously will be cooperation with Canadian Institute for Health Information. Though it was never a problem, it should have been made clear that Quebec's Health Commissioner was responsible for reporting to the Government of Quebec and, through it, to the public on the state of health care.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This amendment we moved was adopted by the committee. As I mentioned, the original version was unacceptable, but we will support the amended version of Bill C-39.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I  mentioned that the concept of asymmetrical federalism, which is in fact asymmetrical interference, was very short lived. To prove it, I point out that on October 26 of last year, at the conference on the provinces' financial situation, which covered more than just health, which had been the only subject of conference in  September, Ottawa decided unilaterally that equalization would be the only item on the agenda. The federal government said right at the start what amounts would be available and announced that not one cent more would be added to equalization and that the formula used in its calculation would remain unchanged. I remind you that the formula had been imposed unilaterally by the federal government a few months before the last elections. Moreover, the Prime Minister refused once again to admit that there was a fiscal imbalance and spoke only of fiscal pressure on the provinces knowing full well that the situation is a lot worse.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I repeat that that asymmetrical interference or asymmetrical federalism, as they called it, did not last long. We saw it during today's question period. There is still no agreement on parental leave despite an agreement in principle signed before the elections. There is still a gap of about $200 million between the positions of the federal and Quebec governments. Here again, we can see the federal government's hard line attitude common in  its relations with Quebec.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the problems go well beyond the area of health. Let me give you another, more regional, example. As you know, there is a crisis in the tobacco industry.  It is a totally understandable crisis considering anti-tobacco campaigns. Being a non-smoker, I support those campaigns. But the fact is that there was a sharp decline in demand for tobacco. Moreover, the three major tobacco companies decided to stop buying tobacco in Quebec to concentrate their purchases in Ontario.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The region that I represent, namely Joliette and Lanaudière, was home to virtually all tobacco farmers. Out of the 57 who were in business three years ago, fewer than a dozen continue to produce a small amount of tobacco, trying, naturally, to diversify   their operations, production and crops, and only three intend to continue growing tobacco to meet the demand of independent    manufacturers like Lépine cigarettes and other manufacturers operating in first nations reserves.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is therefore an emergency. Tobacco farmers need assistance to switch from one type of crop to another, such as  Chinese cabbage or kiwi; anything that can grow in sandy soil ought to be considered. Anyway, these growers need assistance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like parental leave, this assistance was announced a few days before the election. Electoral democracy is good after all. A few days before the election, approximately $70 million in assistance was announced. That was many months ago, yet we are still waiting for the terms and conditions of this aid package for tobacco farmers in Quebec and Ontario to be defined.</p><A NAME="T1225"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1225"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1230"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1220"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1225)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would appear, and this is more serious, that assistance for the 57 tobacco farmers in Quebec, 95% of whom are in the Lanaudière region, is being blocked by a dispute between Ontario farmers and the provincial government of Ontario.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find it completely absurd that producers in Quebec are being taken hostage in a situation that is totally out of their control. Naturally, for the federal  government—and that is what we were told by the parliamentary secretary in response to a question I put to him last week—the same solution has to apply to producers both in Ontario and in Quebec. Consequently, until an agreement has been reached with Ontario farmers, no money will be made available to the farmers in Quebec.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their situation is totally different, though. These farmers in Quebec have already stopped growing tobacco or started   efforts to quickly switch crop production. To conclude this brief aside, I want to emphasize that the funding problems facing these tobacco farmers is largely due to the fact that tobacco companies have forced them to replace their dryers just two years before they decided to stop buying any tobacco in Quebec.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They need help for converting their land because switching from tobacco to asparagus does not just happen in one season. Often it takes five years before production becomes efficient. They are also burdened by debt, which they are unable to amortize with financial institutions in the region.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I was saying, this asymmetrical approach was nothing more than a virtual approach, which did not even last long enough for the ink to dry on the separate health agreement. The government no longer mentions this approach. Again, refusing to acknowledge the fiscal imbalance makes it impossible to find a definitive comprehensive solution to the funding problem. This is so for Quebec, but also, unfortunately, for many other provinces. However, the federal government has been much quicker and much more generous with provinces such as Newfoundland and Labrador and others over the past few weeks, while Quebec has to continue to struggle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I was saying, the agreement on health does not solve the fiscal imbalance problem. It is like taking an aspirin to try to get rid of cancer. I will give some figures, although the hon. member for Verchères—Les Patriotes already gave some earlier. Nonetheless, if I have time, I would like to go into more detail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The specific agreement on health provides Quebec with approximately $502 million more this year, out of a budget of $20 billion.  Consequently, this fresh federal input represents only 2.5% of the Quebec budget, or about 9  days of operation.  That is just for health, so what they have done is the equivalent of helping Quebec meet its health care responsibilities for the equivalent of nine days.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The federal government  boasts that it is getting close to the 25% target the Romanow report recommended for health and social funding.  When we look at all social spending, that is education, social assistance, the areas covered by the Canada social transfer, which is now, as we know, divided into a transfer for health and one for social programs,  it is obviously far from that 25% figure.  Especially  because, as far as equalization payments are concerned, the results have not been what might had been expected, that is, a new formula that is fairer, more stable and more generous to the provinces needing these federal transfers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, after the October conference on the provinces'     financial difficulties, which eventually shrank to nothing more than a conference on equalization, Quebec will end up with a mere $300 million more in equalization payments. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, in its “generosity”, this government will have transferred $800 million more to Quebec this year, whereas the shortfall—according to the Government of Quebec, or its finance department—is in the order of $3.3 billion.  As a result, the shortfall for Quebec, as far as fiscal imbalance is concerned, is still $2.4 billion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must therefore hope that the federal government, with its fabulous surplus of $9 billion last year—this year, some $11 billion or $12 billion—will, in the budget to be tabled and debated starting next Wednesday, get its act together and find some definitive solutions by transferring the $2.4 billion Quebec still lacks to resolve the extremely serious problem of fiscal imbalance. </p><A NAME="T1230"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1230"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1235"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1225"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1230)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1141202"></A><a HREF="#Int-1141208"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1141172"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Michel Guimond (Montmorency—Charlevoix—Haute-Côte-Nord, BQ): </b>Madam Speaker, I greatly enjoyed what my colleague from Joliette had to say, particularly his little aside on the problem faced by farmers producing flue-cured tobacco in his riding and the greater  Joliette area. As a member from Quebec, he certainly educated me on the problem of switching from one type of crop to another.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I especially appreciated his saying that a farmer cannot stop growing tobacco one year and immediately start growing asparagus the next year. Apparently cultivating asparagus takes four or five years to develop.  I have friends who are asparagus farmers on L'île d'Orléans, in my riding, so I have some idea what the hon. member is talking about.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me come back to the focus of his presentation, the government's lack of recognition of the fiscal imbalance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that the Bloc Québécois fought for amendments during the negotiations among the three opposition parties following the Speech from the Throne. We managed to get the government to pay us lip service and recognize the fiscal imbalance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the way, just as a reminder on this Friday, the person who contributed the most to developing the concept of the fiscal imbalance, who put a figure to it and recognized it, is Yves Séguin, Quebec's former finance minister. We sovereignists recognized it a long time ago. We must acknowledge the work done by Mr. Séguin, the author of the Séguin report, which recognized the fiscal imbalance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I would like my colleague from Joliette with his economics background to explain a little further about the shortfall in Quebec caused as a direct result of the fiscal imbalance. He said it was over $2 billion, if I recall correctly.</p><A NAME="T1235"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1235"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1240"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1230"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1235)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1141208"></A><a HREF="#Int-1141259"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1141202"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Pierre Paquette: </b>Madam Speaker, I would like to thank the hon. member for Montmorency—Charlevoix—Haute-Côte-Nord for his questions and comments on tobacco farmers. The  issue is not well enough known, unfortunately. Every time we have a chance to talk about it, we can put a little more pressure on the government to settle the matter finally.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is right. In my opinion, Mr. Séguin did a great deal, first to get the concept of the fiscal imbalance recognized and then to explain the size of this imbalance and the solutions that could be applied. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a way, we have made considerable progress in this debate. We all remember what the Quebec federalists said when we first talked about the fiscal imbalance. And yet, the concept was not invented by the sovereignists. The first person to mention it was Jean Charest, now Premier of Quebec, when he was opposition leader. Some people, including some editorial writers close to the Liberal Party of Canada, have said that it is a concept invented by sovereignists to promote sovereignty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one now denies the existence of the fiscal imbalance, except perhaps the federal Liberal MPs from Quebec. Last week, I read an article by Claude Piché, an economic reporter with whom I rarely agree. This time, however, on the eve of the budget, he was also calculating his expectations in terms of corrections to  the fiscal imbalance. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps I will mention a  few figures. Just now I pointed out that the negotiations in recent months concerning fresh transfers of money to the provinces, to Quebec in particular, only came to an additional $800 million, while the shortfall is estimated—according to Mr. Séguin of the Quebec government, of those federalists who often but not always have the interests of Quebec at heart—at $3.3 billion. Thus, if the gap is $3.3 billion, and $800 million of fresh money comes in, $2.4 billion is still needed in order to correct the fiscal imbalance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a few figures for the current year, 2004-05. The amount transferred before the agreement, or the various agreements, was $14.150 billion. Now, with the new funding that has been announced—here I am not speaking only of Quebec, but of all the provinces—funding of $2.125 billion, the new total for funding is $16.275 billion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provincial spending on health is $83.133 billion. That means that the federal government's share in health care funding is only 19.6%. We are a long way from the 25% Romanow recommended. That is a shortfall, just in health, of $4.5 billion, which the provinces would   be getting  if the federal government were assuming 25% of health care costs, but  are not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the agreement is spread over 10 years, it could be said that things will be better in 10 years. Nonetheless, the calculations that were done—I did not do them, it was the Conference Board which published its report in August 2004—show that after all the agreements, this 23.8%  share of health care funding will remain unchanged, if health care expenses increase at a limited pace.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We see that, if nothing is done to resolve the fiscal imbalance, despite the agreements on health and equalization—and the health accord is a relatively positive measure, as I said, but does not go far enough—the fiscal imbalance will continue to grow. The financial problems experienced by the provinces and Quebec will get worse.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the federal government is paying down its debt—and I remind the House that in recent years, an additional $60 billion was misappropriated, from both the employment insurance fund and excessive taxation by the federal government, to pay down the debt—the provinces are having trouble balancing their budgets. A number of them are running a deficit. So, this ensures that the provinces and Quebec will continue to see their debt spiral.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I repeat again that there is no logic either financially or in terms of services, because the provinces and Quebec pay a much higher interest rate than the federal government. This means that money is being taken from those paying significant interest on their debt, and the federal debt, which has a lower interest rate, is being paid off. Financially and in terms of services, there is no logic   to this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must remember that a fiscal imbalance means fewer health care and educational services. This will not fix itself over time.</p><A NAME="T1240"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1240"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1245"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1235"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1240)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, when a child is living in poverty because the federal government has cut employment insurance and does not want to transfer the money to which the provinces and Quebec are entitled, via the social programs,  that child is the one to pay the price. If the federal government does not remedy this in five years, that child will have lived in poverty for five years, and the impact will be life long.  This is something the bureaucrats in Ottawa just do not get.  When a jobless person does not get benefits, the situation will never be remedied, because the economic and social insecurity of today will have an impact for the rest of his life.  Child poverty has the same effect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every time the federal government puts off solving fiscal imbalance, social and democratic and service levels are affected.  The harm done will never be remedied, even if we do manage to force the government to remedy the situation.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will point out, before closing my remarks, that it is also a problem of democracy, if legislative assemblies, the Quebec National Assembly for instance, do not have the necessary resources to translate  their decisions into concrete action.  Parental leave is an excellent example of this.  Since 1997,  the Government of Quebec, whether Parti Québecois or Liberal, has had this more generous and more accessible parental leave on its books, but the National Assembly is incapable of  implementing a democratic decision that reflects the will of the people of Quebec.   We are dealing here with a real democratic deficit caused by fiscal imbalance and by  the federal Liberals' lack of desire to correct it. </p>
<p>[<i>English</i>]</p><A NAME="Int-1141259"></A><a HREF="#Int-1141321"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1141208"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms. Jean Crowder (Nanaimo—Cowichan, NDP): </b>Madam Speaker, I rise in support of Bill C-39.  The NDP has already indicated its support; however, I am compelled to speak about the fact that there is a lack of accountability in the bill.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order for Canadians to have continued confidence in our health care system, they need to know how and where their money is being spent and what the results are.  This is not a lone voice in the wilderness that is calling for accountability.  It is supported by any number of sources. I will quote from a number of different documents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is  the “Health Care Renewal in Canada:  Accelerating Change” document put out by the Health Council of Canada.  The council  is quite unequivocal in its statements around the need for accountability.  It starts out by talking about the fact that governments are making significant investments in health care and how Canadians will know whether the money is being spent on health care renewal. The council goes on to talk about the fact that money is important. I will quote directly from the document:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>Inform Canadians as to whether the increased investments in health care are supporting the change governments have agreed to implement--</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The council stated: </p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>We believe the public has a right to know how the money has been spent across the country.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It  will  report about this in its annual reports, but it is very clear to the  council that there is a fundamental issue attached to the question of money, how it is being spent, what the results are, and what is being achieved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next document  is quite an interesting one.  It is called, “Principles for Governance, Management, Accountability and Shared Responsibility” and was put out by the Canadian Health Care Association and the CCAF. Their opening statement is actually a quote from an address by the Prime Minister at the first ministers meeting on September 13, 2004:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>When it comes to health reform, Canadians expect real and meaningful accountability.  They deserve to know what they should expect--and what they are getting.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The document lays out some key principles around what we expect out of accountability.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the minister pointed out earlier today, we are spending significant amounts of money in health care over the next 10 years. Surely Canadians deserve to know how that money is being spent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the things the CCAF and CHA outline is that health system partners need to demonstrate commitment to public transparency and accountability.  They do this by explaining to and involving the public in what they plan to do, how well the system is performing, and the implications of both.  Surely these are the elements of good practice in any kind of respect. They then go on to outline areas of responsibility. Under public accountability and involvement, the CHA and CCAF outline a principle which  states: </p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>Health system partners need to demonstrate commitment to public transparency and accountability.  They do this by explaining to, and involving the public in,  what they plan to do,  how well the system is performing, and the implications of both.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, this is a fundamental principle on how Canadians need to have access to how Canadian tax dollars are being spent.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They go on to talk about how these things might be reported.  Again, these are principles.  These are   non-profit bodies that are talking about principles in terms of accountability and transparency.  They talk about reporting principles and standards being key to the integrity and utility of reported information and a prerequisite for fair comparison and benchmarking. They state:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>Principles and standards may be issued as a pronouncement by the requiring party, or developed cooperatively.  Regardless of how they are developed, these reporting principles and standards should be commonly understood and consistently applied.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To me that means there is an agreement on what we should be reporting, and it should be clearly understood by all parties, including the Canadian public.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the first ministers health care agreement the Canadian Health Coalition actually issued a report card in September 2004. Under the accountability and reporting aspect of the report card the government was given a <i>D</i>.  The coalition said that the agreement is based more on trust and an assumption that the public will hold governments to account. We are talking assumptions here.</p><A NAME="T1245"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1245"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1250"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1240"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1245)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the weak accountability facilitates privatization by stealth, Canadians will have to be diligent to ensure real accountability. Medicare is still on life support, not from lack of money, but because of weak controls on where and how the money will be spent. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Health Coalition is talking about the fact that what we really need to do is follow the money. The CHC did a detailed analysis on the 10 year plan to strengthen health care. I will quote from the document on accountability and reporting to Canadians. I talked about the fact that the agreement is based on trust. The document states:</p>

<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>It is no coincidence that the governments with the most resistance to meaningful accountability (Alberta, Quebec and B.C.)  are the ones  determined to transfer the delivery of insured health services over to commercial, for-profit health care corporations. Proponents of private, for-profit health  services do not want public funds accounted for or traced but  this is what true accountability requires. Canadians don't realize that current accountability requirements in federal legislation are being ignored by the federal government. Under the Canada Health Act, the Minister of Health has a statutory duty to monitor, report and enforce compliance with the five criteria of the Act. The Minister's annual report to Parliament on the Canada Health Act consistently fails to identify, report and stop privatization initiatives underway in several provinces. This poses a serious threat to the integrity and viability of Medicare.</small></td>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is from the prebudget consultation which was clearly calling for more accountability. Yet when we look at Bill C-39, any mechanisms for accountability are absent from that bill. It is very cold comfort to hear that there will be a review done in 2008. That is like slamming the barn door shut after the horse has escaped.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are talking about some of the pillars around public administration and  the issue  that we are not able to look at the impact  health care dollars are having and where they are being spent. In my own province we have a current P3 under way and the government cannot tell me that this is a for profit situation.</p><A NAME="T1250"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1250"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1255"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1245"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1250)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have an organization called Access Health Abbotsford, which is a consortium that includes the Dutch bank ABN AMRO, U.S. health giant Johnson &amp; Johnson and Sodexho, a French cleaning and food services company, that will be responsible for the design, construction, financing and maintenance of the hospital that is being built in Abbotsford. Surely that is a for profit organization, which seems to be very dismissive of one of the key pillars of the Canada Health Act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How will Bill C-39 protect Canadian taxpayers from that kind of creeping privatization.  There are certainly any number of questions about the quality of for profit health care.  Again,  independent studies have been conducted and established on these kinds of private health care delivery.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians deserve to know how the money invested in health care is being spent.  Canadians are very passionate about their health care system, and they want to continue to see a publicly funded and publicly delivered health care system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are asking the Minister of Health and the Prime Minister to honour their commitments.  In the minister's own words, he stated after being sworn in:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those are very strong words.  It would be shameful if the government did not live up to its commitment around that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will go on and repeat the Prime Minister's words because they bear repeating.  He made a commitment around real and meaningful accountability.  He said was:</p>

</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely stating that Canadians deserve to know what they should expect and what they get talks about accountability.  It should be one of the fundamental principles in the bill.  It is glaringly absent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge that we quickly put in mechanisms to deal with the accountability, so Canadians have some confidence in where their health dollars are being spent, and that we can proudly stand up and talk about the fact that we have a publicly funded and publicly delivered health care system.</p><A NAME="T1255"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1255"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1300"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1250"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1255)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1141321"></A><a HREF="#Int-1141326"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1141259"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Bill Siksay (Burnaby—Douglas, NDP): </b>Madam Speaker, the member raises a  crucial point around the question of accountability in our health care spending.  I agree with her that this is a glaring omission from the legislation, particularly when we look at the kind of feedback that she quoted from the Canadian Health Coalition, which generally gives the government a “D” when it comes to accountability in health care spending in its past efforts. It does not give us much confidence for the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also agree with her when she raises the serious concerns about for profit health care, especially in our home province of British Columbia.  It always boggles my mind when we talk about for profit health care.  Just the very nature of for profit health care introduces a major new expense into the system that we do not currently have.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Profit is a huge expense to the health care system, to any system.  Taking profit out of the system, constitutes a major and significant new expenditure.  I have real problems with that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, we heard the member for Nanaimo—Cowichan ask the minister questions in question period around credit card medicine.  I was not too impressed with his response.  The minister stood up and said that he would defend the Canada Health Act.  However, he was not very specific.  We have not seen much action on that front.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not one to heckle much in the House.  My colleague from Winnipeg heard that I came to that point today when the minister was responding.  I asked rhetorically for the minister to show us his teeth behind his promise to enforce the Canada Health Act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does she think about the minister's response to her questions today about credit card medicine in Canada?</p><A NAME="Int-1141326"></A><a HREF="#Int-1141334"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1141321"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms. Jean Crowder: </b>Madam Speaker, in question period, the minister's response was that perhaps I needed to turn up my hearing aid. I guess my response to that would have been, for what? To hear more empty promises around credit card medicine?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, on credit card medicine, again the Canadian Health Coalition's analysis around the first ministers health care agreement, and of course Bill C-39 is a result of it, was a D grade for stemming the tide of privatization, as well.  Again quoting from the analysis, which is very appropriate.  It states:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just a few words on politics. I am privileged to be in my 17th year as a member of Parliament. During that period of time I have served with three leaders of the Liberal Party and one interim leader of the Liberal Party. Throughout that time my opposition to same sex marriage has been well known. Yet it is obvious by the fact that I am the first Liberal backbencher to speak, in fact the first Liberal to speak immediately after the Prime Minister, that there is no underhandedness in determining who will speak to this bill on this side.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 17 years under three leaders and one interim leader, never have I been asked to submit a speech to anyone to have it reviewed or to have it vetted. Not that it would work, but it has simply never happened. I lament that there are situations where people seem to think that is necessary in a House of free and open debate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to turn now to the history of this matter as I see it. Back in Chilliwack, British Columbia, in 1994, I issued my first speech on this matter. I predicted that if matters were not observed quickly and a halt was not put to the movement, same sex marriage would become a fact in this country. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a paper dated November 16, 1994, which I distributed to all members of Parliament, so anyone who was a member of Parliament in 1994 received it, I outlined exactly how this would happen and the steps that would be used to achieve this objective. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sadly for me, because I hoped I would be wrong, matters have proceeded exactly as I predicted almost 11 years ago. Unfortunately, people refused to listen and they refused to believe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wrote a letter to former justice minister, Mr. Rock, pointing out that there was a court decision in Ontario from the then divisional court where two judges to one had decided in favour of traditional marriage. My point was that the dissenting judge had found that traditional marriage was unconstitutional.  I warned the justice minister of the day that two to one in favour of traditional marriage today could be two to one against traditional marriage tomorrow, and what was he going to do about it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had written a letter to a concerned Canadian and this is dated February 24, 1997. I want to quote two paragraphs from it. It reads:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That motion passed 216 to 55.  Among the members of Parliament who voted in favour of that motion were, according to <i>Hansard</i>, Mr. Cauchon, Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice), Madam McLellan (Edmonton West), Mr. Martin (LaSalle—Émard), and Mr. Rock.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the year 2000 the House passed legislation known legally as the Statutes of Canada 2000, Chapter 12.  In section 1.1 of that act, the House of Commons, in a government bill, supported by the Government of Canada, enacted the following legislation.  This is not a preamble; this is legislation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of that, in June of 2003 along comes the Court of Appeal decision in Halpern.  In the meantime, the Prime Minister of the day had mandated the justice committee of Parliament to go across Canada to study this issue, make recommendations, and deliver a report to Parliament so that Parliament could debate this issue.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me to the next part of my speech concerning duty bound to act. I maintain that it was the duty of the prime minister of the day and the justice minister of the day to uphold the laws and integrity of Parliament. As we have already heard, two justice ministers had already stated that the law was clear.  A motion had been passed by Parliament supported overwhelmingly, including the government members and the cabinet, that the definition was included in a statute of the Parliament  of Canada and the justice committee was mandated to study this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Parliament was adjourned and we were no longer sitting in caucuses, the Court of Appeal decision came out.  Contrary to this duty to act to support the laws of Canada and the Parliament of Canada and the integrity of the Parliament of Canada, the prime minister of the day, without consultation with caucus, without consultation with Parliament, and without letting the justice committee finish its job, decided not to appeal the Court of Appeal decision of the province of Ontario, effectively undercutting and undermining his own legislation and the expressed will of Parliament.</p><A NAME="T1315"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1315"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1320"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1310"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1315)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to explain my views on why I consider Bill C-38 to be discriminatory, a sham, and a hoax on parliamentarians and Canadians.  I am going to refer specifically to each of those categories.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view this bill is discriminatory. It has been argued that same sex marriage is somehow a right. This is not legally accurate. The Supreme Court, in the reference decision, did not declare that permitting same sex couples to marry was a right. Absolutely no country in the entire world has declared it to be a human right, including the two countries which presently allow same sex marriages. No one has done that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can something be a right when it is not recognized in law by anyone in any country in the world, including the Supreme Court of Canada, as a declared right? Therefore, to say a right is a right in the context of same sex marriage is legally wrong.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we have to turn to section 15 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms which talks about laws being enacted without discrimination; in this case, without discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. We have to look at the institution of marriage then.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the institution of marriage discriminatory? Of course it is, by its very nature.  We cannot get married unless we are of a certain age. That is discrimination on the basis of age.  We cannot get married if we do not have proper mental capacity. That is discrimination on the basis of disability. We cannot get married unless we are of the proper bloodline.  That is discrimination on the basis of who our parents are or who our siblings are, including, as we will see later, adoptive children.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It discriminates against religion because it says we can only have in this country, not in the world but in this country, one spouse:  one wife or husband. This is discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation because it says we must marry someone of the opposite sex.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To my mind the bill seeks to “fix” discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation by allowing people of the same sex to marry, but at the very same time the bill continues to permit discrimination on the basis of age. People still have to be of a certain age even though according to our laws, they can legally have sexual intercourse at the age of 14, but they cannot marry at the age of 14. It discriminates continuously on the basis of mental capacity and who decides on the mental capacity.  It discriminates on the basis of bloodline and indeed, this particular bill perpetuates that discrimination in clause 13. It states:</p>

</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It discriminates and continues to discriminate on the basis of religion because it says in clause 2:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>Marriage, for civil purposes, is the lawful union of two persons to the exclusion of all others.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That discriminates against those religions that believe that it is perfectly acceptable to have more than one spouse. That is discrimination on the basis of religion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, why is it acceptable to remove discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation but continue to permit and perpetuate in legislation and common law other forms of discrimination? Either we eliminate all forms of discrimination or we leave the current definition alone. It  has worked for millennia.  If it ain't broke, don't fix it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That brings me to the subject of polygamy. Some say that raising polygamy is a red herring and has nothing whatsoever to do with this bill. That is utter legal nonsense. Polygamy is currently against the law, section 293 of the Criminal Code. </p><A NAME="T1320"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1320"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1325"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1315"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1320)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the stroke of a judicial pen, that section can be declared unconstitutional on the basis of section 15 charter guarantees of freedom of religion. People say that is not going to happen, but I am going to give two real life examples. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first one is the very definition of marriage. The law of this country was the common law for millennia. The law was that people had to be of the opposite sex. With the stroke of a pen, that which was illegal was made legal by the courts, not by the Parliament of Canada.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 159 of the Criminal Code reads: “Every person who engages in an act of anal intercourse is guilty of an indictable offence...”. It goes on. There are exceptions: “...any two persons, each of whom is eighteen years of age or more,both of whom consent to the act.” That is fine.  There is no problem there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That section was challenged on the basis that it was discriminatory because of age. Justice Abella of the Ontario Court of Appeal struck that section down because it was contrary to the age discrimination in section 15, in her view.What did that mean? That meant that for the Criminal Code of Canada, written into the laws of this country, which denied anal intercourse to people under the age of 18, with the stroke of a judicial pen that which was illegal became legal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why would members think, when those two examples have already occurred, it is beyond the pale that a judge at the stroke of a pen will declare polygamy legal because the law against it discriminates on the basis of religion?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who argue in favour of polygamy will say, “How can we end discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in marriage but continue to permit discrimination on the basis of religious beliefs in marriage?” Where is the logic in opposing this argument? </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is this bill a sham? First, the preamble is sleight of hand. It is meaningless legally. A court can refer to and follow preambles and has, and a court can ignore and has ignored preambles. The courts have already ignored the express will of Parliament, as I read from section 1.1 of the Modernization of Benefits and Obligations Act, so why does anyone think they will not ignore a preamble? </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is the bill a hoax? Clause 3 of the bill states:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Supreme Court in the reference decision has stated clearly and unequivocally that this subject matter is out of bounds to the federal Parliament; it is ultra vires federal Parliament. That is not the member for Scarborough Southwest speaking. That is the Supreme Court of Canada speaking:</p>

</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 2 of the proposed act was virtually the same wording that is in Bill C-38. The court  goes on to say:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>While it is true that Parliament has exclusive jurisdiction to enact declaratory legislation relating to the interpretation of its own statutes, such declaratory provisions can have no bearing on the constitutional division of legislative authority.

</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That section has no effect and is superfluous, according to the Supreme Court of Canada. How can a justice minister put a section into an act which the Supreme Court of Canada has already said is ultra vires Parliament of Canada? He cannot do it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion,  I just want the people of my riding to remember that I was very clear in my position. In June 2003 in my householder, I said:</p>
<p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has been my consistent public position since I entered public life in 1988, four elections ago.  My position is firm and unalterable.  I will do all I can as an individual to try to preserve and promote the only definition of marriage I know.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask the Parliament of Canada to defeat this legislation and ensure that marriage remains between one man and one woman, to the exclusion of all others.</p><A NAME="Int-1141429"></A><a HREF="#Int-1141431"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1141374"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms. Rona Ambrose (Edmonton—Spruce Grove, CPC): </b>Madam Speaker, many countries and states have extended or are considering extending the same rights in law to same sex couples.  Some countries in fact have established provisions to recognize partnerships as civil unions with some or all of the same rights in law that married couples have.  These include such countries as Denmark, Finland, Greenland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Hungary, France and Germany.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government of the member opposite has said that the position of the Conservative Party is not moderate or not reasonable. Given that many of the European countries, as well as many moderate governments around the world, have adopted positions similar to ours, I wonder if the member opposite could comment on this.</p><A NAME="Int-1141431"></A><a HREF="#Int-1141433"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1141429"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Tom Wappel: </b>Madam Speaker, the member is asking two questions, one about civil unions and the other about politics.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously the nature of this place is such that one side is going to say that the other side is wrong.  We saw what happened in the last election.  We saw what happened in the reports of the debates of the leaders' speeches. This is a very emotional topic.  People take their positions very carefully and strongly.  To my mind, this matter should be debated in, if I may put it this way, a very legalistic manner, to take a look and see what the ramifications are.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the point of view of civil unions, my answer would be this.  If we take the analogy of a hockey game, particularly a Stanley Cup hockey game, one never worries about the next game until  one wins the period one is in. There is no point in even discussing civil unions if the bill passes, because if the bill passes we will have same sex marriage in this country. To my mind, the object is to defeat this bill.  Once Parliament has spoken and the same sex marriage bill is defeated, then Parliament will have to come to grips with what the alternatives are.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly one of the alternatives is civil unions. That  was discussed when we were speaking to the pension benefits act.  It was spoken to in a whole series of discussion groups, both within the Liberal Party and across the country.  It is one of the alternatives that has been suggested.  The member is absolutely right: many countries have adopted it.</p><A NAME="T1330"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1330"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1335"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1325"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1330)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1141433"></A><a HREF="#Int-1141440"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1141431"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Speaker (Hon.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said: Madam Speaker,I rise today to speak to my private member's bill, Bill C-268, an act to confirm the definition of marriage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was first elected to this House in June 2004.  As a new member of Parliament, I was pleased when I was drawn fourth overall in the lottery on private members' business.  Under the rules for private members' business this meant that I would be able to introduce a bill and have it considered, debated and voted on by members of Parliament.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must say, however, that my work on this bill has been a reality check and illustrates to me that the democratic deficit our current Prime Minister had promised to slay is indeed alive and well.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My bill is unique in that it is relevant to the debate we are having in this House today on the Liberals' plan to change the definition of marriage.  It is also unique because it is the only private member's bill in this session that has been deemed non-votable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This private member's bill, like the government's Bill C-38, provides a legislated definition of marriage.  However, unlike Bill C-38, my bill defines marriage as it always has been known: as the union of one man and one woman, to the exclusion of all others.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, my bill will not be voted on, as the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs ruled that my bill would be non-votable. The Liberals prevented my bill from bill being voted on so that this issue would only come forward to this House in their timing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This constitutes, in my opinion, a gross interference by the Liberal government in private members' business. Private members' business is limited to only a few hours per week and there is already too little opportunity for members of Parliament to represent their constituents in this House.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To say the least, I also found the rationale for the committee's rejection of votable status for my bill to be without merit.  I find that  the process that led them to the decision was certainly flawed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the Subcommittee on Private Members' Business met in private and in camera, without any representation from me, and acted as judge, jury and executioner of my bill by declaring it non-votable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I of course appealed this decision to the full membership of the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs, where the membership also prevented my bill from being made votable. Their flawed argument was that my bill was clearly unconstitutional.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To suggest that my private members' bill is clearly in violation of the Constitution is to take on the role of justices of the court, not parliamentarians.  It is the constitutionality of the traditional definition of marriage that was the very issue in the reference the Attorney General of Canada put forward to the Supreme Court on January 28 of last year. The reference question states:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>Is the opposite-sex requirement for marriage for civil purposes, as established by the common law and set out for Quebec in section 5 of the Federal Law-Civil Law Harmonization Act, No. 1, consistent with the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms?

</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The committee prejudged the outcome of this important reference to the highest court of the land and therefore acted contemptuous to both the Supreme Court of Canada and to the Attorney General of Canada.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I argued at committee that if the constitutionality of even the common law definition of marriage, let alone a legislated definition of marriage, were clear, then there would be no need to ask the Supreme Court of Canada the question.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Attorney General had put a bona fide question to the court.  Why would the Attorney General waste taxpayers' money and the high court's time to answer a question that clearly had already been answered?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under our judicial system, a decision of a provincial court only has application within the province in which that decision was rendered.  The only court decision that applies to every province is that of the Supreme Court of Canada.  In fact, this is the definition most recently upheld by Parliament as part of the Modernization of Benefits and Obligations Act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this respect, the ruling of the committee was in breach of the law passed by Parliament four years ago.</p><A NAME="T1335"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1335"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1340"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1330"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1335)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The definition of marriage contained in the bill is the same one that is the law in four provinces and two territories in this country.  Further, British Columbia and Ontario courts of appeals went to great lengths to emphasize that they were changing the common law definition of marriage and that there was no legislated definition of marriage for them to deal with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-268 contains a legislated definition of marriage with which the courts have not yet dealt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oftentimes a provincial court of appeal decision is overturned by the Supreme Court of Canada in favour of the reasoning of the original court.  In both B.C. and Ontario there are lower court decisions that found the traditional definition of marriage was in fact constitutional.  Further, the Supreme Court of Canada has never indicated in any ruling that the traditional definition of marriage was unconstitutional. To the contrary, when the Supreme Court ruled in the Egan case, Justice La Forest stated:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>Marriage has from time immemorial been firmly grounded in our legal tradition, one that is itself a reflection of long-standing, philosophical and religious traditions.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went on to say, “In this sense marriage is by nature heterosexual”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of all this, the committee found that my bill was clearly unconstitutional. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Standing Orders do not say that a bill is non-votable because it may, could, likely, or possibly violates the Constitution.  The threshold is much higher.  A bill must clearly violate the Constitution to be deemed non-votable. I submit that in light of the facts that I have already set out, my bill fell far short of that threshold.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, since the committee ruled my bill non-votable, the Supreme Court has finally rendered its decision in the reference case.  In the case it did not in fact find that the traditional definition of marriage was unconstitutional.  As a matter of fact, it did not answer the very question that was put to it by the attorney general and therefore it put the issue back into the hands of Parliament.  This is exactly what my bill would have done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great irony of my bill and the government's bill is that the Supreme Court ruling did not in any way whatsoever indicate that the traditional definition of marriage contained in my bill was unconstitutional.  However, the court did rule that the government's bill, specifically the clause that purports to protect religious freedoms, was in fact ultra vires and unconstitutional.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is important for members to remember, and for Canadians to understand, that allowing my bill to proceed through our democratic process in no way indicates support for the substance of the bill, but failure to do so clearly indicates suppression of democracy.  By denying parliamentarians the opportunity to vote on my bill, we are subverting the limited democratic gains that we have made in the House.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must remember that it is the role of Parliament to legislate, not to determine the validity of legislation.  That role in our system is filled by the courts. It is the responsibility of Parliament to deal with matters of important social policy.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At every turn the Liberal government has sought to avoid meaningful public consultation and debate on the very important and foundational issue of marriage.  When the House of Commons considered the issue of same sex marriage in 1999, not that long ago, the then justice minister and current Deputy Prime Minister clearly stated to Canadians, “The government has no intention of changing the definition of marriage or of legislating same sex marriages”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time the government supported a motion which promised to use all necessary means to defend the traditional definition of marriage.  In a true free vote the motion passed the House of Commons by a margin of 215 to 55, with the current Prime Minister and most of the then cabinet voting in favour of the traditional definition of marriage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We fast forward a few years and today the position of the government stands exactly opposite to the position it promised to uphold in 1999.  Instead of using all necessary means to uphold the traditional definition of marriage, the government is relying on a whipped vote to force cabinet ministers and some parliamentary secretaries to support legislation that would change the definition of marriage. Simultaneously we know that intense pressure is being applied on the government's own backbenches to ensure a favourable outcome for the government's controversial legislation.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What occurred between 1999 and 2005?  How can something that is not considered a fundamental right in 1999 suddenly be so promoted in 2005?</p><A NAME="T1340"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1340"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1345"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1335"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1340)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The simple answer is that over the past five years the government has slowly, methodically and deliberately circumvented the democratic process. It has used litigation at lower court levels to try to create a fait accompli on the issue of same sex marriage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past several years,  individual judges in lower courts of several provinces have struck down the traditional definition of marriage. However, the federal government refused to appeal lower court rulings, suddenly adopting the position that same sex marriage constitutes a fundamental right.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The federal government went so far as to stack the justice committee for an important vote on whether to appeal the Halpern Ontario Court of Appeal decision in this matter. It has further argued that Parliament itself has no right to respond to these rulings with legislation to protect the traditional definition of marriage. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In essence, the government attempted to shut down all meaningful debate on a vital question that has far-reaching policy implications. It was especially urgent for the Liberals that this issue not be front and centre in the last election, so they did all in their power to stifle debate and public input.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year this hidden Liberal agenda hit its first major snag. The government had referred the issue of same sex marriage to the Supreme Court asking four questions, one of which was whether the traditional definition of marriage was constitutional. Although federal lawyers tried to argue before the court that the traditional definition of marriage was not constitutional, the Supreme Court refused to be drawn into the political debate and declined to answer the question. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a matter of fact, the Supreme Court, when we read its decision, contemplated answering the question either way. This has  returned the matter to Parliament, which is exactly where it should be, for the consequences of what the government is attempting to do are serious. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Same sex marriage could have a profound implication on freedom of religion and freedom of conscience in Canada. For example, we have seen already where marriage commissioners in several provinces have already lost their jobs for refusing to agree to same sex marriage because it goes against their conscience. In an interview on CPAC on December 12, 2004, the deputy House leader for the Liberals stated that public servants, such as marriage commissioners, who refused to accept same sex marriage should be sanctioned or fired. That is shameful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is now a great concern in Canada that if same sex marriage is legalized, it will have a profound and long-lasting implication for freedom of religion and freedom of conscience, and it will become increasingly difficult for people who do not agree with same sex marriage to participate in public life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the government has claimed that it will protect religious freedoms, the evidence does not support this assertion. After all, past promises to use all necessary means to protect the traditional definition of marriage were violated in less than five years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, a clear signal has already been sent by virtue of the fact that even cabinet ministers will not be permitted a free vote on this question. If even the rights of cabinet ministers to express their views on an issue of personal conscience cannot be protected, one can hardly place much confidence in promises to protect the freedom of other Canadians.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, the justice committee heard evidence that warned of the social impact on changing the definition of marriage. Experts testified that we were embarking on a policy experiment that would have a profound impact on the way we view relationships and value marriage in our  society. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was for these reasons that I introduced my bill, so that Canadians could be engaged in a debate that the Liberals tried to prevent from taking place. I am pleased that we were able to spark an interest in this issue. I am grateful to the thousands of Canadians who expressed support for our effort to preserve our most basic social institution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In light of the fact that the committee members did not have the benefit of seeing the Supreme Court's decision before they made their own decision, and in light of the fact that the court has not ruled that the traditional definition of marriage is unconstitutional, I would now ask for unanimous consent that my bill be made votable.</p><A NAME="T1345"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1345"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1350"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1340"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1345)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1141493"></A><a HREF="#Int-1141494"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1141440"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Speaker (Hon.

Paul DeVillers (Simcoe North, Lib.): </b>Madam Speaker, the opposition has chosen to use some of the important time set aside in the House for a private member's bill to discuss yet another bill respecting the definition of marriage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the proposal contained in Bill C-268 provide the House with any additional insight that could move the debate forward to constructive options?  I regret to say that it does not.  The bill has been ruled non-votable as unconstitutional in its approach.  It is just another iteration of earlier bills which sought to reinstate the opposite sex requirements for civil marriage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his comments the hon. member referred to the opposition day vote in 1999.  I was one of the 55 members who voted against that opposition day motion which would have had the effect of restricting marriage to people of the opposite sex. I did so for the very reason that one could foresee that the courts would apply section 15 of the charter and would hold that requirement discriminatory. Much has been made about it but it was foreseeable from  a reading of the charter and a  clear understanding of it.</p>
<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under our Constitution, the courts are mandated to review legislation to determine whether it meets charter requirements. The courts in seven provinces, namely British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec, Newfoundland and Labrador and  Nova Scotia, and one territory, Yukon, have now determined that the requirement that a spouse be of the opposite sex no longer satisfies the equality guarantees under section 15 of the charter. It is discriminatory towards  Canadian gays and lesbians who want to get involved to the same extent as any other Canadian. It is discriminatory to deny them access to the civil institution of marriage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The courts also clarified that their decision applies exclusively to civil marriage. They clarified that the charter also guarantees freedom of religion and that any religious group is free to continue to refuse to perform marriages that are not in accordance with their religious beliefs.</p><A NAME="T1350"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1350"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1355"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1345"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1350)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As members of the House are well aware, the government does not believe that this important matter should be decided by the courts in a patchwork of decisions across the country. The government believes that the courts are correct in their legal conclusions, but at the same time the government also fervently believes that only Parliament has the ability to look at the complete picture in designing a Canada-wide approach.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Courts and Parliament each have their distinct and complementary roles under our Constitution.  That is why the government set in place last year an approach to this important question that involved a full and formal debate in Parliament.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will recall that in June 2003 following the Court of Appeal decisions in Ontario and British Columbia, the government announced that it would be drafting a bill and referring the matter to the Supreme Court.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government did draft a bill that contained two important provisions. The first defined marriage as “the lawful union of two persons to the exclusion of all others”.  The second stated, “Nothing in this act affects the freedom of officials of religious groups to refuse to perform marriages that are not in accordance with their religious beliefs”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill currently before the House, Bill C-38, is based on the bill that was referred to the Supreme Court of Canada.  The bill ensures full respect for both of the important fundamental principles identified by the courts: equality based on personal characteristics like race, language, sexual orientation; and freedom of religion. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To further ensure that the government was correct in law that the bill would not infringe on freedom of religion, one of the specific questions asked of the Supreme Court was: Does the freedom of religion guarantee in  paragraph 2(a) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms protect religious officials from being compelled to perform a marriage between two persons of the same sex that is contrary to their religious beliefs?    The court answered in the affirmative.</p>
<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, during the third week of October, the Supreme Court of Canada  heard the arguments  concerning the reference. The governments and 27 out of the 28  intervening parties, including the provincial governments of Quebec and Alberta, presented their positions over the course of two days. These parties presented a wide variety of opinions on many topics.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government's purpose in referring the draft bill to the Supreme Court was to clarify the options available to the members of this House under the legislative framework of the charter. This ensures a constructive and informative debate  during the parliamentary process. The purpose of the reference was not to bypass the parliamentary process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The members of this House now have before them an analysis of legal  topics by the Supreme Court. They also have an understanding of the constitutional impacts and the legislative framework in connection with the government's preferred approach with this bill now before them. In addition, the hon. members have the affirmation by the court that religious groups will be free to  apply their own meaning to marriage, in accordance with their beliefs. This affirms the government's legal position.</p>
<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill before us today does not do that. For starters, we already know that its first provision, which seeks to once more restrict the definition of marriage to a man and a woman, is unconstitutional under the law.  Indeed, the bill was drafted in such a way as to completely ignore the events and debates of the last few years on this point.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is as if the hon. member for Fundy Royal actually believes that legislation can be legitimately used to turn back the clock, ignoring the same definition included in clause 2 has been declared unconstitutional, not once but separately in binding court decisions in eight jurisdictions of the 13 jurisdiction in Canada.  This is an effective means for this Parliament to find a workable solution to a real complex and important question.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only way that the capacity to marry can now be restricted once more to opposite sex couples is for Parliament to deliberately decide to invoke for the very first time in history the notwithstanding clause in section 33 of the charter. That clause enables governments to expressly declare that a statute shall operate notwithstanding that it violates one of more of the fundamental rights and freedoms set out in the Charter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, in order to do so Parliament would first have to publicly acknowledge that it is aware of the discriminatory nature of the law but are insisting that in any event  the law be proclaimed despite the fact that it deliberately discriminates against minority rights.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not believe in discriminating against any minority, let alone using the notwithstanding clause for the first time by the Parliament of Canada, not to protect our national security, not to ensure our collective safety  but to deny to gay and lesbian couples who wish to express the same degree of commitment in a way that is available to any other couple; the ability to enter into and formalize one of the most meaningful relationships in life. Deliberately discriminating against one minority cannot be done without potentially placing minorities at risk and is inconsistent with the Canadian Constitution.</p><A NAME="T1355"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1355"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1400"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1350"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1355)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a Franco-Ontarian and, as such, a member of a language minority. The Charter of Rights and Freedoms protects such minorities, and I am grateful that it does. If gays and lesbians were to be removed from the protection of the charter, under the pretext that this is not a legal issue but a moral one, this would mean that, in the future, a similar application could be made to remove language minorities from the protection of the charter, under the pretext that it is too expensive. Consequently, it becomes an economic issue.</p>
<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, we have a choice before us. Either go forward with Bill C-38, the actual bill which is before the House, make the law uniform for all of Canada or go back to the past using the notwithstanding clause.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed solution in the bill before us today does not exist, and that is why it was declared non-votable by the House procedural committee. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate on Bill C-38 is the right way to proceed.  Whatever one's position may be on this issue, it is better than moving ahead today with a debate on an approach that is a hollow sham and is no longer possible in the Canadian constitutional and legal framework. </p>
<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><A NAME="Int-1141518"></A><a HREF="#Int-1141525"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1141498"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Pierre Paquette (Joliette, BQ): </b>Madam Speaker, let me say from the outset that I am against this motion, even it is not votable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Québécois finds that two equally important essential values need to be protected and they are equality and freedom of religion. Both these values are protected under the Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms  and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Québécois wants to allow same sex partners to get married if they so wish, in accordance with their right to equality, while protecting the rights of religious organizations such as churches, synagogues, temples or mosques to adhere to their beliefs and refuse to perform religious marriages between same sex partners. In our opinion, this is part of religious freedom.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we look at the current law, we look at the Supreme Court ruling. In this matter, four questions had been submitted by the government to the highest court in Canada, as follows. First: does the federal government have the exclusive jurisdiction to define marriage? Second: does the charter allow religious groups not to perform marriages they feel go against their religious beliefs? Third: is the definition of same sex marriage constitutional? Fourth: is the traditional definition of marriage, in other words the union between a man and a woman to the exclusion of all others, constitutional? </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In its ruling, the Supreme Court affirmed the federal government's exclusive jurisdiction over the definition of marriage and clearly established that the provinces have exclusive jurisdiction over the solemnization of marriage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adopting Quebec's position, the court mentioned that Parliament was encroaching on provincial jurisdictions with its draft provision to uphold the right of churches to refuse to perform marriages contrary to their religious beliefs. This falls under the solemnization of marriage, which is a jurisdiction of Quebec and the provinces.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A central element of the court's decision was its recognition that same sex marriage is consistent with the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. It also said that  compelling religious officials  to perform a marriage between two persons of the same sex that is contrary to their religious beliefs would be an unjustified violation of their religious freedom.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the fourth question, the court declined  to answer it, citing respect for the acquired rights   of same sex couples who   have relied upon the finality of the decisions obtained in lower courts. On this subject, the court wrote: </p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small> There is no precedent for answering a reference question—this is paragraph 68—which mirrors issues already disposed of in lower courts—</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The court is speaking here of decisions where an appeal was available but not pursued.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The court also mentioned that the  Attorney General of Canada conceded, publicly and frequently, that the common law definition of marriage was inconsistent with s. 15(1) of the Charter and was not justifiable under s. 1. Thus, the court decided that answering question no. 4   would jeopardize the government's explicit goal of harmonizing civil marriage rights in all of Canada. Thus we see that moral questions are not within the scope of the decision Parliament must make.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, to demonstrate the way this issue can be understood, one of my constituents has written to me, saying that he is a practising Catholic, very involved in his community and his church. He wanted me to know that a number of Catholics think the Church is not moving in the right direction by not recognizing the rights of same sex couple to marry in a religious ceremony. I replied that, while I was sympathetic to his idea, it was not my place as a member of Parliament, or the place of Parliament, to pass judgment on debates within the Catholic Church or the Protestant churches or Muslim or Jewish congregations. That is the domain of moral doctrine.</p><A NAME="T1400"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1400"><!-- Hour: 2--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1405"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1355"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1400)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we are being asked to do as parliamentarians is to decide whether the state will give same sex couples the same right to marry as opposite sex couples have. So, this is a legal issue and we should not get involved in an internal religious debate, whether it is with the Catholic Church or any other church. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should also point out that, in terms of the rulings made by the courts of various provinces, eight courts, in seven provinces and in the Yukon, ruled that preventing same sex couples from getting married violated their right to equality, as provided under the charter, and that such a violation of a protected right could not be justified in a free and democratic society.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The federal government decided not to appeal these decisions from the courts of appeal. These courts of appeal form a majority, since they represent seven provinces, including Quebec, and the Yukon. However, the federal government referred the issue to the Supreme Court to get its opinion. Earlier, I presented the court's opinion on the four questions asked by the government.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, the definition of marriage, as reviewed by these courts, is the union of two persons for life, to the exclusion of all others, without any reference to the sexual orientation of these persons. Consequently, even if the bill introduced by the Minister of Justice were defeated in the House—something I do not wish at all—the right of same sex couples to marry would be maintained in those jurisdictions where the courts have already ruled on this issue, including Quebec.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we need to be very clear. I disagree with the motion because of the issue that we are debating here. I agree that this motion should not be a votable item, since it violates the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. What we have to decide here, without exceeding our jurisdiction, is whether the right to equality necessarily involves the possibility for same sex couples that so wish to have access to a civil institution, namely marriage.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this context, the member will understand that even if his motion is not votable, the Bloc Québécois in no way supports it. We will have the opportunity to examine in greater detail the provisions of Bill C-38, introduced by the Minister of Justice. The leader of the Bloc Québécois outlined his position on this bill during the speech he made this week.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still, I remind the House that the Bloc Québécois is allowing a free vote on Bill C-38, even if I and most of my colleagues in the Bloc Québécois intend to vote in favour of this bill. So, we in no way support this motion before us.</p>

I do not think it will come as any surprise to anyone in the House that I am not supportive of the bill.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appreciate the concerns of the member though and his disappointment that his bill will not come  to a vote. While I do not necessarily support his argument around that, I  understand the frustration of a member of the House who introduces private member's legislation that he or she feels strongly about and hopes for the day when it  will receive a debate in the House.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did that myself. I have a bill on the order paper on the question of marriage. It is probably exactly opposite to the intent of the private member's bill of the member for Fundy Royal.  However, my bill will not come to a debate now. Events have overtaken it. Court decisions have overtaken it.  I appreciate that my bill is now somewhat redundant given the fact we are debating Bill C-38 in the House.  However, it was important for me to introduce the bill. When I did it, it was done so it would put pressure on the government to stop its delaying and get on with the important business of getting the issue before Parliament and before the country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is one of the reasons why we introduce a private member's bills. I hope  I helped move that along with my bill.  I regret  it will not have its day here in the House, but I am happy that Bill C-38 and the issue is firmly on the parliamentary agenda now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have real trouble with the bill on a personal level.  It seeks to limit my participation in Canadian society and the participation of other gay and lesbian people in Canadian society. It says that there is a key institution of our society, a key institution which we in Parliament have responsibility for which is out of our reach and something in which we are limited in our participation.  I cannot accept that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hundreds of gay and lesbian couples have now been legally married in Canada. That is thousands of Canadians. Thousands more Canadians have supported them in taking that step.  Lots of clergy people as well have supported them in doing that. Many of those couples were married in churches and perhaps synagogues as well.   It is something that has changed in our society, but the bill would seek to limit that positive change for many Canadians.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think the fact that gay and lesbian couples can now be married in seven provinces and one territory has really changed our society all that much. I do not believe it has changed our understanding of marriage. I do not believe it has limited the ability, or commitments, or obligations, or understanding of marriage or traditions of marriage that heterosexual couples celebrate regularly in our society. Life is going on. I do not think society has collapsed because we now have hundreds of married gay and lesbian couples in Canada.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill claims to be about the definition of marriage, and we often talk lately about the definition of marriage.  I do not think that is really what we are talking about. We are talking about something much more limited than that. We are talking about eligibility for marriage. If we were talking about the definition of marriage, we would be talking about things like love, commitment, faithfulness, responsibility, security and  the care for children. All those kinds of things I think define marriage, not necessarily the gender of the couple who presents itself to be married.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We miss the point in a very particular and important way if we limit ourselves  to considering the gender of the couple and not considering these other very important qualities about marriage. Love is something that is in short supply in our world. Commitment is something that is often challenged in our world. Faithfulness is sometimes very undervalued in our world. People need to be encouraged to take responsibility for their lives and for their relationships in our world.</p><A NAME="T1405"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1405"><!-- Hour: 2--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1410"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1400"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1405)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of us crave security and the creative space that builds for us and our children.  In gay and lesbian and heterosexual relationships,  we all know that having children in a secure setting does many wonderful things for them. Those are the kinds of things, if we were truly talking about defining marriage, we would be debating.   What we are talking about is something much more limited.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to read a quote from the Right Reverend Peter Short, the Moderator of the United Church of Canada, who wrote an article called “Let No One Be Turned Away”. In that article Reverend Short describes marriage.  He states:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>Marriage lays a foundation, constructs a framework, and builds a house for love. Since constant perfect love is impossible (that's another story) marriage provides a structure, a habit of being together, a promise of faithfulness to carry us through those times when we know we must act with love but do not feel like loving. Eventually the house becomes a home, the wedding becomes a marriage, and the relationship becomes a habit of the heart.</small></td>

</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>Marriage functions the way any good habit or discipline functions. It helps us hang on through short-term ambiguity on the way to long-term freedom. The ambiguity is in the conflict between feeling and commitment. The freedom is in knowing there's a place to stand beneath the ambiguity--common ground. Common ground is not the same as having things in common, but you find that out in time.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to remember that we are talking about this  kind of commitment in this discussion.  I do not think there is anything in the statement by Reverend Short that is not accessible to gay and lesbian couples.  This is exactly what we hope for in our relationships and in our marriages.  We need to remember that there is nothing in being gay or lesbian which limits our participation in that kind of love, relationship and  marriage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am concerned when I hear discussion, some of which we have had this afternoon, that seems legalistic and very removed from the real lives of Canadians.  It is hard for me as a gay man to listen to something which so affects on such an intimate level our lives and loves being debated in an abstract and legalistic kind of way.  I remind people that when we are talking about this issue, we are talking about real people and real commitments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not believe marriage between gay and lesbian people will change the lives of heterosexual couples in any way.  I do not think it changes the commitments they make.  It does not change the traditions they celebrate when they are being married.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember there was a demonstration outside our office about marriage several years ago.  My predecessor, Svend Robinson, went out to speak to the people who were opposed  the change in the definition of marriage.  He asked rhetorically if any of them believed that  his marrying his partner would change the other people's relationships with their husbands or wives.   He further  asked people to put up their hands if they thought his marriage to his partner, if he chose to do that, would change the other people's marriages.  Not one of the people, who were  there to oppose changing the definition of marriage to include gay and lesbian people, put up their hand.  That is a significant indication.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not believe this change challenges religious freedom in Canada.  If I thought that for one second, I would be opposed to doing it.  I am an active member of the United Church of Canada. I will not support anything that I believe tilts us in the direction of limiting religious freedom in Canada. I do not believe raising this issue does that.  I do not believe it is a slippery slope to take us toward that. I just do not think it is in the cards.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another thing I want to challenge. We hear that  this debate, discussion and changes are being forced on us by decisions of the court and that somehow this is undemocratic.  I do not think that is the case at all.  This change is before us now because couples want to be married and want to uphold the traditions of marriage.  They strongly support the institution and champion it.  They went before the courts to say that they wanted to be married, that they wanted to uphold that tradition.  That is why this issue is before us, not because of some legal process or some sort of judicial activism.

I want to deal with that at the outset.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. member for  Burnaby—Douglas from the NDP    ended his 10 minutes by talking about what was or was not democratic.  I would suggest, Madam Speaker, through you to the hon. member and to the others who spoke from the Liberals and the Bloc, that a great travesty was done back in December, I believe it was, to the member for Fundy Royal.  His democratic rights as a backbench member of Parliament, an individual member of Parliament representing his constituents, were trampled on by the committee and by the other other three parties which profess to believe in democracy.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague is the only  member of Parliament thus far in this Parliament who has been discriminated against by having his bill ruled ineligible for a vote.  I say shame on all those parties, and shame on the Prime Minister who has professed to be somewhat concerned about the so-called democratic deficit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We see the truth come out in how his party, the Liberal party, the government, and the other two parties have dealt with my colleague and his intended legislation.    My colleague from Fundy Royal so clearly laid this out, not only today in the chamber, but when he appeared before  the procedure and House affairs committee, of which I am a member, on Thursday, November 25, to defend his bill. He should never have had to do that,  but he did  an   admirable job defending it.  He put to rest the bogus arguments that we heard from the government members and other members  who said that somehow this was unconstitutional.  He said that the very court  that determined the constitutionality of law in the country, the Supreme Court of Canada. had not ruled on this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact at the time when he appeared before that committee to make his case to make Bill C-268 votable, we had not even received the long awaited reference back from the Supreme Court on this very issue. It was nothing short of censorship.  We are talking about the censorship of an individual member of Parliament and the legislation that he brought forward on behalf of his constituents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ten minutes is such a short period of time, but  I want to briefly refer, as I did that day, to the process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been a member of Parliament  for 11 years.  Some days I do not take a lot of pride in saying that.  On November 25, when the other members of the other three parties voted down the appeal of my colleague to make his bill votable, was one of those days.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we had in previous Parliaments, of which I was a part, was    a flawed system for dealing with private members' legislation.  Everybody who drafted private members' legislation, be it a bill or a motion, put it forward, introduced it to the House and their names went in a draw barrel.  It was a lottery.  It was a crap shoot.   If  members were lucky to clear the first hurdle  and had their names drawn,  they  had to go almost on bended knee before a subcommittee, in camera, behind closed doors, and make  their case for why  their bill or motions should be votable.</p><A NAME="T1415"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1415"><!-- Hour: 2--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1420"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1410"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1415)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very few were made votable, because partisan politics began to play once we got behind those closed doors.  There were trade-offs. This was not really on the merits of the bill.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. member:</b>  Not at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Jay Hill:</b> Not at all, as my colleague says. He was part of that flawed process as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we moved in the dying days of the last Parliament to correct that and ensure that all private members' legislation was votable. We moved the onus from the private member, from the individual member of Parliament, to the House. The committee, in representing the House, would have to prove that it should not be votable rather than the member having to prove that it should be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet that process broke down in this one individual case. Why is that?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is that on a subject that is this important?   We see that now with Bill C-38, the legislation now before the House. On a subject that is so very important to the foundations of this country, why is it that this particular bill was deemed non-votable?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would contend that it is simply this. We know it is controversial. It is highly divisive for the country, for the nation,  and this government feared that it might pass, because my colleague's legislation reaffirming the definition of marriage as the union of one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others preceded this government's bumbling efforts on this front. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time the Liberals were hoping that the reference to the Supreme Court would come back and do their job for them, because that is the way this government operates. The Liberals want the courts to do their work for them if it is an issue that is at all controversial rather than taking on the leadership mantle that should come with government.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say shame on them. I hope the viewing public clearly understands what happened here: that these three parties that profess to believe in democracy worked together to ensure that my colleague's legislation did not come to a vote. They continued it today when he asked for unanimous consent to make this votable. This is the only bill that has been made non-votable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have only a few minutes left and I want to deal with the subject that is before us, rather than the process I  have spoken of. On Fridays in my riding I have a weekly newspaper column.  This week  I wrote for the very first time on this subject. I want to read for the House the column that is running today in the newspapers in my riding of Prince George—Peace River. It is about choices. It states:</p>

I regret that it was only one hour of debate and there will not be a second hour, as all the other private members' bills will have, and a vote.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It raises an interesting point. This week the Prime Minister introduced his version of a marriage bill. He argued it was a fundamental human right and not once in his speech did he say “I support changing the definition of marriage”. He does not want to say that because probably somewhere deep down he does not believe it, but he is going to do it anyway. I thought that was telling. He said he supported all kinds of things but he would not say that he supports changing the definition of marriage.  He called it a fundamental human right.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not pull fundamental human rights out of a hat. They are fundamental. There is no other jurisdiction on earth that has treated this issue as a fundamental human right.  It is a social policy decision that the government is embarking on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to comment on something my colleague from Burnaby--Douglas mentioned. He also introduced a bill on the definition of marriage similar to the government's bill. I commend him because it showed some leadership.  It showed some courage. That is something  the Prime Minister completely lacks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Prime Minister and  the cabinet thought for one minute that this was a fundamental right, then why were they not leading the charge all along? Why did they not vote against that very definition in 1999 if they truly believed it was a fundamental right?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member for Burnaby--Douglas introduced his legislation.  The Prime Minister has been dragged kicking and screaming. He has delayed the democratic process. The Liberals  have had every opportunity to allow Canadians to engage in this debate, to allow Canadians input into the democratic process, and at every turn Canadians were denied that input.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The definition of marriage is of importance to all Canadians.  We have heard that today in the House.  There are those who are not in favour of changing what that word marriage means. We feel that in doing so we are embarking on a course and  we do not know where that will lead us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel very strongly that the onus is on those who would wish to change the status quo. I commend the leadership that has been shown within my own party. What we have done is we have come up with where Canadians are at.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister is increasingly realizing Canadians are a tolerant people.  We believe in equality for all of our citizens, equality before the law.  We do  not believe that involves changing what the word marriage means, a word that predates Confederation, a word that the federal government does not own.  Governments do not own what the word marriage means.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am encouraged that we are now into a debate. We are hearing all sides. If we wanted to hear what Canadians had to say, we are hearing it now because we are receiving e-mails, letters and faxes by the  thousands. Canadians are finally engaged, much to the dismay of the Prime Minister, much to the dismay of some who in 1999 voted to uphold the traditional definition of marriage, knowing full   well that they were embarking on a course to change what that institution means.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find it ironic, and I mentioned this before, that the committee found my bill to be unconstitutional, when we know from what the Supreme Court has said that my bill is not unconstitutional.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, and this is so important, the protection of other basic fundamental rights in Canada are threatened by changing the definition of marriage. The clause put into the government's bill is a hollow shell. It contains no force and effect. The Supreme Court of Canada has already said that this matter  is not within the jurisdiction of the federal government, it is unconstitutional.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I conclude by saying that I am pleased to have had this hour of debate and I am thankful for the input from all sides.  I look forward to a day when we can really slay that democratic deficit, not just in words but in actions.</p><A NAME="T1425"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1425"><!-- Hour: 2--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1420"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1425)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1141553"></A><a HREF="#Int-1141551"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Speaker (Hon.
