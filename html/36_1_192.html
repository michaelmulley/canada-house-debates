pursuant to Standing Order 36, I am pleased to present a petition 
signed by a number of Canadians, including from my own riding of 
Mississauga South, on the subject of human rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners draw to the attention of the House that human 
rights violations continue rampant around the world in countries 
such as Indonesia. They also acknowledge that Canada is 
recognized internationally as a champion of human rights.

</I></B></P><P align=left>They say the purpose of this petition is to take animals out of 
the realm of property and provide them with a bill of rights 
giving them rights to law and order, good government, life, 
liberty and the pursuit of happiness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners point out that there is mounting evidence 
between animal abuse and domestic violence and violence against 
people in general.  Essentially the Criminal Code regards animals 
as property and offences against them as little more than 
property offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In contrast to other countries, Canadian laws in this area have 
remained largely unchanged since 1892.  Therefore these 
petitioners call on parliament to work toward swift and effective 
action to modernize Canada's laws dealing with crimes against 
animals and that the penalties for such actions be made strict 
enough to act as a deterrent against such behaviour.

successfully transplanted recognize the importance of this life 
saving treatment, the bioartificial kidney. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They point out that inadequate dialysis service exists across

<P><A NAME="LINK30"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is with considerable pleasure 
that I rise to contribute to third reading deliberations on Bill 
C-65 which proposes to amend the Federal-Provincial Fiscal 
Arrangements Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As hon. members know, the legislation essentially involves two 
federal programs: the provincial personal income tax revenue 
guarantee program and the equalization program, each for an 
additional five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The major portion of the bill deals with the equalization 
program, a program that is really the fiscal cornerstone of 
Canadian federalism.  Hon. members also know and are aware that 
the commitment to equalization payments is enshrined in the 
Constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Payments under equalization go essentially to the heart of what 
it means to be Canadian.  The payments provide provinces that are 
less well off with the resources they need to deliver reasonably 
comparable public services, including health care, to the their 
people without having to tax excessively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Equalization has been a long tradition.  It was established as a 
program in 1957 and has been continuously renewed and improved 
ever since. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's commitment to equalization is clearly evident 
in the fact that this program is one of the few to be exempted 
from the restraint measures that took place some five years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the next five years it is projected that the payments will 
be $5 billion higher, including increased payments due to the 
technical improvements worth an estimated $700 million over this 
same period.  Further, last month's budget showed that payments 
would be even higher this year as well.  Current year payments 
are expected to reach $10.7 billion and that is up $2.2 billion 
from the 1998 budget estimate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that these transfers are indeed very significant. In 
1998-99 they make up between 14% and 42% of total revenues of the 
recipient provinces.  These payments are unconditional. This 
means that receiving provinces can use them as they wish. 
Experience has shown that they play a significant role in 
improving the quality of a wide array of public services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently seven provinces benefit directly from equalization 
payments:  Newfoundland, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, New 
Brunswick, Quebec, Manitoba and Saskatchewan.  There are also 
indirect benefits for all Canadians as well. 
We all benefit from knowing we live in a country where health 
care, education and basic public services are provided at 
essentially the same levels in all provinces.

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In renewing the equalization program the bill proposes a package 
of improvements.  These improvements aim to ensure the program 
continues to accurately measure the revenue raising ability of 
each province.  The proposed modifications will be gradually 
phased in over the next five years so the impacts on provinces 
are smoothed over.  In addition this will give federal and 
provincial governments time to plan for changes in the amounts of 
transfers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What will make this happen?  There are three components to the 
equalization renewal package proposed in the bill.  First the 
equalization legislation renewal for five years provides a secure 
planning framework for receiving provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, equalization ceiling and floor provisions are improved. 
The ceiling provision provides protection to the federal 
government against unexpected increases in equalization payments. 
In other words, this prevents changing economic circumstances 
from unaffordably driving equalization payments through the roof. 
The new ceiling will be set at $10 billion in 1999-2000 and will 
grow by the percentage change in gross domestic product 
thereafter.  This change will ensure the program remains 
affordable and sustainable over the five year renewal period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The floor provision is the other side of the coin.  It provides 
protection to the provincial governments against unexpected large 
and sudden decreases in equalization payments.  The new floor 
will be applied equally across all receiving provinces and will 
reduce fluctuations in floor protection that can result from 
application of the equalization formula during a period of 
economic change.  What does it mean?  It means more predictable 
protection for provincial governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third change is that improvements will be made in the 
measurement of the ability of provinces to raise revenues on 
their own.  The equalization formula measures the provincial 
revenue raising capacity by looking at over 30 different 
provincial taxes and comparing those results to a standard.  It 
is on the basis of this formula driven exercise, and the formula 
is applied equally to all provinces, that the size of 
equalization transfers is calculated for each province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know the taxation environment is not static.  It changes 
and the changes proposed in the bill are needed to ensure that 
the equalization program reflects existing provincial tax 
opportunities and practices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The changes in measurement which will be implemented through 
regulation relate to five tax bases that require significant 
improvements and other tax bases that require technical changes 
because of revised or new data.  For example, changes are 
proposed for the measurement of the ability of provinces to raise 
sales tax. The new tax base will now reflect the taxing practices 
of those provinces that have moved to a value added tax, as well 
as those that have maintained retail sales tax systems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly, because of increased activity in related games of 
chance, the treatment of revenues that flow from them needs to be 
updated.  Currently the equalization program only measures 
provincial ability to raise revenue from lottery ticket sales. 
The proposed changes will take into consideration the ability of 
provinces to raise revenue from casinos and video lottery 
terminals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition a number of resources such as forest products and 
natural gas will be measured according to value rather than by 
volume as is currently the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It bears repeating that these modifications will happen 
gradually.  The proposed tax base changes would come into effect 
in stages over the five year period.  This renewal caps more than 
two years of consultation with the provinces.  Considerable 
technical work was performed by both the federal and provincial 
officials and then that technical work was reviewed by ministers 
of finance at both the federal and provincial levels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to review the equalization program on a regular 
basis to assess accurately what change is needed.  I submit to 
the House that this has been done.  Bill C-65 was introduced in 
the House at the earliest opportunity.  It is important to 
remember there are a number of other inputs like the Statistics 
Canada reports which contribute to the final outcome of this 
review.  As is sometimes indicated by members of the opposition, 
the government did not drag its feet on the bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Passage of the bill continues a Canadian tradition of providing 
and showing that we all care deeply about the well-being of 
residents of provinces that are less well off than others.  The 
renewal we are considering will provide substantial and reliable 
support.  The legislation intends to see that we maintain the 
fairness with which the equalization program is delivered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot stress enough the importance of the legislation.  It 
continues a Canadian tradition of generosity and fairness.  I 
believe all members know this.  The agreement, as all members 
know, expires March 31 and must pass in both the House and the 
Senate.

legislation because I know that it is the kind of legislation all 
members of parliament can support.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is a pleasure to rise on behalf of the official opposition to 
address Bill C-65. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the benefit of the people who are watching this debate on 
television, Bill C-65 is an equalization agreement that will 
transfer somewhere in the range of $50 billion to recipient 
provinces over the next five years.  This is a huge expenditure 
for the government.  The Reform Party, the official opposition, 
believes very strongly that because it is such a huge expenditure 
it deserves a tremendous amount of scrutiny, all the scrutiny we 
can bring to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition attempted to actually bring forward some 
amendments at report stage.  Unfortunately there was a mix-up and 
we were unable to introduce those amendments.  Chief among them 
was an amendment that called for public consultation between the 
year 2001 and the year 2003 so that the public would be involved 
in making decisions about the equalization program which have a 
profound effect on their lives both as recipients and as people 
who pay taxes to support the program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We urge the government to seriously consider the recommendation 
of the official opposition and allow the public to become 
involved in the decision making process on a program that is a 
very large expenditure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party criticizes the equalization program on a couple 
of counts.  First, we believe the formula that is used to 
determine how much money is paid in and how much money goes out 
to recipient provinces is simply inaccessible to most people. 
During the finance committee hearings when Reform members asked 
finance department officials who in Canada understood how this 
system worked, the witness representing the finance department 
looked at his colleagues and said “We do”.  I think that is 
really the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A $50 billion expenditure that very few people in Canada really 
have a handle on lends itself to problems.  It lends itself to 
governments using the formula in ways to manipulate it so that 
they can get more revenue.  We believe that already occurs to 
some degree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There needs to be some discussion on ways to make the whole 
formula more transparent so that we can ensure there is no 
jiggery-pokery and that everything is on the up and up, something 
we are not convinced of right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other criticism we level is we are not certain in a country 
as rich as Canada that we really need to have a system where 
three provinces support seven.  We would argue that it may be 
time to start looking at ways to change the balance so that it is 
four or five supporting five or six, depending on how we do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those things need to be debated in the future.  We need to find 
ways to ensure that the public has some input into this issue 
because it has such a profound impact on people's lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is called the equalization program.  As my colleague in 
government mentioned, it is enshrined in the Constitution. 
However I do not think it meets most people's definition of what 
equalization would mean to them.  Most people would think of 
equalization as being equal opportunities. 
I think that is the way a lot of people would think of 
equalization if they heard it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we need to point out here is that the equalization program 
provides money for recipient provinces so they can use it to 
ensure there is better health care in those provinces where they 
do not have a big tax base and better schooling and that type of 
thing. That is well and good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In so many ways this equalization program simply does not meet 
the standard that a lot of regular folks have which is wanting 
equal opportunities.   They do not just want money going to the 
provincial governments so they can have better schools. It cannot 
end there.  What people want in Canada is an equal shot.  They 
want an equal opportunity to make a living, make a life, have a 
job, to raise a family and do the things that people in some of 
the wealthier provinces maybe take for granted today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We feel the equalization program simply falls short.  It does 
not go far enough.  It is a huge expenditure but it does not go 
nearly far enough.  We are not advocating spending more money. 
Not at all.  In fact the contrary.  As members know, the Reform 
Party advocates keeping the size of government in check.  We want 
a small government.  We want lower taxes and a program of debt 
repayment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I argue that if we really want to help people in those recipient 
provinces, we need to take seriously the discussion that is 
occurring around the world about how we really do improve 
productivity.  I can assert that it is not through huge 
government intervention.  That is not the way we do it.  The way 
to do it is to keep government in check, to lower taxes and to 
pay down debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party argues that a dollar left in the hands of an 
investor, a taxpayer, a business person, a homemaker is far more 
productive than a dollar in the hands of a bureaucrat or a 
politician. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to encourage the government to open up the debate and 
let us have the bigger discussion about what will really help 
people all across this country in the recipient provinces under 
equalization but also in the paying provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to go a little farther afield if I might in discussing 
this equalization bill.  It occurs to me that there are really 
two ways we can organize a society.  We can, and this is the 
traditional way, organize a society on the basis of voluntary 
relationships, voluntary exchange.  Around the world for 
thousands of years that is how it has worked.  There have been 
some big exceptions to that but by and large, given their 
druthers, people choose to associate with each other on a 
voluntary basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If somebody has some wheat to sell and they want some cloves and 
someone else has cloves they undergo a voluntary transaction and 
everybody is better off.  That is the way civil society has 
worked for a long time.  Relationships are formed with other 
people on a voluntary basis.  That is called civil society and 
many groups spring up in that kind of milieu that support and 
enrich civil society.  Families are a part of civil society.  We 
need a larger civil society if we are to create the type of 
prosperity that I and the official opposition in general believe 
we need in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another way of organizing society is by coercion whereby the 
government tells us how to do things.  Sadly there are many 
episodes in history where governments have taken total control of 
society and have impelled people to do things they do not want to 
do but nevertheless had to do because the government had the 
exclusive monopoly on the use of force in some societies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not suggesting for a moment that our government is like 
that.  I do think our government organizes society in Canada far 
too much on the principle of coercion. This holds back our 
ability to create the type of prosperity that Canadians want and 
also the other types of ideals that Canadians believe in 
strongly. If we believe in compassion, tolerance, security, then 
the answer is to increase the size of civil society, voluntary 
relationships, not to make government bigger and compel people to 
do things. 
That is how we create a sense of community and real compassion 
and real tolerance.  Ultimately that is how we create the 
prosperity that gives people security.  I think this government 
is going completely the wrong way.

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to illustrate what I mean by that and provide some 
evidence by pointing to the last budget.  Over the last several 
years the government has been in the situation where it has been 
basically faced with almost bankruptcy.  We came very close, I 
think colleagues in the House would acknowledge, to hitting the 
debt wall.  My friend laughs but I think in 1995 we were pretty 
close to that.  I think there is even some agreement on that on 
the other side of the House.  I believe I have heard colleagues 
on the other side say exactly that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last several years the government has restrained its 
spending somewhat.  That is laudable even though we believe that 
it restrained it in completely the wrong areas.  It restrained it 
in areas that were the highest priority to Canadians instead of 
cutting bureaucracies and cutting the size of the machinery of 
government.  Having said that, it did shrink the size of 
government somewhat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we see the government, the moment it has some kind of 
surplus, embarking again on expanding the size of government. 
Bureaucracies are starting to get bigger again. We are seeing the 
government expend money on things that simply are not priorities 
for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think if my friends across the way were pushed on this 
could argue that some of the new expenditures are priorities.  I 
think they would have to agree.  My friend says name one.  I 
would be happy to do that.  I think it is a waste of money in a 
time when people are really hurting to start spending money on 
television production funds.  I think that is a good example of 
how the government is spending money in a wasteful way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As it increases the size of government, and remember it was 
supposed to spend $104.5 billion this year, according to its 
numbers the government is already $7.6 billion over budget.  The 
government has gone away over budget.  If the head of a 
corporation went that far over budget of course they would be 
fired for doing that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government did that.  In doing that, not only does it start 
spending away the surplus and people's tax relief, the money they 
so desperately need right now, it also gets its fingers into all 
aspects of people's lives where it simply does not belong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, we have the government coming into people's lives saying 
you will do things this way and if you do not, you will not get 
the reward.  I want to give my friend across the way an example. 
Probably the best example is what is going on in the House these 
days with respect to family taxation.  The government has decreed 
and actually made it worse in this last budget that if a person 
chooses to send their children to professional day care, they 
will get a tax break for that. That is fine. That is laudable. 
What the government refuses to do is give all Canadians a tax 
break irrespective of how they look after the children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government uses coercion.  It says the only way you can keep 
your money is to do it our way.  The only way of doing it is to 
send your children to institutional day care.  If you choose to 
look after your children yourself, we do not recognize that.  We 
do not see that as being valuable.  That is essentially what the 
government is saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We argue that is completely the wrong way to organize society. 
Let Canadians have those choices. Canadian taxpayers do 
extraordinarily complicated and sophisticated things every day. 
They run their households, they run their businesses, they raise 
their families.  Let them have the choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members across the way are clapping.  I am thrilled to see 
that.  I see we are getting some support from government members 
for our message.  It is about time that they are waking up to 
that.  We will give them the chance to actually put their money 
where their mouth is tonight when the whole issue of family 
taxation comes to a vote in the House of Commons.  We certainly 
hope they will stand up for families, for single income families, 
all families struggling so much today with the high tax burdens 
we face in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to continue down the track I started on where we were 
talking about how this government uses coercion so often to get 
people to do things that it thinks are right but which ordinary 
Canadians do not necessarily agree with.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend says regulation.  It is not regulation.  Let me give 
my friend an example.  In western Canada today if people grow 
wheat they have to sell their wheat to the Canadian Wheat Board. 
They do not have a choice.  I think my friend across the way 
would acknowledge that.  My friend in the NDP thinks that is a 
good thing.  My friends on the other side of the House do not 
understand that farmers do very complicated and sophisticated 
things every day.  They market all kinds of other commodities. 
They simply want the choice.  They do not need that nanny state 
telling them what they have to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give members another example.  I am a broadcaster by 
trade.  I used to run a radio station.  If someone wants a 
license to run a radio station in Canada today they have to agree 
to a certain things.  They used to have to play 30% Canadian 
music. That is now going up and up.  A listener's choice is to 
either turn the radio off or pick up a signal from somewhere 
else, maybe over the Internet or from a radio station south of 
the border.  That is absolutely ridiculous.  Let people make 
those decisions themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday we saw Alice Munro, a great Canadian writer, who 
received an award in New York, recognized as a great writer.  She 
did not regulation to be recognized as a great writer.  My 
friends in the NDP and the Liberals seem to think that is 
necessary to help Canadians along.  I argue that very often what 
happens is that these regulations hold people back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we want to talk about recording artists, there are many 
Canadian artists who have gone south of the border.  They have 
completely forgone spending any time in Canada.  They have gone 
to the U.S. and made huge careers down there.  They obviously saw 
the opportunity there.  They did not need the 30% content 
regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Terri Clark comes from my riding of Medicine Hat.  We are very 
proud of her.  She has become a huge superstar in country music. 
Shania Twain is another example. These people went directly to 
where the music industry was and became huge superstars.  They 
are Canadian and I am very proud of them.  They did not need the 
nanny state to baby them along. They do not need that because 
they have talent.  Every time this government gets a chance to 
impose more restrictions on people and to coerce people it does 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Look at Bill C-55.  This is a good example.  If an advertiser in 
Canada wants to advertise in <I>Sports Illustrated</I> they cannot 
do it unless they go to the United States and buy an ad that they 
will have to pay for to go all around the world.  If they are 
advertising from my home town of Brooks, Alberta they probably 
cannot use all those people around the world.  They probably do 
not need to reach them.  The government has said that under Bill 
C-55 the only way they can advertise in <I>Sports Illustrated</I> 
is by buying that huge circulation which they can never use. 
Essentially it is telling people again how to run their lives.  I 
think people get a little sick of this.  They are grown up.  They 
know how to run their lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are saying get government out of their face.  Let us shrink 
the size of political society, the coercive state, and enlarge 
the size of civil society where people exchange goods on a 
voluntary basis, where they form relationships on a voluntary 
basis, where they are allowed to be free to do what they want as 
long as they do not harm one another.  I think that is the way 
most people would like to see society run.  Sadly at every 
opportunity this government expands the reach of government.  It 
is completely wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is fine to talk about what the government does wrong.  As the 
official opposition we have a duty and obligation to say how we 
would do it, how we would ensure prosperity for people across the 
country.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I guess we should be addressing the equalization issue because 
that is the bill we are debating.  Let me first talk about how we 
can improve things for the provinces that currently receive 
equalization payments, for the people who pay into equalization 
through their taxes and for the three provinces that kick in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should point out that many of the people in those provinces 
which pay are themselves not well off, but they have to pay taxes 
for equalization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Do you support equalization? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  My friend asks if we support 
equalization.  I made it clear that we do support equalization. 
However, that does not mean we would not find ways to improve it 
or even shrink its scope so that it is not three provinces 
supporting seven, but maybe five supporting five or something 
like that.  Nevertheless, we support it in principle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me go a little farther down the road that I started on. We 
want to come up with a way that goes beyond equalization that 
would help all Canadians.  We believe the way to do that is to 
keep government small in a large civil society and in doing that 
produce the type of prosperity that will leave everybody better 
off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should give Canadians the real security they want.  The way 
to do that is to hold the line on spending, not increase it and 
go over budget by almost $8 billion like this government did this 
year and last and which it will again do next year.  It has 
already upped the amount it wants to spend for next year.  We 
think that is completely the wrong approach, especially at a time 
when the world is so volatile. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We say that we should hold the line on spending.  We should 
reallocate resources from low priority areas like a television 
production fund or some of the grants that go to big business. 
We actually have a WTO ruling against Canada because of some of 
the grants that have been going to big business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should take some of the money the government uses to 
intervene in the economy and give it back to people in the form 
of more money for health care, as well as an investment in 
defence because the department of defence has been basically 
emasculated by this government.  There have been examples in the 
newspapers lately of how the Canadian military has really paid 
the price for Liberal neglect over the last many years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also believe it is time to begin finding ways to reinvest in 
our justice system.  We have a situation now in British Columbia 
where the RCMP is really in a desperate situation.  We need to 
reallocate money from all of the areas that I have alluded to so 
that we can have more money for high priority areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second step is to begin using some of the surpluses that are 
going to be a lot bigger now that we are holding the line on 
spending, somewhere in the range of $43 billion to $45 billion at 
the end of three years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just so my friends across the way know, many economists around 
the country have pointed to that sort of approach as the best way 
to ensure that the Canadian economy is better off.  I point to 
recent studies that come from the C. D. Howe Institute which 
suggest that massive tax relief is in line for what ails the 
Canadian economy these days.  We agree with that.  We think it is 
the right approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are going to run big surpluses over the next three years if 
we hold the line on spending.  There are two things we think need 
to happen with those surpluses.  First we need big time tax 
relief.  The Reform Party is arguing for $26 billion in tax 
relief over the next three years.  That will mean that many of 
those single income families that we are talking about will be 
much better off.  In fact a single income family of four earning 
$30,000 a year would receive $4,600 in tax relief under that 
plan.  It would mean a lot of money in their pockets and really 
would contribute to giving them the type of security they need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If people are in recipient provinces like Newfoundland, New 
Brunswick or even Manitoba, under that plan they would receive 
much more money in their pockets instead of having all the 
efforts of the government going to just giving money to another 
level of government. 
This money would go directly into the pockets of people who are 
scraping to get by these days, who really need the help.  They 
have paid the price for successive Liberal and Tory governments 
that have raised taxes incessantly over the last 15 or 20 years. 
Now it is time for some real tax relief.

<A HREF="#LINKT9"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know my friends across the way will say that they gave them 
some tax relief in the last budget.  But by the time we figure in 
the increases in CPP premiums and the fact that the government 
has not bothered to do anything about the deindexation of the tax 
system, Canadians will actually be $2.2 billion worse off over 
the next three years.  Canadians end up a lot worse off even 
after the government's tax proposal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We say let us change all of that.  Let us leave Canadians $26 
billion better off.  We have enumerated a number of ways we would 
do that.  We would raise the basic personal exemption to $7,900. 
The married exemption would be raised to $7,900 so we would not 
have the discrimination that we have now against single income 
families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would change the child care tax deduction to a credit that 
would be extended to all families, irrespective of how they look 
after their children.  That would ensure that some of the feeling 
which a lot of single income families have, where they feel the 
government does not value their parenting, would disappear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  That's not true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  My friend across the way on the 
Liberal side said it is not true, but I am simply saying that is 
how people feel.  My friend may say that he does value parenting 
and that is fine, but actions speak a lot louder than words.  As 
my friend knows because he is a parliamentary secretary for 
finance, we have had people come before the Department of Finance 
for years to say that it is time to end discrimination against 
single income families in the tax code.  We agree.  It is time to 
do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It cannot end there.  We have to lower the tax burden on two 
income families because they pay way too much in taxes.  Our 
proposals would do that because, again, we want to lift the 
exemptions.  We want to eliminate the 3% and the 5% surtaxes. The 
government has started on the 3%.  We want to completely 
eliminate those and we also want to start to lower the marginal 
rates.  In fact we would eliminate the top marginal rate of 29% 
and take the 26% rate and start to lower it as well so that 
ultimately everybody would be better off.  We want to end the 
deindexation of the tax system which takes $1.1 billion a year in 
a secret tax increase from people's pockets.  That would end 
under this plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have offered a whole bunch of ways that, through the personal 
income tax system, we would leave people better off.  But we 
would also take the money that is currently paid into the EI 
fund, the huge overcommitment that employers and employees make 
every year, which is about $7 billion, and give it back to folks 
because it is their money in the first place.  We think it 
belongs to them.  That is the other area where we would help 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, we would cut the capital gains inclusion rate in half 
because we believe that we need to give an incentive to investors 
in Canada.  So often today in Canada people buy, for instance, a 
revenue property.  When they do that they are essentially 
ensuring that there are rentals around the country for people on 
lower incomes.  Right now there just are not enough rentals, so 
we need to give people incentives to do that.  But what happens 
is, if their property only keeps up with inflation in terms of 
the amount of money they get back from it in the form of a 
capital gain, for instance if they make a $1,000 on a property 
and it is all inflation, they still have to pay a capital gain on 
it.  We say that is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we want to help people in Atlantic Canada who get 
equalization today, the real way to help them is to ensure that 
their tax burden goes down.  Our proposals would leave about $1.5 
billion a year in the pockets of people in Atlantic Canada alone. 
That would really help folks a lot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We encourage the government to consider that the debate is much 
broader than equalization.  If we really want to help people we 
think it is important that the government find other ways of 
doing it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The good news does not end there.  In this plan we would also 
start to pay down the debt.  There would be $17 billion in debt 
repayment over the next three years.  We point out that this is a 
complete departure from the government approach. 
The government approach is to ad hoc it.  The government's own 
budget documents show the debt being static at $579 billion over 
the next three years.  It says that if it has any money left 
over, if it does not blow the contingency reserve fund, it will 
use that to pay down a bit of the debt.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think Canadians really want to pay down the debt in a serious 
way.  They understand in their own lives that having a lot of 
debt threatens their ability to fund their household.  In Canada 
today we have debt payments of $40 billion a year.  The single 
biggest cheque the finance minister writes every year is for 
interest on the debt.  We argue that to help folks we should not 
make them pay so much every year out of their tax dollars to go 
simply toward servicing the debt.  If we start to pay down that 
debt people will have more money in their pockets and they can 
make decisions about their lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our program would pay down $17 billion over the next three 
years.  We also have a longer program that would see $240 billion 
paid down over the next 20 years.  We believe the debt issue is 
that serious that we need to pay it down in that manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Equalization is a program that is necessary in Canada.  We wish 
we did not need it, but unfortunately it is necessary.  It is 
also in the Constitution.  We think it could be changed quite a 
bit to make it a better program, but the debate really cannot end 
there.  If we really want to help people there is a much better 
way of doing it than simply throwing money at it through 
equalization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The best possible way to help people is to leave more money in 
their pockets.  Let them make decisions about their own lives.  I 
guarantee that if we allow that to happen they will make far 
better decisions than the government.  Who knows better what is 
best for their families?  Is it the finance minister, the 
heritage minister or the prime minister?  I do not think so. I 
think it is individual Canadians.  They understand better what is 
important to their families.  So leave the money with them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that we see the complete departure of the Reform Party from 
other parties in this place.  We believe that money belongs to 
the people who have earned it in the first place, and it should 
stay there.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, 
NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I may not seem enthusiastic, but I am 
enthusiastic.  Under this exterior of certain calmness and 
seriousness I am very excited about the possibility of speaking 
to Bill C-65 which concerns equalization payments in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This defines what is best about being a Canadian.  It defines 
what is best about being a country like ours.  I liken it to a 
family.  A well-functioning family, as opposed to a dysfunctional 
family, is a family that cares for all of its members.  If one of 
the family members is having a difficult time the family rallies 
around and does whatever is necessary to help.  When another 
member is having a difficult time or runs into some difficulties 
or problems, the whole extended family rallies around. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what distinguishes effective families from those which 
are less effective.  It distinguishes an outstanding family from 
those we call dysfunctional.  Today's discussion reminds me of 
one of those very functional families, the best of families, a 
family that cares about all of its members in a real and 
demonstrable way.  Of course in our society that is normally in a 
financial way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill really says that those provinces which are doing very 
well for whatever reason, be it location, an abundance of natural 
resources or whatever the advantage, are seriously prepared to 
assist those having difficulties or those that are less 
fortunately endowed in terms of natural resources, location, 
financial resources or whatever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does that tell us about our country?  I suspect it is the 
kind of characteristic that attracts people from all over the 
world who want to live here. 
They know no matter where they live in Canada, whether it is in 
Atlantic Canada, the north, south, east, west, central, wherever, 
that being a Canadian citizen means relatively the same thing. 
They would have access to the same kinds of services.  They would 
have access to relatively the same kinds of opportunities, 
whether it is university or college training in Cape Breton, Nova 
Scotia or Victoria, British Columbia.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Access would be relatively the same. One of the ways we 
accomplish that is through programs like equalization.  Clearly, 
when it comes to the vote on this bill, the New Democratic Party 
caucus members in the House of Commons will be voting 
enthusiastically in favour of the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a matter of fact, the very concept we are talking about 
today, equalization payments in Canada, is part of our 
Constitution.  It is written right into the Constitution.  It is 
what Canada is all about. The Constitution says reasonable and 
comparable services no matter where they live.  What a glorious 
phrase.  What a glorious statement to hold up to describe what 
being a Canadian is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  It is heartwarming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  My friend next door says it is 
heartwarming and indeed it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Equalization is a fundamental principle that is very much part 
of what makes Canada a compassionate and caring society.   Surely 
that is one of the crucial measurements of a country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened with interest, as I always do, to my friend who spoke 
earlier.  He made the case that less government is a better 
country.  I thought about countries around the world where there 
is very little government. Normally they are not very pleasant 
places to live. As a matter of fact, countries that have very 
little government, that have downsized their government, are 
brutal places to live. Often it reflects a society that is 
uncaring particularly of those less fortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously we seek to find a balance. When I think about 
equalization enabling us to be a compassionate and caring 
society, what better society could we be part of than one that is 
actually compassionate and caring for all its citizens?   One of 
the reasons we are all proud to be Canadian is that Canada is 
that kind of country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not to suggest that this bill is perfect, not by a long 
shot. There are many ways that we can improve Bill C-65 and 
improve the whole issue of equalization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What demonstrates this is that most in the House of Commons have 
tried to figure out what this bill actually does. We have tried 
to look at the formula used for equalization. I am not a 
brilliant person.  I am probably not even that smart but I am not 
a stupid person.  Quite frankly, I cannot figure out how this 
thing works. I have asked many others how this equalization 
formula actually works.  I have not found anybody who could 
explain it to me in a way that I could understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There must be somebody somewhere who understands it. When the 
question was put in committee, it was fascinating. The question 
was put to the experts from finance. How many people actually 
understand the equalization formula used between the federal 
government and provincial governments? The answer was perhaps 
five people in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know who those five people are but there are probably 
five people in Canada who actually understand how this bill 
works. That is one of the real downsides of this because we are 
being asked to approve a formula.  We are being asked to approve 
legislation, approve a concept that nobody fully understands. 
That is not what this place is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is imperative that members of parliament understand how the 
equalization formula is applied so that we can judge it.  Is it 
the appropriate formula?  Are there more appropriate ways to 
decide who gets what in terms of where they happen to live in 
Canada, what province gets an equalization payment and which 
province would pay one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is one major flaw, it is that it has become so 
complicated, convoluted and complex that no one really 
understands how the system works today. We assume it works well. 
We know that all the provincial finance ministers and officials 
met regularly for five years to try to figure this thing out. 
They have come up with some kind of plan which they say on 
balance is effective and the best deal they can come to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To be fair, the province of Manitoba has some concerns about 
this formula which now involves 33 different criteria. When it 
first started a few years ago, there were only three criteria. 
The three criteria were personal taxes, corporate income taxes 
and succession duties.  That was it.  That was fairly easy to 
figure out.  Everyone could say that the provinces that are 
getting a certain amount based on this formula makes sense and 
the ones which are not getting anything also makes sense because 
they are doing relatively well.

<A HREF="#LINKT12"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now there are 33 separate revenue sources ranging from income 
taxes to insurance premiums, from property taxes to payroll 
taxes, from sales taxes to sin taxes.  It goes on and on. Experts 
from the provincial finance departments and experts from the 
federal system get together on a regular basis and fine tune it 
so that everyone can agree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Manitoba, as I said, has some disagreements but it will have a 
chance to sit down soon and start to renegotiate from its 
perspective a fairer system.  Everyone says that is fair enough 
and they will proceed with this understanding.  While Manitoba is 
not delighted about this, it understands that in the end it will 
be okay as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I might mention that because of the flooding situation Manitoba 
experienced, the collection of income taxes was disrupted. 
Consequently the formula that was used to determine this year's 
transfer to Manitoba was based on erroneous information that 
could not be avoided.  With any luck this will be readjusted 
later this year so that Manitobans will get a fair deal in the 
end as well. That is my understanding.  From what I can gather, 
everyone has enough faith in the system to say that will actually 
take place, including the people from Manitoba. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I get into some of the more substantive comments about 
the legislation, there have been some changes in criteria.  There 
have been many changes but I am going to identify two or three of 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One is the recognition that a good revenue source for a lot of 
provinces is gaming.  It seems that video terminals, VLTs, and 
casinos are turning up on almost on every street corner. For some 
provinces they are a major source of revenue. For others they are 
not a major revenue source yet. For British Columbia it is not a 
major revenue source yet, but apparently it is taking steps to 
expand its casino base, as those who have read the newspapers 
recently are probably aware.  Other provinces are as well. Since 
gaming is a significant revenue collector, it has now been 
factored in as a new criterion to be considered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the fine tuning, as a member of parliament from British 
Columbia, I appreciate this one perhaps more than people from 
other parts of Canada who are not so closely attuned to the 
timber base.  In the past the criteria has been based on the 
volume of timber. We realize that volume of timber is not 
necessarily an accurate reflection of the revenues collected from 
timber sales. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some timber is a poorer quality than other timber.  Others are a 
higher quality. It is going to be based on the value of timber 
products.  If a province is collecting a certain amount of money 
in terms of value obviously makes a lot more sense than a 
province which is collecting less or more but the volume is quite 
different.  Value as opposed to volume when it comes to things 
like timber makes sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at some of the purposes of this program. The program 
of equalization is an effort to reduce disparities among the 
provinces' revenue raising abilities or fiscal capabilities. The 
equalization payments compensate provinces for the differentials 
in their tax bases. That is straightforward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The program allows for the less prosperous provinces to provide 
public services of a quality and at taxation levels comparable to 
those in other provinces.  Again, to come back to the idea of 
being a Canadian citizen in this part of Canada or that part of 
Canada, it  ought to mean about the same thing. That is the 
reasoning behind the program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill represents a completion of negotiations that for the 
most part have been about what constitutes this tax base. The 
legislation represents over two years of discussions with federal 
officials and various levels of provincial people, including all 
provincial finance ministers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Herein lies a rather annoying element.  It is not a major 
criticism; it is an annoying point that I have to raise, which is 
that we have been rushing this through the system.  One of the 
reasons this has become an issue today in terms of how long the 
debate should be, it that it has to pass before the end of this 
month.  We knew that five years ago. 
We knew it three years ago, four years ago, one year ago. 
Negotiations have been for the last two years and have taken a 
little longer than expected.  We are up against the wall.

<A HREF="#LINKT13"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is pushing us saying that this bill has to pass. 
It should have had more serious consideration, but this goofy 
time system made it problematic for us.  In my judgment, we are 
rushing this and we ought not to be rushing it.  It is too 
important. Perhaps what we can do the next time around is try to 
get at this issue earlier than at the eleventh hour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The equalization transfers are calculated according to a formula 
set out in the Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements Act. 
Therein lies another area which requires some consideration as 
part of an ongoing examination of this process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of the various tax bases that determine the bottom line 
for the provinces, there is ongoing discussion and debate on the 
makeup of these tax bases.  As I indicated, Manitoba is not a 
happy camper at this point, but it accepted this and assumed that 
things will be sorted out shortly.  Not just assume, Manitoba 
knows things will get sorted out shortly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members have probably looked at the figures that have come out 
from the finance department which project, as best as people are 
able to project, over the next number of years how each province 
is going to be treated. In my recollection I think every province 
that collects money now from the equalization program will see 
their collections expand over this period of time.  But the 
reality is if a province becomes hotter in terms of its economic 
base and things turn out better than expected, those numbers will 
be adjusted downward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a funny thing. There is a lot of history attached to these 
programs.  I am an amateur historian by interest and I was 
looking over the Saskatchewan equalization payments.  Lo and 
behold there was a history story. I noticed that in the past the 
province of Saskatchewan sometimes never received any 
equalization payments. My friend across the way will know this as 
well.  Some years Saskatchewan received some, some years it did 
not.  Some years it received a lot. This seemed odd because other 
provinces seemed consistently to be either haves or have nots. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wondered why there was a pattern and Saskatchewan got 
equalization payments some years and other years did not.  Lo and 
behold there was a direct correlation.  The years when 
Saskatchewan worked its way out of needing an equalization 
payment, guess what political party was in office?  The New 
Democratic Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The New Democrats balanced the books, heated up the economy, got 
things moving well and then for whatever reason, they were kicked 
out of office. Then Liberals were elected or Conservatives were 
elected or Reform, I guess we could use that generally as well 
and they got the province into trouble.  The books got out of 
whack and the economy went into a nosedive and Saskatchewan 
required equalization payments again.  People got fed up with 
that, tossed them out of office and brought in the NDP again. 
Everything gets back in order and the equalization payments 
evaporate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting when we see political history as reflected in 
the economy and reflected now in the history of the equalization 
payment program for Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me talk about some of the purposes behind this program.  I 
mentioned the fact that only five people know what this is all 
about, which I think tells us a great deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Six now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  Six, after my presentation.  That is 
very encouraging. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The equalization program dates back to 1957 when only three 
sources of revenue were identified.  I mentioned them earlier: 
personal and corporate income taxes and successive duties.  The 
revenue base is expanded now to 33 and I mentioned what some of 
those tax areas are.  There is a list in the legislation and it 
is a bit of a shock to read all of the different tax bases that 
exist in the provincial jurisdiction. I recognize only a few of 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 1982 budget I remember Allan MacEachen introducing a 
change to the system where the national standard of 10 provinces 
was replaced with a five province standard.  At that time the 
situation in all 10 provinces was considered.  Mr. MacEachen then 
changed it to only a five province standard.  It was felt that 
Alberta on top with its oil revenues and the Atlantic provinces 
on the bottom skewed the national standard so much that the five 
in between provinces of Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan 
and B.C. replaced this national standard.  It was done.

<A HREF="#LINKT14"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, after all is said and done there can be no disputing 
that it is all about the bottom line situation and that is how 
much each individual provinces gets under the operating formula. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This implies that along with the very basic financial need there 
have always been some very serious political considerations 
applied in reaching agreement on these transfer payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We remember with interest how when the information came to the 
province of Newfoundland about the change in equalization 
payments and that this was to bump up the payments to 
Newfoundland all of a sudden, bingo, Brian Tobin had a balanced 
budget.  That was helpful presumably in the days just before the 
election in Newfoundland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Politics does play a role because there has to be agreement with 
the provincial jurisdictions and I guess whenever agreement is 
sought politics is certainly an element of consideration at 
least. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned already the timing of this situation.  To suggest a 
few weeks of consideration at the tail end of the process for 
parliament is simply inadequate.  I propose that rather than look 
at this every five years we should look at this annually.  This 
should go to the finance committee on an annual basis with a 
thorough briefing so that it is parliament that plays a 
meaningful role in this equalization process as opposed to simply 
bureaucrats from the federal and provincial governments involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is fair to say without being overly critical of the political 
element that we really have not had an opportunity to deal with 
this adequately and effectively to ensure that what we are 
agreeing to here today is in the best interest of the country. 
We assume it is because of what people tell us but I do not think 
we have an adequate grasp to make that decision comfortably 
ourselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be better to communicate these changes on an annual 
basis rather than at the end of the five year cyclical renewal 
period.  I agree with the points made in the 1997 auditor 
general's report on equalization.  It made a number of 
recommendations that encouraged an improved a more important role 
for parliament in the renewal process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, in his report to parliament he made the point that 
a very clear statement of the objectives of the program ought to 
be made so that it would be perfectly clear in everybody's mind 
what is behind all this.  Someone may say it appears perfectly 
clear.  We have just gone through a federal budget where there 
were a number of changes to the transfers to provinces, another 
form, I suppose, of equalization.  We appreciate now that the 
government is moving to a per capita system with those transfers 
for health, education and social services. This will change 
things.  I am not even certain people know that has happened, 
that it is moving toward a per capita basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the changes to the transfers from the federal government to 
the provinces combined now with the equalization program, what 
does it mean in terms of the provinces?  This gets more 
complicated and it seems to me we need to look very carefully at 
what the objectives of this program now are in light of the 
changes being made to the federal transfers to the provinces and 
perhaps, more important, to have a clear understanding of what 
the expectations of these transfers are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened with alarm to my friend from the Reform Party when he 
made his presentation in terms of how he sees the world and how 
he see what Canada ought to be.  I respect his view but it is 
totally different from mine.  I wonder if it is clear what we 
expect from these equalization payments in terms of how they are 
spent.  Let us face it, when the money goes to the provinces it 
is just handed over.  There are no strings attached.  It is done 
in good faith, here is the money and you folks deal with it as 
you wish or deem appropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such an important program is trying to create a level playing 
field for all citizens in Canada. I hate to use that term because 
it conjures up the wrong things.  We ought to make that very 
clear, that we have some expectations in terms of what the moneys 
from these equalization payments ought to be attached to and then 
have a very clear, acceptable and understandable way of reporting 
the results from these expectations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could apply this to most federal programs in the system where 
there is little clarity in what we expect from this program and 
certainly very little reporting on how we reach that expectation. 
A best example of that would be the tax system. We have had a lot 
of tax discussion in the House during the last little while and I 
do not want to get into it at this point.  It would be 
inappropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is curious to think about is if we took every significant 
tax expenditure program and applied to that a cost benefit 
analysis to the country of who benefits, how much, what is the 
point of this, what is the goal and how effective is this in 
reaching that goal. I wonder how many of those tax expenditures, 
or as the Minister of Finance even now calls them, tax loopholes, 
would continue in the system. 
My guess would be very few.  I suppose they had laudable goals at 
one point but there was never any measurement put into the system 
and I suspect most of them have long outlived their usefulness. 
However, that is a little beside the point.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The resource revenues that are now part of the new formula will 
reflect the value rather than volume in resources, including 
timber, which I mentioned earlier, as well as gas and oil 
receipts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The recipient provinces such as New Brunswick and Quebec are 
satisfied with this formula for calculating forestry revenues 
because the old formula overestimated provincial fiscal 
capacities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the whole issue of oil revenues, there has been another 
change to acknowledge that new oil is more expensive to extract 
than old oil.  This now also is being reflected in this new 
formula so that those parts of Canada now that are relying on 
revenues from a new oil source as opposed to an old oil source 
will have much higher levels of expense.  That reality will be 
reflected now in these new categories as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned gaming already.  The one thing we overlooked in this 
gaming business, acknowledging that revenues from gaming will be 
an important part of any province's revenue base, is the cost 
associated with gaming.  Let us face it, when a whole lot of 
people are gambling in one province, a lot more than in another 
province where the facilities are less accessible, there will 
probably be a lot of people having troubles.  I am referring to 
gambling addicts and that sort of thing where there are a lot of 
costs attached to provincial jurisdictions as a result of dealing 
with gambling addicts and losses attached to that sort of thing. 
That is something we want to look at in the future in terms of 
fine tuning this process of the complicated base. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, recognizing that there are floors and ceilings in 
this to help out and there are seven provinces eligible for 
equalization payments, not British Columbia, Alberta and Ontario, 
the equalization transfers for this year ensure that all 
provinces with average tax rates have revenues of $5,431 per 
person in order to fund public services.  Most provinces are very 
supportive but Manitoba has some concerns. I will leave it at 
that and I look forward to the vote later today. 
<P><A NAME="LINK33"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
with pleasure that I rise today to speak to the equalization 
issue and to Bill C-65. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Equalization is a cornerstone of Canadian social policy.  I 
believe most members of the House recognize that the free market 
system is a viable and important system for all Canadians to 
improve their qualities of life individually and collectively. 
The free market system will work only if all Canadians have 
access to the levers of a free market system and have approximate 
equality of opportunity across this country, regardless of where 
they live, and that is what equalization is all about.  The 
concept of providing effectively level taxation or similar 
taxation and similar levels of services across this country is a 
cornerstone of Canadian social policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a reflection of this importance, equalization is the only 
transfer program that is actually enshrined in the Constitution 
act.  The goal of equalization, of providing equality of 
opportunity across Canada, is extraordinarily important.  We 
should also recognize that a goal of equalization should be to 
provide a ladder for provinces and individuals in those province, 
those recipient provinces, to rise from their status as recipient 
to the point that they can participate in the free market economy 
fully. The equalization system should under no circumstance 
provide barriers to success, roadblocks to success for 
individuals and provinces as they try to bootstrap themselves 
into a more prosperous economy.

<A HREF="#LINKT16"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of my concerns about Bill C-65 and the equalization formula 
is that there are direct disincentives for recipient provinces to 
improve their economies.  For instance, in provinces like Nova 
Scotia and Newfoundland, which have the potential and will be 
enjoying increased resource revenues, those resource revenues 
will come off equalization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has addressed the issue partially by phasing in 
these clawbacks in equalization over a five year period, but five 
years is a very short period of time in terms of the development 
of economies.  It took more than five years for the economies in 
Atlantic Canada, for instance, to develop negative spirals 
downward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will take more than five years for Atlantic Canadian 
economies to participate fully in the Canadian economy and to 
achieve the level of prosperity that other regions of the country 
take for granted.  Yet the government has only partially 
addressed the issue of disincentives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government needs to encourage provinces to pursue economic 
activities that will bootstrap individual provinces into 
prosperity.  Instead there are roadblocks to success. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This situation and how equalization provides these disincentives 
is somewhat analogous to the issue of single parents in any 
province who are on social assistance and who have an opportunity 
to work and succeed but see a direct financial disincentive to 
participating in or pursuing activities and taking a job because 
the government puts in place a direct disincentive through the 
tax system for them to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a perverse way our equalization system, as it is formulated 
now, can actually create and encourage a continued reliance and a 
continued roadblock to success for these provinces.  That is 
perhaps the most fundamentally important issue in equalization 
which has not been addressed and needs to be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I am sharing my time with the hon. member for 
Richmond—Athabasca.  I should have mentioned that at the 
beginning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another important criticism of the equalization program made by 
the C. D. Howe Institute has some merit.  The C. D. Howe Institute 
has argued that poor citizens of rich provinces sometimes 
transfer money to rich citizens in poorer provinces.  An example 
of this is an east Vancouver family living in poverty may end up 
paying money that will ultimately benefit an affluent Westmount 
family.  That is one small nuance but one detail that has been 
ignored by the government in terms of the revision to 
equalization through Bill C-65. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that equalization is based on, to a certain extent, the 
assessment of a province's capacity to produce in terms of 
revenues from the final product reduces the incentives for 
provinces to produce value added products.  To actually add value 
and develop a better secondary manufacturing system within the 
provinces is reduced by equalization.  Provinces are encouraged 
to sell raw resources in many cases as opposed to trying to add 
value in their province and create jobs and employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is perverse.  It is one way that the federal government, 
through a lack of leadership and vision, continues to promote 
policies that are flawed and are not providing the best possible 
opportunities for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One area in which I have significant concern is population as a 
basis for cost of services.  Equalization distributes the funds 
to the provinces on a per capita basis. For a province like 
Newfoundland, which has seen a significant exodus of people over 
the past several years and it is predicted to continue for the 
foreseeable future, it is grossly unfair and inconsistent with 
the principles of equalization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The actual fixed costs of providing services such as health care 
and education in a province, even when the population decreases, 
remain fairly consistent for a long period of time because of the 
fixed nature of those costs.

<A HREF="#LINKT17"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would like to see in an equalization formula some accounting 
for the actual cost of delivery of services.  Both Germany and 
Australia take into account the actual cost of delivery of 
services.  Some of the socioeconomic factors, some of the 
demographic factors and the rural-urban make-up are issues that 
should be considered in equalization, not purely population as is 
proposed here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the biggest flaws in the whole equalization argument has 
been around the issue of transparency.  The fact that the 
government in recent weeks has engaged in a meaningful effort to 
dialogue and debate on equalization and on this fundamental 
issue, a program that costs $9 billion per year, is indicative of 
the government's continued knee-jerk, crisis management 
reactionary style of government.  There is no vision.  We may 
have a budget surplus but there continues to be a leadership 
deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are concerned by the fact that the government, instead of 
debating the issue and discussing the issue over the past five 
year and trying to come up with a equalization plan that provides 
all regions of the country with opportunities to succeed, 
continues with the same old, tired policies that we need to 
revisit.  If we are ingenuous about giving opportunities to 
recipient provinces and if we are ingenuous about eliminating 
barriers to success, it will take more than a few hours of debate 
in the House of Commons and some witnesses appearing before the 
House of Commons finance committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of gambling revenues is another important one.  Bill 
C-65 will take into account gambling revenues in the provinces. 
The fact is that many of the social costs of gambling are 
provincially borne costs, whether in health care or in social 
program spending.  This could have a very negative impact on 
provinces that currently benefit from gambling revenues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need a new visionary approach to equalization, a new 
equalization program that provides a ladder to success and not 
barriers to success as this one does.  We believe in 
equalization.  Our party believes that an equalization program is 
necessary and that we should continue to protect and encourage 
equalization as a tenet of Canadian social policy.  We can make 
it better as parliamentarians.  In that light I would move:

“that” and substituting therefor:

</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-65, an act to amend the Federal-Provincial Fiscal 
Arrangements Act, be not now read a third time but be referred 
back to a committee of the whole House for the purpose of 
considering amendments to clause 2 to alter the equalization 
formula to fairly take into account the varying costs of program 
delivery in different provinces because of differing 
demographics, geography and urban-rural variations in addition to 
population; and to clause 2(2), which would eliminate the current 
disincentives for recipient provinces to improve their finances 
through innovative economic policies.

<P><A NAME="LINK35"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I heard 
part of the member's speech while I was in my office.  I missed 
some while en route and heard the end of it while I was here. 
There may be some gaps and perhaps he has addressed this point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a very simple question.  The Conservatives were in power 
for nine years.  During that time there were, as with this 
government, no substantial changes made to the equalization 
program.  There was no concerted effort to fix up the problems in 
it and to try to make it a true equalization payment system 
instead of what it has become.  I wonder whether this represents 
a new thrust on the part of the PC Party or whether it just wants 
to gloss over the errors of the past.  I am asking a sort of 
rhetorical question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am really intrigued with the idea that the Tories now want to 
basically scuttle the bill in order to send it back to committee, 
which would mean it probably would not meet the deadline for 
continuing the payments to the provinces.  Is he actually 
interested in scuttling it or in revamping it?  What exactly is 
his purpose? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question 
of the hon. member for Elk Island.  He is quite right that the 
Conservatives should have been in government a lot longer to 
pursue these types of important policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure if he had longer to ask his question he probably would 
have pointed out that the Progressive Conservatives were very 
busy making structural changes in the Canadian economy including 
free trade, the elimination of the manufacturers sales tax, 
deregulation of financial services, transportation and energy, 
those policies that ultimately enabled the government opposite to 
eliminate the deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate the hon. member's intervention.  I would hope, 
perhaps with his support and the support of members sitting with 
his party, that we could return to the days when we had an 
extraordinarily active public policy government that actually 
developed visionary changes necessary for Canadians.  Right now 
it is not happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure if the member had longer to ask his question he would 
have pointed out the fact that there has not been a single 
visionary policy from the Liberals since 1993.  It has been a 
status quo, caretakership government without vision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure if he had longer to ask his question he would have 
pointed out the fact that the former Progressive Conservative 
government was busy making important structural changes and if it 
would have had just a little more time it would have probably 
pursued the necessary fundamental changes we are discussing as 
the Progressive Conservative Party of 1999. 
<P><A NAME="LINK36"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills—Grasslands, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, would the hon. member care to elaborate further on the 
Conservative economic policies which he is lauding and which I 
believe led to a doubling of the national debt and an increase in 
the annual deficit to something in the order of $42 billion a 
year? 
It brought in the wonderful GST which we all love so much!  Was 
this visionary?  I would like to hear more about this because it 
gives me a thrill to hear about these so-called wonderful 
policies that wrecked the Dominion of Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  Mr. Speaker, perhaps it is a generation 
gap but the hon. member prefers to focus on the past and I prefer 
to focus on the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that in 1984, if the hon. member checks his facts, 
the Conservative government inherited a $38 billion deficit in 
1984 dollars.  It was a far higher deficit than what the 
Conservatives left in 1993 at $38 billion.  In fact as a 
percentage of GDP that deficit was almost half, from 9% of GDP to 
about 5%.  Government program spending was reduced from where it 
was growing by 15% per year to zero program spending growth by 
the Conservatives that recognized the importance of debt and 
deficits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1988 the hon. member's party started attacking these policies 
by dividing the right in Canada.  It ran a candidate—I think 
this gentleman is now the leader of the party he decided to wind 
down—against the current leader of our party on the free trade 
debate and split the right on the fundamental issue of free 
trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very sad that members of his party not only choose to 
focus on the past instead of the future, but even when it does so 
it does not have its facts straight.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Bachand (Richmond—Arthabaska, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
nice to see the Progressive Conservative Party knows how the 
House operates.  We have introduced motions here to try to 
improve Bill C-65, while the Reform Party has been saying this 
morning that they would have liked to but did not know quite 
how, they did not have the time and they sort of got sidetracked 
in the procedure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We manage to do it and it makes for a good debate so that people 
understand what C-65 is really all about.  So we are proud to do 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What must be remembered in the motion we put forward is that we 
are attempting to improve Bill C-65 quickly. 
A Reform member was saying that it might be too late, but we 
were talking about the committee of the whole House, not a 
committee outside this chamber.  It is the committee of the 
whole where we can assure all the provinces, including 
Newfoundland, Nova Scotia and Quebec that—in the last part of 
the motion, it is mentioned—should there be some extra money, 
they will not be penalized by the equalization payments 
immediately, but they will be able to spread it out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what we talked about in committee.  There was a 
discussion of spreading it over five years.  Various formulae 
were discussed.  Unfortunately, that is not in Bill C-65. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Kings—Hants provided an example to help 
understand it. 
The analogy I will now make may not work perfectly, but it will 
allow members to understand what I am geeting at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we do not pass the motion moved by my colleague, the member 
for Kings—Hants, the provinces will find themselves in a 
situation something like that of a single parent family on 
welfare.  A job means the immediate loss of the so-called 
benefits of the social assistance system, such as drug and 
dental plans, rent to income accommodation, and so forth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We now know that several provinces, including Quebec, have 
decided to lessen this impact.  We would have liked to see Bill 
C-65 take the same approach so that a province that put a lot of 
energy, and often a lot of money, into developing its primary 
and natural resources would not immediately be penalized.  We 
would have liked Bill C-65 to take a much more logical approach 
with respect to what could happen in provinces now facing more 
of an uphill battle than others but wanting to do better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that all members will support this motion, especially our 
Reform Party friends who, having been unable to come up with 
good amendments for the provinces, can turn to us.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-65 talks about equalization.  When I was younger, I viewed 
equalization as a Robin Hood situation, where the government 
took from the rich and gave to the poor.  This is the simple 
explanation of a system that unfortunately can have its negative 
side, as C. D. Howe pointed out.  That gentleman wrote an article 
in which he said that Canada's equalization system consisted of 
taxing low income Canadians in the have provinces to cover part 
of the cost of transfer payments to high income residents in the 
have not provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One must be very cautious about examples referring to Robin Hood 
or C. D. Howe, for fear of running down a system that does, when 
all is said and done, work well.  Even our friends in the Bloc 
Quebecois have said so on a number of occasions. In fact, their 
silence today is probably an indication of this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the C. D. Howe example, a poor family in a rich 
province is likely to have access to assistance from that 
province, because it has the means.  Care must therefore be 
taken not to criticize a system that works rather well, when all 
is said and done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The equalization payment system has been in place since 1957. 
It is an unconditional transfer to the provinces, one with which 
the provinces are generally in agreement.  Some provinces even 
have their own equalization system because there are not only 
national disparities, but also provincial, regional and local 
disparities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, for several decades Quebec had an equalization 
system based on the federal system, as far as its philosophy and 
calculations go.  It used an overall taxation rate, based on a 
standardized municipal property value, and thus enabled the 
province to help the least advantaged to get through some hard 
times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This changed in 1979. Today, the program scarcely exists any 
more in Quebec; nevertheless, the philosophy of richer regions 
helping poorer regions works very well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have never heard it said in Quebec that a poor family in a 
rich region was providing help for a rich family in a poor 
region.  To say so about a system that works very well is pure 
demagoguery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hopefully, Bill C-65 can be improved to help the poorest regions 
and bring hope to the poorest people. 
As I said earlier, the amendment moved by my colleague will be a 
tax incentive to regions starting to make a go of it, without 
penalizing them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is wonderful to see all members in agreement.  This morning, 
I listened to the Reform Party finance critic, who spoke at 
great length but did not actually say anything useful.  He said 
that they would do things differently.  More than once, he 
commented on how it did not make sense for three provinces to 
pay for the other seven.  He thought it should be five or six 
paying for three or four. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How is this any different?  This is not how the equalization 
system works. 
But, according to the Reform Party, it is because things are 
going well for them in two of the three richest provinces, and 
they would like to do well in the third.  It is not by getting a 
greater number of provinces to pay for a smaller number that the 
Reform Party will increase its chances of winning the next 
election.  They are busy creating a new party and trying to come 
up with a good platform for the next election.  We know this 
will not fly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The equalization system must continue to improve.  That is why 
the legislation is reviewed every five years.  That is why the 
federal and provincial governments are in constant contact, to 
monitor the situation on an ongoing basis so that every five 
years action can be taken to smooth out inequalities in the 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From three or four criteria in the late 1950s, we now have more 
than thirty today. 
This may be complex, but the tax base has broadened and changed, 
and new tax methods have been introduced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The leader of the Reform Party said in his speech that he did 
not understand, that Canadians did not understand.  It may not 
be just equalization payments they do not understand. They 
perhaps do not understand their tax return either, and that is 
why there are accountants.  The Reform Party does not understand 
and that is why it is dropping in the polls.  The fact that some 
folks do not understand does not mean that what they do not 
understand is not good for others.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The tax base has changed, it is better.  And that is why we went 
from three or four items to 30.  We hope it is not to complicate 
things, but to be fairer and more equitable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, 10 or 20 years ago, there were no casinos. 
Revenues from casinos were not taken into account.  Why? 
Because there were no casinos in Canada.  There were community 
bingo halls, but no casinos.  Now revenues from lotteries and 
games are taken into account in the analysis of equalization 
payments.  Has it made the system more complex?  No, I think it 
is an element to be taken into consideration.  Not including it 
would penalize the regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why they think there is a change, but the change must be 
toward really helping, ensuring that equalization payments are at 
the heart of a country, and of a province and a region.  They 
must serve the purpose for which they were initially intended—to 
help the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must make sure that, in the regions, in spite of their 
difficulties and differences, people can enjoy basic services, 
framework and support equivalent to that of others in this 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same thing is done provincially.  Quebec did it for decades. 
It is understandable.  It is a principle.  We could call it not 
the Robin Hood of Canadian taxes, but simply charitable, 
logical.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to ask the member a question with respect to the province of 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know Quebec has been a part of Confederation since the very 
beginning.  It is one of the oldest provinces.  It contains 
one-fourth of the country's population.  It has a hardworking 
population.  It has a fair number of natural facilities.  It has 
a lot of natural resources.  It has a strong agricultural 
community.  It has a vigorous people and yet year after year 
somehow it needs money from Ontario, British Columbia and Alberta 
in order to finance the basic programs for its people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member have any hopes, any dreams for the country, that 
the province of Quebec, one of the strongest provinces in the 
country, will eventually become self-sufficient and be able to 
provide for its own citizens from its own revenues?  Is that an 
anticipation or are we really looking at perpetually having the 
other provinces support this very vigorous province? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason I ask has to do with the whole basis of equalization. 
It seems the formula used is such that it demeans the people of 
Quebec by making them dependent on the rest of the country and 
does not provide for them an opportunity to be self-sufficient. 
I would like to see that happen.  I wonder what the member has to 
say about that.  I would appreciate his comments. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Bachand:</B> Mr. Speaker, at the beginning of the hon. 
member's speech I was surprised, extremely surprised, very 
pleased even, to see that a Reform member was showing an 
interest in Quebec.  This was a surprise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the end, however, I had seen through his question to the 
cynicism that lay behind it.  In fact, I find the way he 
presented it somewhat patronizing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is as if Quebec were not entitled to its share in this 
country.  I would remind hon. members that Alberta once received 
equalization payments.  According to the Reform's principle, the 
provinces are equal when that suits them, and unequal when it 
does not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec is entitled to the same treatment as all other provinces 
in this country, no more and no less.  Like any other province 
in this country, moreover, Manitoba, Newfoundland, or whatever, 
it is entitled to respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem with Reformers is that, every time there is a 
minority somewhere, a province or group that is different from 
them, or what have you, they start saying “It's not right; they 
are getting preferential treatment”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec is taking its proper place, and may it be given the 
freedom to do so.  Quebec, francophones, minorities, will most 
certainly not be able to take their proper place with the Reform 
Party, but thank goodness, that will never happen.  Thank 
goodness, the Reform Party will never be in power.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This country is blessed.  Proof of that blessing is that, in the 
next election, the Reform Party is likely to have far fewer 
seats than it does today.  Quebec will take its place in an 
atmosphere of respect, and not of cynicism, particularly from 
the Reform Party.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour (Beauséjour—Petitcodiac, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it is unfortunate having the Reform Party as the official 
opposition.  The Liberal government implements Reform Party 
policies.  When I heard the member say how he wanted to give 
more power or autonomy to Quebec, I was concerned, because I 
come from the Atlantic region where help is needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Atlantic region is part of Canada.  I think some people in 
this House forget that.  If the Reform Party were in power, it 
would abandon these regions and its responsibilities toward 
them.  I would like to know whether my Progressive Conservative 
colleague agrees with me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Bachand:</B> Mr. Speaker, I agree with 99% of my NDP 
colleague's remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party said it wanted to give greater autonomy to 
Quebec, but that is not the point.  The only way Reform would 
have a mathematical, theoretical or even political hope of 
forming a government is if Quebec did not exist, if there were 
no francophones, including Acadians.  The Reform style is to 
divide and conquer.  It is Machiavellian.  It is cynical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member's party and our own share the representation in 
the maritimes.  They are the access for the development of this 
country and will surely not be the exit for the Reform Party. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK40"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
honoured to stand in the House to represent the people of the Elk 
Island constituency which I would venture to say is the best 
constituency in the whole country.  I also say I have the best 
woman in the world as a wife. I hope that everybody else would 
say “no, it's my wife”. I really love my constituency and the 
people in it. They are very good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also represent the province of Alberta which has been a net 
payer into the system except for one occasion approximately 30 
years ago when it received a very small equalization payment in 
one year.  In the broader sense I represent the people of Elk 
Island but also the people of Alberta who have a very great 
interest in how their money is spent. This money is taken from 
them through the coercion of taxation and they have every reason 
in the world to demand accountability on how that money is spent. 
I am here to represent not only my riding but the province of 
Alberta. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I really am sorry that the member from the Progressive 
Conservative Party who answered my question totally misread it. I 
asked what I thought was a decent question that could have 
addressed the question of the mathematics and the formula used 
and whether equality is really equality. The member debased 
himself into an answer with political rhetoric.  The NDP member 
joined in on it.  Somehow they think by oft repeating this 
message Canadian people will believe it. That is just not true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People in my riding want to keep this country together.  I 
suppose one of the reasons the support for me and our party out 
west is so strong is that we are the only party that has ever 
come up with a decent plan for keeping this country together, 
reaching out to Quebec in a tangible way, trying to meet its 
needs and aspirations which this Liberal government and the 
Conservatives before it rode over roughshod.  We are reaching out 
to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people criticize us because we occasionally have dialogue 
with members from the Bloc. I think it is about time we dialogued 
with all people of Quebec. A fairly good number, 50%, have been 
sending separatists to the House of Commons and to the provincial 
legislature in Quebec.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That sends a very strong message.  There is trouble in Ottawa. 
It is time to address it honestly and try to find a solution to 
it.  Instead, what we get is this attempt by the Liberals, and 
now the Conservatives who have joined in, to crawl over each 
other and put each other down.  They do not want us to work 
together.  They want power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know whether this is going to be misunderstood, but I 
do not want power at all.  I have no need for it.  My ego does 
not require this kind of a cheap ego trip.  I want to serve the 
people of Elk Island, the people of Alberta and the people of 
Canada.  Unless we are going to write off Quebec like these other 
parties are doing, that includes an honest and open dialogue with 
the people of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question to the member was very clear and explicit.  Does he 
have a hope that Quebec, with its vigorous population, its 
strengthened natural resources and all of its other amenities and 
strengths, will ever become independent in the sense that it will 
be able to row its own canoe and be financially independent?  I 
would hope so.  That would be my desire for every province in 
this country, and it is certainly true for the province of Quebec 
as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I reach out to them because I believe that we need to do what we 
are proposing in the new Canada act.  We need to make sure that 
we listen to and obey the Constitution of the country which puts 
a lot more responsibility with the provinces and gives them the 
freedom to run their programs.  That is what the original 
Constitution envisioned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Successive Progressive Conservative and Liberal governments have 
chewed away at that, primarily by the use of spending power. 
They tax all Canadian citizens individually.  They tax individual 
businesses.  They do not tax the provinces.  They tax the 
taxpayers.  They then turn around and with all of this money that 
they have in their pockets jingling away, they take it and put it 
into wherever they think it should go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have no objection to the principle of equalization.  In fact 
if I were to get this debate right on stream, I think it is 
appropriate for us to once again read the principle of 
equalization that was adopted in the Constitution Act, 1982. This 
is something I believe we could support wholeheartedly, provided 
it is done properly.  Section 36(2) of the Constitution Act 
reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliament and the Government of Canada are committed to the 
principle of making equalization payments to ensure that 
provincial governments have sufficient revenues to provide 
reasonably comparable levels of public services at reasonably 
comparable levels of taxation. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I doubt if there are very many Canadians across the country who 
would disagree with that as a principle.  There may be some, but 
I am not one of them.  I am one who believes in lending a hand of 
help to people who are truly in need.  Later on I will address 
how we actually determine this equitability or equality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The principle of every citizen in this country having access to 
education and to be not denied the right to extend their 
education beyond high school because of financial restrictions is 
a principle that I would endorse most wholeheartedly along with 
99.99% of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unconscionable that we have in this country a two tier 
education system, thanks to Progressive Conservative and Liberal 
governments, where the people who come from rich families can 
march right out of high school into post-secondary institutions. 
Because they are rich they have the money to pay the big tuition 
fees, the big cost for books and all of the other expenses that 
are involved.  For many Canadians it involves living away from 
home while they are going to school.  If they are rich they can 
afford it.  But what happens if they are poor?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the years governments have deteriorated the transfer of 
funds to the provinces, which they should not have been into in 
the first place, but they got into it by use of the spending 
power.  When they did that originally it was for a good cause and 
it was done well.  The principle was that no one in the country 
should be denied the right to post-secondary education because 
they could not afford it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government taxed the money from all of the people 
and from all of the businesses.  Then it paid the money back to 
the provinces so they could provide educational facilities at 
reasonable cost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the mid-fifties and early sixties I was a university student, 
a recipient of that largesse.  I am grateful to this day.  It was 
a wonderful privilege.  I was the first member of my family—and 
I have mentioned before that I am a first generation Canadian—to 
go on to university.  What a privilege it was to be educated and 
then later on get into the business of education so that I could 
pass on the knowledge which I had gathered.  I believe in that 
principle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do we have now with this Liberal government?  The 
government has a fancy scheme of putting students into 
interminable debt.  When these students graduate from school they 
will have a debt as big as half a mortgage on a house. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Shortly after I graduated my wife and I got married and started 
a household.  In today's world, if a young couple were to do 
that, together their debt load for their education on average is 
equal to the debt of buying a house.  How are they going to also 
finance a house?  How are they going to finance the starting of 
their business, be it a law practice, a dentistry practice or 
whatever it is?  They cannot because they have so much debt. They 
are in debt federally because their share of the federal debt is 
$20,000.  They are in debt provincially because all of the 
provinces have been going into debt.  They are in debt personally 
because they have encountered all of these wonderful student 
loans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I really believe that we ought to look at that again.  I do not 
believe that we are investing properly in our young people.  I 
believe that if equalization payments are to be made from the 
federal government to the provinces it should be done in such a 
way that it helps those who are in need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think about health care.  Every once in a while we hear of 
people, in fact too frequently, who because they are rich can 
afford to go to the United States to get superb health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know of a family who lives in my community.  It is actually a 
very sad story.  This young married man, who has a couple of 
children, was feeling tired.  His mother was also not feeling 
well.  But they could not get any proper diagnosis in our health 
care system.  First, they wait six months to get in line.  When 
they do get into the health care system there is inadequate 
equipment.  Many of the really skilful medical practitioners have 
gone off to the United States where there is more money available 
for their research and for them to be able to practise their 
profession. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people, because they had the means, went to the Mayo 
Clinic.  Unfortunately my friend was diagnosed with MS, which is 
a very serious disease.  They could not even figure out what it 
was here in Canada.  Fortunately he had enough money to go there. 
He also took his mother along.  Unfortunately they diagnosed a 
terminal disease and she has now since passed away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We often hear the hue and cry “We don't want a two tier health 
care system”.  The fact of the matter is, we have it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government started out with a good principle. 
The principle was to make equalization payments so that people in 
the different provinces could have an equal level of services 
without undue taxation. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1210"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT25"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the federal government originally brought this in it funded 
50% of health care costs.  It did that quite consistently for a 
few years.  Then payments started to decrease.  I do not know if 
my number is accurate, but a number which I heard recently put it 
as low as 13%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, we are still being taxed.  Nobody in the country 
feels that their tax rates have gone down, notwithstanding what 
the Minister of Finance says.  If we look at our bottom line at 
the end of the year we realize that the average family has, as 
the statistics from Statistics Canada show, a take home income of 
$3,000 a year less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are still being taxed to the hilt, but health care is no 
longer being funded adequately.  What the government has done in 
the present budget is woefully inadequate in terms of restoring 
what it should be doing relative to the original purpose of 
equalization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two issues.  One is to provide comparable levels of 
services at reasonably comparable levels of taxation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the equalization plan do? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know whether people who are watching on CPAC or even 
members of the House are aware of this, but one of the strange 
things is that both the provincial and federal governments tax 
individuals and businesses and then the federal government pays 
some of the money back to the provincial governments directly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Originally that was to be done without strings attached, 
recognizing the legislative and the constitutional right of the 
provinces to manage these affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I found a really interesting quotation in the report of the 
auditor general.  One of the recommendations in that report came 
from the Rowell-Sirois commission which was formed in 1937.  That 
is interesting because it happens to be two years before I was 
born.  It was a dominion provincial relations commission.  One of 
its recommendations was that the dominion government should make 
annual national adjustment grants to the needy provinces.  The 
report went on to describe that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then the commission wrote that the grants would be unconditional 
and the provinces would be free to decide how to spend them or 
whether to use them to reduce provincial tax rates.  In other 
words, the principle of equalization was embodied in the report 
of 1937. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Have we lived up to that?  No.  Now we have a top-down, 
heavy-handed federal government saying to the provinces “We will 
give you the money”.  But are there strings attached?  Big time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My province of Alberta, which as I said in my introduction I am 
here to represent as well as all of Canada, has been dinged 
several times.  Even though this was its own jurisdiction 
according to our Constitution, the federal government, utilizing 
its arbitrary and heavy-handed ability to spend the money it 
taxes, simply withheld funding from the Alberta government's 
portion of health care.  That is unfair.  It is wrong.  It is 
illegal, but no one stands up to the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we have the separatists.  Liberal members cannot figure out 
why they are here.  They shake their heads.  Instead of trying to 
ask the question “Why are they here?” they continually accuse 
them.  I will not do that. I will not accuse the separatist 
members for being here.  Their people back home sent them here. 
As far as we know the elections were fair and square and the 
ballots were properly counted.  There are enough people out there 
who say “We are so fed up with Ottawa that we want out of this 
thing”.  That is terrible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know of several families whose children have left on very, 
very bad terms.  It is painful.  Those parents hurt when that 
happens.  We as Canadians all hurt when somebody leaves or 
threatens to leave.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not end up criticizing them, bawling them out and yelling 
at them.  We sit down with them.  We want to talk to them.  We 
want to find out what are their true legitimate grievances and to 
solve them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has happened with the Liberals?  Over and over all they 
have done is added more grievances to their list.  That has to 
come to an end.  It has to be communicated to the people of 
Quebec so that they will send people here who want to work with 
the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Notwithstanding some of the political rhetoric we get around 
here, and I say this as humbly as I possibly can, I believe that 
the Reform Party and the principles we espouse contain the seed 
of the grand reconciliation we need so desperately in the 
country.  Then we can say to the people of Quebec and to all 
other provinces that we will respect the Constitution and make 
sure they have the right to manage their affairs properly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I speak to the equalization bill I believe we need to get 
back to the principle which says that we tried to reach an 
agreement with the provinces so that their people could have the 
same level of services in education and particularly in health. 
When we think of welfare, public services like national highways 
and roads and so on, there are huge costs of running provincial 
governments.  There is absolutely no problem on the part of the 
Reform to say that those who are truly in need should be able to 
have those needs met. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last minute I would like to say something about the 
formula.  Given that we are admitting we will do that, how do we 
determine what is equitable?  That is the problem.  The 
legislation requires that the act be renewed every five years. We 
have known since 1994 that this would expire in 1999.  What did 
the government do?  Two or three working days before it was 
introduced in the House we were given notice of it.  Then the 
government almost immediately invoked closure.  It had to push it 
through because it had to be done by the end of the month.  I 
agree with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I disagree with the amendment we are speaking to which says we 
will basically hoist it.  I do not think we want to put the 
provincial governments into such a disaster as the Progressive 
Conservatives would propose with their amendment that would not 
give them these payments.  We need to have a longer process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I propose that we ought to do that.  The next process should 
start as soon as this one is renewed.  Let us hear from some 
academics.  We heard some very excellent witnesses in committee. 
Let us have some academics to answer these— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I am afraid I must 
interrupt the hon. member at this point because his time has 
expired. 
<P><A NAME="LINK41"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills—Grasslands, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I hesitate to get into a wrestling match with one of my 
colleagues, particularly the member for Elk Island.  I have a 
problem with his proposal as it affects equalization specific to 
the province of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my humble belief, if we are to have good relations with 
Quebec and get back to some degree of amity with that province, 
that the best way to do it is to revert to the terms of 
Confederation, to the initial British North American Act, which 
clearly defined the rights and responsibilities of the provinces 
and the federal government and apparently with which all parties 
were quite happy 130 years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we get into targeted payments for health and education we 
are in effect overriding the original intent of the BNA act. 
Would it not be more in keeping with the spirit of Confederation 
if equalization payments were non-targeted and were ultimately 
based, as they are now, on income levels in the concerned 
provinces based on productivity?  We can jigger the formulas and 
put in as many variables as we like, but ultimately they are a 
measure of productivity and per capita income.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why not have totally non-targeted contributions from the federal 
government to the alleged have not provincial governments, rather 
than specifying this is for health, this is for education and 
this is for whatever? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Madam Speaker, my hon. colleague from 
Saskatchewan happens to be, by the way, the MP for my parents and 
from the area where I grew up.  We actually have no differences. 
Because of the limitation of time I only had 20 minutes and I 
could not really get into the details of that.  I was saying 
that.  The one quote I read actually specified that provincial 
governments could even use it to reduce their provincial tax 
levels if they wanted to, total unfettered use by the provinces. 
Yes, I am totally in agreement with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting also that a number of witnesses appeared 
before the committee on Bill C-65.  One of them was Dr. Boothe 
from the department of economics at the University of Alberta who 
held that view very strongly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know whether I am permitted to do any free advertising 
here, but there is a book available.  I know I cannot display it 
because that would be considered a prop, even worse than the 
flag, possibly.  There is a book written by one Dr. Dan Usher. He 
is a member of the economics department at Queen's University. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He gave us a very good presentation in our committee.  Dr. 
Usher's book is entitled <I>The Uneasy Case For Equalization 
Payments</I>.  He addresses both the question of the principle of 
equalization and the question of the formula.  Many speakers said 
that we should base it on per capita income, average per capita 
income across the country, and that for those provinces which are 
sufficiently low on a per capita income provide some sort of 
rebate to the provinces to equalize it.  In other words, it would 
top them up a bit so that they are not substantially 
disadvantaged because they live in a very poor province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those issues require a long term debate.  That is why I would 
like to see the government do something.  In the report I 
mentioned, the government said that we should discuss it, have a 
longer term, come up with a white paper and have some technical 
input.  We just barely got started in committee and it was done 
because it was rammed through so fast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could see after we started that the debate should probably 
last a couple of years.  We could hear from different academics, 
those people who think about these things, and think the thing 
through.  Let us analyse it.  Let us look at the different 
options.  Let us choose the best one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I anticipate that the next round of negotiations will come about 
in another five years.  It has to be done every five years. 
Perhaps by then we would be ready to bring in a new equalization 
formula which is open, which is transparent and which provides 
for accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the beginning of my speech I said the taxpayers in my 
province, because they are not eligible for equalization grants, 
have a very large interest in making sure that their money is 
properly spent and well accounted for.  It cannot be done with 
this legislation because the formula is convoluted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the finance committee I asked a witness how many people in 
Canada knew how the formula worked.  He looked to his left and 
his right, because he had two or three officials with him, and 
said “We are all at the table here but I am not sure they all 
know exactly how it works”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not right.  We cannot have accountability to taxpayers 
when we have that kind of formula.  They try to figure out, for 
example, with the new legislation what is the fiscal capacity of 
a province on lottery revenues and on gambling revenues.  It has 
many variables. It has to do with how much money is available. It 
has to do with the psychology of the fact that very often people 
who have less money available are more likely to spend money on 
lottery tickets for that little glimmer of hope.  It has to do 
with some people who have a deep philosophical conviction with 
respect to gambling and will not participate in it, so we get 
into the psychology of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does this group that determines the equalization payment really 
think it can get into the heads of the people in Manitoba and 
determine why it is they are not buying enough lottery tickets? 
If they did they would have this much income and therefore would 
be cut out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does my hon. colleague know that the province of Manitoba will 
lose in equalization entitlements under the act about $50 
million? 
There are other areas where equalization entitlements go up a 
bit, so the grand difference to Manitoba would be about $37 
million.  However it will lose $50 million.  It would be getting 
$87 million if it were not for the fact that it is penalized 
because the people of Manitoba are generally too smart to buy 
lottery tickets.  That is unconscionable.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley, 
Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I listened with interest to a number of 
previous speakers from a variety of parties putting forth their 
ideas.  I am a little confused, I must say, about their 
positions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Kamloops who represents the New Democratic 
Party said that his party would support the bill, that it thinks 
it is worth supporting.  Yet I heard him give a whole list of 
issues with which he had a problem.  I am a little confused as to 
why the New Democratic Party would be supporting it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I never got the impression one way or another whether members of 
the Conservative Party are supporting it although they did put 
forward a motion that the bill should go to committee.  They do 
not want to debate it at third reading or have a vote at third 
reading.  They want to put it before the committee for further 
study.  As I continue I may reflect on other things I heard from 
various speakers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will address the question of what is equalization, what it 
means.  There is not a Canadian who does not believe in the 
concept of equalization, that those provinces with a greater 
ability to provide a certain level of services should help those 
provinces without the ability or capacity to deliver the same 
level of services.  The concept of equalization is supported by 
most Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The difficulty we get into is in applying this concept in 
legislation.  Many speakers before me have talked about the 
complexity of it.  They have said that the formula was so 
“complex, complicated, convoluted”, to quote my colleague from 
Kamloops, that people do not understand what it is or how we try 
to level the playing field between provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Elk Island sat on the finance committee when 
the bureaucrats came before it to talk about equalization 
payments.  The bureaucrats admitted that they were probably the 
only ones who understood what the formula was all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As has been mentioned by others, it is very distressing that 
there is a handful of people, if that, who understand how the 
government is spending Canadian tax dollars.  Canadians would be 
concerned that there may only be a handful of people who 
understand how the government is spending tax dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not talking about a few tax dollars.  We are talking 
about $50 billion over the next five years.  We are talking about 
$10 billion of our tax dollars a year.  We have maybe five people 
who understand how it is being distributed.  We have a problem. 
Not only in this legislation but in all legislation we should be 
striving for clarity and simplicity so Canadians can understand 
what it is that their government is doing to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another problem with this program is that there is no 
consultation.  The government is not interested in talking to 
Canadians about how it will spend the $50 billion.  It is not 
interested in bringing the ordinary Canadian or the business 
community or the legislators like ourselves into a meaningful 
debate.

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is another indication of the arrogance of the government. 
It continues to feel that it knows better than anybody else to 
the exclusion of a conversation with anybody else how to govern 
the country, how to take $50 billion and distribute it from the 
have provinces to the have not provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard other colleagues ask if it is fair in a country 
that is as well off as Canada where we have such a high standard 
of living according to the United Nations, that we have three 
provinces carrying the fiscal burden.  Three provinces are 
providing to seven provinces.  Is that fair?  Should we not be 
looking at whether or not that adequately represents reality? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For Canadians who may be watching and trying to understand 
equalization and what it means, they should not feel bad if they 
do not understand it because there is nobody else in this 
country, bar a few civil servants who have concocted the formula 
and have manipulated the formula for whatever reason, who do 
understand it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope to clarify some of the issues that we feel need to be 
addressed, to properly deal with trying to create a level playing 
field between provinces that have the capacity to raise revenue 
and provinces that do not have the same capacity. Is it necessary 
to try to accomplish that?  I suggest it is. It is a very 
Canadian thing to do, to try to help those who are less fortunate 
or may not have the same ability. It is readily supported by 
Canadians all across the country but they are asking, and rightly 
so, is it properly managed?  Is the program accountable for its 
end result and delivery of the services?  Is it fair?  Is this a 
program that has the concept of fairness? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will point out a number of things on which I will challenge 
that the concept of this bill deals with that.  To make 
equalization and the formula work, there has to be the same kind 
of tax system in all the provinces so that they are all being 
compared on an equal basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not all the provinces have the same type of tax system.  In 
essence we are dealing with a tax system in one province and a 
completely different tax system in another province. In other 
words, we are dealing with a hypothetical tax system that does 
not work or does not exist.  We are trying to blend them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cost of production to create the taxes or source of revenue 
is not the same in all provinces.  There is no way that the cost 
of taking the trees off a mountainside in a remote area of 
British Columbia is the same as taking a tree from a flatter area 
closer to civilization, yet that is not taken into account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard again from my colleague from Kamloops that there is a 
recognition that new oil sources are more expensive to retrieve 
than old oil sources.  That is very interesting because Alberta, 
one of the have provinces, depends largely on oil revenue and 
would have considered the Alberta tar sands as a new source of 
oil.  Certainly it is far more expensive to extract it than the 
old traditional source of oil, yet there was no compensation for 
that in the formula. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was no recognition in the formula to deal with the new 
type of oil technology that was required for the tar sands. But 
all of a sudden because of the Hibernia oil field, this new 
recognition has been brought into the system. The revenue from 
the Hibernia oil field will only be 70% considered rather than 
the 100% in another province. 
This does not add to the fairness of how we deal with revenue 
sources.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thirty-three tax areas are brought into consideration in this 
formula.  Another one is property assessment, property taxes. 
Those can change overnight.  All we have to do is ask the 
individuals who own property on the Musqueam how quickly property 
values disappear.  All it takes is a change in circumstances for 
that property value, upon which property taxes are considered and 
are part of the formula, to disappear completely.  There is no 
recognition of those differences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no recognition that property values are different from 
one end of the country to the other. I would suggest that in my 
area, a person who bought a single family home could probably buy 
for the same amount of money a 15 or 20 block apartment elsewhere 
and have revenue property to help sustain them. That kind of 
consideration is not taken into account in this equalization 
payment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a high cost of living in some of the major centres in 
this country.  A large portion of the income of individuals is 
used just to provide housing.  The differences from one part of 
the country to another are not taken into consideration in the 
equalization formula. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the politicizing of the formula.  We have heard from 
other members about what happened in Newfoundland.  It had a 
deficit and two days before the writ was dropped for a provincial 
election, the deficit suddenly disappeared because there was more 
money in equalization to put into the pot. Therefore, 
Newfoundland did not have a deficit but lo and behold it had a 
surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no commitment on paper for that money. It was simply 
the ability of a government to say the discrepancy is there 
because nobody understands the formula, nobody understands where 
this money is being spent or how it is being spent.  For 
political reasons they can reach into the pot and say they 
miscalculated and give out some money for political purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not good enough.  The transparency and clarity are not 
there.  It allows for the transfer of money to be manipulated for 
political purposes.  The lack of transparency and accountability 
allows for manipulation not only for political purposes but for 
other purposes as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a situation is not clear and not accountable, it can allow 
a formula to be changed, to be interpreted without anybody 
knowing how to challenge it, again because of the complexity of 
the equalization payment and the lack of transparency.  It is 
very dangerous for a government to allow itself to get into a 
position where it cannot account for or justify where our tax 
dollars are being spent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to talk about the end result and what equalization 
in the long run does to our country.  My colleague from 
Kings—Hants brought up the issue of equalization payments 
providing disincentives for provinces to develop their economies 
in such a way that they no longer need support from the federal 
government.  I would assume that as the member represents 
Atlantic Canada, he is aware of what has happened in Atlantic 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to share some numbers with my colleague.  They are 
percentages of revenues transferred by the federal government to 
the provincial governments.  These are percentages of the budgets 
that federal transfers equate. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1240"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Newfoundland the provincial budget relies on 43.7% from 
federal transfers, almost half of its budget.  It is 36.8% that 
Prince Edward Island depends on federal money to go into its 
budget.  In Nova Scotia it is 40.3%.  In New Brunswick it is 
38.2%.  In Quebec it is 15.3%.  In Manitoba it is 29.3%. That 
shows the heavy reliance by those considered have not provinces 
on the federal government to provide them with their financial 
resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to repeat that my colleague from Kings—Hants said that 
part of the problem is that we have created disincentives for 
those provinces to be able to stimulate their economies and to 
create an economic environment so that they do not depend on 
these federal transfers.  In other words, what he implied and 
what I support is that the concept has created a dependency of 
the have not provinces upon the federal government.  It has 
created a situation where these provinces feel that it is not 
worth their effort and not worth their consideration to remove 
themselves from a position of receiving transfer payments from 
the other provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can speak from my own experience that this is not a healthy 
position to put any province in.  When a province loses its 
desire to better itself, to better its economy because it might 
cost money, that is not a healthy environment. The last thing 
this government should be trying to do is to continue the 
circumstances in 1999 going into the next millennium where three 
provinces are supporting seven other provinces. It just does not 
seem right in a country as bountiful as Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next question we have to ask ourselves is does the formula 
allow for fairness in the provinces.  I would suggest that it 
does not.  I do not think the province of British Columbia feels 
that it is getting a fair shake.  I cannot speak for Alberta or 
Ontario, but I can speak for British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we do know is that although its economy has been number 10 
in growth in Canada over the last three years, British Columbia 
is still considered a have province.  We are still expected to 
take money out of our economy that is not growing and put it into 
the economy of other provinces that have a higher growth rate. We 
are still expected to put money into provinces that are providing 
services to their citizens that British Columbia does not have 
the capacity to provide to its own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see that in the dental care program in the province of 
Quebec.  The province of Quebec is able to provide free dental 
care, all dental care to children under 10 years old. Children in 
British Columbia do not get free dental care.  But the taxpayers 
in British Columbia are funding Quebec, or putting money into the 
province of Quebec, so that it can offer free dental care to its 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Somehow I do not think that was the intention of the 
equalization payments. I think the intention of the equalization 
transfer was so that all provinces could have at least a basic 
service, that all provinces could provide to their citizens the 
same thing that another province could provide, not something 
more, not something better.  But that is what is happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Look at education and the university tuition fees. Tuition fees 
are lowest in the province of Quebec.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why should the students and the taxpayers in British Columbia be 
sending money to the province of Quebec so it can provide cheaper 
post-secondary education for its children when it is not 
available to the children in British Columbia? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about fairness I suggest the taxpayers in my 
constituency and in my province would feel that is not being 
shown in the transfer payments based on equalization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said all this, what we have to ask ourselves is what 
would be more acceptable to all Canadians.  I want to address a 
number of issues here.  One is that the province of Quebec is 
constantly arguing as to whether the federal government should be 
interfering in its— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>   The hon. member for 
South Surrey—White Rock—Langley I know is in full flight and I 
have been disturbing her with my motions to get up but that is 
because the member is out of time.  I will give her 30 seconds to 
sum up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I guess I was in full 
flight. I suggest to the members from Quebec that they look at 
equalization as equality and fairness.  They should also look at 
whether they really want the federal government interfering in 
provincial jurisdictions and controlling through federal spending 
their ability to manage their own province. 
<P><A NAME="LINK43"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West—Nepean, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I noticed that the member South Surrey—White 
Rock—Langley listed very carefully the proportion of the 
provincial budget that comes from federal transfer payments in 
every province that receives equalization payments except 
Saskatchewan.  I do not know if she had a reason for leaving 
Saskatchewan out.  Perhaps it is the fact that Reform has some 
members elected there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps she could tell us just what proportion of Saskatchewan's 
budget comes from federal transfer payments, including the 
equalization payments now being debated in the House.  Perhaps 
she could also tell us how Saskatchewan will benefit from the 
legislation before the House today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the figures I have for 
Saskatchewan in the 1997-98 budget are that 12.8% of the 
provincial budget came from federal transfers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest Saskatchewan is one of the provinces learning that it 
is better to have self-autonomy, a good healthy economy and to 
join the have provinces in an economy that stimulates job 
creation and sees the benefits of not being reliant on a federal 
government to provide it with money but rather on its own 
ingenuity, its own progress and its own economy.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened with 
interest to the remarks of my Reform Party colleague. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot help but wonder why, during the 1995 referendum in 
Quebec, these people who find us so expensive stepped in to 
prevent us from leaving.  If we are the drain on finances that 
the Reform Party members would have us believe, it would only 
have made sense to let us go, indeed to help us on our way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, when the member speaks about the social union and 
equalization costs, I would simply point out that, while it is 
true that British Columbia is one of the provinces now on the 
paying end, this was not always the case.  Nor will it always be 
the case in future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the people who fled Hong Kong for British Columbia because 
of the impending takeover by mainland China return to their 
homeland, as some of them have already done, and when the U.S. 
boycotts against British Columbia lumber have achieved the 
desired effects, perhaps then British Columbia will find itself 
on the receiving end.

them can change at any time.  What holds true today will not 
necessarily hold true tomorrow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are costing them so much, if Quebec is not productive and 
it is not worth keeping us happy within the federation, I would 
like the member to tell me why she and her colleagues came to 
Montreal with their flags and paid so dearly to tell us they 
loved us during the 1995 referendum. I would like her to simply 
explain that. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I did listen attentively 
and with interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I to the hon. member that we want Quebec to stay within Canada 
for reasons that are emotional.  I did not realize we could buy 
the support of a province or that we should be buying a province 
to stay in our country.  It is a question of opportunity.  It is 
a question of the ability of a provincial government, through the 
jurisdictions given to it in the BNA act or the Constitution Act 
of 1867, to enhance and stimulate an economy, to control its 
natural resources and to look after its people through health, 
social services and education.  It is not to pass that 
responsibility on to the federal government. I thought we agreed 
with hon. colleagues from the Bloc on that issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it interesting the member would bring in the issue of 
immigrants from Hong Kong and from Taiwan who have come to 
Canada.  What he has not said is that although people moved to 
British Columbia and settled there they left their money in the 
province of Quebec.  Quebec benefited from the economic 
well-being of these people.  They invested their money in Quebec 
and they got $90 million for resettlement of these investor 
immigrants.  They did not stay there.  They came to British 
Columbia.  British Columbia ended up using our resources while 
Quebec got the benefit of their investments. I am glad to clarify 
that for members of the House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK45"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member indicated in her 
remarks that it was very complex topic and that the formula in 
the bill before us had some elements of complexity. I though I 
would take this opportunity to clarify a couple of things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She made reference to Newfoundland and its ability to balance 
its budget.  She felt that was politicization of the actual 
program.  I want to clarify that equalization payments are made 
according to a formula.  Every October the lookback takes place 
to see what has occurred not only in that province's economy but 
in the other standardized provinces.  When we see what has 
happened in Ontario and compare what has happened in Ontario and 
how that increased the standards to what is happening in 
Newfoundland, we see an adjustment of the program. It is not only 
Newfoundland, it is other provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If any provincial government decides to call an election 
sometime after October, I hope the member does not attribute that 
to politicization of the actual program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She talked about British Columbia and the turmoil there. We know 
the Asian crisis is contributing to that. If British Columbia no 
longer has the ability to raise the kind of revenues it is 
raising today, it too would be eligible for equalization. 
Therefore this is a program that is based on formula and one that 
I think most Canadians support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I find it interesting that 
the hon. Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance 
brings up the formula when there is admission by the auditor 
general that it is too convoluted, that the formula is 
manipulated, that it can be changed and interpreted in different 
ways.  The formula is not that clear.  That is the whole problem 
with this equalization transfer program.  It is not clear.  It 
can be manipulated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I respect that he differs with my opinion on the transfers, that 
the conclusion that they had under given money or under 
transferred money to Newfoundland was not political.  I 
appreciate that he does not agree with me. 
I would not expect him to agree with me, representing the federal 
Liberal Party and supporting the provincial Liberal Party.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, we are on the third and final reading of an act that 
affects the equalization arrangement we have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Essentially equalization takes money from the federal tax base 
collected from the wealthier provinces and pays it to the less 
wealthy provinces to ensure that provincial governments have 
sufficient revenue to provide comparable public services at 
comparable rates of taxation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is one of the arrangements in our federation that brings 
equity and equality to citizens across the country.  This is a 
very good goal and a goal that makes our country work well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately over the years the whole equalization arrangement 
has become very convoluted, very inefficient and full of 
complexities that have not been addressed.  This arrangement is 
actually unfair, inequitable and in great need of reform. This 
bill should be doing that.  It does not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill renews the current five year equalization agreement 
which expires at the end of this month.  Specifically, the bill 
makes some amendments to the formula that determines equalization 
payments but the amendments amount to nothing more than mere 
tinkering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point out to Canadians watching this debate that this topic, 
although it seems dry and academic, is actually of tremendous 
importance to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It deals not only with the very heart of our federal system but 
with the billions of the tax dollars that we work hard for, we 
give to government and pay into programs like equalization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The practice of equalization started at the beginning of 
Confederation in 1867. At that time it involved a few hundred 
thousand dollars per province.  Today equalization transfers 
alone approach $9 billion a year. This is in addition to other 
transfers from the federal government to the provinces like the 
Canada health and social transfer which supports health care and 
education, the EI funds, regional grants and other smaller 
programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we were looking at total transfers with an equalization 
component, the total payments would be much higher than $9 
billion, perhaps three times as much or upwards of $25 billion to 
$30 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are dealing with enormous amounts of our money.  Because of 
that, this debate should be of great interest to all Canadians. 
Although this is a complicated program, and I am a novice on the 
subject, a few scholars have written about it, the most recent 
being Dr. Paul Boothe, a professor of economics at the University 
of Alberta. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Six months ago Dr. Boothe wrote a 60 page analysis of the 
equalization system.  Just a week ago he testified before the 
finance committee on the subject of equalization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For Canadians who want to understand this rather complex area, I 
suggest they look at Dr. Boothe's work on this subject, 
«Finding a Balance: Renewing Canadian Fiscal Federalism», 
released October 30, 1998.

than it needs to spend while provinces collect less than they 
need to spend. That makes these kind of transfers between the 
federal and provincial governments necessary under our 
constitutional system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an implication in the Constitution that these transfers 
will be unconditional.  That of course has changed over the 
years.  There is also the citizenship rationale that says that 
citizens have a right to certain publicly funded social and 
economic services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Due to imbalance in the powers of taxation between the provinces 
and the federal government that I just mentioned transfers become 
necessary.  The citizenship rationale about citizens having a 
right to publicly funded services suggests that transfers would 
have some specific objectives.  There is a suggestion that 
transfers should be unconditional.  There is a suggestion that 
transfers should have specific objectives and those need to be 
balanced out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the economic efficiency rationale that transfers 
can be used to alleviate efficiency problems related to the 
mobility of workers, which means that they can be used to 
encourage workers to move where the jobs are.  Transfers could be 
used to alleviate bad practices in one province that harm another 
province, for example grants to induce a province to clean up air 
pollution and not export it to other provinces.  Those kinds of 
grants would be conditional. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there is the equity rationale, closely related to the 
citizenship rationale, that says the federal government should 
give the same services and transfers and levy the same taxes on 
similarly situated individuals regardless of where they live and 
the provinces should do likewise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because provinces do not have identical taxes, services or 
transfers, this implies an enormous increase in the role of the 
federal government and very large equalization costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mention this to try to gain some understanding of the 
philosophical underpinnings of this whole equalization program. 
Understanding what we are trying to achieve is important before 
we can examine a program and ask if it is delivering what we had 
hoped it would deliver. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The history of the equalization program is also interesting and 
although it may seem like a dry academic exercise it is helpful 
for Canadians trying to understand this whole issue of 
equalization to go through it quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prior to Confederation most provincial revenues came from 
customs and excise taxes.  With the loss of customs duties, 
because the federal government became exclusively responsible for 
levying customs duties, the provinces faced a fiscal crunch in 
meeting their constitutional responsibility to provide key 
services to their citizens.  Therefore the Fathers of 
Confederation established a system of transfers providing each 
province with a statutory grant of 80 cents per person to a 
maximum of 400,000 persons.  Nova Scotia and New Brunswick were 
also paid a special grant, acknowledging that they trailed 
Ontario and Quebec in economic development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Between Confederation and the Great Depression transfers from 
Ottawa fell as a proportion of provincial revenues.  During the 
depression governments raised taxes to combat deficits.  The tax 
system became very fragmented and complicated and some described 
it as a tax jungle.  What happened in the 1930s may sound 
familiar to us in the 1990s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Professor Boothe points out, at one point the city of 
Edmonton levied an income tax.  Transfers from the federal 
government to the provinces soared, rising from 10% of federal 
revenue to 45%.  Because the situation was spiralling out of 
control, a commission was set up, always a time honoured way to 
study a problem, called the Rowell-Sirois commission. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1305"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT36"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It made a number of recommendations in 1939 concerning 
unemployment relief, the collection of taxes and provincial debt. 
An important recommendation of the Rowell-Sirois commission in 
1939 was that the federal government institute a system of 
“national adjustment grants” for poorer provinces and that 
general transfers be made to ensure that the provinces had enough 
revenue to fulfill their constitutional responsibilities without 
undue taxation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the second world war the federal government rented the 
income tax field from the provinces in return for fixed transfer 
payments with the understanding that it would be returned after 
the war.  After the war the federal government wished to continue 
with the rental of personal income taxes. Ontario and Quebec 
resisted.  Ontario did join the tax rental agreement in 1952. 
Quebec remained outside and set up its own personal income tax 
system in 1954.  That led to the development of the present 
equalization system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Formal equalization payments began in 1957 with a fiscal 
arrangements package that had both an equalization and a 
stabilization component.  The equalization component was 
calculated based on the average revenue from three tax bases in 
the two richest provinces.  This is important because the base 
for calculation keeps shifting from here on in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1962 the equalization formula was altered, based now on a 
national average rather than two provinces, and natural resource 
revenue was included in the tax base.  Some of it was, not all. 
Thus Alberta became a contributing province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These agreements last for five years.  We are discussing a five 
year renewal today.  Five years after that in 1967 the 
equalization formula calculation was expanded to include the 
revenue from 16 bases.  By this time the federal government had 
transferred 28 personal income tax and 10 corporate income tax 
points to the provinces and was offering more in lieu of federal 
contributions to other programs.  We get transfers for other 
programs mixed in with equalization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The number of eligible tax bases continued to expand.  In 1974 
the government abandoned full equalization of energy revenues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1977 the government instituted established programs financing 
to convert cost shared grants for health care and post-secondary 
education into block or unconditional grant transfers of only 
half their former size.  At the same time, an equivalent amount 
of personal income tax and corporate tax points was transferred 
to the provinces. The cash transfer, which was an equal amount 
per capita across Canada, was to grow with the economy 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rising energy prices in the 1970s created problems for 
equalization and Ontario qualified as a receiving province for 
the first time.  We saw the introduction of the national energy 
program through which the federal government confiscated 
Alberta's tax revenues to maintain low fuel prices in central 
Canada.  Now we get resource taxation being mixed into 
equalization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1982 the equalization formula was again altered by moving to 
a five province standard, excluding Alberta and the four Atlantic 
provinces, the richest and the four poorest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also in 1982 the federal government linked the established 
programs financing cash component with the tax points.  This 
meant that the federal cash transfer would grow less rapidly than 
the economy, as had been earlier promised.  In addition, the per 
capita transfer for the three contributing provinces was reduced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most important, in 1982 the federal government and all provinces 
except Quebec agreed to enshrine the principle of equalization in 
the Constitution, section 36(2). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1990 the federal government, as part of its deficit reduction 
battle, capped the growth of Canada assistance plan payments for 
B.C., Alberta and Ontario, the only three that were not receiving 
equalization payments. 
In 1995 the Liberals introduced the Canada health and social 
transfer which was really a slash and burn effort on health care 
and education.  It reduced the total transfer for those programs 
from $18.5 billion to $11.5 billion and locked in the 
differential treatment of B.C., Ontario and Alberta.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know of the great hardship this reduction of the Canada 
health and social transfer put on provincial health, education 
and social services.  The point I make with this history is this. 
The evolving complexity and patchwork of this program and the 
fact that it was impacted by a multitude of diverse political 
purposes to achieve different results from time to time has made 
this program exceedingly complex. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to equalization there are intergovernmental 
transfers which add in a component of equalization.  In other 
words, we have equalization and then we have equalization of 
other transfers.  We have equalization on top of equalization 
which has resulted in some very unfair distortions in the 
transfers from the federal government to the various provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is about the fiscal arrangements act, equalization 
payments, but I submit this debate should include a discussion on 
other major intergovernmental transfers besides equalization, in 
particular the Canada health and social transfer and regional 
differences in employment insurance because they also have an 
equalization component. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As was said earlier, equalization was designed to ameliorate 
imbalances between revenue and spending responsibilities across 
the provinces. Today the provinces have access to per capita 
revenues equal to the potential average of five provinces, B.C., 
Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec.  This five province 
standard includes 33 different tax bases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope members are struggling with this as much as I am because 
what happens is that in a democracy when billions of our dollars 
are being spent we need to understand how they are being spent 
and why they are being spent.  I think the history on what I am 
going through now shows how this program lacks transparency, 
lacks accountability and therefore lacks the kind of scrutiny we 
as the public in a democracy need to give it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The calculation of the values for each tax system is very 
complicated.  Imagine the complication when 33 different systems 
in each of the 10 provinces are involved.  The system also has 
rules governing floors and ceilings, growth rates and so forth. 
It has been said that only a few academics and bureaucrats in 
Canada fully understand the system.  I submit it has yet to be 
proven that anyone understands it.  Yet we have only a few hours 
of debate in the House to even try to talk about it, never mind 
address it in a meaningful, focused way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Federal equalization payments will total about $9 billion this 
year.  Federal equalization transfers in 1996-97 ranged from a 
high of about $1,800 per person for Newfoundland to a low of 
about $220 per person in Saskatchewan. As I pointed out earlier, 
B.C., Alberta and Ontario receive no equalization payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to that variance, the CHST per capita amounts vary 
across the provinces.  Alberta received the least in 1996-97 of 
$416 per capita while Newfoundland and Quebec received the most 
in over $600 per capita.  The same regional differences are 
present in the EI program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently then there are some real problems with these 
transfers. They result in individual inequity where a program was 
supposed to give equity to individual Canadians.  They result for 
a number of reasons in inefficiency, and my colleagues have 
pointed out some of those inefficiencies.  There is declining 
political viability where three provinces are consistently paying 
to seven supposedly poor provinces in a wealthy country like 
Canada and then we have to deal now with the impact of 
international competition.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge the House, instead of just rubber stamping a renewal with 
a few tinkering changes to the equalization agreement, to do a 
substantial and sustained examination of the system, some 
fundamental reform, and move to something that is much fairer for 
Canadians and much more workable. 
<P><A NAME="LINK47"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster—Coquitlam—Burnaby, 
Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the comments of my 
colleague, but I am wondering how we get to a new era where we 
reduce the kind of unfairness that has been pointed out and 
perhaps might be able to outline the positions in the new Canada 
Act which call for two basic reforms.  The first is the equal 
treatment of all citizens with per capita grants to provinces for 
cost shared programs; in other words, amounts directly related to 
people in the province.  The other is a single equalization grant 
based on macro indicator per capita provincial GDP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we go down the wrong road this transfer can become a reward 
to a province that essentially delivers poor government to its 
people.  Like any benefit program, if it is not in balance it 
becomes a trap of continuing pursuit of unwise economic 
behaviour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the member comment on how we could move to a more broadly 
based estimation of the ability of the provinces to generate 
revenue and stay out of the trap that a dependency program could 
create? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member is pointing 
out one of the problems with the program to which I alluded 
toward the end of my speech, that is the inefficiency of the 
program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member who just spoke is from British Columbia.  British 
Columbia has a situation where the transfer payment is based on 
gross income.  Taxpayers in British Columbia are forced to 
contribute more to the program even though their province is in 
recession.  If we had a net scheme rather than the current gross 
scheme, we could address this kind of problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing that has been pointed out by experts is that there 
are incentives in the program for provinces to manipulate their 
own tax structures to maximize the amount of equalization they 
receive.  I think the member was also referring to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that is so, it clearly adds inefficiencies into the system 
where provinces could have a brighter economic picture.  The 
current structure of the equalization program actually rewards 
less efficiency in the management of provincial economies. 
Experts say this is the case and that it should be addressed in 
the legislation.  It is not addressed at all.  The member is 
quite right in suggesting that area needs to be talked about and 
needs to be cleared up. 
<P><A NAME="LINK48"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour (Beauséjour—Petitcodiac, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I find it interesting that a party can get up in the 
House and say that the provinces are creating a dependency on 
equalization payments.  It is unbelievable that the official 
opposition, which says that it is a national party, can actually 
say that it does not agree with those things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  We did not say that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour:</B>  That is exactly what it is saying. 
That party does not care for the people in the country who have 
less than others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every province is a province of the country and the wealth 
should be divided among the whole country, not only among a 
couple of provinces.  There are provinces and territories in the 
country.  I cannot imagine that party has the gall to get up in 
the House and say the things it says.  I hope Canadians are 
hearing what members of that party are saying.  I hope they hear 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish the Liberal government could hear them as well and stop 
implementing their policies, because that is the other part that 
scares me.  I live in New Brunswick, in Atlantic Canada.  It is a 
province within the Atlantic provinces of Canada.

equalization payments.  They pretend to care about minority 
groups.  They pretend because they do not.  They do not care 
about the provinces that need help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just checked with every person in Atlantic Canada and we are 
willing to give up our equalization payments if they want to send 
the jobs they have in their provinces.  That is a tradeoff we 
will take.  That is no problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People in Atlantic Canada want to work.  We live in a country 
where we are supposed to share.  We have the Reform Party 
criticizing the Bloc.  Everybody should be looking at themselves 
to see what kind of platform they are actually trying to promote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I applaud the member's 
passion.  The goals we have in the House for the well-being of 
Canadians across the country are the same.  However, it is 
logical and proper to examine the programs that are supposed to 
get to the results the member wants to see and to examine whether 
those programs are in fact delivering the well-being they were 
intended to deliver. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have quoted experts that have examined the program who note 
that it is riddled with inefficiencies, inequities and 
unnecessary complexity.  In some cases it is actually harming the 
citizens it is supposed to help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member will be glad to know the policy of my party is to 
increase equalization payments to her province.  We would argue, 
largely because of the mismanagement, inequities, inefficiencies 
and perverse consequences in many of the well intentioned 
programs visited upon her province, that it is one of the four 
provinces at this point in time which is in inappropriate 
economic situation in a rich country like Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is utter nonsense to somehow suggest that we cannot logically 
and clearly examine a program and point out its inefficiencies 
and inequities because somehow this is a slur or criticism of the 
people who receive the program.  The programs are administered by 
the federal government.  We have a responsibility to make sure 
they are well administered.  There is no responsibility on the 
part of the people who are receiving the program for the 
inefficiencies and inappropriate measures of the program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should have an honest and open debate about them without 
being accused of somehow taking unfair positions against certain 
Canadians.  The whole point of this debate is to achieve and move 
toward fairness.  I hope we can do that in a thoughtful and 
considered manner. 
<P><A NAME="LINK49"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
compliment my colleague from Calgary—Nose Hill for the concise 
history she gave of the equalization payment system in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like her to refer briefly again to the shift that took 
place.  In the very beginning it was to make sure there was a 
balance in the distribution of wealth across Canada.  It was so 
direct, so transparent and so simple that anyone could 
understand.  Now it has become convoluted, difficult, complex and 
somewhat obscure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the hon. member speculate on why it went from simplicity 
to complexity, from openness and transparency to obscurity and 
obfuscation in many cases? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the simple answer is 
one word, politics.  The program has been twisted and turned and 
jammed and jimmied to serve political masters and political ends 
that it was never meant to serve.  It should be a simple macro 
calculation of provinces like some of the Atlantic provinces 
which have a smaller tax base but whose citizens deserve fair and 
equal services and of the amount that needs to be transferred 
from the wealthier provinces to achieve that. 
Instead we have had all kinds of political manipulation of the 
system.  I would suggest that is the reason the system is not 
clear.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I point Canadians interested in the whole area of the 
inefficiencies of the system to Professor Boothe's studies, pages 
24 to 29.  I do not have time to go over them, but I believe he 
makes a very concise and lucid evaluation of where some of the 
inequities exist. 
<P><A NAME="LINK50"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, first I 
thank the powers that be for the occasion to debate this very 
significant part of Canadian financial affairs.  Within this 
debate we can come to the realization that many things are 
happening in Canada which are highly desirable.  There are other 
things happening in Canada that are not desirable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make it abundantly clear that at the heart of this 
question is the heart of Canada.  What do we as Canadians believe 
about one another?  It is very significant for us to recognize 
that many people prefer to live in Canada than in other 
countries.  In many instances they were born in other countries 
and chose to immigrate to Canada because they liked it here and 
because they felt they could live better lives and create a 
better situation for themselves.  It feels good to have been born 
in a country where that characteristic is admired and envied in 
many other parts of the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I go any further in my particular remarks on the bill, I 
want to refer directly to the earlier remark of the member of the 
NDP who suggested that the Reform Party does not care about 
Canadians and that this is just a postering position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to read into the record the three points that 
clarify and are absolutely essential to the understanding of the 
heart of Canada.  Canadians care about one another.  I believe 
these words will probably quash at least partially the hon. 
member's statement.  I hope she is listening because it is 
significant.  I also assure her that I believe what I will read 
right now.  I am there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the member's benefit, if for no one else's, Reform will 
begin negotiations with the provinces to amend the formula for 
equalization to make it more sustainable and ensure that 
equalization payments are refocused toward Canada's poorest 
provinces.  Is that not exactly what the hon. member was alluding 
to?  I loved her passion.  I think we all need to become far more 
passionate about Canada than is often demonstrated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second point I would like the hon. member to remember is 
that Reform recognizes the need and the constitutional 
requirement for equalization and would ensure that transitional 
funding and flexibility would be available for any province which 
found its equalization entitlement reduced.  If that does not 
speak directly to the concerns that have been expressed, I would 
like to know what does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third point is that under Reform equalization for the 
poorest provinces in Canada would not be reduced and could be 
increased subject to negotiations with all Canadian provinces. We 
would have this interaction among all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That suggests to me that not only do we have a heart but we 
recognize that all other Canadians have a heart.  What we need to 
recognize is that as we help each other we can help to build an 
even stronger nation and an even more desirable country than we 
have at the present time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would now like to refer to what exactly is the equalization 
that we are talking about.  It is an unconditional grant. 
An unconditional transfer is perhaps a better way to say it.  It 
is a transfer to the less well off provinces from the better off 
provinces.  That is what it is.  That is what we support. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1330"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT41"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The principle of equalization is embodied in the Constitution. 
This is not something which this particular government dreamed of 
at this time.  Neither is it something that we suddenly 
discovered.  It was there at the very beginning when this country 
came into being.  It is in the Constitution.  Interestingly, the 
provision is not in the formula.  The provision is that this must 
happen.  The Constitution did not say that a particular formula 
should be observed.  Periodically the formula is amended to take 
into account changes in economic circumstances.  That is the 
current position of the equalization payment provisions in 
legislation and in the Constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we also need to recognize is that as we go through history 
we notice that it has changed dramatically from a very simple 
taxation system, of which parts of it were transferred, to a 
highly complex system.  There are 33 different measures to 
determine whether equalization payments should be made.  It is 
needlessly complicated.  It does not need to be that way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does that suggest?  What does it make possible?  Whenever 
we complicate something three things are possible.  One, it is 
not easily understood.  That means that there is a group of 
people who can become experts and everybody else has to believe 
their interpretation of how it works. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, that creates all kinds of other opportunities.  It 
creates the opportunity to manipulate the formula and the inputs 
in such a way that would appear to arrive at the same conclusion 
as anyone else using the same formula would arrive at.  However, 
we all know that when we examine this it does not turn out that 
way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give members one interesting example that happened in the 
first quarter of this year.  Lo and behold when the premier of 
Prince Edward Island looked at the equalization payments he 
discovered that he was going to have a deficit budget.  Then he 
noticed that it was okay to call an election.  He called the 
election.  What happened?  The transfer payments were 
recalculated.  All of a sudden he had a balanced budget.  It was 
a $30 billion difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How did that happen?  Did it happen because the formula changed? 
Did it happen because taxes changed?  Did it happen because we 
had a new province?  Did it happen because we had a new 
government in Ottawa?  It was none of those things.  Had suddenly 
the population base in Prince Edward Island changed?  Had 
suddenly the GDP changed?  No.  Something went into this thing 
that changed the whole picture.  Who knows exactly what happened. 
We could make all kinds of surmises, we could have all kinds of 
speculation, but nobody could prove the point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the third thing that could happen?  In that manipulation 
and development the whole system could become politically 
motivated and politically driven.  It seems to me that the 
example I just used illustrates that is exactly what can happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The present equalization formula also encourages poor economic 
decision making by provincial governments and impedes free and 
efficient labour mobility.  That point has been made before, but 
I want to put this in the context of another issue which has to 
do with the trade barriers that exist among provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We seem to have developed in this country a preferential 
interpretation of the Constitution.  When it suits us to 
interpret the Constitution one way, we do that.  In other words, 
the federal government chooses sometimes to intervene in 
provincial affairs.  How does it do that?  It intervenes in the 
educational system.  It intervenes in the health care system. 
What does that do? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has taken the Constitution, which says 
that those issues are completely within provincial jurisdiction, 
and it has intervened.  Then it turned the other way.  The 
Constitution also says that there shall be free movement of goods 
and services across Canada from one province to another.  It 
shall be free.  What have we got?  We have 700 plus barriers to 
the moving of goods and services from one province to another, 
which costs Canadians billions of dollars every year.

</I></B></P><P align=left>On the one hand we interpret the Constitution as saying that the 
federal government can interfere in provincial affairs and on the 
other hand we interpret the constitution as saying that it 
cannot.  What kind of sense does that make? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason that happens is because the formula has become so 
complex that it becomes the dictator of what happens.  The result 
is that politics becomes the issue, the bells and whistles become 
the issue, rather than the heart of the matter which is to help 
people and to be fair, equitable, transparent and democratic 
about the whole thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the heart of this issue.  That is why we have some real 
difficulty with this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does this mean that we do not want equalization payments?  Does 
it mean that we should not have them?  It means that we have to 
have equalization payments, which is what I said at the outset. 
We need them, but they should be transparent, they should be 
simple and they should be fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to move to another point which was made by Dan Usher, an 
economist and professor of economics at Queen's University. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I notice the hon. member opposite is laughing.  Why is he 
laughing?  Is he laughing because Dan Usher does not know what he 
is doing?  He knows exactly what he is doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He concluded that the equalization program was inefficient, 
counterproductive and should be radically reformed or scrapped 
altogether.  That is not our position.  We do not believe it 
should be scrapped.  But should it be radically reformed? 
Absolutely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Usher argues that the ultimate benefit of equalization to the 
poor may be negligible, even non-existent, and is certainly less 
than if the federal sources were provided to the poor directly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is an interesting development.  Give it to the poor people 
directly.  That is ultimately who it is supposed to help.  It is 
not supposed to help governments, it is supposed to help people. 
It is not the province of New Brunswick that is to be helped, it 
is the people who live in New Brunswick who are to be helped. 
That is where we are going.  That is what we want to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A recent study by the Atlantic Institute for Market Studies 
found that the massive regional subsidies that have become part 
of Canada's fiscal and political makeup have done more economic 
harm than good.  The conclusion is that Atlantic Canadians should 
look to their own economic resourcefulness and not to government 
or transfers from the rest of Canada.  Wow.  What a conclusion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also refer the hon. member to a conclusion of a former premier 
of New Brunswick, Mr. McKenna. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  I don't like him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt:</B>  The hon. member says she does not 
like him.  That is her privilege. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will refer to what he said to a conference of Canadians from 
across Canada:  “Do not, first of all, give us grants and 
subsidies; rather, reduce our taxes.  We will use the resources 
that are left in our pockets, that are left in our province, that 
are left in our corporations to greater advantage than if you 
filter them through the government”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was a premier who was saying “Let individual Canadians 
keep the money, the individual New Brunswicker”, rather than 
sending the money to Ottawa and then having it returned to the 
provinces to be filtered down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that process a lot of people lose money.  They do not make 
money.  I would suggest that even the hon. member who thinks Mr. 
McKenna does not know what he is talking about would spend her 
money more effectively than if she gave it to the premier of New 
Brunswick, the Prime Minister of Canada or any other politician 
or bureaucrat.  She is wise in the expenditure of money.  That is 
why she is here today.  She knows how to spend money properly. 
She wants to represent her people so that they will be able to 
apply their resources in the best way possible.  I commend her 
for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Allowing people to apply their own initiative, their own 
resourcefulness, would create a better world than the kind of 
world a government would create.  The government's role should be 
to create an environment so that individuals can apply their 
skills, abilities and energies in a way that will be most 
productive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The relationship between the federal government and the 
provinces has often been compromised by conflict, by the federal 
government intruding into provincial jurisdiction and by 
confrontation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The national energy program created a direct confrontation with 
at least one province in Canada, but I will take an example that 
applies to every province, health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know there was a time when the Liberal government, the 
current group that is in charge of Canada today, said it would 
never ever pay less than 50% of health care costs in Canada. 
It promised that would never change, and it underlined never. 
However, it did.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only did the amount change, but even as the proportion of 
the funding that came from the federal government changed it 
insisted that the provinces would get less money.  And guess 
what?  The provinces could not decide how they would make up the 
difference because they were told what to do by the federal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, if a province wanted to introduce a special fee 
for a service it was not allowed to do that.  If the province 
wanted the money it would have to spend it the way it was told to 
spend it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not only unfair, it is downright dirty.  Why would 
anybody want to do that?  It took away the money and then told 
the provinces “Now you have less money to do this job.  Do it 
our way”.  Talk about conflict.  Talk about confrontation.  That 
is exactly what happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to return to the issue of interprovincial trade barriers. 
The Constitution says that we should have the free movement of 
goods and services across provincial boundaries.  We want that. 
We want that very much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has the responsibility to enforce the 
Constitution of Canada.  What have we had?  Nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We agree that this is what we want and what does the federal 
government do?  Nothing.  How do we put those things together? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government chooses to interpret the Constitution the way it 
wants to, the way it seems will be most advantageous to further 
its political agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do I blame the government for that?  The Liberal Party has done 
that forever.  The time has come for us not to do it from the top 
down, but to do it from the bottom up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians would take a different approach.  Canadians want those 
barriers removed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was talking to a fellow in Ontario last week.  He said that he 
finds it more difficult to trade his commodities across provinces 
than to ship them south into the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What kind of sense does that make?  On the one hand we have this 
great equalization program and then we make it difficult for the 
provinces to develop their economies by trading within their own 
country.  However, they can trade freely across other borders. 
There is no logic.  A decision has been made, but there has been 
no action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to refer to a certain provision in this bill which I find 
absolutely insulting.  I do not know if I should say insulting. 
It really caused me to envision all kinds of terrible things 
about what this government is really trying to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are 33 tax elements.  Guess what?  I want to read this 
into the record.  I know the parliamentary secretary is laughing. 
I think he knows exactly what I will read into the record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will be in these new 33 taxes eight different measures for 
oil and gas revenues.  There will be eight different measures. 
How many different ways will gas and oil be measured?  This is 
the list.  There will be conventional new oil revenues.  That is 
“conventional” and “new oil”.  Then there will be 
conventional old oil revenues.  These are somehow different. 
There is new oil and there is old oil, but in both cases it is 
conventional oil.  I guess the difference is drawn between new 
and old.  Where will the line be drawn between what is new and 
what is old, that which was covered last week or that which was 
covered a year ago?  What is new?  What is old?  That is one 
complication. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there are heavy oil revenues.  I guess that heavy oil 
weighs more per barrel than the other oil.  I know better than 
that, but is it not interesting that they separate heavy oil from 
conventional oil? 
It talks about mined oil revenues.  Those are the four oils.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then it goes into the natural gas: domestically sold natural gas 
revenues, exported natural gas revenues, sales of crown leases 
and reservations on oil and natural gas lands. There are three 
gas measures and four oil measures.  Here comes the catch all: 
oil and gas revenues, other than those described in paragraphs 
(q) to (w). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are eight different ways of saying the same thing.  The 
government wants to tax all oil and gas revenues, whether they 
are from conventional oil, heavy oil, old oil, new oil, gas, 
whether its sold domestically or whether it is exported.  The 
government simply wants to tax all the revenues from oil and gas. 
Why in the world can it not say that?  No, the government has to 
write it eight different ways. That is what is going on here. It 
is needlessly complicated.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I know the hon. member indicated 
that I was smiling earlier.  I was smiling because I could see in 
the passion the hon. member had in part of his speech his 
yearning to be back on the industry committee when we were 
talking about internal trade barriers among provinces. I had the 
opportunity to work with him on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of his remarks on the equalization bill, he talks about 
the increased adjustments to Newfoundland and what happened.  He 
knows that Ontario forms part of the five province standard and 
the increase in what is going on in Ontario really contributed to 
the adjustment to Newfoundland and other provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member talked about how the Reform Party would refocus the 
equalization system to Canada's poorest provinces.  I have to ask 
the hon. member, which are Canada's poorest provinces?  There are 
seven provinces today which are receiving equalization payments, 
the have not provinces.  Which ones would he take off the list? 
Would it be Quebec, Manitoba, Saskatchewan? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member said he would refocus the program on the poorest 
Canadian provinces. Some of them must not then be entitled to 
equalization payments according to how the hon. member described 
his Reform Party platform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then the member went on to say that Reform would also ensure 
that the poorest provinces would not have their equalization 
payments reduced under the Reform plan.  In essence, all the 
adjustments that were made collectively have equalization 
payments going up to each and every have province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Which would the hon. member take off the list?  Which of the 
have not provinces would not receive equalization payments under 
the Reform Party platform? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the important issue here 
is that the third point is the one that matters.  The third point 
is that we would make absolutely sure that there was a complete 
and radical reformation of the equalization program.  That is the 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member would stop talking and start listening, I 
think it would help his understanding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to reform in a radical way the equalization program. 
There are two points we would make in the radical reformation. 
If the hon. member would take the time to read the new Canada 
act, he would find them there. They are equal treatment of all 
citizens with per capita grants to provinces for shared cost 
programs and then a single equalization grant based on a macro 
indicator of per capita provincial GDP compared to the per capita 
national GDP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is at the heart of the issue.  That shifts the formula away 
from the political considerations the hon. parliamentary 
secretary referred to.  He wants to get into this conflict again 
of one province versus another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to bring the individual into the equalization formula 
and make sure that we have a macro measure so that we do not have 
one region competing with another region, one region lording it 
over another region so that no one benefits.  The fact is the 
manipulation for political reasons takes precedence rather than 
the needs of individuals and that is what we are concerned about. 
That is really at the heart of the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage the parliamentary secretary to take this to heart 
and do this in the equalization formula.  If he does that, he 
will not have all this concern about which kind of oil it is, how 
old or new it is, whether it is heavy oil or light oil, whether 
it is gas or oil, or whether it is gas sold in Canada or 
elsewhere. 
He would not have to do that.  He could simplify his life so 
much.

when that comment was made, the McKenna government was actually 
on its way out.  It was so far out that Thériault actually made a 
comment this week that he was trying to distance himself from the 
McKenna government, although he was holding his hot coffee cup, 
all along he was in his cabinet.  That tells us what the McKenna 
government did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member also said he would give a whole lot more to New

is the question. The words are nice but I also remember about the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  The bingo parlour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour:</B>  The bingo parlour, exactly.  But once 
elected, those words were forgotten.  The pension plan was the 
same thing.  How many Reform members got elected saying they 
would not accept the pension plan and now they have all taken it? 
Reform also talks about health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  The hon. member just made a personal statement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  That is obviously a 
point of debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour:</B>  Mr. Speaker, Reform members talk 
about health care.  Now they are the saviours of health care, 
although one of the Reform members said at one point that they 
were hurt in the United States and got better service in the 
United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is nice to hear the words, but unfortunately, following my 
review of the situation, we cannot take Reform's word. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I cannot help but 
correct what the member has alleged of certain members of 
parliament and members of the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A large number of us said we would not accept the MP pension 
plan because it was far too generous compared to what other 
Canadians could expect.  That is an issue which many of us take 
to heart.  I am one of those who said I would not accept that 
pension.  When the legislation was amended we were given the 
opportunity to opt back in.  I did not opt in and most of us did 
not opt in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member should be very, very careful when she paints 
everybody with the same brush.  Am I going to paint her with a 
particular brush because she is a member of the New Democratic

things like that.  She should be corrected.  She should apologize

more willing to redistribute the national income.  In other 
words, who is more willing to be more socialist? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In view of all the problems, I would like the member to clearly 
explain where we should go.  He talked about the single 
equalization grant.  Maybe he could talk a little bit more about 
what that means, to clarify and to get to the realm of 
simplicity, to make it politically defensible and accountable to 
the public understanding, a kind of transparency of fairness so 
that average Canadians can get behind any readjustment and 
politically support it based on real need and real ability to 
pay, removed from any perverse incentives or disincentives. 
Perhaps the member could help us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt:</B>  Mr. Speaker, yes indeed, it is as if 
we want to outsocialize each other.  That is not the point here. 
The point here is that we need to look after the needs of 
Canadians and we need to do it in as equitable and fair a manner 
as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We live individual lives.  I thank the hon. member for focusing 
this once more not on a formula, not on a constitution, not on 
the transfer of funds from one province to another, but rather on 
the needs of individual Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is one thing that has become abundantly clear, it is 
that the federal government has taken an increasing share of an 
individual's income, of an individual's ability to look after

our split-run tax in violation of trade commitments.  Yesterday 
however, for the second time in four years this government took

the spirit and quite possibly the letter of our trade agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are not prepared to respect the trade agreements we sign, 
how can we expect other countries to keep their word?  When we 
sign an international agreement, we make a promise that other

then we should not sign it.  However, this government likes to 
sign deals and then pass laws ignoring their provisions. 
Ignoring international agreements minimizes their impact.  That 
in turn undermines the regime that separates orderly trade from

April 26, 1999. That's an important date for Canadians.  That's

of child pornography is illegal.

Vancouver.  If Liberal members of parliament will not stand up 
for you then perhaps the presence at the appeal hearing will send 
a clear message that this will not be tolerated.

today a young woman and recent university graduate named Annick

relentless attack on students.  Annick, with the help of the CFS, 
has launched a court challenge aimed at striking down 
discriminatory and unjustified changes to the Bankruptcy Act 
pushed through by the Liberals in last year's budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These changes force students unable to cope with debtload to 
wait 10 years after leaving school to file for bankruptcy. 
Annick, who graduated with a debtload of $63,000, has been forced 
to seek justice from the courts because the government refuses to 
do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I rise to do two things, first to applaud Annick's courage 
and second to call on the Minister of Human Resources Development 
to save Annick the pain of a lengthy court battle by doing the 
right thing, repealing this discriminatory change to the 
Bankruptcy Act.  If the minister will not do it, then I urge all 
members of this House to support my private member's Bill C-439 
which would do the job for him.

francophones access to power.

weeks alone the number of times this government has closed down

vote against a motion that would quickly end child pornography in 
British Columbia.  Today he will probably order his MPs to vote 
against the bill that would correct the injustice of higher 
taxation for families with one stay at home parent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is wrong with this picture?  What is wrong is that the

against single income families with children. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is pretty straightforward.  It will instil fairness, but the 
Prime Minister has ordered every Liberal MP to vote against it, 
no matter what.  Ministers were even told to cancel important

against stay at home parents? 
<P><A NAME="LINK96"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member knows that is not the issue and that we 
have asked that this matter be referred to the House of Commons 
finance committee to deal with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us understand what the real issue is here, that members of 
the Reform Party are advocating that family income be the basis 
for taxation, not individual income.  That is the issue they are 
putting before the House, and that is what all members will be 
asked to deal with.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the finance minister thinks he can just shuffle it off to 
committee, but we have seen more committees get busy in the House 
and no one across the country knows what they are doing and 
nothing seems to get accomplished by them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By sending it to committee the finance minister is simply 
admitting that he knows there is something wrong in the system. 
The committee may say one thing but what will happen tomorrow in 
the United Nations is that the government will defend 
discrimination against stay at home parents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why cannot the government just admit the obvious, that it 
discriminates against stay at home parents, plain and simple? 
<P><A NAME="LINK98"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

is complex.  It is not an issue that will be subject to a simple 
solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question I would then put to the hon. member is why does she 
insult members on all sides of the House.  Why does she say that 
she does not want this matter to go to committee?  Why does she 
say that members of the House are not capable of dealing with one 
of the more fundamental issues? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what the members of the all party finance committee were 
elected to do.  It is in fact to make sure that systems, programs 
and aids to Canadians evolve along with their needs. 
<P><A NAME="LINK99"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
committees have dealt with this over and over again.  The finance 
minister could have straightened it out in the budget.  He has 
had any number of budgets to correct this and he simply has not 
done it.  We see from every government member that they like to 
discriminate against stay at home parents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, do not take my word for it.  How about the Liberal 
MP for Durham who in today's Hamilton <I>Spectator</I> said that 
the whole tax system was discriminatory, that the bottom line was 
that taxes were too high, period? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that is true, does the finance minister really think that 
Canadians will accept more excuses from a committee rather than 
less taxes? 
<P><A NAME="LINK100"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, that is why we reduced taxes in last year's budget, why 
we reduced taxes in this year's budget, and why we will reduce 
taxes in the next budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be very clear what we are dealing with here.  The Reform 
Party in its report on taxation and the member for Calgary Centre

the family structure was a primary consideration in measuring

structures that would be taxed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should understand what that means. That means that when a 
lower income spouse decides to re-enter the workforce, that lower

money left for a rainy day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week, we asked the Minister of Finance if he could tell us 
what he planned to do if we hit some bad times, or a rainy day, 
as he put it.  Is he going to increase contributions to the

unemployed, or create deficits? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having had a week to think it over, could the minister give us 
an answer today? 
<P><A NAME="LINK107"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
shall tell the hon. member exactly what I told him last week, 
that one of the reasons for eradicating the deficit was that now 
we have a surplus, which will help us get through any bad times 
that might occur.  We do not want to do what the Progressive 
Conservative Party did, which was to raise contributions during 
a recession.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, when 
the minister tells us there is a surplus, first of all, there is 
none in his budget.  Second, the Minister of Human Resources 
Development tells us that it has all been spent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask him again: if there is no more money set aside, if there 
is nothing in the fund, is he going to raise premiums, reduce 
benefits, or create deficits?   It has to be one of these three. 
Otherwise, his answers do not hold up.  There is no more money 
left in the fund, and according to him there is apparently a 
zero deficit and no surplus.

<P><A NAME="LINK109"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Government of Canada has always been the guarantor of the fund, 
the guarantor for employees and employers in times of recession. 
We have always done this when there was a deficit.

reserve, the best solution would be to permit a modest 
cumulative deficit during a recession and then increase 
contribution rates slightly during the following recovery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Minister of Finance finally admit that in the next

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have just answered this question twice. In view of Canada's

would in a much better position to deal with it.  That is thanks 
to the improved state of the public purse.

<P><A NAME="LINK121"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Natural Resources and

should rest properly with those who create the waste, the owners

fall, not on the taxpayers of Canada. 
<P><A NAME="LINK156"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta—South Richmond, Ref.):</B>  Mr.

took a plan to cabinet on how to avoid public consultation on the 
disposal of nuclear waste.  He took a plan to cabinet on how to 
avoid liability for nuclear waste storage if something should go 
wrong.  He took a plan to cabinet and then he forgot about it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Natural Resources and 
Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the preamble and the allegations in the hon. gentleman's 
question is a crock of horse feathers.  The facts of the matter 
are that we had a comprehensive environmental study conducted by 
Seaborn, we have responded in detail to that report by Seaborn, 
and that is based upon full, open, transparent, public 
consultation in the public interest. 
<P><A NAME="LINK158"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the Minister of Natural Resources has indicated that we must 
address the precarious issue of nuclear fuel waste.  We 
understand that the desire of the minister is to allow industry 
to manage the control of nuclear fuel waste in this country.  The 
Seaborn panel clearly stated that a waste management organization 
at arm's length from industry is required.  Will the minister 
assure Canadians that the panel report will not be ignored and 
that an independent waste management organization will be his 
government's priority? 
<P><A NAME="LINK159"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Natural Resources and 
Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, we said in response to the Seaborn recommendations that 
it is fully the responsibility of the utilities and the other 
owners and producers of the waste in Canada for the waste 
management organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also said in our response to Seaborn that that is subject to 
federal oversight and regulatory provisions, including if 
necessary the implementation of new legislation to make 
absolutely sure that the waste management organization discharges 
its responsibilities in the public interest. 
<P><A NAME="LINK160"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Prime Minister.  The minister has two 
major responsibilities in this country, the AECB and the AECL. 
We are all very aware that the AECB has regulatory 
responsibilities that are in direct conflict with the industry 
proponent, AECL, a major stakeholder in the future development of 
nuclear waste. But Canadians are confused.  Who does what? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Prime Minister relieve the obvious conflict within the 
Ministry of Natural Resources and transfer the regulatory 
mandates of all nuclear waste to the Department of the 
Environment? 
<P><A NAME="LINK161"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, in my judgment the system works very well, but I will 
look, if it is needed.  At the end of the day the government will 
have to decide, whoever is the minister who will handle the file. 
At the end of the day the government will have to decide what to 
do.  Changing one organization and sending it to another 
department does not relieve the government from making the final 
decision.

this government in the budget included well over $200 million for 
aboriginal health, including over the next three years about $190 
million that will be devoted among other things to community and 
home care for aboriginal and first nations on reserves and in 
their communities so families can stay together while people

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-65, an 
act to amend the Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements Act, be 
read the third time and passed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK202"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
will be sharing my time with my colleague from Nanaimo—Cowichan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I rise again to speak on Bill C-65, the renewal of equalization 
payments.  I have been sitting here all day listening to 
government speakers on this debate. What I have found is that 
they have refused to answer the questions that my colleagues and 
I have put to them throughout this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have listed our concerns point by point on this bill in 
reference to equalization payments.  What we are hearing from the 
government side is the usual status quo or do nothing approach 
this government is becoming famous for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The concept of equalization is not under challenge.  We all 
understand and agree with the concept that Canadians are willing 
to share with their fellow citizens their good fortunes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have concerns and we have been saying them throughout this 
debate.  Let us start with what the auditor general has been 
saying.  In the auditor general's 1997 review he said that 
parliament is presented with the legislative proposals any time 
from a few months to a few weeks before an approval is required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is a problem is that parliament is not given adequate time 
to review this legislation. What is even more of a concern is 
that equalization makes up 8% of of all federal spending.  We as 
custodians of taxpayer dollars need to debate the effectiveness 
of all legislation where taxpayer dollars are involved.

<A HREF="#LINKT61"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we have a program in front of us that uses 8% of all 
federal program spending and what do we get?  We get probably 
three business days' notice or maybe a month's notice to look at 
this program.  That is not transparency or accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-65 from our point of view is an extremely flawed process. 
All my colleagues have been talking about their concerns. I was 
quite surprised to see the Conservatives showing the same 
concerns that we have despite the fact that at one point they 
formed the government and did not do much about this program. They have 
pointed out, as we have, the flaws in the legislation, the 
problems with this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk a little about what concerns us, the formula.  They 
have not told us what the formula is.  We do not understand this 
formula.  Who understands this formula, by the way?  It is a 
formula that is supposed to create equality in Canada.  That is 
funny, a formula that is supposed to create equality and members 
of parliament cannot even understand how it is calculated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from the NDP this morning said he tried to look at 
the formula and gave up.  We have a formula that nobody 
understands and it is now becoming even more complicated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a question I am asking the government. Government MPs 
have been standing up and defending this equalization program 
with all its greatness, as they say, but they themselves do not 
understand it.  How can they stand up and defend an expenditure 
when they do not know how it is calculated?  This is a weird 
concept. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government MPs have given the power to the bureaucrats again. 
It is the bureaucrats who are running the expenditure, not the 
House of Commons, not the elected members here.  That is what is 
coming from that side and it makes me concerned and a little sad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general has also talked about the formula and has 
said that he would like this thing to be addressed.  The 
department said it would address the formula issue.  It is quite 
interesting that even the bureaucrats have been struggling with 
this for 30 years and have had no success.  It is becoming a 
guessing game. This is a cause of concern for everybody because 
what has the formula created? It has created inequality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We now have seven provinces that we consider have nots.  We have 
three have provinces.  As my colleague this morning pointed out, 
some of the have not provinces have far more extensive social 
programs for their citizens than the have provinces, and I 
applaud them for that, yet they are called the have not 
provinces. In the have not provinces some of the programs are far 
superior.  Where is this equality? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole formula issue was in a study done by Queen's 
University.

<A HREF="#LINKT62"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It took only two years to use the formula.  After that it 
was a band-aid solution.  The rest of the time the system is 
driven by various bells and whistles, which means that it is not 
addressing the real issue.  It is at the whim of bureaucrats or 
at the whim of politicians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an example, Newfoundland Premier Tobin's expected deficit 
budget indicated that it was subject to manipulation.  By whom? 
By bureaucrats and by politicians.  Members of parliament who are 
supposedly the custodians of taxpayers money are unable and 
cannot find out how 8% of federal spending was spent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This concept is justified by a very noble statement that services should 
be equal throughout Canada.  It is driven by that statement and 
that is all it is driven by.  After that it is lost in the middle 
of bureaucracy, in the maze of manipulation and inequality. There 
is something seriously wrong with the whole concept.  That is 
what my party is challenging, not the noble concept of 
equalization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where are transparency and accountability?  As I mentioned, 
members of parliament see in the budget document that so much 
money has gone to the have not provinces from the have provinces. 
It is a very strange concept, as my colleague pointed out, that 
seven provinces are have not provinces and three provinces are 
have provinces in a country that has the best standard of living 
in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no accountability.  What concerns me is that it is for 
the next five years.  Perhaps government members have a problem. 
I think that is why they have been ramming through the bill to 
meet some deadline.  They could not come up with a proper review 
of the formula, but they could have extended it for six months 
while a parliamentary committee looked into the whole process. 
All members who have given speeches in the House are in agreement 
with the concept, so I would not see any problem with all parties 
studying the issue for the next six months. 
<P><A NAME="LINK203"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I value 
the intervention of my colleague.  He gave some very good 
insights into the whole process of equalization renewal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very curious that the legislation requires the program be 
renewed every five years but departmental officials work on the 
process for approximately two and a half years.  We get that from 
the auditor general's report.  The officials work in the back 
rooms.  There are consultations with the provinces, also in the 
back rooms.  However the final say is given by parliament because 
it is the expenditure of federal money.  It is money for which we 
as members of parliament are responsible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very curious and totally inadequate, even according to the 
auditor general, that parliament be given so little time.  As I 
mentioned earlier in an intervention, we were given but three 
working days to study the legislation when it was introduced at 
first reading.  We had no time to look at it in advance.  We had 
no time to study it and look at the different convolutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to put on the record of the House of Commons in 
this short question and comment period something the auditor 
general has said because I think it is very important: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that the process needs to be opened up to facilitate 
wider participation in the consideration of changes to such a 
fundamental program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many interest parties, including some leading academics, have 
given considerable thought to this program and we believe their 
views could be useful.  The government tried this approach once, 
in 1981, when it established the Parliamentary Task Force on 
Federal-Provincial Arrangements (Breau Committee), which focused 
on all fiscal transfers, including equalization.  Its report, 
<I>Fiscal Federalism in Canada</I>, stands today as one of the 
best public assessments of Canada's fiscal situation.

parliamentarians.  He made the following recommendation:

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Department of Finance should ensure that parliament is 
consulted in a meaningful way on the periodic renewal of 
equalization.

</I></B></P><P align=left>My intervention is probably more a comment than a question, but 
certainly I would invite the member from Calgary to concur with 
what I just said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai:</B>  Madam Speaker, I have no comment to

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>FEDERAL-PROVINCIAL FISCAL ARRANGEMENTS ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK208">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-65, an 
act to amend the Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements Act, be 
read the third time and passed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK209"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo—Cowichan, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to debate Bill C-65, an act to amend the 
Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A long time ago a universal question was asked in the biblical 
story of Cain and Abel: am I my brother's keeper.  The answer 
from the Bible that permeates the social justice system of the 
western world is yes.  Yes, we are our brother's keeper.  We have 
a social and moral responsibility to see that the poor, the less 
fortunate and the weak in society are taken care of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore I would not argue that the equalization program is a 
valued part of the federal-provincial relationship.  We have 
regions of our country that have found greater prosperity than 
others.  They have long been termed the have and the have not 
provinces.  Typically the have provinces have included British 
Columbia, Alberta and Ontario.  The remaining provinces have been 
given the dubious title of the have not provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, the whole point of the equalization program is to 
ensure that there is a minimal level of service for all Canadians 
in all parts of Canada.  My time will not be used to refute that 
premise.  While all of us would agree that the premise of 
equalization payments has long been a part of the Canadian social 
make-up, the actual process leaves much to be desired. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has shown a complete contempt toward the citizens 
of Canada, the auditor general and parliamentary procedure.  In 
the auditor general's report the following point was made: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Department of Finance ... could use parliament more 
effectively, soliciting advice from a wider circle of interested 
parties, rather than relying almost exclusively on the advice of 
a committee of federal and provincial officials. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has simply not occurred.  As my hon. colleague just pointed 
out, at the initial introduction of the bill there were only 
three business days in which to review the documents and to 
prepare for debate.  Reform staff had to ask to receive a 
briefing from finance officials in order to determine the effects 
of the proposed legislation.  This is not good enough if 
government is to work for the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The equalization program makes up 8% of all federal program 
spending.  A program this large deserves more than just a 
superficial glance.

<A HREF="#LINKT64"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask that a review of this procedure take place.  The 
House is to be used as a forum for debate that brings in 
alternative ideas, constructive criticism and allows the Canadian 
public full access to the parliamentary process.  I do not 
believe this has occurred. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Department of Finance has had five years in which to prepare 
for the legislation.  Every five years the legislation must come 
to parliament to ensure that parliamentarians and indeed all 
Canadians know what transactions have occurred between the 
federal and provincial governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general's final concluding remark was that the 
Department of Finance ought to devote more effort to its 
relationship with parliament.  Parliament is the legislator for 
the program and the body to which the department and the minister 
are accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He concluded that in their view this relationship could be used 
to the advantage of the department and for the betterment of the 
program.  Plain and simply, this has not happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance and his departmental officials have 
simply ignored the report of the auditor general in this regard. 
It is outrageous to think that a minister of the crown can so 
blatantly ignore the office of the auditor general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One has to wonder if there is something else amiss.  The 
Minister of Finance knew that the bill must come before the House 
for debate and final approval by March 31, 1999.  Yet he 
introduced it only weeks before this deadline.  The minister and 
his department have had five years in which to prepare 
legislation, and yet the House is now asked to rush it through. 
Unfortunately this happens far too often in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My second point is with regard to the matter of fairness. 
Currently the equalization payment is made by calculations of 33 
different revenue sources.  This is an incredibly complex 
formula.  Few people in government truly understand how it works. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The model looks at 33 tax elements of the economies of five 
provinces and tries to estimate how much revenue the province can 
raise in each category.  For each tax element it then converts 
each estimate into a per capita figure, totals them and 
multiplies them by the number of people in the province to arrive 
at the equalization payment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ten provinces have 10 different methods of calculating property 
taxes, income taxes, resource values and all other calculations 
that make up the 33 different revenue values calculated in the 
equalization payment.  Where is the fairness in that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the greatest inequities that affects my riding of 
Nanaimo—Cowichan is the calculation of resources.  While it is 
recognized that the value of the timber harvested in the province 
of B.C. is greater than that which is harvested in Saskatchewan, 
the cost of production is not taken into account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us consider the following.  According to the Council of 
Forest Industry the cost of building logging roads in B.C. in 
1997 was $715 million.  The cost of building logging roads has 
risen by 171% since 1992.  The equalization formula does not take 
all this into account.  This disparity will continue to grow. 
Simply the system is flawed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My third major concern is the incentive to change.  The way the 
system is currently structured there is no incentive to move from 
a have not province to a have province.  For a have not province 
to increase its tax revenues means that it will turn loose a 
portion of its equalization payment.  In general terms it is 
easier to accept money from outside the province than it is to 
raise it within the province itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister and his department have escaped much 
constructive criticism on this important issue by ensuring that 
the process is not transparent or easily understood.  The more 
complex the system, the fewer the number of people who will 
understand it.  The fewer who understand it, the easier it is for 
the Minister of Finance to subject it to political manipulation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a system is complex it is easy to be inaccurate and 
ultimately unfair.  The system can be made much simpler.  One 
such consideration would be to calculate the payments for the 
equalization program based upon provincial GDP.  This would 
ensure that individual provinces cannot make internal adjustments 
and therefore add to the revenues from outside dollars.  GDPs are 
not subject to adjustment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Equalization payments should go to those provinces that require 
them the most. 
As one of the richest countries in the world, it is hard to 
believe that 70% of Canada's provinces are declared to be have 
not provinces.  This simply boggles the mind.

equalization program will cost taxpayers an additional $700 
million over the next five years.  This to me does not appear to 
be sound fiscal management. This current program pits Canadians 
in one province against those in another.  For all the government 
says, in reality this program is divisive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a whole, Canadians are known to be compassionate, generous 
and caring for one another.  We have seen this time and time 
again during the past several years with ice storms in Ontario 
and Quebec and major flood disasters in Manitoba.  Canadians all 
across the country reached out to assist other Canadians in need. 
They did it without being asked.  They did it in their 
neighbourhoods and from afar because they believe that they are 
their brother's keeper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The equalization program does not do this.  Surely there are 
better ways to do business for all Canadians, but the finance 
minister has chosen an arrogant approach in the handling of this 
matter. With the inherent problems and inequities that still 
exist under this legislation, I must oppose it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I would 
like to thank my hon. colleague for his speech regarding this 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the member has a large interest in the funding of health 
care which has had quite a history in Canada.  When our 
forefathers put our Constitution together, they gave explicit 
responsibility to the provinces to run the health care system in 
each province.  Over time, particularly in the last 30 years or 
so, there has been quite a shift in this.  The federal government 
originally intervened by paying voluntarily apparently with no 
strings attached 50% of the costs.  It used its spending power to 
intrude into a provincial jurisdiction. Over the last several 
years that has eroded.  The number which I last heard is 13% of 
actual costs are covered by the federal government although it 
continues to tax us the same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I presume the member has given some thought to how the federal 
government should be participating in the health care funding. I 
would appreciate it if he would give us his insight into this and 
perhaps tie it into the whole idea of equalization.  I would like 
to know from him whether he would like to see the CHST separated 
from equalization or merged with it, perhaps like the giant HST 
where the sales tax was merged.  Perhaps we could merge the 
outgoing money, instead of the incoming money and equalize it per 
capita for each province and territory so that they could provide 
close to equal services to their people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know how much thought the member has given to it, but I 
would be very interested in his response to that question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague 
for his question.  I am very interested in the country's health 
care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government in proposing the universal medicare 
system a number of years ago did indeed shoulder its fair share 
of the load.  At that point it was contributing some 50% of the 
moneys for health care. Like many other good things that over the 
years turn progressively worse, the health care system has 
deteriorated because the federal government has failed to live up 
to that initial obligation.  The hon. member is quite right.  It 
is down to 13% and less now in terms of actual funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of equalization payments, what we have here is another 
inequitable system that is based on a very abstract and complex 
way of figuring it out.  Over the years it has not done justice 
to balancing across the nation the need for fairness in our 
taxation system, in the amount of money that government provides 
for people and for the health care system itself. 
I would certainly say that the government and all of us as 
legislators here in the House should be giving far more thought 
to the reform of this system.

comments.  I was giving the hon. member the opportunity to ask a 
question.  I have another question if time permits. 
<P><A NAME="LINK211"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview—Greenwood, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to participate in this 
debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday when we were debating Bill C-55, that bill which 
protects this country's magazine industry, I said that I was a 
passionate interventionist. Today I am happy to see that we have 
another debate in the House which in essence deals with 
Government of Canada intervention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quite frankly, I believe that the purpose of all of us sitting 
in the House of Commons is to deal with different levels, 
different styles of government intervention. I believe our 
purpose in sitting in the House of Commons is to speak for those 
people who do not have a voice, to speak for those regions of 
Canada that from time to time need voices to stand up for them. 
When I hear debates in the House of Commons where we stand up for 
people who need a referee in terms of making sure that their 
needs or their concerns are looked out for, I cheer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel sad when I see an issue like that of homelessness and the 
Government of Canada is not in a position to respond in a direct 
way. Some of our listeners and some of the members today might 
wonder what I mean by that.  Over the past few years, in the name 
of fiscal responsibility we have boarded up Government of Canada 
instruments, or Government of Canada departments or agencies that 
allowed us to intervene when we needed things done in the common 
good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Homelessness is one of those issues which I think illustrates 
that by disengaging too rapidly and too radically we have lost 
our ability to intervene. This problem exists in my city and in 
other cities across Canada.  People are living on the streets. 
Families, and not all of them are young families, are living in 
motel rooms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my city of Toronto, the richest city in all of Canada, over 
1,200 families are living in motel rooms. Think of that.  A 
country as rich as Canada, a city as rich as Toronto, and over 
1,200 families with young children are living in motel rooms.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, which is a 
Government of Canada agency, had the national authority to 
participate in housing requirements in whatever region of Canada, 
we in this House of Commons could have intervened in a second. We 
could have fixed that problem. We could have had a national 
housing policy. But in 1989 we devolved and the government said 
that it did not want to intervene, that it wanted to walk away. 
There would be less bureaucracy, less intervention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This chamber walked away from the responsibility that had been 
bestowed on the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, a 
Government of Canada crown agency.  We walked away saying that we 
would let the provinces look after it, that we would give them 
the constitutional authority to deal with that national issue and 
that we would let them do it by province. That was a mistake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said it yesterday and I will say it again today.  I believe 
that the Government of Canada, when there is a national crisis 
should have the authority and instruments to intervene.  I 
believe in intervention.  I believe in it passionately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It almost makes me sick when I think that we are sitting here 
with a $160 billion budget process and we do not have the 
mechanism or the authority to intervene and look after those 
families that are living in motel rooms, or that this national 
chamber cannot figure out a way to get those people who are 
living on the streets in whatever city of Canada into medical 
centres where they can be looked after. Most of those people 
living on the streets in sleeping bags are there more through a 
mental health condition than anything else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I see the bill in front of the House today talking about 
equalization, I cheer.  The essence of the country is that those 
who are advantaged must look out for those who are disadvantaged. 
There are regions of Canada that have extraordinary wealth and 
resources.  We are here in this chamber to make sure that all 
members of the national family have access to the total riches of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hear the opposition talk about less government intervention 
and interference.  That is an abdication of our responsibility in 
this chamber.  We are not in this chamber to speak for the 
advantaged.  We are not in this chamber to speak for those people 
who can look after themselves.  We are here for the exact 
opposite reason, generally speaking for those people, regions or 
situations where government intervention is required, because the 
voice of those people or the message of those situations is not 
getting through.  We are here to make sure that it does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could have an honest disagreement on levels of intervention 
and types of intervention, but let us at least agree that the 
essence of the responsibility we share in this chamber is 
government intervention.  We should not be shy about it. 
We should not run from it.  We should be proud of it.  This is 
something that I could never understand about the Reform Party.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Many members of the Reform Party come from the province of 
Alberta and other regions of the west.  Historically, government 
intervention at all levels, but certainly at the national level, 
played a tremendous role in building the fabric of western Canada 
from the railway through to the oil and gas business through to 
the wheat board and all of the areas that are considered to be 
the jewels of the west. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sectors of the western economic fabric were reinforced and 
embellished because of Government of Canada intervention, 
intervention from this Chamber, over the past number of years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a mystery to me when Reform members stand to say “We do 
not want Government of Canada intervention.  Why would we let 
bureaucrats intervene?”  That is really misstating what happens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bureaucrats or officials of government do not do things on their 
own, without direction; they implement the political decisions 
that are taken in this Chamber.  We tend from time to time to 
knock bureaucrats, but we should not do that.  They are there to 
implement what we ask them to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Essentially, if someone is knocking a bureaucrat they are 
knocking what goes on in this House because they follow the law 
of the land by department.  Those directions come from the laws 
that are made in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we cut, cut, cut, our public servants, our officials, 
cannot do their work because they do not have the resources or 
the manpower.  I will give a specific example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember when the Conservative government came to power in 
1984.  It said that it would cut the bureaucracy by 10% across 
the board.  In my city we have a huge immigration challenge. 
When 10% of the bureaucrats were cut from the department of 
immigration it caused lineups.  It caused people to jump the 
queue.  There were no more immigration police.  We ended up with 
people coming in through underground means. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It created a bigger problem in the long run.  We were penny-wise 
and pound foolish.  The government wanted to have the 
satisfaction of saying to the general public “We will cut those 
bureaucrats”.  That was folly because we, the people of Canada, 
ended up getting a quality of service that ultimately did not 
serve our community or the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We applaud the opposition's support for the thrust of this 
equalization bill which is being debated today.  However, let us 
stop knocking government intervention.  Let us start celebrating 
it because that, in essence, is the life of a national 
parliamentarian.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills—Grasslands, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I have heard some funny things in this House, but 
the intervention by the hon. member for Broadview—Greenwood in 
which he suggests that government intervention has been 
beneficial to the economy of western Canada is one of the 
funniest that I have ever heard. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1550"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT69"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He referred specifically to the CPR and to the western oil 
industry.  I grant you that the railways in general owed their 
existence to the intervention of the federal government, but I 
would also venture to say that the people of western Canada paid 
for those interventions tenfold, twentyfold, thirtyfold while 
they were raped by the railways, by the central Canadian 
establishment sucking the resources out of the west and putting 
nothing back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as our oil industry goes, the only federal intervention 
of any consequence that I am aware of in the petroleum industry 
was the national energy program, which was designed to murder the 
oil industry in western Canada and very nearly succeeded.  We had 
refugees from Alberta all over the country trying to escape what 
was done to the industry by the Liberal predecessor to this 
federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because the member for Broadview—Greenwood is acknowledged to 
be quite knowledgeable on taxation, I would like to put a 
question to him.  If we are going to have equalization payments, 
and I do not think anybody in any party in this House would say 
that we should not, why do we have to have these dreadful 
convoluted formulae tying them to God knows what?  Why could we 
not just simply have a transfer of funds, a cheque from Ottawa to 
the have not provinces based solely on per capita GDP in those 
provinces and get away from all of this crazy bureaucracy?  Why 
not? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank the member 
for his questions.  I will first deal with the elimination of the 
cap on CAP in the transfers.  I would never have eliminated the 
cap on CAP.  I would have done the equalization in a way that 
these moneys would have been handed directly by department, by 
members of parliament in this Chamber so that the Government of 
Canada presence could have been reinvigorated, especially in the 
remote regions of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On this notion of writing a single cheque to the premiers, I 
would not trust half of them.  The notion of them distributing 
this money is not something that appeals to me.  We are here to 
think in terms of the national interest and they do not tend to 
think that way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us deal with the member's issue on tax reform.  I support 
every member in this House from all sides and all parties in the 
idea that the biggest challenge we have in this Chamber is 
comprehensive tax reform.  I think the tax act of this country is 
a scandal.  I really believe that.  We have 50,000 cases in front 
of the courts of Canada on tax challenges and 95% of them are 
with huge corporations that know how to essentially challenge or 
rig the system.  I pray for the day when we can all come together 
on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third point was the national energy program.  I was working 
in Ottawa in Mr. Trudeau's office at the time.  I think the 
national energy program was like a crafted jewel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills:</B>  Oh, no, no.  The security of supply, 
the conservation thrust and the Canadianization of our resource 
related to energy.  There were gangster-like tactics being used 
by the American oil companies to push us around and bully us. 
Finally Brian Mulroney came in and threw it out the door.  It was 
absolutely scandalous.  The national energy program was a jewel, 
a crafted jewel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot wait for the debate when we deal with making sure that 
we manage the sharing and caring of our national water resources 
in this country.  I am deathly afraid that the Reform Party is 
going to say “Give it away”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The final point has to do with the member's formula of 
distribution.  I believe that was the first point. 
We can debate the formula, but in essence what we are saying is, 
let us take those provinces that are haves in terms of cash and 
distribute to those that are have nots.  There is always room for 
improving the actual formula and I accept the member's point on 
that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac—Mégantic, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, at 
the beginning of his speech, the member for Broadview—Greenwood 
said that it was up to the government to defend society's 
weakest members, those without a voice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said that over 12,000 families in Toronto were forced to live 
in motel rooms.  Last summer on Toronto's Yonge Street it was 
impossible to walk 30 metres without running into one or two 
homeless people begging for money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the Liberal Party to which the member for 
Broadview—Greenwood belongs took office in 1993, this number has 
steadily risen. 
The member said he wanted to defend the homeless, the neediest 
members of society, those who do not have a voice.  Yet his 
government has slashed provincial transfer payments for health, 
education and social services by $42 billion.  Obviously, the 
provinces made cuts in turn, with the result that these people 
must beg for money to provide for their daily needs, or live in 
motels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is easy for the member to say, and I quote  “As we know, most 
of those people living on the streets in sleeping bags are there 
more through a mental health condition than anything else”.  I 
would agree that some of them have mental health problems, but I 
would not go so far as to say that all the homeless are so 
afflicted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current federal government, his government, a Liberal 
government, has slashed the funding available for the neediest 
members of society.  One example is employment insurance. 
There was a time when 92% of those who paid EI premiums 
qualified for benefits.  Today, four years after the EI reform, 
a little over 40% of those who pay premiums qualify; 60% are 
paying into the plan for nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder whether my colleague, the member for 
Broadview—Greenwood, would urge his colleagues, the ministers in 
various departments, to have cabinet amend various pieces of 
legislation so that the first scenario in his speech would hold, 
and more importantly, be respected, so that it would not just be 
idle talk to impress the voters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the member for 
Frontenac—Mégantic for his question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He is right in his comment about Toronto's homeless.  But I made 
a distinction between those who are ill and those who are 
homeless. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to be very clear that I did not say all of those people 
who are homeless in motels.  I said those people who are living 
and sleeping in sleeping blankets on the street.  There is a 
dramatic difference and I want the record to show it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to say to the member that his comments are 
constructive.  I think he is right on the money.  If there is one 
thing I have learned to appreciate about members of the Bloc 
Quebecois is that they are very sensitive to issues that tend to 
be for those who do not have a voice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I obviously totally disagree with the hon. member's views on 
trying to divide the country, but we all know that issue is 
coming to an end.  Separatism is almost dead.  But I totally 
respect his views on speaking out for those who do not have a 
voice and I will continue to fight within our team to make sure 
we are more sensitive.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Madam

</I></B></P><P align=left>No one in the House would disagree that there is a need to take 
care of those less privileged.  What we disagree with is creating 
an institutionalized welfare state in certain provinces by virtue 
of handouts from the federal government.  By doing this, we are 
entrenching the dependence of these provinces on these 
equalization payments.  What we should be doing is focusing on 
how we can make have not provinces have provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1957 when this system of equalization payments was 
created, I would ask the hon. member how many of these provinces 
have permanently gone from have not provinces to have provinces. 
There is not one that I am aware of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We establish a baseline where those provinces that are making 
less and have less than the other provinces are supported, as 
well they should. That is fair.  However, to engage in the 
equalization payments that we have now, a system that is unfair 
and divisive, is something that does not bring the country 
together but rather separates it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A fairer measure would be to establish a baseline on which those 
provinces are not able to manage.  They may have fallen on hard 
times or their economy is not doing as well as it should and 
their people are suffering.  They are able to get handouts from 
the federal government so that they can share in the same 
privileges as people in the rest of Canada. That is fair and that 
is what Canadians stands for. However, to redistribute wealth on 
some arbitrary level is not fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My province of British Columbia is one that constantly gives 
money to the have not provinces.  We do not mind doing that 
because people in British Columbia care.  What they do not want 
is to give money to provinces that are not have not provinces and 
have no demonstrable need.  There is a convoluted formula made by 
the federal government where money is redistributed based on the 
essence of that formula rather than on the need of the people in 
that province.  We need to focus on human need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only do we need to focus on human need but we need to focus 
on two aspects of that.  Everybody in the House would agree on 
supporting individuals who cannot take care of themselves.  That 
is what is good about Canada.  We do not tolerate individuals 
who, as the hon. member mentioned, are living on the streets 
through no fault of their own.  They may be psychiatric patients 
who are not well taken care of by the system we have and we want 
to take care of those people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also want to ensure that the people who can take care of 
themselves have the tools to do that.  Investment in the tools 
and capabilities of individuals to help themselves, as we should 
be investing in the tools and capabilities of provinces to take 
care of themselves, is what equalization payments should be all 
about.  That is not taking place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general chronically and eloquently gives the federal 
government and indeed all of us constructive solutions on how we 
can enable individuals and provinces to be more effective 
caretakers of themselves.  Is this listened to?  No, it is not. 
Despite the fine efforts of the auditor general he is simply not 
listened to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Broadview—Greenwood, the finance minister 
and other members on the other side know very well those 
suggestions are constructive but they, like their predecessors in 
government, have turned a blind eye to the constructive 
interventions of the auditor general, interventions and solutions 
that if implemented could dramatically increase the federal 
government's role and also greatly improve the provinces' roles 
and capabilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public may not be aware but a minuscule part of the auditor 
general's report is ever listened and an even lesser amount is 
ever implemented, which is a profound tragedy. What we need to do 
is focus on solutions. 
What should the federal government be doing with equalization 
payments?  The first thing is focusing on how we can give people 
the fishing rod to fish for the food to take care of themselves.

is deal with the oppressive tax regime we have. This is not 
something that is just insular but affects our country and its 
ability to function and be competitive internationally.  The hon. 
member knows this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is coming from members of the Reform Party, from other 
parties, from the public, from other countries and from 
independent think tanks.  They are all saying the same thing. 
Canada cannot compete because our tax regime is too high, too 
complex and too oppressive.  We can fix the problem.  Until we 
fix the problem, businesses in Canada will be unable to be the 
best they can be.  Let us fix it.

from backbenchers on the other side such as a flat tax, 
increasing the basic minimum, decreasing the tax regimes, 
decreasing the maximum amount and the amount people on the bottom 
pay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we were able to do that we would have more money in the hands 
of the poorest of the poor.  Many would be off the tax roll.  The 
stimulus to work and strive and work harder would come back into 
the Canadian economy and the high oppressive tax rate that seeks 
to support the underground economy would be lessened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we were able to do that, no longer would we see the best and 
brightest in our country move south of the border.  No longer 
would we see as many companies going belly up.  No longer would 
we see companies going south of the border not because of a free 
trade agreement but because they cannot compete when their tax 
rates are 33% higher than in the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No longer would we see Canadians who love their country asking 
how they can justify staying in Canada when their income is 44% 
lower after taxes in Canada than in the United States.  They do 
not go south of the border because of a love of the United 
States. They go because that country provides them with the 
greatest ability to be the best they can become, to use the tools 
and talents they have acquired in the Canadian education system 
to be effective contributors to an economy. Why do we not change 
that around so that Canadians can stay in Canada and contribute 
to our economy? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The longer the government persists in supporting this tax 
structure, the longer we will see an erosion of our country not 
only from an economic point of view but from a social 
perspective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The more people off work, the greater the demands on our social 
programs because the greater the erosion of the individual soul, 
the greater the incidence of psychiatric problems, depression and 
substance abuse.  Interpersonal relationships are eroded in those 
circumstances.  Furthermore, by keeping the tax structures high, 
we actually decrease the revenues that go into the government's 
coffers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Former Prime Minister Mulroney, I believe in 1992, actually 
decreased the tax rates for a short period of time.  What 
happened?  Money came into the public coffers at an increased 
amount, which meant more money for social programs, more money 
for research and development and more ability to decrease the tax 
structure some more.  What did Mr. Mulroney do after that?  He 
started on an orgy of taxation.  He increased taxes, and as a 
result moneys went down that came to the public coffers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore the increased tax rates we have today are harmful on 
the rich but they are more harmful for those who are poor and 
underprivileged because they erode the tax base, they erode the 
power governments have to invest in the programs to take care of 
those who are most underprivileged.  This means less money for 
health care, less money for education, less money for pensions 
and less money for support programs for those who are retired and 
cannot take care of themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Constructive solutions have come from the House and from outside 
the House.  Members from across party lines are literally begging 
the government to listen to the solutions and implement them.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not rocket science.  The problems Canada faces are faced 
by other countries. Look at the Nordic experience.  Many Nordic 
countries have a very large socialist bent, a bent we 
historically have had. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They came to the realization that they are harming people in 
their countries, especially those who were most underprivileged. 
By maintaining the high tax rates Sweden was gutting its own 
economy.  As a result it was forced to drop the tax rates and 
right now there is a healthier economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Look at what happened in Great Britain.  The highly oppressive 
tax regime it had was choking the life out of its economy.  The 
rich do not have to worry.  They will just leave. They can 
manage.  It is the poor and the middle class who do not have a 
choice who are hurt the most by this system of oppressive taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a myth that lowering taxes will somehow benefit the rich 
at the expense of the poor.  That is bunk.  Lowering taxes helps, 
above all else, the poor and middle class.  Furthermore, it can 
be used to strengthen the social programs we have today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I implore the ministers across the way to take the experiences 
of the people in this country and also look at the experiences of 
other countries, first world nations like ours, that have had 
similar experiences and have found solutions to their problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing the government needs to look at are rules and 
regulations.  When everyone goes back home, to our communities, 
when we speak to business men and women, what do they say? 
Beyond taxes, the oppressive rules and regulations choke the 
ability for them to compete, to actually work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These rules and regulations are a gordian knot and we need to 
take a sword and cut it.  Good rules and regulations are useful. 
Bad ones are not.  We have this propensity to ask what rules and 
regulations should we construct now rather than asking what we 
should do about rationalizing the rules and regulations we have, 
finding out what we need and getting rid of what we do not.  We 
do not do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A very useful project or action by the government would be to 
commit soon by saying let us take a look at the rules and 
regulations that the feds have implemented in every single 
ministry. Look at the rules and regulations and rationalize them. 
Get rid of the ones that are not necessary and keep the ones that 
are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next thing to do is that ministers bring together their 
provincial counterparts, sit down at a table and say we are not 
leaving here unless we decide what we each do best. In other 
words, ensure that the feds do what the feds do best, that the 
provinces do what the provinces do best and separate out those 
rules, regulations and responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The longer we maintain the complex and oppressive regime we have 
now of overlap, when the left hand does not know what the right 
hand is doing, the longer we maintain a very costly and 
inefficient system.  Remember that with every rule and regulation 
we have, every time we institute something it may have a benefit 
but it also has a cost.  We have to measure out what the 
opportunity costs of those are.  We have to determine whether the 
implementation of this rule or regulation is for the betterment 
of the public and whether that implementation outweighs the cost 
that will be incurred not only by governments but by the public. 
In effect they are one and the same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I implore the government to do that.  We have been requesting 
that for a very long time.  It would take strong and innovative 
leadership to do that but that is a challenge I lay at the feet 
of the government today.  It needs to do that now.  Failure to do 
that is a costly omission that will continue to oppress our 
economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing we have to look at is research and development.  I 
compliment the government over the last two budgets in putting 
forth money into research and development.  It is indeed a good 
thing. 
It is one of the pillars of our economy. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1615"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT74"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A better thing to do is to enable companies to have the money to 
do that.  If companies are to have the ability to engage in 
research and development, they need the money in their pockets to 
do so.  They want to do it but they cannot.  Again it goes back 
to our tax structure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government can also experiment with innovative measures to 
provide tax credits to companies that engage in research and 
development.  It is very important.  I look at the experience 
south of the border.  The government needs to look at what the 
U.S. is doing to give its private sector the ability to engage in 
research and development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at a micro example, California.  We as a country 
have to do move with the changes in our economy.  In many cases 
we have to move from an economy that is largely resource based to 
something more.  California had a problem.  In the cold war it 
was a primary manufacturer of armaments.  It was very important 
to its economy.  California's population is about the same as 
Canada's. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After the cold war concluded the need for armament went down 
dramatically.  It was faced with a crisis of adaptation, how to 
adapt to the situation in the short term.  California did it 
through some very innovative measures.  I encourage the 
government to look at them.  California is now a world leader in 
high technology, pharmaceuticals and the service industry.  I 
encourage the government to look at examples like California to 
see what role government should play in terms of enabling Canada 
as a nation to move from resource based industries into something 
else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also encourage the government to look at experiences in other 
countries in various regards.  I take one example that is close 
to my heart because my riding has a large population of 
fishermen.  Fishing, as we currently know, has taken a large hit. 
We will never be able to go back to the system we had before. Let 
us look at an innovative way of dealing with that.  Rather than 
pouring money into make work projects for fishermen to clean up 
areas, projects that give them no long term capability of earning 
revenue, let us look at ways to give them long term skills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Norway is a world leader in fish farming.  It is not like what 
was done in southeast Asia which has been very destructive to its 
environment.  We have a superb ambassador in Norway; she is very 
competent.  Perhaps we could use our embassies to find what is 
best in the countries they are in and to feed that intelligence 
to our country and our leaders.  We could discover innovative 
ideas these countries are employing that will help Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many things that have been done in other countries can be 
employed here.  We do not need to reinvent the wheel.  The fish 
farming experience in Norway is something that could be employed 
not only on the west coast but also on the east coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Equalization payments, as I said before, have at times further 
institutionalized the welfare state in certain regions of the 
country.  We need to be able to give these regions the tools to 
take care of themselves.  Newfoundland is one example of an area 
that has been devastated in many ways.  There is not a lot there, 
but there are things Newfoundland can do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to look at ways to give the people of Newfoundland the 
tools to take care of themselves.  We should not support areas or 
regions where there is simply no way the people will survive 
because the resources and the ability to work are not there. They 
should be convinced to go into areas where they can work, where 
they can earn money.  They should be given the tools and the 
resources to make the move, to make the change so that they get 
off the national welfare rolls and create a way of providing a 
stronger future for tomorrow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I raised a number of points.  We do not support the 
bill because the equalization system is archaic, inefficient, and 
does not get to the heart of the problem.  I encourage the 
government to look at the ideas that have been put forward by my 
colleagues in the Reform Party and members in other parties.  It 
should listen to them, adopt them, and use them for the 
betterment of Canada and Canadians.

Speaker, I listened to the remarks of the member for 
Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca.  I thought they were insightful.  I 
especially agreed with his notion of comprehensive tax reform. 
There was not a sentence in the part of his speech that dealt 
with comprehensive tax reform with which I did not agree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should understand and the people of Canada should understand 
how the system works in terms of moving a government to change 
its ways.  All members have been here for almost two years.  In 
the fall as we led up to the budget preparation period we did not 
have one opposition day with any tight focus on comprehensive tax 
reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My remarks are intended to be constructive.  I was hopeful, when 
a number of additional members from the Reform Party came here 
during the last term knowing that they had a huge commitment to 
comprehensive tax reform, that would be one of the centrepieces 
of their strategy in trying to mobilize debate and the will to 
take on the huge problem of changing our cumbersome tax act, 
which is inefficient and does not work any longer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to suggest to members in opposition that it is 
not enough for one, two, three or four members to speak to 
comprehensive tax reform as the member did. As I say I agree with 
every sentence in that regard, but we have to mobilize at least 
100 or 140 members in here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  That is what we are trying to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills:</B>  I am doing my best on this side of 
the House but it is a heck of a lot tougher when in government to 
move the will of the system.  Challenging the government is a 
core responsibility of the opposition side.  I hope the speech of 
the member for Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca is the beginning of a 
long, focused and forceful debate from the opposition on 
comprehensive tax reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He will find there are probably about 25 or 30 members on this 
side of the House who share the notion that what we need more 
than anything now is to fix the rotten tax act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for Broadview—Greenwood for his insight.  He has been as leader 
in tax reform in the House.  I know members across the way would 
be very interested and very open to having members from this 
side, in particular our finance critic, the member for Medicine 
Hat, work with them on establishing tax reform.  In fact the 
member for Medicine Hat has worked for a very long time in 
putting forth constructive solutions to the government on how we 
could fix it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I challenge the government, members of the public, members of 
the private sector and companies out there to send their 
constructive solutions to the Prime Minister and the Minister of 
Finance on comprehensive tax reform.  As the member for 
Broadview—Greenwood mentioned, I look forward to bringing 
together a group that has the ardent ear of the Prime Minister, 
that will listen and act on the constructive solutions which will 
be placed before it in the very short term.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the opportunity to engage in this debate.  It has been 
interesting today because I think we all recognize that what is 
happening here is not good enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In general there is an inadequate explanation from the finance 
department to parliamentarians of what we are voting on today. 
Most members do not understand how the equalization system works. 
I rather doubt that most government members know how it works. 
Yet they will be told how to vote and that is what will happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question for my colleague who gave a very good 
intervention that has to do with the debate between him and the 
member for Broadview—Greenwood.  The member for 
Broadview—Greenwood said explicitly that he was a passionate 
interventionist.  That is a quotation from <I>Hansard</I> 
yesterday.  He said the same thing today.  He said he believed in 
intervention and believed in it passionately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The equalization payment system takes through taxation money 
from people in all provinces and distributes it to seven 
provinces.  The result is that the federal government, by 
intervening in this way, lands up taking money that is paid by 
poor people in one of the three have provinces and distributing 
it per capita to people who are very well off in the have not 
provinces.  We have a government intervention that effectively 
transfers money from poor people to rich people in different 
parts of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Oh, come on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  That is accurate.  The member opposite is 
questioning this point.  I have studied it.  I have been up to my 
ears in equalization.  This actually happens.  It is a fact 
because equalization is based on a per capita computation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to give my hon. colleague from the Reform Party who 
just spoke an opportunity to reinforce in the mind of the member 
from Broadview—Greenwood that not all government intervention 
goes in the right direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague 
from Elk Island for that intervention.  Intervention can be done 
in two ways.  It can be done with a view toward the needs of the 
people involved or it can be done in a way that can be 
destructive.  Intervention should be done on the basis of true 
need.  Every intervention has an opportunity cost.  The cost, as 
I mentioned in my speech, is money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are to intervene, will that intervention benefit the 
Canadian public or cost us more than the actual intervention?  We 
do not disagree with equalization, but we disagree that 
equalization must be done on the basis of true need.  We cannot 
do it under some complex formula which nobody understands. 
Rather, the intervention has to take place on the basis of the 
need of the people, not on the basis of the fact that we want to 
somehow equalize all the provinces.  That is very destructive and 
in fact counteractive in the long term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to ensure that whatever moneys will be spent by the 
federal government will help individuals in need and, more 
important, will help them help themselves.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order 
concerning an amendment that was offered to the House earlier 
this day by the hon. member for Kings—Hants which asked that we 
refer Bill C-65 back to a committee of the whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I respectfully submit to the Chair that this is impossible. Bill 
C-65 was considered by the Standing Committee on Finance and not 
by a committee of the whole.  While the authorities make it clear 
that if otherwise in order an amendment may be offered at third 
reading that would recommit the bill, there is no possibility 
indicated of proposing an amendment to commit a bill to a 
committee that never considered the bill in the first place.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such is the result of the motion offered to us today. In other 
words, a bill cannot be recommitted to a committee that never 
considered the proposition at all. That is what the amendment 
offered to the House earlier this day purports to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I verified earlier this day whether I could rise on a point of 
order now notwithstanding the fact that the Chair had received 
the motion. I have been informed that it is in order to bring it 
nonetheless because we have not yet arrived at the stage where 
the motion is actually put.  That will occur only at the end of 
the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to draw attention to citations 731 and 737 of 
Beauchesne's to support my argument.  Section 731 refers to 
amendment on third reading: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When an order of the day for the third reading of a bill is 
called, the same type of amendments which are permissible at the 
second reading stage are permissible at the third reading stage 
with the restriction that they cannot deal with any matter which 
is not contained in the bill. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, we cannot introduce a new proposition. Citation 
737 of Beauchesne's says in part: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any member may move to recommit a bill for one of the following 
purposes: 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(a) to enable a new clause to be added to the bill when the 
House, on report, has passed the stage at which new clauses are 
taken. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, we have passed report stage and at third reading 
the purpose would be to try to get that back in. 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b) to enable the committee to reconsider amendments they had 
previously made. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee had not previously dealt with any amendments so 
this is not applicable in terms of reconsideration. In any case, 
all this applies only to a motion that is recommitted to the 
original committee that had received the original proposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My point is what occurred today does not satisfy that threshold 
and therefore the amendment, I contend, is out of order. 
<P><A NAME="LINK218"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in response to the arguments put forward by 
the learned government House leader and to respond most directly 
to his arguments.  I suggest the words “recommit” in this 
instance and “referred back” can be construed much the same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More important, I think the intent of the word here is to refer 
back or recommit to a stage of the proceedings as opposed to the 
inference that it is a reference back to the actual committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any event, we are suggesting that the original ruling is in 
order, a ruling made by Mr. Speaker.  You are essentially being 
asked by the government House leader to sit in judgment of 
yourself or to overrule yourself. We all know that you are very 
able and no one is questioning your ability.  You are being asked 
to be a court of appeal for your own ruling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The more important instance here is that this 
intent is to go back to a stage as opposed to sending it back to 
the finance committee. The intention here is that it is to go back 
to committee of the whole.  The reference in 
Beauchesne's 737(1) is: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A bill may be recommitted to a committee of the whole or to a 
committee by a member moving an amendment to the third reading 
motion. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest this is very much in order and that Mr. Speaker's 
original ruling was the correct one.  Therefore I want to also 
indicate this is not a dilatory motion.  It is not the intent of 
the mover of the motion or the party of the mover of the motion 
that this be dilatory or that this hold up the bill. That is not 
our intent. We want the provinces to get their money.

mix.  This would be voted on at the same time as the main motion.

occasion when this was before the House.  I encourage you to

vote of support.  I assure him also that this will not be the 
first or the last time I will be reconsidering something I may 
have done or said.  I am used to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was given prior knowledge that this point of order was to be

here with the possible exception of the government House leader 
and the hon. member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have consulted with the Clerk and I want to make it clear that 
the Chair did not rule on the amendment this morning.  The 
amendment was accepted but I did not rule on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government House leader has very correctly pointed out that 
the interpretation of Beauchesne's is that it would go back to

<A NAME="LINK227">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-65, an 
act to amend the Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements Act, be 
read the third time and passed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK228"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a 
privilege to participate in the debate on Bill C-65 regarding 
equalization.  This is the essence of what makes Canada Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier today on this main motion the House heard from the NDP 
finance critic, the hon. member for Kamloops, Thompson and 
Highland Valleys.  He is a very hardworking MP who had requested, 
in preparation for this debate, to hear from provinces as to 
their views and comments on the new equalization formula. I do 
not believe that in his remarks this morning the hon. member had 
time to refer to that except in passing. I would like to speak 
about how Saskatchewan sees this proposed reform on equalization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The formula is that a maximum of $5,431 per resident to fund 
public service is the essence of the equalization formula.  From 
Saskatchewan's perspective, the net effect will not be terribly 
significant.  Saskatchewan wins in some areas and loses in others 
or, as an acquaintance from Australia once said, what they win on 
the merry-go-round they lose on the ferris wheel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, on the whole the revision is seen to be positive.  For 
example, for the year 1999-2000 the province of Saskatchewan's 
entitlement may increase by about $3 million.  This of course 
depends on the range of economic variables, particularly the 
price of oil futures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just as an aside, the World Bank outlook for commodity prices is 
not very encouraging for the next decade or so, and Saskatchewan 
is a resource based province that depends largely on the export 
of primary resources as are a number of other provinces. This 
impacts very significantly on whether Saskatchewan is a recipient 
province or indeed a have province.  It has been in both 
categories from time to time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Natural Resources had suggested that 
Saskatchewan would be receiving a significant upturn in 
equalization and offset the 40% share of the province's entry 
into the agriculture income disaster assistance program.  This is 
simply not true.  I have mentioned $3 million for 1999-2000.  The 
maximum calculation by the province's minister of finance would 
be $45 million over five years as a result of this new formula. 
It would barely cover the proposed cost for Saskatchewan for the 
agriculture income disaster assistance program for one year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a second aside, I want to again be on the record to talk 
about the basic unfairness in the AIDA program.  Provinces are 
being asked, requested, forced to pay up to 40% for this income 
assistance when at the same time states such as North and South 
Dakota, Minnesota and Montana are not asked to pay any sort of 
money to help farmers on that side of the 49th parallel because 
their contributions are being paid by the national government in 
the United States. Here the provinces are requested to kick in 
40%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is simply not fair to expect a small province like 
Saskatchewan, or Manitoba for that matter, both of which have 
high proportion percentage of the arable land base and a 
relatively small percentage of the population, to fund that kind 
of program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the equalization program itself, as I have indicated, 
Saskatchewan is in favour and is also in favour of moving to a 
ten province standard rather than the current five province 
standard. We believe this would advance the goal of providing 
quality programs at reasonable costs.  We also favour a shorter 
transition period of probably two years rather than the current 
five years.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important for all of us to keep in mind that equalization 
is to maintain a relatively level playing field in terms of 
ability to provide programs and services. Generally speaking the 
payments go up to an individual province when its revenues are 
experiencing a decline. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have indicated, Saskatchewan has a particular interest in 
the work done on resource bases and takes the position that 
recognition of the higher cost of producing so-called new oil 
would represent an improvement. It is important for Saskatchewan 
and it is also important for provinces such as Nova Scotia and 
Newfoundland.  A move away from the volume of production to the 
value on for example forestry would not represent a step backward 
in any way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Overall the objective of equalization is not to get every last 
cent out of each of the have provinces.  As I have said before, 
it is to ensure that all provinces offer a reasonably comparable 
level of services at roughly comparable levels of taxation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The program has to be equitable and fair in order to function 
effectively which means it has to work both ways.  Saskatchewan's 
position is that a change to a value based measurement on 
forestry does represent an overall improvement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one thing in particular that some provinces such as 
Manitoba and Saskatchewan are opposed to. That is the changes to 
the equalization formula for the lottery base.  The proposed 
changes would unilaterally impact on provincial policy decisions. 
To expand on that, I would use this argument.  The choice not to 
introduce VLTs, which will have a large impact on entitlements, 
is a policy decision which therefore should not impact on the 
determination of fiscal capacity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government I believe has taken a different approach to this. 
It has included the new gaming as another new tax base. The 
argument is that this approach will increase Ontario's fiscal 
capacity and therefore benefit equalization payments to recipient 
provinces.  A discussion at the finance committee did focus on 
the fact that Manitoba's population is one of the lowest 
participants in lotteries and gaming and how this particular low 
revenue source may be a factor in lower equalization payments for 
Manitoba. We would question the inclusion of VLTs in the new 
formula. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, overall and in conclusion, the NDP caucus members 
present support Bill C-65 on third reading.  It is a step in the 
right direction, but the important thing is to recognize and 
realize that it is certainly no windfall for the seven recipient 
provinces. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> It is my duty, pursuant to 
Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the questions to be 
raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows: the 
hon. member for Cypress Hills—Grasslands, Rural Municipalities; 
the hon. member for Winnipeg North Centre, Tobacco. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK229"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills—Grasslands, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I would like to hear the comments of the hon. member for 
Palliser on a couple of things that I picked up on in his speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One is the question of the formula. He mentioned several times 
things that he found good or bad in the formula. I would like to 
get his party's take on something that has certainly been running 
through my mind for a long time.  That is, it would be very 
expeditious to simply base the equalization payments on the per 
capita GDP in each province and not get involved in any way in 
all this convoluted arithmetic. If we know where the GDP of a 
province is low and where the GDP of a province is high, we 
shuffle money from the haves to the have nots.  We do not have to 
go through all this.  It is becoming something like the Income 
Tax Act, totally unintelligible. I would like the hon. member's 
view on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My other question is perhaps a little more difficult because it 
presumes that the formula is the be all and the end all. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1650"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT81"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know what effect that specific land claim 
settlements will have on the equalization formula with the 
infusion of federal money to buy the land and the gross 
distortion of the municipal tax base by the creation of these new 
reserves.  Will this, through the formula, create discrepancies 
or inequalities that we may not be aware of? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank the member for 
Cypress Hills—Grasslands for his two questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to why we do not level the formula out and do it on 
the per capita gross domestic product, I would probably be the 
last person in the House one would want specific advice from on 
creating a formula. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have listened to a lot of the debate today on the formula and 
it seems to me that it is not terribly relevant.  A formula is 
calculated.  When it was first started in the 1950s equalization 
was based on three variables and now we are up to 33. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been involved with fund raising and revenue sharing and 
sometimes we get into very complex formulas.  It is like getting 
behind the wheel of a car.  I do not necessarily have to know 
everything about how the motor functions but I know where the key 
goes, and where the gas pedal and the brake are.  What is 
important is that we have a formula that is overall fair to all 
of the provinces, both those that are recipients of financial 
largesse and those that are paying.  Perhaps the government would 
be in a better position to answer specific questions on what the 
formula should look be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the same with the land claims settlement.  I cannot 
comment on what impact those settlements will have on 
equalization payments in the future. 
<P><A NAME="LINK230"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour (Beauséjour—Petitcodiac, NDP):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I have a question for my colleague about reserves and 
land claims. Would he agree that if the first nations had not 
settled and given us their land, that really we would not have 
the land? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor:</B>  Madam Speaker, very clearly that is the 
case.  It is important when we are discussing land claims 
settlements that we recognize that.  European and American 
settlers who came to what is now Canada, and my ancestors fall 
into the latter category having come from Virginia during the war 
of independence, did not treat our native peoples well.  They 
were pushed off the land or into poor patches of land.  Now it is 
time to redress those historic endemic problems and I think we 
are trying to do that the very best way we can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with my colleague from Beauséjour—Petitcodiac that this 
is something this parliament and indeed provincial and 
territorial legislatures will have to deal with, with dispatch 
and with a great deal of sensitivity today and tomorrow. 
<P><A NAME="LINK231"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Matthews (Burin—St. George's, PC):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I want to make a few general comments on Bill C-65, an 
act to amend the Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must say at the outset that I have listened very intently to 
the hon. members for Broadview—Greenwood, Esquimalt—Juan de 
Fuca, and Palliser.  I found their remarks on this topic to be 
most responsible and very interesting. 
After listening to those three hon. members speak, I wonder why 
we do not find solutions more readily in this House of Commons 
and why the government of the day does not listen more to what 
hon. members say about taxation issues and the other issues 
facing our country.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come from the province of Newfoundland and Labrador.  I have 
listened with great interest to a number of speakers today. They 
have talked about equalization, the fairness and the unfairness 
of equalization.  Newfoundland and Labrador has a great desire to 
be a have province.  I remind some of my friends from the west 
that all of the western provinces were not always have provinces. 
So the wheel turns and the wheel turns slowly.  Some day, please 
God, Newfoundland and Labrador will be a have province and 
Atlantic Canada will be a have region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have great resources.  We have a great natural resource base, 
as great as any in the country.  The province I come from has oil 
and gas resources.  We have a growing oil and gas industry.  We 
have forestry resources.  We have one of the richest mineral 
discoveries in the world at Voisey's Bay which we hope will be 
developed someday for the benefit of all of Canada but more so 
for the benefit of Newfoundland and Labrador. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The greatest resource we brought into Confederation when we 
joined in 1949 was our fishery resource.  About 20 years ago the 
export value of fish products from Newfoundland and Labrador was 
about $3 billion.  Imagine what that value would be today in 1999 
dollars.  Of course we are sad to say that successive governments 
of Canada mismanaged our most important resource.  Our groundfish 
stocks have been practically eliminated and our people have paid 
a great price. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can be a have province.  It will take very good management 
decisions on our fishery from now on in to bring that back.  We 
are going to need good decisions on our oil and gas, on our 
minerals and forestry and so on.  We are struggling to become a 
have province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have listened intently to what people have had to say here 
today.  I have listened intently to the equalization debate over 
the last number of years.  What strikes me most about the 
equalization debate is that yes, we have resources that we are 
developing in Newfoundland and Labrador but unless we change the 
equalization formula accordingly, we will always be a have not 
province.  If the federal government is going to knock us back 
dollar for dollar, for every dollar we get from Voisey's Bay when 
it is developed, or from our Terra Nova oil field when it is 
developed, then we are never going to be a have province. These 
are the concerns of the people of the province I represent.  They 
are my concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unless there is going to be a significant and substantial 
change, we are never going to get to the level of other affluent 
provinces, such as the provinces of our western friends.  We have 
to keep this in mind when we come to this great chamber and 
debate what should be truly national issues.  It is not a 
regional issue or a provincial issue; equalization is a national 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened to the three speakers before me.  They talked about 
this great country of Canada, about how caring we are in this 
country.  Yes we are, or some of us say that we are.  Sometimes 
that takes a lot of tolerance, understanding and patience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to all hon. members that the best thing we could do in 
this chamber, the 301 of us who are here, is to go to the other 
provinces, the other regions of this country, meet the people and 
understand their problems and their issues.  Then we would all be 
better versed to stand in this place and make constructive 
suggestions about equalization, about tax regimes and about every 
other issue that affects us as Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find too often in this chamber that people bring their own 
provincial or regional perspectives and biases to the debate. 
Most times it is not out of general concern for all of Canada and 
all Canadians.  Those were the few general remarks I wanted to 
make. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1700"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT83"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to say that have I found the debate to be very 
professional today.  There was some great debate between 
government and opposition members.  However, I want to go on 
record as saying that if we are truly Canadian, and if we come 
here to espouse a truly Canadian perspective, then let us try to 
better understand the needs of all Canadians because there are 
regional differences and regional disparities that still exist 
big time in the various provinces of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest to my friends from the west that they go to the east 
to gain an understanding of those problems.  I suggest that they 
not bring western Canadian remedies to the House of Commons which 
they think are in the best interests of eastern Canada.  On the 
other hand, we should not come here thinking that we know what is 
best for the west when we do not.  I say that with all due 
respect.  Too many times in the last 18 months or so I have heard 
too many western Canadian solutions for eastern Canada when the 
people who are proposing them do not truly understand eastern 
Canada.  They do not understand its people, its solutions or its 
issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be tolerant, let us be considerate and let us be ever 
mindful that all of the provinces which are now affluent, well 
off and have provinces were not always have provinces.  Provinces 
today which are have not provinces could very well in 10, 15 or 
20 years be have provinces, and those which are have now could 
very easily become have not.  Let us not forget that can happen 
in this great country.  Hopefully we will all be caring 
Canadians, we will be caring parliamentarians and we will do what 
is in the best interests of all Canadians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK232"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it is rather sad that the individual who just spoke 
would talk about the west like that.  We are all in this 
federation together.  I think he is somewhat missing the point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people in the west wonder why there are people from 
Atlantic Canada, Quebec and Ontario going to the west on a 
western alienation committee to determine and tell them how they 
should feel.  There is too much of that in this country, blaming 
one or blaming the other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People who stand in the House to talk about the equalization 
index or any other issue should have the right to do so.  They 
are not just here to talk about their own individual 
constituency, they are members of parliament who are here to talk 
about the federation as a whole.  I think the member should 
respect that.  It is unfortunate that he does not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the hon. member whether he thinks the equalization index 
in total is reasonable when we have three provinces trying to 
equalize for the other seven.  How is that ultimately going to 
work given that, for instance, Nova Scotia, with its gas and oil, 
is coming around to an economic boon?  I suspect that 
Newfoundland is coming around in terms of Voisey's Bay, possible 
oil production, mining and those kinds of things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it not reasonable to expect that this equalization index 
would have to change one of these days and that it should not 
have been brought into the House by this government which had 
five years to bring the issue here and is now in a damn big rush 
to have it dealt with in the last few days before it needs it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Matthews:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his comments and his question.  However, I do not think that 
I need a lecture from the hon. member on respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not saying that I oppose changes to the equalization 
formula.  I am not saying that at all.  Yes, he is right about 
Nova Scotia.  Yes, he is right about Newfoundland and Labrador.

<A HREF="#LINKT84"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My point is simply this.  If the government continues to take 
back, dollar for dollar, any royalties that we get from oil and 
gas, or from Voisey's Bay, if we ever get to develop it, we will 
not become a have province.  Voisey's Bay is still in the ground. 
The company paid something like $4.2 billion for control of the 
resource, and there is much more than that there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My point is that there had to be changes.  If we are ever going 
to become a have province, then we are going to have to be able 
to keep some of the royalties that we get from those resources 
and not be penalized by the federal government clawing them back. 
That is my point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not against changing it.  I know what the hon. member is 
saying about three provinces and seven provinces.  We want to be 
a have province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I said was out of no disrespect for the west.  What I said 
was that too often in this Chamber members stand in their place 
who are a little too parochial but think that they understand the 
problems of other regions and have solutions for other regions 
when they do not understand the people and they have never been 
there.  How can someone understand the people, their issues and 
concerns if they do not go to where those people are to gain an 
understanding of their problems? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps members could criticize me for not having a great enough 
understanding of the west.  I could probably be fairly criticized 
for that.  However, I am suggesting that if members of parliament 
are going to recommend solutions for people from other parts of 
the country we have to understand the people and the problems 
before bringing solutions that just do not cut it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK233"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Power (St. John's West, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I must commend the member, for whom I have the highest regard, 
for his comments about equalization.  All of us in Newfoundland 
are very concerned that these equalization changes could make our 
lives much more difficult rather than easier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ask the hon. member if he could clarify a point for 
us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometimes the laws that we make in this House of Commons are 
what can make a have or a have not province.  For those members 
from western Canada or Ontario who do not fully understand, 
Newfoundland has become a have not province because of an act of 
this House of Commons of 1967 which forced the province of 
Newfoundland to make a deal only with Hydro Quebec and with 
nobody else.  The Upper Churchill agreement has cost the province 
of Newfoundland as much as $700 million per year, every year, 
during the seventies, eighties and nineties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Ask Joey Smallwood.  He signed it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Power:</B>  Joey Smallwood and the Government of 
Canada.  This House of Commons forced the people of Newfoundland 
into an agreement which was unjust and unfair and we have never 
been able to change it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to remind the member that the same thing almost happened 
in western Canada when the national energy program was in place. 
It almost impoverished the province of Alberta.  It could have 
made it a have not province had it stayed in place much longer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ask the hon. member if there is going to be some time 
in history when we could have a moratorium on paying back all of 
the royalties that we receive in Newfoundland from resource 
projects until such time as Newfoundland is a have province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Matthews:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his question.  For those of us who were involved in bringing 
the Hibernia project to fruition in Newfoundland and Labrador, we 
know at that time that there was a similar debate which took 
place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member and I were members of a provincial government at 
the time and we negotiated an agreement whereby we got to keep a 
percentage of royalties from Hibernia.  If memory serves me 
correctly, we got to keep about 30%.  That has helped us a bit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now we are into the development of Terra Nova and other 
oil fields.  White Rose and so on will come onstream before too 
much longer.  We are going to be a significant player in offshore 
oil and gas in Newfoundland and Labrador.  Hopefully we will have 
significant mineral developments and mining and the smelting of 
various ores. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the point is that we should be afforded an opportunity 
to develop our natural resources and keep enough of our royalties 
so that over a period of time we will become a have province. 
That is my point.  I think that is basically what the hon. member 
is asking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, the federal government should give serious consideration to 
a formula that would allow us to keep at least a portion of 
revenues from Hibernia, Terra Nova, White Rose and Voisey's Bay 
without knocking us back, dollar for dollar, off the equalization 
formula. 
<P><A NAME="LINK234"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
am a little confused about some of the comments the member is 
making.  The proposal is that as the resources of Atlantic Canada 
are developed, in order to become a have province they should not 
only keep the royalties from those resource projects but also the 
transfer payments as a have not province. 
As an Albertan I would like to know if that thinking would also 
apply to Alberta, that we could keep the royalties from our 
natural resources and also receive transfer payments.

for his question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unless things change, we will always be a have not province.  If 
we give someone $10 and take back $10, they are no better off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Chatters:</B>  How did Alberta become a have 
province? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Matthews:</B>  Alberta was not always a have 
province.  We are going to be a have province, but we need some 
considerations from the Government of Canada to get there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would love to be a have province.  We wish we did not have to 
come to the Government of Canada looking for five cents.  That is 
our wish, but we are going to need some help and some 
consideration gradually until we get there.  That is what we are 
asking for.  Give us a sliding scale so that it is taken back 
over time, but at least let us get to that point where we are 
considered to be a have province and then we will not need as 
much equalization from the Government of Canada or from other 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what we aim to do, but we are going to need some help to 
get there.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased today to speak to Bill C-65. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When future generations look back at today's <I>Hansard</I> they 
are going to see that the member for Broadview—Greenwood gave a 
speech in this House and was subsequently followed by the member 
for Selkirk—Interlake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Selkirk—Interlake sent me to Ottawa to represent 
them, to stand up for them and to put their points of view across 
to the government in a way that it would understand.  Some 
constituents suggested that I take a length of two-by-four or a 
fence post.  I have to say that I declined, but today, after 
hearing the member for Broadview—Greenwood, I wonder if I should 
have followed their advice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That member constantly referred to the west as that remote 
region, the region out west.  The member for Broadview—Greenwood 
is the epitome of that thinker who says that the centre of the 
universe is Toronto, the centre of the universe is the Liberal 
attitude, the arrogant Liberals, the “we will tell you in the 
remote regions what is good for you” Liberals, the 
interventionist Liberals.  That was his favourite, the 
interventionist Liberals.  I would simply say that the people of 
Selkirk—Interlake believe that Toronto and the member's riding 
of Broadview—Greenwood are in fact remote regions to them and we 
resent being referred to as a remote region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was speaking about the interventionist government being the 
kind of government that we need, and big intervention, not small. 
I would suggest to the member that he look at the 
interventionist activity that could have been taken in relation 
to our native people and the poverty and the homelessness that he 
was talking about.  In that case the government has all the 
authority and the right to act on behalf of those poor people and 
has not done so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that he use his interventionist activities and 
abilities to move now, not sometime in the future when they get 
bigger government and more power.  Do it now, with the power the 
Liberals have today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now speak more directly to Bill C-65.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has taken a bit of my time but the record is important for 
future generations.  I will also be sharing my time with the 
member for Dewdney—Alouette who also has some important things 
to say about Bill C-65. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The interventionist member took some time pointing out Reform's 
position, my party's position, yet he strayed from the facts. 
The purpose of equalization is to promote equal opportunities for 
the well-being of Canadians, to further economic development, to 
reduce disparity in opportunities and provide essential public 
services of reasonable quality to all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to quote the Leader of the Official Opposition who 
stated “The official opposition, the Reform Party, is committed 
to equalization and has been from the outset.  I believe that the 
rank and file people in provinces like British Columbia, Alberta 
and Ontario who receive no equalization payments and in fact are 
net contributors to the federal-provincial transfers also support 
the principle of equalization.  They have objections as to how 
the federal government administers it and how the federal 
government handles transfers but do not object to the principle 
itself”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That should put to rest the statements the member for 
Broadview—Greenwood made.  He distorted precisely what the 
position is of the Reform Party and the Leader of the Official 
Opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to talk about some points in Bill C-65.  It is 
certainly a big subject that cannot be handled in one short 
speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things that has caused me some concern is the concept 
of gambling revenues.  It is my understanding that the changes 
will see for the first time provincial casino revenues included 
in the formula for the calculation of equalization payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Myself and many people in my riding are very much against the 
video lotteries and the extensive gambling that is going on in 
Canada today.  Without trying to say that no one should gamble, 
which is not the question, the question is how much reliance 
should provincial and federal governments be putting on gambling 
revenues as a major source of their incomes? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once governments start to figure things in and say they are part 
of the income, if there is any danger of that drying up, the 
first thing they have to do is take action to get people to 
gamble in order to keep that source of revenue coming in.  If 
governments need more money, they have to encourage more people 
to gamble.  Gambling in itself is not wrong. The problem is that 
many people cannot control their gambling instincts.  Having a 
public government, the representative of the people, encouraging 
gambling is not right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Gambling revenues are going to be included in the equalization 
formula to determine payments.  That is a big mistake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As to what the formula is going to do over the next few years 
with regard to the individual provinces, I note that my province 
of Manitoba will lose about $37 million by the end of the five 
year term.  The figures could certainly go higher, to as much as 
$50 million as some members have stated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Premier Gary Filmon has taken a very good economic road and has 
had economic policies for the benefit of the province of Manitoba 
over the past 10 years.  He spoke out on equalization when this 
formula was proposed.  He clearly stated that the objective of 
Manitoba is to become at least zero or a have province. 
We are taking economic activity and initiatives that will get us 
to that point.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime, as has been pointed out by the Reform Party, 
the formula which is in place and which is being developed in 
part of this bill is so convoluted and unfair that it is not 
really transparent or obvious to Canadians how it works. It is 
subject to political influence and interference.  I do not think 
our country should be run in a way which tries to equalize things 
and make them fair for everyone but in fact, the very formula 
that is being used permits the government to be either unfair to 
a province or excessively fair to a province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A particular example is the province of Newfoundland.  Just 
before the provincial election it was in a deficit position.  It 
happened, I suppose by accident, that it was a Liberal who was 
trying to become the premier of the province again. Lo and 
behold, after refiguring the formula and recalculating how it 
works, Newfoundland's payments went higher and the would-be 
premier of the province went into the election saying that he had 
a balanced budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is one example of what is wrong with this formula. 
Newfoundland no doubt deserves that money and needs that money 
because it has fallen on hard times in years past. But in 
treating provinces fairly, it should not be left to the 
government of the day to make individual decisions based purely 
on politics on how to be fair to Canadians and to the poor people 
of this country. 
<P><A NAME="LINK236"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, these are 
questions and comments and mine will probably be a comment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member is our critic for agriculture. Even those of us 
who are on the finance committee whose job it is to study this 
bill and the equalization plan have great difficulty 
understanding the formula and how it is evaluated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to comment on the issue of lotteries. The member is 
looking at the bottom line.  According to the bottom line of this 
bill, when it is passed it is projected—and we got these numbers 
from the finance department officials—that the equalization 
payments for Manitoba will go down $37 million. That is the 
number the member quoted quite correctly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it should be pointed out that because of the lottery 
component, if the member would look at the sheets, which 
obviously he has not had an opportunity to examine, in the 
breakdown per tax component, Manitoba loses about $50 million 
because of the gaming component.  It is in the tables. This means 
that instead of going down $30 million, $50 million is due to 
lotteries.  Instead of going down, Manitoba would have had an 
increase.  Manitoba went from an increase situation to a decrease 
because of the lotteries.  The total lottery impact is some $50 
million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My other comment has to do with respect to the formula and 
evaluation.  How does one compute the potential of a province to 
gain lottery revenue?  That is how the equalization formula 
works.  It would be very subversive if actual income was used. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Conservative member from the east has explained, when a 
government gets new revenue, it does not like to have that taxed 
because there is 100% clawback.  The same thing is true here. How 
would it be evaluated? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to give one of my other colleagues a little more 
time so I will very gently shut down and add that as a comment. 
It really does not require a response from the member.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom:</B>  Madam Speaker, certainly I have said 
quite clearly that I am not in favour of lotteries being included 
in the formula because of the incentive it gives to governments 
to try to raise those revenues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also have a question with regard to casinos that are going to 
be on our aboriginal reserves.  How does this work into the 
formula? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part of the problem is that it gets so complex and convoluted 
that it is difficult to work with.  It may be okay for government 
actuaries and accountants, but the problem is that the average 
Canadian has to understand how this works because it is his or 
her money that is being thrown around by governments. That is why 
I would like to see a much simpler formula.  I thank the member 
for his question. 
<P><A NAME="LINK237"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney—Alouette, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I that know time is brief so I will try to make my 
points very quickly here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a pleasure to enter into this debate for a number of 
reasons, the first one being that this whole area of equalization 
is an important area, something that we support.  We do not 
support the way the government has gone ahead with this bill and 
the way it has introduced it.  The government has had five years, 
imagine, to deal with this issue and in three days it has brought 
it forward without consultation.  It is another example of the 
top down arrogant style of governance we have seen from the 
Liberal Party of Canada over and over and over again. It is 
reflected again here with the introduction of this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It reminds me a little bit of a comic strip we are all well 
aware of. In the Charlie Brown comic strip there is a character 
named Lucy.  She would pull the football away from Charlie Brown 
every time he tried to kick it. Charlie Brown kept coming back to 
try to take another kick at the ball and every time Lucy would 
pull that ball away and Charlie Brown would lie flat on his back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the way the Liberal government approaches legislation. 
In fact it is the way the Liberals approach governance in this 
country.  We could substitute whomever we would like to for 
Charlie Brown, whether it be the hardworking Canadian taxpayers 
who fork over dollar after dollar after dollar to the government, 
or in this case the provinces which are treated in that same way. 
They come back in good faith, yet the government continues to 
pull the ball away from them, to take away the goodwill they 
bring to the table over and over and over again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the way this Liberal government deals with Canadians and 
with the provinces.  And the Liberals wonder why they need to 
send out a task force to western Canada to find out what the 
problem is, why they have only a few members of parliament when 
there is approximately 100 seats in the west.  Perhaps the 
Liberals will be sending a task force to other regions of the 
country as well to figure out why people are not voting for them. 
It is very simple.  Canadians are not voting for the Liberals in 
those parts of the country because the Liberals are not 
listening.  They do not get it.  They do not understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those comments were made clear by a member of the government, 
the member for Broadview—Greenwood just a few short minutes ago 
when he said he was an interventionist.  “Do not worry, people 
of Canada.  The federal government will solve your problems. 
Send us your bucks and we will take care of you”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That simply is not working.  It is not the truth and it is not 
the reality of the situation.  And the Liberals wonder why they 
have to send a task force out to western Canada and other parts 
of the country to find out why people do not support them.  They 
just do not get it.  They do not understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Broadview—Greenwood mentioned that he cannot 
understand why people in western Canada are upset with a 
government that says it has basically taken care of them.  “We 
have put all this money into this program and that program.  Why 
do you not support us?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People of western Canada and other regions of the country do not 
support the government because it does not listen.  Government 
members think they have the answers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  What does this have to do with his 
riding? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally:</B>  Madam Speaker, I hear the member from 
Coquitlam harping up once again. It is nice to see that he is 
here for a change.  It would be nice to see him enter into this 
debate in a reasonable manner rather than just shouting across 
the way as he usually does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the government's way of dealing with Canadians and the 
different regions of Canada.  The Liberal members simply think 
they have all the answers. 
Thirty years of governance from the sixties onward have shown 
that the government does not have the answers, that it does not 
have the solutions.  The programs it has put in place do not 
solve all the problems.  The government cannot see that and that 
is a shame. That is exactly the approach it has taken with Bill 
C-65.  Once again it has shown its arrogant way of dealing with 
Canadians.  It is a shame.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government could have taken a different approach.  It could 
have taken a consultative approach where it talks with 
individuals and mentions equalization in a formula that would 
actually work.  To think that we have seven have not provinces, 
in this government's own terms, is a shame.  It is 
incomprehensible how that can happen in a country as rich as 
this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is this government's approach to governing. It is 
disrespect for Canadians that has led to this kind of legislation 
and this style of governing and it has to come to an end.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin—Swan River, Ref.)</B> moved that Bill 
C-312, an act to amend the Income Tax Act (percentage of gifts 
that may be deducted from tax), be read the second time and 
referred to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to have the 
opportunity to debate my private member's Bill C-312.  Let me 
thank my colleague from Delta—South Richmond for seconding the 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-312 would amend the Income Tax Act with respect to the 
percentage of gifts that may be deducted from tax.  I will read a 
brief overview of exactly what this private member's bill is all 
about: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of this enactment is to increase the deductibility of 
charitable gifts up to $1,150 a year to be no less than for 
political contributions.  It applies to gifts, up to that amount, 
the same formula for calculating the deduction that is used for 
political contributions to registered parties and candidates. 
The deduction for gifts above that amount remains unchanged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The enactment actually covers Crown gifts and cultural gifts as 
well because they are added to charitable gifts to calculate the 
deduction under the act and the expression “total gifts” means 
total charitable gifts up to 50% of income plus total Crown gifts 
plus total cultural gifts. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rationale for this private member's bill is really about 
levelling the playing field.  As members know we are all proud to 
be Canadians and we believe that Canadians should be treated 
equally.  That is one of the pillars of our democracy. 
Politicians should not have any advantage over regular citizens 
who work hard and pay a lot of taxes.  In fact 46 cents out of 
every dollar is paid out in tax in one form or another.  For that 
purpose it is even more important for citizens to get the same 
breaks as politicians.

<A HREF="#LINKT93"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is really about equality for Canadians.  It is about 
being treated in this country on an equal footing.  Regardless of 
what politicians believe, which is that they should have an added 
advantage certainly during election times when raising funds, I 
believe that politicians should not have an advantage over other 
citizens who would like to contribute to the charity of their 
choice.  Therefore, this bill would level the playing field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In essence, Bill C-312 is about taking away political advantage 
for political donations.  Politicians I believe and most people 
in this country believe should be treated no differently from the 
average Canadian.  Not all donations should have the same weight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill unfortunately is not votable.  Obviously it was 
politicians who decided that it should not be made votable.  In 
fact when I presented myself before the committee there was an 
instance when members of the committee thought I was mixing 
apples and oranges.  I really do not think we are mixing apples 
and oranges.  I believe that Canadians need to be treated in an 
equal fashion.  Politicians are Canadians and so are the citizens 
of this country, so it is really not about apples and oranges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I would like to do at this time is run through the bill so 
that the people who are watching will know what it is about.  As 
I first indicated, Bill C-312 would amend the Income Tax Act with 
respect to the percentage of gifts that may be deducted from tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Subsection 118.1(3) of the Income Tax Act would be replaced by 
the following: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(3) For the purpose of computing the tax payable under this Part 
by an individual for a taxation year, there may be deducted such 
amount as the individual claims, not exceeding 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(a) 75% of the lesser of $100 and the individual's total gifts 
for the year if the total does not exceed $100, plus 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b) 50% of the amount by which the individual's total gifts for 
the year exceed $100 and do not exceed $550, plus 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(c) 33 1/3% of the amount by which the individual's total gifts 
for the year exceed $550 and do not exceed $1,150, plus 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(d) the highest percentage referred to in subsection 117(2) that 
applies in determining tax that might be payable under this Part 
for the year multiplied by the amount by which the individual's 
total gifts for the year exceed $1,150. 
</UL></UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(2) Subsection (1) applies to the 1998 and subsequent taxation 
years. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposals necessary to change the calculation for the 
charitable donation credits for income tax would take place in 
such a manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Income Tax Act would have to be amended, as I indicated 
earlier, in order to make the calculation of the tax credit for 
the first $1,150 of charitable donations in order to make the 
treatment equivalent to or better than the tax credit for 
political contributions of $1,150. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to political contributions, the taxpayer may at 
present deduct from income tax otherwise payable under Part I of 
the Income Tax Act an amount in respect of contributions made in 
the year to a registered party or an officially nominated 
candidate in a federal election or byelection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to subsection 127(4) of the act, the above terms have 
a meaning assigned to them in the Canada Elections Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pursuant to subsection 127(3), the political contribution 
deduction is calculated as a percentage of the actual 
contribution made by the taxpayer in the year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The taxpayer may deduct (a) 75% of the first $100 contributed; 
(b) 50% of the next $450 contributed; and (c) 33 1/3% of the next 
$600 contributed. 
The maximum deduction is therefore $500 and is available where 
the taxpayer has contributed $1,150.  Where the contribution in a 
year exceeds $1,150 no amount is deductible in respect of this 
excess and the taxpayer may not carry such an excess over and 
take a deduction in another year.

<A HREF="#LINKT94"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the deduction is from part I, tax otherwise payable, it 
is in the nature of a tax credit.  Where the taxpayer is not 
otherwise required to pay income tax for the year in an amount at 
least equal to this credit the benefits of the credit are lost. 
The taxpayer cannot receive this credit as a tax refund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 118.1 provides for a non-refundable tax credit to 
individuals in respect of certain gifts made by them which 
qualify as charitable gifts, crown gifts, cultural gifts or 
ecological gifts.  This credit is applicable against income tax 
otherwise payable under part I of the Income Tax Act and is 
determined in accordance with the formula described in section 
118.1(3). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The formula is based on the individual's total gifts for the 
taxation year, meaning the total of the lesser of the 
individual's total charitable gifts for the year and generally 
50% of the individual's income for the year in 1996 and later 
years up from 20% in 1992 to 1995; the individual's total crown 
gifts for the year; the individual's total cultural gifts for the 
year; and the individual's total ecological gifts for the year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The relevant definitions of the above terms are contained in 
section 118.1(1).  According to section 118.1(3) the tax credit 
for an individual in respect of total gifts for a taxation year 
is calculated at two rates, 17% of the first $200 of donations 
plus 29% of the donations over $200. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to change the calculation of the tax credit for the 
first $1,150 of the total charitable gifts to make it equivalent 
to or better than the tax credit for $1,150 in political 
contributions an amendment would be required to section 118.1(3). 
The wording would depend on whether the intention was to change 
the calculation of the tax credit for only total charitable gifts 
or for total gifts since total charitable gifts comprise only a 
portion of the total gifts on which the present calculation of 
the tax credit is based. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Assuming that the calculation of the tax credit for the first 
$1,150 of donations was changed to be the same as the calculation 
for the tax credit for $1,150 in political contributions, a 
determination would also have to be made as to what the 
legislated formulae would be for calculating the tax credit on 
the portion of donations in excess of $1,150. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Turning to the revenue implications of the proposal in Bill 
C-312, the most important change is the increase to 75% credit of 
the first $100 as opposed to the 17% of the first $200 given the 
existing rules and 50% of the next $450.  The average charitable 
donation claim in 1993 was $626 according to Revenue Canada's 
taxation statistics.  Subject to standard rules the federal tax 
credits generated would be $158.  If this representative donation 
had instead been subject to the political contribution credit 
rules, the earned credit would have been $325, a difference of 
$168 multiplied by a hypothetical 5.4 million taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another approach to estimating the revenue implication of the 
proposal is static microsimulation which was done using 
Statistics Canada's social policy simulation model and database. 
Responsibility for the results and the interpretation lies with 
the present author.  This involves rewriting the algorithm of 
calculating the charitable donations tax credit to reflect the 
proposal at hand and using the model to estimate the net impact 
of federal revenues.

<A HREF="#LINKT95"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Assuming that for charitable contributions above $1,150 the 
credit rate would be thirty three and one-third per cent instead 
of the current twenty nine per cent. Matching the political 
contributions credit for amounts below that, the impact on 
federal revenues is estimated to be about $800 million.  The 
simulation approach thus matches quite nicely with estimates 
above employing averages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After $1,150 it will go back to 29%. This is a static exercise, 
which is to say that we assume in doing the calculation that 
individuals do not choose to donate more because of the more 
favourable treatment.  If it is the case, that more favourable 
treatment does not generate any new or incremental revenue for 
charities, all that is changed is the cost of giving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be more realistic to assume that individuals choose to 
donate more, in which case charitable events would increase and 
federal revenues would decrease more than they do in the static 
exercise.  How charitable givings would increase is a matter of 
speculation.  It depends on what estimates one chooses for the 
rate of tax induced giving, which means how much the after tax 
cost of donation influences the amount donated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been a reasonable amount of empirical work on this 
question and the jury is still out.  While taxes do positively 
affect charitable livings, on the margin the magnitude of that 
effect is uncertain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The incremental federal cost of increased giving depends on who 
is doing the giving.  This is because for amounts above $550 the 
credit rate is only changing from twenty nine per cent to thirty 
three and one-third per cent, a relatively small shift.  For 
smaller donors the credit rate is changing from 17% to either 50% 
or 75%, which may have a significant impact on donation rates. 
In other words, we may well find a large number of new donations 
under the $100 level and a large amount of new or increased 
donations in the $100 to $550 range. This would obviously 
influence charitable receipts in a positive way and a federal 
revenue in a negative manner.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
appreciate being able to speak early on the motion tonight.  I 
understand the parliamentary secretary assisted in that and I am 
very much appreciative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion is a very important motion that seeks to address a 
fundamental flaw in the Canadian tax code as we see it currently, 
the discrepancy between the tax treatment of political 
contributions and charitable contributions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a preface to my remarks, it is very important to recognize 
the importance of the role charitable organizations play in 
Canadian society.  That role has increased in recent years in 
part due to both federal and provincial government cutbacks where 
we have been in a period of fiscal restraint. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The non-profit sector, the volunteer sector, has had to play a 
larger role in providing some of the basic services.  For 
instance, in areas of health care organizations like the VON have 
been called on to play a larger role than perhaps they have ever 
had to play in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I argue that not just the intentions of this motion are very 
important but that the government should be trying to engage the 
volunteer sector on almost every area of service delivery to 
ensure that we identify the needs of Canadians more effectively 
and also, through the volunteer sector, to can work more 
effectively in meeting those needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are several facts I would like to provide to the House on 
this issue.  The discrepancies are very clear.  The maximum 
contribution amount eligible for credit with a charity is 50%. 
For political parties the amount eligible for credit is $1,150. 
On charitable or non-profit organization contributions it is 17% 
of the first $200 and 29% on gifts over $200. 
The largest possible tax credit is limited by 50% of the donor's 
actual taxable income.

<A HREF="#LINKT96"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On contributions to political parties it is 75% of the total if 
the total does not exceed $100; $75 plus 50% of the next $450 is 
eligible and the lesser of $300 plus one-third of the amount 
exceeding $550 or $500.  Clearly at some levels of contributions 
there are significant advantages of contributing to a political 
party as opposed to a charity.  My party is not opposed to 
political contributions.  I encourage Canadians who are watching 
tonight to make contributions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue before us tonight is one that specifically addresses 
the discrepancy between contributions to charities and the 
non-profit and volunteer sector and political organizations.  In 
the next century it is argued that in most industrialized 
countries the volunteer sector will play a larger and larger role 
in society.  Governments will be asked to do some things 
extraordinarily well and will be asked to do less in some other 
areas.  If we are to provide that level of responsibility to the 
volunteer sector we have to provide with it some type of 
commensurate improvement in the tax treatment which would enable 
citizens to contribute to those worthy areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not the only area that needs to be addressed in terms of 
our treatment of charitable contributions.  We believe the 
government should remove the remaining capital gains tax on gifts 
of publicly traded securities to registered charitable 
organizations.  Our party has taken a strong position on this. We 
have recommended to the minister that he eliminate this capital 
gains tax on publicly traded shares. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These publicly traded securities have been a very attractive 
option in allowing a philanthropist to transfer some of their 
investment holdings to worthy organizations.  The capital gains 
tax effectively reduces the incentive for these philanthropists 
to contribute to the causes that are very important to them and 
that are very important to Canadians.  The government appeared to 
recognize the principle I am speaking of a year ago when it 
reduced the capital gains tax on contributions of publicly traded 
securities by 50%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are asking the government to do now is carry that policy 
to its logical conclusion and completely eliminate that capital 
gains tax on contributions of publicly traded shares. The cost to 
the federal treasury of the initiative I am speaking of in 
forgone revenue would be less than $50 million per year. That 
strikes me as an eminently reasonable tax expenditure to 
encourage more Canadians to contribute publicly traded shares and 
to support many of the non-profit and volunteer sector 
institutions, including hospitals, universities and other worthy 
institutions that are very important to the quality of life for 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion addresses one area of tax policy that we would like 
to see corrected.  As I discussed, we have been pushing for the 
government to eliminate as well the capital gains tax on 
contributions of publicly traded shares to Canadian charities. 
These are some of the steps whereby the government could provide 
a recognition of the importance that Canada's volunteer sector 
provides to Canadians and the important level of services 
provided to Canadians by Canada's volunteer sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important to recognize the trend of the increasing 
role that our volunteer sector is asked to play in society.  The 
House would do itself proud to support this motion and to make 
steps in any way we can to encourage more Canadians to contribute 
to the volunteer sector which improves the quality of life of 
Canadians every day.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles-A. Perron:</B> Madam Speaker, I thought I had risen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I rise this evening to speak to Bill C-312, introduced by the 
Reform Party member for Dauphin—Swan River and entitled an act to 
amend the Income Tax Act (percentage of gifts that may be 
deducted from tax). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of this bill is to amend paragraph 118.1(3) of the 
Income Tax Act in order to put charitable gifts on the same tax 
footing as political contributions for the first $1,150. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In February 1997, the Bloc Quebecois asked that the amount 
qualifying for a tax credit be standardized.  A tax credit equal 
to 29% of allowable gifts was proposed, so that low income 
taxpayers could benefit from a credit proportionate to that of 
wealthier taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, for instance, the credit is equal to 23% of total 
allowable gifts, regardless of the size of the gifts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are now seeing, and have often seen in the federal 
system, is that the wealthy, those with higher incomes, always 
get the best deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last budget, for example, the Minister of Finance 
proclaimed to all and sundry that he had lowered everyone's 
taxes. 
Indeed he had, but the allowable deduction for an unmarried 
taxpayer with an annual income of $40,000 is $114.75, barely 31 
cents a day, while the tax credit for a taxpayer with an income 
of $4 million is $30,000.  It is obviously unfair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tax credit for charitable donations is 17% on the first $200 
and 29% on the remainder, so that once again taxpayers in a 
position to make sizeable donations benefit from the maximum 
deduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is estimated that those earning under $60,000 claim an 
average of $144 in charitable gifts, while those earning 
$250,000 and up claim an average of $3,670. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently, the first are entitled to a tax credit of 17%, 
whereas the most wealthy are entitled to a tax credit of 28%. 
We must not forget that these credits also reduce federal and 
provincial surtaxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill ensures that taxpayers with incomes less than $60,000 
will enjoy a tax credit of 67% of the $144 paid, whereas those 
declaring incomes over $250,000 will receive a tax credit of 34% 
of the $3,670 paid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would point out that a dollar, for someone well off, has a 
smaller marginal value than the same dollar made available to 
someone more disadvantaged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, welfare organizations are seeing increased public need. 
The challenge is all the more difficult to face because these 
organizations have had severe budget cuts in recent years.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, in recent years organizations have had increasing 
difficulty obtaining registration numbers.  The forms contain a 
growing number of questions, and any political connection 
increasingly means the loss of registration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would mention a case in my riding, the Fondation jeunesse les 
Coopérants de la MRC de Deux-Montagnes, which has waited for a 
registered organization number for over two years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government will likely tighten eligibility criteria 
further to the detriment of the organizations in the field, 
whose resources are all too often strained to their limit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Giving and tax credits must be encouraged, as proposed.  Bill 
C-312 is a good initiative from this point of view, particularly 
when one keeps in mind that the Canadian Centre for Philanthropy 
calculated some three or four years ago that there would have to 
be a 5.8% increase in giving every time there was a 1% drop in 
government subsidies and transfers, if a constant level of 
funding was to be maintained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this connection, it needs to be acknowledged that services of 
a social nature would be delivered far more effectively by the 
charitable organizations themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have examined the report of the Canadian commission on the 
volunteer sector and it is my belief that the government ought 
to take action, and bring in the necessary amendments.

Finance, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, certainly the government 
recognizes the motivation for the hon. member's bill and fully 
supports the principle of offering generous tax assistance to 
charitable giving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact the government has provided additional incentives for 
charitable giving in four of the last five federal budgets.  Some 
of the measures the government has put forward include lowering 
the threshold for eligibility for the 29% level of tax credit to 
$200 from $250, raising the annual income limit for use of 
charitable donations to most charities from 20% when the 
government took office to 75%, and reducing the income inclusion 
rate for capital gains arising from the donation of appreciated 
publicly traded securities to 37.5%.  These initiatives have been 
recent and certainly the government is monitoring the impact to 
see if further changes are required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member should also recognize that the differences in the 
treatment of political contributions and charitable donations 
reflect the different policy intents of the two measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The design of the federal political contribution tax credit 
reflects the desire to encourage greater grassroots involvement 
by all Canadians in the political process.  It is for this reason 
that generous tax assistance is given to small political 
contributions, that tax assistance is reduced for incremental 
amounts to the point that the federal tax assistance is zero for 
amounts contributed to federal political parties in excess of the 
$1,150 per contributor per year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison:</B>  That is officially noted, precisely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri:</B>  The member says it is official. 
According to the law that is in fact the case.  Perhaps the hon. 
member is not making reference to the law, but what I am stating 
is in fact what the law states. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In contrast, tax assistance for charitable donations is greater 
for amounts in excess of $200 in order to encourage larger 
donations to charities.  It is a policy decision and one that we 
feel is the correct one.  Indeed in the case of very large 
donations tax credits may be claimed for donations up to 75% of a 
taxpayer's income in a given year.  Tax credits may also be 
carried forward for future years should the 75% limit be 
exceeded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The donations of small amounts to charities is not strongly 
motivated by the availability of tax assistance.  Consequently 
the greatest effect of the proposal would be the increase of 
fiscal cost of tax assistance according to donations that would 
have been made in any case.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Charities themselves would receive little benefit.  Under the 
existing tax policy the level of tax assistance accorded for most 
charitable donations results in roughly a 50:50 partnership 
between government and the private sector in support of 
charities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government, while adhering to and supporting the intent of 
the hon. member's bill, cannot support it.  The current design of 
the charitable donations tax credit acts to encourage larger 
donations while recognizing the value of smaller donations.  It 
is appropriate.  The fiscal cost of the measures would be large, 
approximately $125 million per year, for what in fact would be of 
little effect on the level of charitable giving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The greatest effect of the measure would be the increased tax 
assistance to donations that would have been given in any case. 
Consequently charities would receive little additional support 
and therefore I cannot support the bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to debate Bill C-312.  I congratulate the hon. member 
for Dauphin—Swan River on bringing the bill forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a previous job I had the opportunity to participate a little 
in the Royal Commission on Electoral Reform and Party Financing 
in the late 1980s and early 1990s.  I remember distinctly one 
visit the committee made to Washington to meet with 
representatives of the political system in the United States. 
Practically their first question was why we were there to learn 
from them because our system was so much further advanced in 
terms of political financing and representation, the absence of 
soft money and everything else that goes with the American 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I do not necessarily have a problem with Bill C-312 and 
what it purports to do, I am also aware that governments can 
level up and can level down.  My concern—and I thought the 
previous speaker on the government side put it well—is that the 
reason the tax endowments are greater for the person who makes a 
contribution to a political party as opposed to a small donor to 
a charity is to encourage grassroots participation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is incumbent upon us in this debate to talk a little about an 
important study that has just come out on the voluntary sector by 
a blue ribbon committee.  It is very concerned about some aspects 
of charities and wants to make it accountable to end some of the 
abuses it sees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is staggering to note that there are 75,000 charities in 
Canada alone and that the amount of money donated every year is 
in excess of $90 billion.  At the same time it is also noteworthy 
that apparently two-thirds of the revenues of charities come from 
government and only about 12% actually come from donations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That may be hard to believe for some of us who are at home at 6 
o'clock at night when the phones are ringing off the hook with 
callers wanting donations to this or that charity, but these seem 
to be the facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There certainly is some need to tidy up the problems.  I will 
quote from the Canadian Unitarian Council on the voluntary sector 
and on charities which said the following: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What voluntary sector leaders told the Panel on Accountability 
and Governance about Canada's archaic charity laws: 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“We are seriously concerned that the body charged with 
decisions about the public good is Revenue Canada.  There is 
something fundamentally contradictory in the fact that an 
organization which has as its primary function the raising of 
government revenue also has control over determining which groups 
are acknowledged to have a contribution to make to a democratic 
society”.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We can see some good in the proposed bill.  On the other hand we 
are concerned that the grassroots participation in the political 
field continues to be encouraged.  I will await with interest to 
see what the mover of the bill has to say in his wrap-up 
comments. 
<P><A NAME="LINK251"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to add my contribution to the debate on Bill C-312 
proposed by my hon. colleague. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some fundamental, philosophical questions to be asked 
when we have a bill like this one.  When the government gives an 
exemption from taxation on income that is used to promote a 
charity or a political party, it becomes a tax expenditure.  The 
Government of Canada by forgoing some revenue lands up indirectly 
subsidizing that particular activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is an organization in one of our communities whose job 
it is to pick up stray cats and keep them in a nice home with 
facilities and all such things for cats that is considered to be 
a socially beneficial activity, the government then feels it is 
justified in taking money from everybody in the whole country who 
pays taxes and putting some of it into subsidizing that activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the years in Canada the support of different charities and 
different organizations has grown into quite an industry.  As a 
matter of fact, the finance department has a huge branch involved 
in the designation of charities.  One problem that arises from 
this is that we now have a deputy minister and others who by the 
role of regulation and interpretation can determine which 
organization qualifies for the indirect subsidy and which one 
does not.  It does make a substantial difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the parliamentary secretary said that small donations 
were not really driven by whether or not there was a tax 
exemption for them.  That may well be because of the current tax 
law.  The first $100 are not affected by it.  Quite clearly one 
will not be giving a donation to somebody for $20 based on 
whether or not there is a tax benefit since there is not one.  If 
it kicked in right away then perhaps there would be motivation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Back in the old days it used to be that we could claim $100 of 
charitable donations even if none were made.  We did not have to 
supply receipts.  We could either do that or supply the receipts. 
It was always my argument that the person who was not able to 
accumulate $100 worth of receipts in a year for charity is 
probably such a cheap screw that he would not be giving anything 
so why should we give him $100.  If there were no receipts it 
seemed to me that there should be no benefit at all because that 
is a person who does not reach out his hand to help charitable 
organizations or those in need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we come to political parties.  Political parties, according 
to governments of the past, are an activity which the taxpayer 
should be coerced to support indirectly through the granting of 
tax credits.  In the old days it used to be a reduction of one's 
taxable income based on the amount of money given to a political 
party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rate at which political parties are indirectly subsidized by 
the taxpayer in general is much more generous than that for other 
organizations such as those that run safe houses for women and 
children who need a place to escape to when they are in danger or 
other organizations that help people who are ill.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know several of those which basically run extended care 
centres for people with a long term illness.  They are run as 
charitable organizations.  My aunt was in one of those because 
the health care system in this country failed her and her family 
totally.  She was moved into one of them so she could live out 
her final days with a good and reasonable amount of care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those organizations do not have nearly as much benefit and one 
could really wonder which one is better for society.  Which 
activity provides a greater benefit to society as a whole, the 
existence of the Liberal Party or the existence of the extended 
care centre in the small town in Saskatchewan that looked after 
my aunt? I would contend that it was probably the extended care 
centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the way, the family received donations to this extended care 
centre in lieu of flowers because of their great appreciation for 
the care she got. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rate at which the government is indirectly subsidizing this 
should definitely be equal with that for a political party.  I 
would even put my own political party into that category.  It is 
as important to provide support for organizations like that as it 
is for even the Reform Party and certainly the Liberal Party and 
the other parties represented here in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We then have the added question of who decides and how do they 
decide which organization gets the right to give tax receipts. 
That is a big problem which we have been made aware of just 
recently.  The department tends to be rather discriminatory. It 
will accept one particular organization but not another, 
depending on what their supposed activities are and what their 
purposes are.  Sometimes it is quite arbitrary. In my view, some 
of the situations that have come to my attention have been 
wrongly judged.  These people then have a greater difficulty in 
raising money through donations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. colleague has put forward a bill that basically 
equalizes the contributions to charities as compared to those to 
political parties.  With all due respect, I am not sure that I 
would go in that direction.  I may have put it in the other 
direction. I would have perhaps considered bringing the political 
parties' benefit level down to where the charities were instead 
of what the member has done in bringing the charities up to where 
the political parties are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They were quite far apart but there was a limitation on it for 
political donations.  The maximum donation is $1,150 whereas for 
charitable donations, if I am not mistaken, it is now up to 50% 
of one's net income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is now a greater amount available for the charities even 
though the rate is lower.  We need to consider this very 
carefully but I can certainly concur in principle with what my 
hon. colleague is doing.  He is saying we should reflect what is 
valuable to Canadians.  There is no doubt in my mind that most 
Canadians would consider the charities they support to be at 
least as valuable as the political parties, which many people 
unfortunately due to the growing cynicism across the country are 
failing to support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend my colleague for bringing this bill forward.  I hope 
that sometime in the near future we will actually be able to vote 
on something like this to bring a change and equality into this 
area. 
<P><A NAME="LINK252"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills—Grasslands, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I applaud the general premise of the member for

favourably by the income tax system than charities.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I have a severe problem with what is happening in the, 
I would hasten to say, charitable industry in this country. It is 
a little disconcerting that there are over 70,000 registered 
charities, all entitled to the standard deduction which is 
afforded to people who are able to get their hands on a number. I 
wonder how useful a lot of these organizations are, how much of 
their intake is actually swallowed up in administration and 
salaries and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seventy thousand charities.  There has to be something wrong 
there.  They are not all Salvation Army or the Canadian Cancer 
Society.  These are people who have their own little private axes 
to grind.  They are getting a tax break which in many cases I do 
not think could be justified if we could do a serious audit on 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of us who read the daily papers know what is happening. 
Audits are being done on a very selective basis.  People that are 
not necessarily in accord with the government of the day are 
having their numbers revoked, whereas other charities that are 
perhaps more friendly to the philosophy of the Liberal Party are 
not having their numbers revoked, even though they are engaged in 
proselytizing, evangelism or whatever one wants to call it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On that basis we may have allowed this thing to get a little out 
of control. I do have some very grave misgivings about the 
member's bill. 
<P><A NAME="LINK253"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin—Swan River, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
first let me thank all hon. members on both sides of the House 
for debating this private member's bill.  They brought forward 
many important points, one being that it is about societal values 
and the volunteer base of this country.  We all come from 
communities where if it were not for the volunteer sector, not 
much would probably happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Cypress Hills—Grasslands brought forward the 
important point that perhaps there needs to be a new set of 
standards.  If the rules are to be changed, it is a good idea. We 
all need scrutiny.  Audit requirements are probably a sensible 
approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my brief closing comments, I would like to make some key 
points to tell the House why this bill should have been made 
votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the optics of our society, of equality in this country. 
Politicians really should not get the edge on the average 
Canadian, at least that is the optics out there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The charitable donation of $1,150 or less should be put on an 
equal footing with political donations.  The first $200 donated 
to charities results in a tax credit of 17% of that amount. 
Anything over $200 donated to a charity results in a tax credit 
of 29% of the amount.  The maximum tax creditable amount is 50% 
of the filer's income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first $100 of a political donation results in a 75% tax 
credit.  The next $450 results in an additional 50% tax credit. 
The next $600 results in an additional tax credit of one-third of 
the amount donated.  The maximum tax creditable amount is $1,150 
which results in a tax credit of $500. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993 the average charitable donation claim was $626.  Subject 
to standard rules, the tax credit was $158.  As a political 
donation, $626 resulted in a tax credit of $325. 
That is a difference of $168.  Again, as was indicated by 
previous speakers and myself, there is a discrepancy in our tax 
credit system.

<A HREF="#LINKT103"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are the revenue implications?  According to the reference 
branch of the Library of Parliament, these are difficult to nail 
down at this time.  Estimates are that under present levels of 
donations this would probably result in the government taking in 
about $800 million or less.  Perhaps we could just deem this as a 
tax break.  As we all know, money in the pockets of the citizens 
of this country is certainly better than in the hands of 
politicians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, the key reason for the uncertainty on revenue is 
that increasing the tax credit for charitable donations could 
encourage people to give more to charities.  At a time when 
governments are able to do less, and we all agree on that, I 
think we should encourage increased giving to charities.  It is 
unfortunate that with the tax breaks political organizations 
currently get, it appears that people in this country still do 
not take an interest in politics.

<P><A NAME="LINK256"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills—Grasslands, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, on November 6, 1998, I raised a question in the House 
regarding the loss of tax revenue by western rural municipalities 
when land is converted to Indian reserves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In responding, the government House leader clearly did not have 
the faintest idea of what I was talking about.  He stumbled and 
stammered that his government fully understood its obligations to 
aboriginal Canadians and as always he adhered to the standard 
Liberal policy of when you do not understand the issue, 
obfuscate. In order that the government can compose a rational 
response, I will now pose my question in great detail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two types of native land claims being settled by 
federal and provincial funding of land purchases by Indian bands. 
Treaty land entitlement claims involve lands promised by the 
government as part of the original treaties with the Indian 
bands.  Some bands were shortchanged mainly due to incorrect 
counts of band members.  A recent recalculation has resulted in 
the awarding of huge additional entitlements based, not on the 
original 19th century populations, but on recent counts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Using remarkable Liberal mathematics, I suppose that the 
treaties should rationally be reopened in 10, 20 or 30 years 
hence until ultimately all of the west has been returned to its 
original owners. However I am digressing. That is a subject for 
another debate. Tonight the subject is taxation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Land purchased under treaty land entitlements and transferred to 
reserve status is land removed from the tax base of rural 
municipalities.  However, for the loss of these particular lands, 
the rural municipalities are very fairly given a grant of 22.5 
times the annual tax revenue as compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately there is a second type of entitlement which has a 
totally different outcome to the rural municipalities.  Specific 
land claims are to return lands lost through unlawful acts or 
land arbitrarily taken away from a reserve without compensation. 
For such claims, rural municipalities will only be compensated at 
five times the previous year's taxes.  This is blatantly unfair 
and it represents a disavowal of federal commitments made to the 
rural municipalities in 1991 and 1993.  It is a breach of trust. 
The only rationale for the reduced rate seems to be that it is 
cheaper for the senior government to download its 
responsibilities onto the municipalities.

<A HREF="#LINKT104"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it is certainly not cheaper for rural taxpayers who 
will pay more to cover the shortfall.  They are hit twice, once 
as Canadian taxpayers to purchase the lands and once as municipal 
taxpayers to provide the services in perpetuity, the roads 
primarily, for these alienated pieces of land.  That is not fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very easy for a government to be generous at the expense 
of someone else.  If a debt is owed to natives for land unfairly 
taken from them, it is a debt owed by all Canadians and not just 
by a handful of Saskatchewan farmers.  Why does this government 
find that so hard to understand?

it is a pleasure to respond to the member's question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are only two minutes to respond. I will consult my notes 
briefly but I think by listening to the premise of the hon. 
member's question, he is absolutely wrong. I wish he would review 
his history with respect to the rule of law, contract law and 
some of the legal decisions that were handed down to this country 
through the privy council office even in England long before any 
of us arrived in the House of Commons.  This set out the rules 
very clearly that the first nations in Canada had a legal 
interest in the land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had signed the treaties, therefore, based on the legal 
process.  The land was given away illegally by successive federal 
and provincial governments.  We are trying to rectify that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the member that it is collectively a Canadian 
decision.  The hon. member will know as well that under section 
91 we have responsibilities at the federal level and under 
section 92 those are responsibilities at the provincial level as 
well. We are working within those responsibilities, in this case 
with the Government of Saskatchewan, to address those 
compensation issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the hon. member that legally in this case we have no 
obligation to provide those kinds of grants back to the 
municipalities.  It is done as a gesture to work and facilitate 
relationships between all the interested parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member said he spoke for western Canada.  That is not the 
case at all.  I am from western Canada and I do not share his 
view on this process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about Saskatchewan.  We are working very closely 
with the Saskatchewan government to work out under the treaty 
land entitlement process acceptable arrangements.  We are still 
in discussions with respect to fair compensation for third party 
interests that we recognize as legitimate.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I am 13 years old and I have smoked for a year.  I am trying to 
quit. It is hard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support Bill S-13 that collects 50 cents on each carton of 
cigarettes because it will stop kids from smoking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thank you for your time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>P.S.  Please help kids stop smoking. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-13 was the bill that the health minister said was a good 
idea.  I quote from his comments to the media on June 3:  “I 
think it is a good idea.  I think it is clever.  I think it is a 
good bill and we should go forward with it”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what we are asking today.  Where is the bill?  Where is 
this government's support of the idea in the form of some 
legislation or financial measure to ensure the spirit of the bill 
put forward by Senator Kenny is adhered to? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of concrete action, all we get from this government is 
rhetoric.  We get the Minister of Health saying this country has 
the best record anywhere in terms of anti-smoking provisions.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of a great record we have a situation where cigarettes 
are now cheaper than they were before, tobacco profits are up, 
more kids are smoking, cigarette advertising has increased, 
tobacco is killing more Canadians and funding for anti-smoking 
measures has not been put in place as promised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are asking for is a comprehensive strategy.  We thought 
we would have that when we heard the minister was making a big 
announcement on January 21.  There was no complete comprehensive 
strategy.  There were measures on packaging, on bigger warning 
labels on cigarette packages and on the particular health effects 
if one smoked and so on.  There was no comprehensive strategy. 
There was nothing in terms of the need to look at taxation, 
especially given that many provinces are offering cigarettes at a 
much lower rate than in the United States.  That puts to rest the 
whole notion of dealing with smuggling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have no evidence from this government that it is spending the 
money it promised in the 1993 federal campaign and in the 1997 
federal campaign, $100 million, toward youth anti-smoking 
initiatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are asking today where is the comprehensive strategy.  When 
will we see the government act on the spirit of Bill S-13 and 
start acting in terms of protecting the health of our young 
people?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Elinor Caplan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am pleased to be here today 
to discuss the government's efforts to reduce tobacco use among 
young Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Protecting the health of our kids is a priority.  We have put in 
place a comprehensive four pronged strategy that includes 
legislation, regulation, enforcement, research and public 
education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In April 1997 the government passed the Tobacco Act, one of the 
toughest tobacco control laws in the world.  It restricts access 
by young people to tobacco products, empowers governments to 
introduce stronger health warnings and establishes broad powers 
for tobacco regulation.  Let me remind members that the World 
Health Organization has recognized our Tobacco Act as one of the 
toughest in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have initiated consultations on the process of regulation 
which would make those regulations among the most stringent in 
the world.  We are addressing labelling and promotion of tobacco. 
We have already alerted Canadians to the realities of light and 
mild messaging.  We have hosted a round table with experts to 
learn about strategies designed to increase public awareness and 
to ensure that concerns about tobacco are widely known. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are working with provincial governments to increase 
compliance.  We recognize this is a serious problem.  That is why 
we are working with the National Cancer Institute on monitoring 
and surveillance activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have committed $50 million over the next five years to 
encourage and support young Canadians not to smoke.  In addition, 
we have a caucus committee which is looking at enhancing options 
for tobacco public education efforts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our priority is protecting the health of young Canadians.  As I 
said, we have a comprehensive strategy.  The one thing that is 
certain is that the critic for the New Democratic Party will 
never be satisfied.  That is a good thing.  It is her job to 
complain, to criticize and to issue rhetoric.  That is why we are 
here—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> Order, please.  I am sorry 
to interrupt the hon. member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been 
adopted. Accordingly, this House stands adjourned until tomorrow 
at 2 p.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(The House adjourned at 7.23 p.m.)
