International Plowing Match and Machinery Show, IPM '98, will 
be held in Sunbury near Kingston in my riding of 
Hastings—Frontenac—Lennox and Addington from September 15 to 
September 19. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the largest outdoor agricultural exhibition in North 
America.  The theme for the five day event is “Quality Living, a 
partnership” which points to the interdependence between urban 
and rural communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More than 125,000 people are expected to view the approximately 
1,000 exhibits ranging from farm, gardening and recreational 
equipment to antiques, educational displays, crafts, magnificent 
farm animals, demonstrations, and live country music. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Plowers from age 7 to 70 will take part.  In addition to the 
regular classes, this match will also feature the Canadian 
Plowing Championship.  I particularly like the 
federal-provincial plowing competition for elected officials. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker and honoured colleagues, I throw down the gauntlet 
and challenge you to pit yourselves and your furrows against me 
in September and help make IPM '98 a great success.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
today the Reform Party of Canada begins its second year as Her 
Majesty's loyal official opposition.  We will continue to hold 
the Liberals accountable for their mismanagement.  The Liberals 
use closure to debate and prevent free votes.  Many MPs only look 
through the lens of political stripes, not the lens of issues. 
Partisan politics is applied to compensation for hep C victims, 
Senate reform, rebalancing Confederation, the CPP and the YOA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Debate is about sharing and listening to different viewpoints. 
Yet the official opposition has to regularly call for quorum 
forcing Liberal members to participate in debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are getting value for money from Reform MPs because 
our performance springs from true grassroots democracy as 
demonstrated at our London assembly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us work together and make Canada a better place.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to extend special congratulations to Ms. Patricia 
Bell who was awarded a certificate of excellence by our Prime 
Minister for her teaching excellence. Ms. Bell is a Latin teacher 
at Centennial Collegiate and Vocational Institute in Guelph.  A 
sign on her classroom wall reads “Latin is more than a 
language”.  She encourages activities that highlight the 
relevance of Latin today.

senator himself to act responsibly and do the honourable thing 
which is to resign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should the senator not resign, the Senate has only one option 
and that is to deal with the senator's criminal conviction. 
Canadians do not want a senator from prison any more than they 
want a senator from Mexico.  So resign, Senator Cogger, and 
resign now.

Army surrounded students and workers rallying peacefully for 
democracy in Tiananmen Square. In the early hours of June 4, 
troops and police opened fire. Tanks rolled in.  Armour-piercing 
bullets tore through human flesh.

were arrested are still being held in Beijing's brutal prisons 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On this anniversary the Chinese people demand a new China, a 
democratic China with a free press, a China that respects human 
dignity.  But their voice is stifled as more dissidents are 
arrested every week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pathetically the Chinese communist government said today that 
the massacre of pro-democracy students at Tiananmen was a correct 
conclusion and that there is no need to reassess the issue.

expressing their belief in democracy.

Speaker, when the largest service contract ever awarded by the 
Canadian government was given to the Prime Minister's favourite 
company, then the government's contracting guidelines should have 
been followed to the letter, but they were not.  There were no 
competitive bids, there was no public notice and the government 
refuses to answer access to information requests.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, this contract had been discussed and everyone had 
knowledge of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, yesterday Don Chynoweth, the director of business 
affairs of Frontec Corporation of Edmonton, said “We have kept 
the Reform Party informed of this for three and a half years. The 
former Reform member of parliament responsible for Moose Jaw up 
until the last election”, who is presently the member of 
parliament for Blackstrap, “was more than involved in it and 
more than encouraging to us, as we were keeping him briefed”.

<P><A NAME="LINK36"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr.

led to an unsolicited, untendered and unadvertised $2.85 billion 
contract. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been seven months since the official opposition formally 
requested the government to disclose how this contract was 
arrived at.  We have repeated this request every month since then 
and all we got was a worthless verbal briefing from the

Speaker, we have absolutely nothing to hide.  Perhaps I will keep 
reading from this well informed person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said “By Reform putting forward the notion that it should 
have been tendered, I guess what they are saying is perhaps they 
wanted it in a foreign company's hands because there was no other 
Canadian consortium or company that was interested or capable of 
pulling this together”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a western company which wanted to work with the Canadian

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if what the Prime Minister says is true, if this deal is 
really that beneficial to Canadians, then the Prime Minister 
should have no difficulty at all in proving that point to the 
House.  All he has to do is lay before the House the documents 
that show how this contract was arrived at and how it led to this 
$2.85 billion deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the Prime Minister not back up his claims that this is

Silence.  Absolute silence.  Reform members were not interested

Speaker, how can the minister say he is being fair to Air 
Canada, when the Hong Kong market, which is estimated at 500,000 
passengers, is still hard for it to access fully, with the 
number of passengers required for a second designation set at 
300,000?

<P><A NAME="LINK82"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, we brought in a policy three or four years ago in 
terms of when a market reaches 300,000.  Then we designate a 
second carrier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In some cases such as with Taiwan, which Air Canada wants to 
serve, we just do not have the figures to confirm that the 
300,000 passenger mark has been reached.  I expect that will be 
reached this year and therefore Air Canada will probably be 
allowed to service Taiwan as of next year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an evolving file.  We want to make sure that each 
company has access to the international routes, but we believe 
that Canadian Airlines has to be allowed the time for its 
restructuring plan to bear fruit.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
Michel Cogger is a convicted criminal who spends part of his time 
being a senator.  Yesterday he was convicted of bribes of more 
than $200,000 to influence Senate decision making.  Mr. Speaker, 
do you know what his defence was?  He said “Nobody told me it 
was wrong”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Legally his salary is guaranteed and his seat is secured.  The

resign.  When will he do the same for Michel Cogger?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, in relation to members of the other house, they have 
rules and regulations there.  We have a system of law in Canada 
and we do not know if he will decide to appeal or not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to respect the system and the other house is in charge 
of its own procedure.  We will see what the end result is of 
these proceedings which have not been completed at this time.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the Prime Minister did not hesitate at all to write a letter to 
the upper house about Andy Thompson.  There are some amazing 
similarities between the upper house and the big house. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here are a few of them.  It costs about the same to house a 
prisoner as it does a senator.  Both are full of colourful

question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will.  Thank you very

hook or by crook.  When will it be? 
<P><A NAME="LINK87"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, when there will be an elected Senate there will be an 
elected Senate for all Canadians at the same time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we were to elect the Senate today, it would be ensuring 
forever that there will be only six senators in Alberta.  I do 
not understand why those who have 30 seats in the east would want 
to let that power go.  They received it at the time of 
Confederation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we want reform of the Senate we need a complete one with 
equality and effectiveness.  I do not think a little scheme to 
score political points is in the best interest of the people of 
Alberta or Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ)</B> moved: 
<A NAME="LINK219">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 1 
</UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That Bill C-37 be amended by deleting Clause 5. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, the purpose of Bill C-37 is to amend the 
Judges Act and to make consequential amendments to other acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois is generally in favour of this bill, but has 
many reservations about certain aspects of it. 
The motion I am moving calls for the deletion of clause 5 which, 
in my view and in the view of the Bloc Quebecois, gives 
unreasonable salary increases to judges, in light of the 
financial situation and the cutbacks that have taken place in 
various departments and sectors in Canada and Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see no need for a 40-minute speech about this.  It is very 
easily understood and I will give figures to make it clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My motion reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That Bill C-37 be amended by deleting Clause 5. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If members examine the bill, they will see that clause 5 deals 
with the determination of judges' salaries after June 1, 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In committee, an attempt was made to convince me that Bill C-37 
is not a retroactive bill.  An attempt was made to convince me 
that judges in courts under federal jurisdiction, that is the 
Quebec Superior Court, the Ontario Supreme Court, appeal courts, 
as well as the Supreme Court of Canada, were not being given a 
retroactive increase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If members read clause 5, however, they will clearly see that 
the period used to determine the salary goes back to April 1, 
1997.  The government should be aware that it is now June 3, 
1998 and that this bill has not yet been passed.  In other 
words, when it is passed, judges' salaries will be determined 
retroactive to April 1, 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The poor judges did not have a big enough increase.  Under the 
Judges Act, they received an increase of 2.08% on April 1, 1997 
and of 2.08% on April 1, 1998. However, the government in its 
great wisdom thought it a good idea to ask a committee to look 
into judges salaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A report was released—the Scott report.  From it and its study 
the government is proposing, in addition to the 2.08% for two 
years, an additional increase for the judges of 4.1% as of April 
1, 1997 and 4.1% as of April 1, 1998. Thus, once parliament 
passes Bill C-37—today or in a week from now, it does not much 
matter—the judges will have a retroactive salary increase of 
some 13.8%, if we add up all the percentages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For someone earning $25,000, 13.8% is not a whole lot. But 
federal judges currently earn, before the increase, between 
$165,000 and $210,000.  That means that the Chief Justice of the 
Supreme Court of Canada, because he earns the most and it is the 
highest court as well, earns about $210,000 today. The 13.8% 
increase amounts to between $25,000 and $27,000—I do not have 
the calculations here—in retroactive increases as of April 1, 1998.

<A HREF="#LINKT19"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think such increases are justified at the moment.  Do 
not get me wrong.  I am not saying that the judges of the 
Supreme Court of Canada, the Superior Court, the Court of Appeal 
or whatever do not deserve a salary increase.  That is not what 
I am saying.  I am saying that, right now, with the state of 
public finances and the terrible cuts the government opposite is 
imposing on the most disadvantaged, a salary increase of about 
13% for people earning $165,000 to $210,000 is indecent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the government will have cut over $30 billion in transfer 
payments by 2003, it is considering increasing the salary of the 
Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Canada by $25,000 to 
$27,000. 
While the government is pocketing approximately $700,000 an hour 
with the employment insurance plan we discussed last week and 
again this week, accumulating a surplus in excess of $19 billion— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> That it will pocket. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B> That it will pocket. A 13.8% wage 
increase is contemplated for judges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the one hand, cuts are made in health and in transfer 
payments to the provinces for education, but on the other hand, 
a 13.8% wage increase is contemplated for judges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Frankly, I think this is not the right time to give them a 
raise, the same way it is not the right time to give one to 
government employees. In the committee, judges were compared to 
senior government officials for the purpose of increasing their 
wages. 
In a few weeks or months, senior government officials will 
compare themselves to judges to get a raise. Where will this all 
end? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At present, we have good, well paid judges, earning between 
$165,000 and $210,000, plus a number of paid expenses like the 
ones the members of this House and the Prime Minister get. 
Perhaps the Prime Minister is not paid well enough, but we must 
also look at who is paid for the zero deficit the government has 
been so eager to achieve and rightly so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each of us must do our part. I do not think that it is 
appropriate to give the judges a raise on top of the one already 
provided for, because the existing legislation does provide for 
a raise for them, while many people have not had any raise in 
recent years. 
Under the Judges Act, they already have a 2.08% increase.  I 
believe 2% is within the normal range, and reasonable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But to add onto that, under the bill we have before us, 4.1% 
effective April 1, 1997 and another 4.1% effective April 1, 
1998, is unreasonable in my opinion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> That is four times the inflation rate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B> My colleague from Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot 
tells me it is four times the inflation rate.  I think this 
should be taken into consideration, given his expertise in the 
matter.  I am sure the government did not take it into 
consideration and, since we now say this is four times 
inflation, I think this is one more argument in support of my 
calling it unreasonable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since I have only one minute left, I would like to make it clear 
that, if we are to have quality judges, they must be paid 
accordingly.  But I believe that a salary of $165,00 to $210,000 
is plenty to ensure that we get judges of the quality we have at 
present. I have practiced law and I am the justice critic.  I am 
very attentive to their rulings and I believe that, at the 
present time, the salary judges get is sufficient to get quality 
judges.

they are political appointments.  If members look at the list of 
people waiting to be judges, they will agree with me that all of 
them feel that a salary of $165,000 to $210,000 is sufficient. 
<P><A NAME="LINK220"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as 
the hon. member is well aware, since he sits on the Standing 
Committee on Justice and Human Rights, this issue was discussed 
on a number of occasions when we reviewed the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is following up on the recommendation made by an 
independent commission appointed by Parliament, the Scott 
commission. Such commissions play an important role, that is to 
preserve public confidence in the independence of the courts. 
This is a role to which the Supreme Court of Canada gave 
constitutional stature in a recent decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We took a very close look at the recommendations of the Scott 
commission, and we decided to follow up on the ones we felt were 
legitimate, which include raising the salaries of judges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Judges are not considered public servants, even though they are 
paid by the Treasury Board. 
Canadian judges must receive an adequate salary that reflects 
the importance of their role in our society and the constraints 
related to their responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In determining whether the recommendation was reasonable, the 
Scott commission—which, again, was an independent 
commission—took into consideration the specific constitutional 
role of the judiciary and other factors, such as the need to 
attract and to keep the best qualified candidates to carry out 
the responsibilities of a judge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want the House to know that there is a procedure in place, but 
it is not political one, contrary to what the hon. member 
suggested. Indeed, there is an independent commission which 
submits to the minister the names of the best qualified people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Judges also made a contribution to the reduction of the 
government deficit, since their salaries have been frozen since 
1992. 
The increase provided in Bill C-37 only applies in the future. I 
repeat. judges should be recruited from various groups, 
including lawyers in private practice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Considering the salaries paid to lawyers in private practice, we 
have to be able to attract the best lawyers. We want our courts 
to be run by the most qualified people in Canada. The salaries 
paid to judges simply do not compare with those paid to lawyers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Still, we will have to offer salaries that will not deter the 
best candidates from applying. The  proposed raise, recommended 
by the Scott commission, will bring judges' salaries in line 
with those of senior deputy ministers. For example, on April 1, 
1997, a deputy minister at the DM3 equivalent level was paid 
between $140,000 and $170,000. 
The lowest salary a judge could earn is $165,500.  As of April 
1, 1998, public servants received a 5% salary increase.  Their 
salaries are now between $173,000 and $203,000.  For judges, it 
amounts to almost $176,000. This compares reasonably, given 
their level of responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could talk a little about salary increases approved in some 
provinces.  I will give a few examples. 
For Newfoundland, the rate of increase is 13%. For Saskatchewan, 
it is 16%; for Nova Scotia, it is 25%.  For Newfoundland, as I 
said, it is 13%.  I must add that for Newfoundland—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos:  </B>I am coming to Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For Newfoundland, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island, this 
increase is retroactive.  For the other two it is not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for Quebec, if my information is correct, a committee is now 
looking at judges' salaries. There has been no increase since 
1992. 
The salary of the chief justice of the Court of Quebec is 
$132,786, and that of the associate chief justice $130,516.  As 
I said, there has been no increase yet because it is before a 
parliamentary committee.  We do not know the percentage 
increase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would once again like to emphasize that the government looked 
carefully at the recommendations of the Scott commission and 
that it was guided by them in its recommendations to committee 
members.  If we wish to attract the best candidates to 
judgeships, and I repeat that we want the judiciary to be 
independent, I think that these recommendations are very 
reasonable.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
motivation for this bill is very unusual.  I want to speak to 
this bill and to this particular amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I begin by pointing out to the House that when this bill was 
before the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights only 
two witnesses appeared.  We had Mr. David W. Scott, the author of 
the Scott report which had the recommendations that my hon. 
colleague across the way referred to, and we had the commissioner 
for federal judicial affairs. Only two witnesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had asked for other witnesses.  We asked for two 
constitutional lawyers who would have been able to answer some of 
the questions I had concerning the contents of the bill and the 
motivation for the bill.  Even though the committee had time we 
were denied that.  It had originally scheduled time to hear 10 
witnesses.  It appears that at least six refused to appear to 
give testimony to the committee on this bill.  The witnesses we 
had asked for were not asked to attend. This was a decision made 
by the Liberal majority on the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do we have in this bill?  I support my hon. colleague's 
motion. I will not spend as much time as my colleagues and others 
in this House will on the raises the judges will be receiving if 
this bill is passed without this particular amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the next two years, the Chief Justice of Canada will 
receive a $17,000 increase in pay.  The other justices will 
receive the same.  The chief justice and associate chief justice 
of the Federal Court and Tax Court of Canada will receive a 
$15,000 increase in pay.  Justices of the federal court will 
receive $13,000.  When we get to the superior courts, the chief 
justice and associate chief justice will receive a $15,000 
increase in pay over the next two years.  Justices of the 
superior court will receive a $13,000 increase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with my hon. colleague that that is quite a raise in 
pay, considering that at this particular time there are families 
with children who are struggling to make ends meet.  They are 
making $35,000 and less.  The chief justices now make $208,200. 
Other justices of the Supreme Court of Canada make $192,000. 
I think a lot of Canadians would agree that that is a pretty 
comfortable salary.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes we have to attract top qualified people to the courts but 
nevertheless this is a subject that should be discussed in this 
House. I think my hon. colleague brought forward this amendment 
for that very purpose, to enable this matter to be looked at and 
debated and not rushed through this House unexamined as the bill 
was rushed through the justice committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to touch for a moment on the motivation for this bill in 
the first place.  It was motivated by a ruling of the Supreme 
Court of Canada on the P.E.I. and Alberta cases where it was 
determined that a commission must be set up by all provincial 
governments as well as the federal government to examine the 
benefits and pay of judges.  Recommendations must go to the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem with this is that it has been determined, if I 
understand correctly and I believe that I do, that if the 
government of a province or the federal government does not 
follow through with the recommendation, it can be taken to court. 
It can go to the Supreme Court of Canada. If the decision of the 
supreme court indicates that the decision of that government is 
not reasonable and that the raise or other benefits should be 
provided, that can be construed as interference by the Government 
of Canada or the government of a province into the judicial 
independence of the courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I read Justice LaForest's dissenting opinion he said 
clearly what I think the common sense of this country would 
support.  He indicated that any interference in any decision by 
any government, whether federal or provincial, that deals with 
judges pay or benefits that is not satisfactory to a court, 
including the supreme court of this country, ought not to be 
considered as an interference with the judicial independence of 
the court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another area of grave concern which this bill raises. 
If the Parliament of Canada goes along with the decision of the 
Supreme Court of Canada, there is also an interference, an 
abridgement or an encroachment upon the supremacy of parliament 
to tax because the pay of judges comes from the public purse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Suppose that the economic conditions of this country are such 
that everyone must take a pay reduction and the courts feel that 
that pay reduction is unacceptable or unfair, their subjective 
assessment is that it is not fair.  According to that decision if 
the governments of this land do not want to face the consequences 
of the inference that that decision to reduce their pay 
interferes with the judicial independence of the court, then they 
are going to have to be guided by a decision of the court to tax 
the people in order to pay their salaries and benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is wrong. I agree with the dissenting opinion of Judge 
LaForest in this particular area.  For the House of Commons to 
bring in this kind of bill in response to that decision of the 
Supreme Court of Canada is wrong as well. 
When they do that and refuse to bring in witnesses who could 
address some of the concerns that I and other members of the 
committee and perhaps this House have on that issue, this is 
wrong again.

</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are seeing is an encroachment by the powers of the 
judiciary into the supremacy of parliament not only to pass laws 
but also in the area of taxation. This is very serious. This is 
why I cannot support this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My recommendation to members of the House, certainly my caucus 
but the rest of the members of this House is that we had better 
examine this very carefully because of the consequences of moving 
in concert with that judgment.  If it is not challenged, where is 
it going to end? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see that my time is up.  I appreciate the indulgence of the 
Chair and the House.  I will continue my debate when we arrive at 
the next amendment to this bill. 
<P><A NAME="LINK222"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney—Victoria, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I too rise to address the motion before the House.  I indicate to 
the House that we will be supporting the motion from my colleague 
from the Bloc Quebecois. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened carefully when the member was presenting his 
arguments for this motion.  He argued against an increase at this 
point in time for the members of the judiciary which this act to 
amend the Judges Act provides for. I concur with him on all of 
those remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When this bill was first introduced in the House, I spoke 
against the bill.  I said that at this point in time it was 
essential that moneys be returned to the provinces for support 
for those who are working in the courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice stood up 
and quoted statistics from other provinces.  She said that there 
has been an increase in judicial salaries, and quoted my home 
province of Nova Scotia and said some 20% or 25%. She is right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Monday of this week I walked the picket lines with the crown 
attorneys for the province of Nova Scotia.  They did not want to 
stop working but after four years of negotiations with the 
provincial government they could get nowhere in terms of talking 
about support services. They took the extraordinary step of work 
stoppage, of not attending court on Monday and Tuesday of this 
week.  That is an extraordinary event in the history of my 
province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On my way here today to speak to this bill, in fact walking 
across the street I was speaking on a cellphone with a lawyer in 
the Nova Scotia legal aid system.  That lawyer has not been in 
court the last three days. It is because the judges have just 
received their 25% increase in salary and are on a judges 
conference. That lawyer cannot deal with the crushing caseload 
that has ended up on his desk in the last few days.  It is to the 
point where they are spending their time answering complaints 
that have been written to their superiors. They do not have time 
to return calls.  They do not have time to answer letters. They 
do not have the resources to cope with the crushing burden that 
the courts are faced with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the examples that the crown prosecutors used is that they 
are still keeping file stats on those they are prosecuting on 
recipe cards.  They do not have access to the Internet.  They do 
not have up to date computers on their desks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know these matters all fall under provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini:</B>  The hon. member from the government 
says right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the reality is that the reason these dedicated public 
servants cannot access money from their provincial governments is 
that her government has cut the payments to the provinces for the 
last four years. This government has cut and cut and downloaded 
on the provinces.  She sits there proud of that, laughs and takes 
pleasure in it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people cannot perform their functions but the money can be 
found to provide substantial increases for the federally 
appointed judges to the extent of over 8%. 
It is a substantial increase given the crushing burden that those 
who serve the public in the provinces are facing.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary talked a little about the 
appointment process which she defended.  I questioned the 
Minister of Justice on this issue when she was before the 
standing committee on justice.  She said there are committees in 
place and there is wide consultation.  She is right that there 
are committees in place.  It has been some time since I looked at 
the last committee in my own province.  When I looked that 
committee was composed of a former campaign manager for the 
individual who had been the Liberal cabinet minister from my 
province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come from a small community where people wear their political 
affiliations on there sleeves so I knew who sat on that 
committee, I knew who was likely to get appointed. The last 
federally appointed justice was a good friend of mine and a good 
fellow.  He had also been the collector of campaign contributions 
for the same cabinet minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not to say there are not good judges.  I do not want to 
mislead the House or anyone who reads this.  There are some very 
good judges who work long hours and deal with difficult cases and 
make good law.  But there are some other judges.  Part of the 
problem in the Judges Act is that there is no mechanism to keep 
in check or to make accountable or to separate the good judges 
from the bad or to separate those who are political appointees 
who do not perform their functions well from those appointees who 
go above and beyond their necessary work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the hon. member from the Bloc for bringing forward his 
amendment.  I will be supporting it, because I think at this 
point it sends the wrong message.  If the courts are struggling, 
as they are, with a backlog of cases and if the individuals going 
before the courts have not had increases, the lawyers I have 
mentioned, the crown attorneys and the legal aid lawyers, have 
had their wages either frozen or rolled back for nine years.  At 
this point to suggest the judiciary ought to receive this salary 
increase is difficult for the morale of those who work in the 
courts and it sends the wrong message.  And so I will be 
supporting my colleague's amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK223"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak to Motion No. 1 which would amend Bill C-37 by 
deleting clause 5, a clause that outlines the calculation of a 
judge's salary for the 12 months commencing April 1, 1997 and 
April 1, 1998.  Not only should this clause be deleted but the 
whole bill should be deleted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the third time the Liberals have amended the all 
important Judges Act.  During the last parliament in 1996 they 
introduced Bill C-2 and Bill C-42, both which were 
inconsequential pieces of legislation of little significance to 
Canadians who were more concerned about their safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we are again spending precious time on judges' salaries and 
benefits when this Liberal government has failed to introduce 
anything that addresses the victims bill of right or the Young 
Offenders Act.  They failed to limit the use of conditional 
sentences for violent offenders.  They have failed in so much and 
here we are debating this kind of bill regarding judges' 
salaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It occupies the justice committee's valuable time with these 
administrative matters at the expense of more important issues 
like amending laws on drinking and driving or a lot of things 
that would so much more protect society.  That whole thing has to 
change.  At the heart of this legislation is that it increases 
judges' salaries retroactively from April 1, 1997 to March 31, 
1998 by 4.1% and by an additional 4.1% from April 1 1998 to March 
31, 1999. 
In other words they will get an 8.2% increase over two years. I 
understand the average salary of a judge is approximately 
$140,000. This will mean the average will go up to in excess of 
$151,000.  That is a substantial increase.  The salaries are 
$208,200, $192,900, $177,700, $162,300, another $177,700.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those wages are going to go up in the amounts that were 
described by my colleague from Crowfoot.  They are going to end 
up really making big bucks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole thing that is really perturbing about this is that we 
have people called public servants who have not received a pay 
raise for a long time, certainly not a pay raise of 8.2%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government continually awards judges and senior 
bureaucrats, including its own ministers, with large pay raises 
and bonuses while frontline police officers and low level public 
servants receive little to nothing.  This government does not 
care about frontline peace officers who risk their lives every 
day to protect Canadians.  It does not care about the lowly 
prison guards who put their lives on the line constantly, every 
time they show up and go to work in these penitentiaries. They 
are at high risk and we do not talk about a retroactive pay raise 
for them. That would be the wildest of dreams to these people. 
These frontline workers have not had a pay raise for many years 
and here we are talking about the elite once again getting more 
money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have seen Liberals in this House, including the two who are 
here now, at one time or another every week since 1993, through a 
member's statement or through some kind of process, bringing 
forth the topic about the millions of children, thousands and 
thousands of families suffering in this country, 
living below the poverty line, having a tough time making ends 
meet.  Some of these raises are $17,000 or $15,000.  I know 
people with families of two or three children trying to 
get by on a salary that big, let alone an increase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These members keep talking about what a shame it is and that we 
have to do something about it.  Here it is 1998 and they have 
done diddly squat. They have not done one thing to help the 
people who are living in poverty.  Those same numbers are still 
out there. People are still suffering.  Young families are still 
being evicted from their homes because they cannot meet the high 
rents now or they cannot meet the mortgage payments.  People are 
eating meals that would not even compare to half as good as what 
prisoners in penitentiaries get. People are not able to play in a 
big park or shoot pool or take in any movies because they cannot 
afford to go out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We spend time with legislation that says to people who are 
drawing anywhere from $170,000 to $200,000 and down to $130,000 
that we have to do something for them, we have to get them a 
raise.  What kind of hypocrisy is that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will almost guarantee that before we leave here some Liberal 
member will stand and boldly say we must do something about the 
poverty in our land and help these people who are suffering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am really getting tired of their constantly making those kinds 
of statements and then turning around and taking $25 million to 
give away free flags and saying “aren't I a nice girl?” or boy, 
or whatever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime, imagine what $25 million would do for children 
on the streets of Ottawa and how people who work in child 
services and in child poverty situations would love to have a 
little teeny chunk of that $25 million. I do not understand where 
they are coming from. The last thing we should ever talk about is 
how much more money we should make in a raise without addressing 
the problems that face this country because of poverty stricken 
people.

</I></B></P><P align=left>For that reason alone it is a really sad day.  It is of extreme 
importance, though, that judges' needs be met. We have to address 
this issue immediately.  I do not know what their needs are.  I 
would like to have a little problem with some of those needs.  I 
do not understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hear about all these difficulties.  Why are we not addressing 
that?  Why are we not standing to talk about those who are 
genuinely suffering out there instead of talking about things 
like this?  It is because we have a greedy Liberal government in 
charge.  It is all yap, yap, yap.  It talks but does not act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It acts all right.  It acts on giving judges raises.  I know 
some fine judges, people who work hard in their profession and 
they deserve to be paid for what they are worth.  But I also know 
what some of these fine judges would say, “why do we not try to 
help out some of these people who are standing in my court every 
day because poverty sent a lot of them there?”.  Why do we not 
do that?  Because it is not in the Liberal philosophy.  They all 
went to university. Most of them are lawyers.  They majored in 
bleeding heart 101 and tear drop 102 and they do not think of 
anything but themselves, so it is difficult for them to 
understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Justice is able to table a copy of the 
commission report but parliament is given no opportunity to 
respond.  This is the reason for my honourable colleague from 
Crowfoot's motion that is coming up next to rectify this 
situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The creation of this commission also provides the federal 
government with, guess what, more opportunities for good old fat 
cat patronage appointments, making more positions available to 
those little boys and girls out there in our wide country who 
have been good little Liberals.  What a sick way to run things. 
It is absolutely pathetic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That member over there talking now and heckling would stand on 
her feet and say is it not a shame we have all these starving 
children.  If it is a shame, she should get up and say cancel 
these things and let us look after the real needs of people 
instead of heckling over whether judges should get pay raises. 
Here we go again, patronage heaven coming back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Liberal philosophy has to go, and the sooner the better. 
<P><A NAME="LINK224"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is a pleasure for me to speak on this motion from my colleagues 
from the Bloc, which I will be supporting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Wild Rose just asked what are the needs of 
these judges.  One judge in Alberta said he should be able to go 
on holiday every year.  That is their need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I ran in the election to represent the people of Calgary 
East they told me I was the custodian of tax dollars. “Remember 
we elected you, we who every day go to work and come home and who 
have not seen a pay raise for a long time, who have a hard time 
putting food on the table”.  They represent small business. 
They represent workers.  The average earnings in my riding are 
not more than $30,000.  Lots will do with less than $17,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am here representing them and therefore I cannot agree to this 
substantial increase that would be granted to judges. The money 
being granted here, as many colleagues of mine have pointed out, 
a $17,000 increase over two years, would feed a lot of families 
in my riding.  A lot of families earn less than that. 
Here we are giving a substantial increase to judges who, by all 
standards, are earning a reasonable and fair wage.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary said it was the right time for such 
an increase.  Is it really the right time for such an increase 
when increases have been frozen and workers have received an 
average increase of 2%?  Here we are proposing increases of 4.1% 
for one year and 4.1% for the second year, which will be 
retroactive.  Nobody is offering retroactive pay to the workers 
who are fighting for an increase.  Why are the judges being 
offered this? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In all aspects, morally and everything else, this substantial 
increase is not, in my view, an acceptable situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague from Wild Rose said, I have a lot of friends who 
are judges.  They do a tremendous job.  My speech is not an 
attack on judges.  What I am talking about here today is this 
reprehensible increase that has been given to judges in such a 
short time.  It is a huge amount of money which will be spent at 
a time when we could better utilize the money for other causes 
which need urgent attention, as my colleague has suggested. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member is right to ask why we are debating this issue. Why 
are we debating in the House of Commons a bill which will give 
Canada's elite, who are already earning a reasonable and fair sum 
of money, an increase that under any normal Canadian circumstance 
is way out of line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also recommends the creation of a judicial compensation 
and benefits commission.  If we are to rely on anything that the 
government has done in the past, we can bet there will be some 
Liberal appointees on that commission.  This is just another 
patronage appointment commission being formed by this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This increase, averaging $13,000, within such a short period of 
time is not a reasonable increase.  It is actually an 
unreasonable increase.  I find it extremely hard to swallow.  If 
I went back to my riding and told working Canadians that I 
approved an increase of $13,000 for judges, they would look at me 
and ask “Where do you live?  Do you live in Canada?  Do you live 
in this riding?  Why are you supporting the elite receiving such 
a substantial sum of money?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all recognize the job the judiciary is doing and the fine 
work the judges are doing and we agree that they should be 
compensated fairly.  Nobody has a quarrel or an argument with 
that, but we certainly do have a major difficulty when it comes 
to such a substantial increase in such a short period of time. 
It should not surprise me that this is coming from a government 
that knows how to compensate its friends and the elite in this 
country.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party would like to reform the appointment process 
for judges by removing the patronage appointment process.  Of 
course the parliamentary secretary, who is sitting over there, 
would not agree with that because she is one of the people who 
proposed these increases for her friends. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party would like to reform the patronage appointment 
process by making it more transparent and publicly accountable. 
If we did that, fair compensation for judges would also become 
transparent.  That is the key.  The most important aspect is that 
compensation for judges should become more transparent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, I will wholeheartedly support Motion No. 1, put 
forward by my colleague from the Bloc, to amend the bill by 
deleting clause 5. 
<P><A NAME="LINK225"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I wish I could say that it is a pleasure for me to rise 
today to address the report stage of Bill C-37, but I must 
confess that following my comments and the comments of others 
when it was before the House for second reading, I had hoped the 
government might rethink this legislation instead of bringing it 
back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I am here to speak to Motion No. 1, which was put forward 
by my colleague from the Bloc Quebecois.  The motion would amend 
Bill C-37 by deleting clause 5.  We have heard previous speakers 
address this particular clause because it is controversial.  I 
certainly feel that it is controversial insofar as it deals 
specifically with an increase in judges' salaries.  It is duly 
noted that judges, on average, make about $140,000 a year.  This 
will amount to an 8.3% increase over the next couple of years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I rose to speak to Bill C-37 the last time it was before 
the House I noted that it was April 1.  I thought it was perhaps 
a cruel April Fool's joke which had been foisted upon the 
Canadian public by the government of this country at a time when 
Canadians were increasingly concerned about judgments that were 
being brought down by the justices of Canada.  Rather than 
debating some of the judgments, which I feel quite confident do 
not carry the judgment of the Canadian people, we find ourselves 
today, as we did on April 1, discussing a very substantial salary 
increase, amongst other things, in Bill C-37. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As other speakers from the opposition have noted, I support the 
motion put forward by the hon. member of the Bloc Quebecois to 
entirely delete clause 5, which would increase judges' salaries, 
at least at this particular time.  As I did at second reading, I 
would draw the comparison for the viewing public at home between 
the salary increases for judges and the more recent salary 
increases that were granted to our RCMP officers.  Those 
increases amounted to a mere 2%, which was retroactive to January 
1, and a subsequent 1% increase on April 1, which, ironically, 
was the day we were debating the second reading stage of this 
bill.  Another .75% will become due to the Mounties on October 1. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The starting salary for a third year constable will go from 
$50,500 to a little better than $52,000.  These are the people 
who every day put their lives on the line to protect society, yet 
we find that in the eyes of this particular government they only 
warrant a small increase. 
The judges, who increasingly are returning violent convicted 
criminals back to the streets, will enjoy this 8.3% increase over 
the next two years.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a number of my colleagues have indicated, I want to put it on 
the record that I am not casting aspersions upon all justices. 
That is not the case.  We had somewhat of a heated debate on 
April 1 when certain members of the government felt that the 
official opposition, the Reform Party, in citing certain examples 
of judgements that have come down were doing exactly that.  I 
want to say at the outset that is not the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been indicated by a number of my colleagues in the Reform 
Party that many of the judges in Canada today, both at the 
provincial and federal level, do great work.  They bring down 
many judgments which carry the confidence of the Canadian people. 
However, unfortunately, a lot of them do not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In referring to this issue today I would like to mention three 
cases that happened either in my riding of Prince George—Peace 
River or very near to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first case I would like to cite is what has become known as 
the Feeney case.  Michael Feeney was convicted of second degree 
murder in the bludgeoning death of 85 year old Frank Boyle in his 
home in Likely, B.C. in June of 1991.  Likely is a small 
community just outside Williams Lake, which is outside my riding. 
Ironically, the lawyer who took the case to the supreme court is 
a lawyer from Prince George, which is in my riding, so I am 
fairly familiar with the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This unfortunate victim was smashed in the head five times with 
a crowbar and his truck and $400 in cash was missing.  RCMP 
officers, following up on a tip that Feeney had been seen near 
the victim's stolen truck, went to Feeney's trailer to 
investigate.  They entered his trailer and found his shirt 
splattered with blood.  Subsequently they arrested Mr. Feeney. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the supreme court judges ruled that the police did not 
have reasonable grounds to arrest Feeney when they entered the 
trailer without a warrant.  All evidence gained as a result of 
the arrest and the subsequent search which was conducted with a 
warrant were ruled inadmissible.  It was a majority decision.  It 
was not unanimous.  The evidence included the bloodied shirt and 
his fingerprints, matching prints which were found on the 
victim's refrigerator, money hidden under a mattress and 
cigarettes similar to those found in the victim's house.  I would 
suggest that it is going to very difficult for the crown counsel 
to obtain a conviction, if it ever goes to retrial, without the 
use of this evidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will draw to the House's attention another case which was 
known as the Sullivan case.  This happened in the city of Prince 
George.  Wayne Richard Sullivan of Prince George was found 
non-criminally responsible by reason of a mental disorder in the 
January 1992 shooting death of his wife and the sexual assault at 
gunpoint of another woman.  After a night of drinking, Sullivan 
proposed a threesome between himself, his wife and the other 
woman.  His proposal was rejected.  He then shot his wife in the 
temple, pointed the gun at the second woman and ordered her to 
remove her clothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The trial judge instructed the jury on the law relating to 
mental illness and criminal responsibility.  The B.C. court of 
appeal judges ruled that the judge was correct in his 
instruction.  The verdict of December 11, 1993 meant that 
Sullivan was confined in a secure mental facility, but 
subsequently would be released once it was determined he was no 
longer mentally disordered.  Sullivan's punishment was a 
conditional release. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That judgment has raised a lot of concern not only in the 
community of Prince George, but in communities across our 
country.  I raise it today as another example of how the 
judgments brought down by our justices certainly do not at all 
relate to what average citizens in our communities would feel is 
right, fair and just.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The last case I would bring forward today is the Baldwin murder. 
Here we have a case of an elderly gent in the city of Dawson 
Creek located in the southern end of my riding of Prince 
George—Peace River.  The elderly gentleman was set upon in a 
park by six local teenagers and kicked and beaten to death.  Six 
local teenagers were charged in the murder of James Baldwin.  Mr. 
Baldwin, a homeless person, had set up camp in the park less than 
a dozen metres from where his body was found. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I guess I am already out of time, unfortunately.  The point I am 
trying to make is that all of these judgments reinforce the view 
of the general public that there is something seriously wrong 
with our justice system.  In fact they do not even refer to it as 
a justice system any more, but a legal system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is pretty hard to defend an 8.3% increase when people see 
these types of judgments coming down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  It is my duty, 
pursuant to Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the 
questions to be raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as 
follows:  the hon. member for Halifax West, Aboriginal affairs; 
the hon. member for Verchères, Varennes Tokamak; the hon. member 
for Sarnia—Lambton, the North American Free Trade Agreement; the 
hon. member for Charlotte, Hepatitis C; and the hon. member for 
Churchill River, the Environment.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
would like to comment on remarks made earlier by the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice and member 
for Ahuntsic, which did not sound right to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, she said that, at the federal level, judicial 
appointments were not political appointments. I will remind her 
that these appointments are made by a committee of seven 
members, four of whom are appointed by the Minister of Justice, 
and that the majority prevails. 
So the minister can make appointments with the support of four 
out of seven committee members, which form a majority since all 
it takes is 50% plus one—as members need to be reminded once in 
a while. Therefore, judicial appointments are political 
appointments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the parliamentary secretary cited some figures on 
Quebec which are not quite accurate. With respect to judges' 
salaries, I will remind her that, when he was elected premier of 
Quebec in 1995, Lucien Bouchard ordered a 6% salary reduction 
for all government employees, including judges. This means that 
judges' salaries have been reduced by 6%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Contrary to what the hon. Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Justice said, and this is my third point, the fact 
that a huge increase—a 13.8% compounded increase over two years—is 
recommended in a report does not means that it must 
automatically be approved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Blais report recommended that the salaries of members of 
Parliament be raised, but everyone on this side of the House 
said no. That is what the report recommended, but we said no. 
Why? 
Because we find it indecent to be talking about raising judges' 
salaries by 13.8% over two years, retroactive to April 1, 1997, 
when, on the other side of the House, since the Minister of 
Finance tabled his second budget, in 1995, there is a plan under 
way to cut back transfer payments to the provinces for welfare, 
post-secondary education and health. 
By 2003, $30 billion will have been taken away from the 
recipients of social assistance, the sick and the students in 
higher education.

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, those on the other side of the House are happy to 
steal an accumulated surplus in the employment insurance fund, 
which will reach $25 billion by the end of next year and which 
comes from the excessive contributions of employers and 
employees.  The Minister of Finance is blithely dipping into it. 
He will continue to take up to $25 billion by the end of fiscal 
year 1998-99. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After all the sacrifices required from the population, all the 
theft from funds that do not belong to the federal government, it 
now wants us to agree to compound salary increases for judges of 
13.8%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find the way the parliamentary secretary put it to us 
indecent, saying that such a monumental increase in judges' 
salary was needed to ensure quality candidates.  With their 
annual salaries between $170,000 and $230,000, I imagine people 
are knocking the doors down in an effort to get a judge's 
position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would remind the House that salary increases are awarded in 
large measure to reflect changes in the cost of living.  The 
cost of living is reflected in the consumer price index, and in 
the past three years the rate of inflation has moved between 2% 
and 1%. 
This means that the 13.8% salary increase given to judges over 
the next two years is 13 times greater than the current 
inflation rate of about 1%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This makes no sense at all. How can we justify such a decision 
to people who have been subjected to indirect tax increases 
totalling $23 billion over the last three years? How can we 
explain to them that, with all the sacrifices they made in the 
areas of social welfare, post-secondary education and health 
care, with the minister having failed to index the tax tables—there 
was an increase in tax receipts, and that is an indirect 
form of tax increase—judges will now be getting a 13.8% 
increase? How can we justify maintaining the status quo while 
judges' salaries will be increased prodigiously, at a compound 
rate? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is totally unacceptable. I add my voice to that of my 
distinguished colleague from Berthier—Montcalm, who did the right 
thing in bringing this scandal to light. 
It makes absolutely no sense to present things in this fashion, 
especially with the kind of arguments we just heard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lucien Bouchard, Premier of Quebec and leader of the Parti 
Quebecois, has understood that. That is why, two or three years 
ago, Quebec ordered a salary decrease rather than a freeze or an 
increase. It is only logical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When one asks people to make sacrifices and makes budget cuts to 
reduce the deficit and create annual surpluses, as the finance 
minister did on the back of the poor, one does not give judges a 
13.8% salary increase. It is totally unacceptable, and we will 
all fight against that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George—Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to speak to Bill C-37.  I would like 
to say right off the bat that I am in absolute opposition to this 
bill as are my colleagues but perhaps for different reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My reasoning is that nowhere in this government's philosophy, 
nowhere in any type of justice legislation it has brought down 
pertaining to judges and the judiciary have I ever seen the word 
accountability. The fact is there is zero accountability for 
judges in this country.  There is no effective mechanism that 
this government or the previous Tory government have put in or 
would be prepared to use to remove judges from the bench. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In many cases in their fuzzy logic they have let violent 
criminals walk out of the courtroom with little or no penalty. 
Judges have used the conditional sentencing law that the Liberal 
government brought down in the most insane ways we could possibly 
imagine.  Judges have continually bewildered our society with 
some of the decisions that have been made in this country. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1640"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT32"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can give the example of something which is near and dear to my 
heart, the issue of people who choose to drink and then to get 
into their cars, drive and kill people.  Judges have a latitude 
of sentencing from zero to 14 years. Historically the sentences 
have been on the low side of three and a half years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no way to hold these judges accountable for the insane 
decisions they make.  Now this government has the audacity to 
bring in Bill C-37 to give them more money.  The insane 
legislation in Bill C-37 takes no back seat to some of the insane 
decisions that are made by the judges in this country. They do it 
and there is no accountability. Before this House begins to even 
consider any type of salary increase or a compensation increase 
for judges, the government had better darn well do what it should 
do.  It should bring in some legislation that will make judges 
accountable before it even considers giving them a single cent 
more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then they have the audacity to suggest an 8.3% increase over two 
years plus they want to talk about annuities, payments and 
survivor benefits.  It is very clear these are the very people 
who are setting the bad guys free after the RCMP have worked 
their butts off to get them to court.  The RCMP are getting 
little or nothing by way of salary increases, the ones who do all 
the work, only to see all their work for naught because the bad 
guys are set free by some judge with some fuzzy logic in his head 
about what his or her definition of justice is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Never in my lifetime would I ever support this package on Bill 
C-37 until there was an ounce of accountability brought in by 
this Liberal government.  Never. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to get off judges for a minute and talk about the way 
this Liberal government deals with the justice system or, as my 
colleague from Prince George—Peace River said quite 
appropriately, the legal system in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All over this country people are upset about the legal system 
and is it any wonder when we look at the Liberals in government 
and the Tories before them.  A good percentage of them were 
lawyers anyway in their past life.  Not their real life; they say 
their past life. Why would they do anything else but support 
their friends who are still in the system out there?  That is 
what they have done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legal system, the so-called justice system we have in this 
country is not doing what it is supposed to do.  It is not 
protecting society.  It is not punishing the bad guys. It is 
feeding the coffers of the legal people who make a very good 
living defending the scoundrels who come before the judges. They 
are very good at it and they charge lots of money. Why would a 
government want to do anything to hurt its buddies out there in 
the legal business? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government should be making the number one priority in the 
criminal justice system the protection of law-abiding citizens 
and the protection of society.  That is what it should be doing. 
The former Minister of Justice, now the disgraced Minister of 
Health, said in this House last year that the number one criteria 
in the justice system is the rehabilitation and reintegration of 
criminals back into society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That made us all sleep well that night. It made Canadians feel 
really good that the Liberal government was looking after the 
safety of their homes, the safety of their streets, the safety of 
their families, the safety of their wives and their husbands.  It 
gave them a really empty feeling inside that they were not living 
in a safe society and they had little hope of it because the 
Liberal government under the former Minister of Justice had no 
concern about the safety of their streets and their families.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Government members would do well to listen to Canadian people 
instead of their lawyer friends out there in legal land.  They 
would do well to get out in the street and talk to the people 
instead of drinking cappuccino with their lawyer buddies in the 
restaurants beside the law courts.  They would do well to listen 
to the real people out there.  If they did they would start to 
address some issues where there is a huge void. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about our prison system.  In case anybody does not 
know, a prison is a place where bad guys go when they are 
incarcerated to pay a penalty for committing crimes.  That is 
what prisons are supposed to be for.  Prisons are not supposed to 
be places where there are prisoners' unions which tell the warden 
what kind of meals or what kind of recreation prisoners should 
have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand that people are not supposed to have drugs in 
prisons.  Safeguards are supposed to be in place to make sure 
drugs do not get into prisons.  Canadians know that many times it 
was the drugs they obtained outside prison that got them into 
prison in the first place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Logic would tell us that if there were no drugs inside the 
prisons people might get better. They might be rehabilitated so 
they could somehow go back into society.  Drugs put them there. 
Liberals have a hard time making that connection: drugs put them 
there so let us give them more drugs so that when they get out 
they will be better citizens.  They do not stop the flow of 
drugs.  They say they will give the poor guys in there clean 
needles so they can use their drugs in a safer fashion and 
condoms so they can have sex— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I fail to see what jails, penitentiaries and everything 
else the hon. member has referred to in the debate have to do 
with the motion before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  The hon. member has the 
floor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Harris:</B>  Madam Speaker, the Liberals hate to hear 
the truth.  I was talking about things that go on in the prisons 
which tie into the judicial system.  Pornography is rampant in 
prisons but according to the Liberals that is okay because 
prisoners need some form of entertainment within the prison 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could never support the bill until the Liberal government put 
some form of accountability into the legislation to deal with the 
insane decisions of some judges.  If the Liberals are serious 
about fixing things in the justice system, why do they not fix 
the things that are wrong and not give the judges more money? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not support the bill.  My colleagues will not support it. 
No one in their right mind— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  The 
hon. member for Thornhill. 
<P><A NAME="LINK228"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Elinor Caplan (Thornhill, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise in today's debate.  Quite honestly I did not plan 
to speak but I was provoked.  I felt it was important not only 
for the constituents in my riding of Thornhill but for people 
across the country listening to the debate to understand what the 
legislation is all about.  We need someone who will speak on the 
topic of the bill and explain to people why the government is 
taking the action it is taking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The independence of our judiciary is important. As a matter of 
principle I believe judges must be independent of political 
interference, and they are.  Those who call for accountability of 
judges should know that accountability is through judicial 
councils which review the work of judges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They cannot have it both ways.  They cannot support the 
principle of judicial independence and at the same time use the 
word accountability in anything other than judicial review of 
judges' decisions.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I stand in my place today to say that I stand for the principle 
of judicial independence.  I believe that judges should be 
accountable through the judiciary.  Those who have complaints can 
go to the judicial council to ask for a review. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to further say that as a second principle I want leaders 
in the legal profession to come forward and apply to be judges. I 
do not want us to have people other than those who have years of 
experience and respect within the profession to have the 
opportunity to apply.  I do not believe there should be a 
financial penalty for people who choose to serve.  Being on the 
bench is a form of public service and I believe they should be 
well paid.  If we want to attract those who are in leadership 
position among the profession, we have to make sure there is no 
deterrent to those who wish to serve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to comment on the issue of courts 
administration.  For the people who are watching and for my 
colleague across the House in the New Democratic Party who spoke 
at length about courts administration I point out that this is 
entirely a provincial jurisdiction.  Courts administration is a 
responsibility of the provinces.  They determine what resources 
they wish to put into courts administration.  Anyone who has 
concerns about that should address their concerns to the attorney 
general of the province they live in or to their premier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since we see many provinces such as my home province of Ontario 
reducing their revenues through tax decreases of some 30%. 
costing in excess of $5 billion, anyone who wants to know where 
the money has gone that could have gone to courts administration, 
improved health care or improved education must look at the 
policy of tax cuts.  Since that is the policy of the Reform Party 
opposite I find it heckles interesting on this matter.  The 
responsibility for courts administration is entirely a provincial 
jurisdiction.  It is inappropriate for us to take time of the 
House discussing matters that are clearly a provincial 
jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding Bill C-37, the facts are that federal judges have not 
received a pay increase since 1992.  They contributed to the 
deficit reduction plan which resulted in the first balanced 
budget in 30 years being tabled this year by the finance 
minister.  That is something I am very proud of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also know that there are provincial judges across the country 
and there were remarks raised about what was happening on the 
provincial scene.  While that is a matter of provincial 
jurisdiction, many of the provinces are adopting the same method 
the federal government has adopted, the establishment of an 
independent commission.  For example, the Province of Quebec at 
the present time has a commission studying judges' salaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My assumption is that if a government establishes a commission 
it will look very carefully at the recommendations of the 
commission.  That is exactly what the federal government did.  We 
established an independent commission to make recommendations to 
the government so that we could ensure we were attracting the 
very best and the brightest, the leaders of the profession, to 
sit on the bench.  They make very important and difficult 
decisions which affect not only public policy but public life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The commission was called the Scott commission.  The government 
accepted its recommendations on pay increases for federally 
appointed judges.  I believe that is appropriate.  It reinforces 
the notion of independence of the judiciary, which was my very 
first point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are to determine salaries it is a very good process to 
engage people who are expert in understanding the role and ask 
them to advise the government. 
They did that and the government took that advice.  While some 
may believe that number is too high, I am sure others believe 
that number is too low.  The government has made the decision to 
accept the compensation recommendations of the Scott commission 
and I believe that is appropriate.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I also believe that the process for the selection of judges is a 
good one.  We have public representatives on the committees who 
review the applications.  There are also consultations with the 
law societies.  Just for the record, I think people watching this 
debate should know that Bill C-37 is supported by the Canadian 
Bar Association. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have those who are aware of the role of judges, how hard 
judges work, not only from the Canadian Bar Association but also 
from an independent commission established to review the matter 
agreeing that the government's action is appropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask those in opposition to think about the implications of 
arbitrarily making decisions without seeking advice from those 
who know like the Canadian Bar Association or an independent 
commission that would review the workload and so forth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My view is that there will always be debate.  Salary issues are 
always contentious.  There are always different points of view, 
but it is a responsibility of government, a responsibility the 
government takes very seriously.  Bill C-37 reflects the 
appropriate balance between judicial independence and the 
obligation of government to set a salary level which will attract 
the very best, the very brightest and leaders in the profession 
to sit on the highest courts of the land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The actions taken by the Minister of Justice are appropriate. 
The legislation deserves support.  Our process in coming to this 
conclusion has been one that has been filled with integrity.  As 
the member for Thornhill I feel it is not only in the public 
interest but in the interest of my constituents in Thornhill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to support the legislation because it responds not 
only to the principles I have articulated but to the needs of the 
judiciary and the judicial system.  That is good public policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those who stand in this place and use this opportunity to 
vent, I think it is completely inappropriate on this type of 
legislation.  We should be talking about how we reward through 
compensation and remuneration those people who sit in judgment on 
the most difficult of subjects frequently and mete out justice in 
a way which is impartial and which should be wise and thoughtful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How do we say to federally appointed judges that we appreciate 
what they do?  On behalf of my constituents of Thornhill I say to 
them that we believe they provide a very important service to the 
people of Canada.  We thank them.  I believe the debate, much of 
what I have heard, is an insult to the judges of Canada.

congratulate my colleague from Berthier—Montcalm.  He is a lawyer 
himself and could become a great judge.  However, he is an MP 
today and represents his fellow citizens as I do mine, and he is 
totally convinced that clause 5 should be deleted.  And that is 
what he is proposing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier it was said that the chief justice of the supreme court 
could have a retroactive increase of $25,000.  Most of the 
people in my riding do not earn $25,000.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When we put poverty insurance on trial here. the members 
opposite laughed. Today these same people are prepared to give 
judges increases.  We are not criticizing judges. We all know 
that judges, some of them at least, are fine judges.  They work 
very hard.  That is a fact, and everyone is aware of it, 
including us.  But that is not what we are talking about today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are saying that, in a society where people suffer, where 
children in certain schools do not eat enough, where parents 
suffer from depression because they run out of money for food at 
the end of the month, everyone should be treated fairly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a person earns $150,000 a year, I think he or she can 
manage to buy groceries, to go to hospital, to buy prescription 
drugs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a person earns $15,000 or $20,000, that is something 
different.  In my riding I have seen many forestry workers who 
start work at 5 a.m. and finish at 5 p.m.; they work for four or 
five months a year and, even with poverty insurance, do not 
manage to earn more than $25,000 or $28,000.  They have 
children, and it is hard for them to manage their budget and 
meet the needs of every family member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now they are proposing to raise judges' salaries by an average 
of $17,000. Tell that to the people in my riding of 
Matapédia—Matane. This is unacceptable. A little raise, fine, but 
this one makes no sense.  I am therefore asking my colleagues on 
the other side of this House to reflect on this and to accept 
deletion of clause 5.  I think everyone stands to gain as a 
result. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure that the judges themselves, those who are really not 
in it for the money, but to serve their fellow citizens, will 
understand that the House is not giving them the increase 
recommended by the commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, it must be realized that a lot of lawyers put 
their names on the waiting list.  They know what their salaries 
will be and what conditions they will be working in.  If they 
really need more money, let them stay in private practice and 
leave room for others, for there are many interested in the 
position.  Money must always be secondary, it must never come 
first.

I rise today to say that I will be voting against Bill C-37 and 
that I will be supporting this amendment from my Bloc colleague. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think the government is in touch with the average 
Canadian. It is not listening to what Canadians feel about this 
issue.  If it were it would not bring in a bill like this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to share this afternoon three reasons why the government 
is out of touch with the Canadian public and three reasons why 
the Canadian public does not support this kind of wage increase 
at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Liberals were truly in touch with the grassroots of this 
country they would be hearing what we are hearing when we go back 
to our ridings about the desperate needs of Canadians in the 
areas of health care, education and crime prevention.  These are 
all very serious issues and priority issues that face Canadians 
today.

<A HREF="#LINKT37"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are telling us as parliamentarians that we have to get 
back in touch with the priorities, the most important things that 
concern them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They see the federal government, as it has over the past number 
of years, continuing to cut back on the amount of money going to 
the provinces.  In turn, the provinces have a smaller amount of 
money to put into important areas like health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members should talk to a person who has stood in line for over a 
year for an operation, or talk to parents who need to have bingos 
to raise funds for things in the classrooms, or talk to victims 
who have been caught in some of these consequences of serious 
crimes being committed. Those are the Canadians who are asking 
why in the world we would give money to judges who are making 
$177,000 a year already when we do not have money to put into 
those priority concerns that certainly all Canadians are worried 
about across this nation.  It does not make sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are angry about this.  We as parliamentarians need to 
remember that it does not really matter what we think about these 
issues here in the House.  This is not the court that settles the 
issue.  It is the court of public opinion that settles the issue. 
Come election time they will let us know how they feel about 
this and other issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have another concern about something like this.  The 
government is sending the wrong message to law enforcement 
officers, the men and women on the frontlines defending us 
against the criminal element every day. They are the ones who 
have to do the dirty work for us.  They are the ones who have to 
clean up the messes that are made by crime and criminals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a lot of angry police officers out there who are 
looking at the 8.3% wage increase for judges while members of the 
RCMP have had a five year moratorium on their wages.  When they 
finally got the government to act on it what did they get?  They 
got a pittance.  These are the people who are actually out there 
on the firing line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this government wants to continue to drive the wedge between 
those who are actually law enforcement and those who are sitting 
on the benches meting out the law, then this kind of legislation 
does that even more.  It makes law enforcement officers angry. It 
increases their frustration of the inability of judges in many 
cases to actually bring the full extent of the law against the 
criminals these law enforcement agents are working so hard to 
apprehend and bring to court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the election and after I have had law enforcement 
officers tell me about their frustration of working so hard to 
bring the criminals to the courts and then the criminals get off 
on a technicality or are given a soft sentence.  That is not 
right and Canadians know that is not right.  There is a 
frustration and anger against some judges who do this sort of 
thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We now come to this House to give those judges a raise.  The 
Canadian people are not happy with our giving them that kind of 
raise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>RCMP officers finally received a 2% raise retroactive to January 
1, 1998.  They will receive a second increment of 1% on April 1, 
1998 and an additional .75% in October 1998.  What does that add 
up?  If my math is correct, it will be 3.5% over two years.

</I></B></P><P align=left>What are the judges going to receive?  A supreme court justice's 
salary will go from $208,200 a year to $225,700 by April 1, 1998. 
I do not think the Canadian people think that is just. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before anyone on the other side says I am against judges, that 
is not the case at all.  We know there are many good judges who 
do fine work and work long hours to do their work well.  We 
commend them for the work they do.  But in this present economic 
climate when most Canadians are not receiving an increase at all 
in their wages or at the most the wage increase is indexed to 
inflation, this kind of obscene raise does not sit well with 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not sit well with us in the Reform Party. It obviously 
does not sit well with my colleagues in the Bloc.  I am happy our 
Bloc colleague brought this motion to the floor because it needs 
to be debated.  The government's legislation needs to be 
challenged and I want to serve notice that I will be voting with 
my Bloc colleagues in support of this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that when we do this there will be a chorus of Canadians 
across the country saying we voiced their concerns in the House 
of Commons today and they will be supportive of where we as 
opposition members stand. 
<P><A NAME="LINK231"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, it is 
a privilege for me to enter the debate on this Bloc motion to 
delete from the proposed bill clause 5.  I will be supporting 
this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to address a couple of the points made by one of my 
Liberal colleagues opposite.  She made the point that we want 
judicial independence so that it stands clear and will interpret 
and apply the law in the way that the legislators of this country 
both federal and provincial intended it to be enforced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could not agree more. I think we all agree on the independence 
of the judiciary. I think we want to commend those people. I 
think we want to recognize them for what they are.  In order for 
them to do that and to have the kind of respect we want them to 
enjoy, they must be competent and able and must demonstrate solid 
judgment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of judges fit into that category.  Not all of them do. 
But the important thing to recognize is that we want competence. 
We want to trust our judges.  We want to depend on them.  We want 
them to interpret the law as it ought to be interpreted. Where we 
have difficulty is when judges decide that what they think about 
the law is more important than what the House thinks the law is 
to be.  We have difficulty when judges think they can write the 
law for Canadians, when they can reinterpret what the House of 
Commons said and when they can tell the House of Commons this is 
what we should be doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is when the judges have stepped outside their independence. 
They have now taken over a position they had no business taking 
over. Let us never forget that a judge is a servant of the people 
to preserve the justice of the nation, to ensure the laws are 
applied fairly and with the intention and the spirit within which 
legislation was passed. Judges should not tamper with the sacred 
right of the people and the responsibility the people have given 
to them to represent their interests, to make sure the safety and 
the justice of the people are preserved. That is a point we must 
underline. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This raises the point of how a judge is appointed. The process 
of appointing a judge in Canada today leaves a lot to be desired. 
We want to appoint people who have demonstrated that they can be 
wise in their judgement, who have the courage to take on very 
difficult situations and ensure the principles of justice, 
fairness and righteousness apply in the administration of that 
justice. 
To do that means we have to step completely outside of patronage 
appointments.  We must have a process that guarantees that. 
Unfortunately the process we have today does not guarantee this 
kind of independence.  How can we expect to have an independent 
judiciary if the process itself is not one that guarantees or at 
least has the potential of bringing forward those people who are 
competent and who have demonstrated they can be trusted?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That bring us into the actual provision of this motion, the 
elimination of clause 5, which means to give to the judges a 
retroactive pay raise of 4.1% and another in the year following 
of 4.1%, a total of about 8.3% from the salary base from which 
they have come today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My concern is not that judges are going to get a raise.  They 
deserve to be adequately compensated.  But it has to take place 
in the context of what else is happening in our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I draw attention to the context within which this proposal is 
being brought forward.  My hon. colleague has just talked about 
the RCMP having received a pittance.  Perhaps it is a pittance 
but it is what it is.  Let me refresh our memories as to what it 
is.  On March 27, 1998 RCMP officers secured a pay raise of 2% 
retroactive to January 1998.  They received a second increment on 
April 1 of another 1% and an additional .75% in October 1998. 
That is not exactly a pittance but it does not even come close to 
what is being proposed for the judges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at what the officers do for us.  They are the ones 
who are at the front line, who are there to detect the criminal 
and try to find out who committed the crime and to do what is 
necessary to bring that criminal to justice.  Those officers did 
not get the kind of raise they deserve.  If they did, the judges 
should receive something similar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More important is a totally different issue.  The government has 
decided in Bill C-3 to deny the police officers who are to 
enforce the law one of the basic fundamental tools in order to 
detect who actually committed the crime, to make sure the 
identification is accurate.  We are talking about DNA samples. 
They ought to be given that kind of authority, the tool that 
allows them to unequivocally determine who was at the scene of 
the crime.  That is one area of the context, but there is another 
one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently the Minister of Justice provided a fund of $32 million 
for crime prevention.  It is a wonderful, noble idea to prevent 
crime.  It is excellent.  But what happened? Did any 
municipality, any province receive any additional fund so that it 
could apply and get the people out there to enforce the law?  No. 
Should we prevent crime as much as possible?  Yes we should, but 
we are not enforcing the law as well as we could and the police 
are not able to do their job simply because in many instances 
there are not enough of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me tell the House why there are not enough of them. Even if 
we could use all the RCMP officers for crime detection, that 
would be one thing, but the government in its wisdom passed Bill 
C-68 which establishes a firearm registration.  Who has to 
administer the registration of all these firearms? The police. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is that their primary function?  Will that help them detect 
crime?  Will that help them to make our society safer?  Will that 
help them to bring to justice the people who have killed others, 
who have committed violent crimes? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not a small amount of money, $133.7 million per year 
estimated by the director of the new firearms registration unit. 
Where is the logic in all this?  That is our context. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can go one step further.  We can go to the Young Offenders 
Act.  We have been told for almost two years now there will be 
new legislation.  What did we get?  A proposal. Put that in 
context.  It begins to look a little strange.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the RCMP officers getting a raise.  We have civil 
servants getting a raise.  We have other people in our private 
sector getting a raise.  None of them are getting a raise 
anywhere close to what is being proposed for the judges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the people we want to administer the law, to enforce 
the law, to pass judgment on criminals that is fair, just and 
righteous.  Then we turn around and say they are in a special 
class and deserve more money than anyone else. If we really want 
to listen to the people, we should be doing things that are fair 
and equitable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have created a special class of people who deserve a raise 
over and above what anyone else is getting.  I want to raise a 
point that has to do with the definition of spouse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very interesting that this legislation says a surviving 
spouse in relation to a judge includes a person of the opposite 
sex who has co-habited with a judge in a conjugal relationship 
for at least one year immediately before the judge's death. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very interesting that this definition is different from 
the one that recently came out of the appeals court defining 
spouse.  For judges a spouse is a partner of the opposite sex. 
It is interesting that we have that kind of definition here and 
we have another definition for the rest of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What will happen now?  Is an appeals court going to say this act 
is ultra vires or are we going to change the other legislation? 
It is fascinating that we have these kinds of things in 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I propose to the government that it take this bill back, rethink 
the whole thing and figure out something that makes sense to 
Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it is indeed a pleasure to speak on Bill C-37.  I think 
the public would find it very interesting to know that this is 
not the first time, not the second time but the third time that 
the government has revisited the Judges Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we have issues such as victim rights, health care, 
aboriginal issues, economic issues to deal with, this government 
has tied up this House for the third time through committees to 
deal with the Judges Act.  Why? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is costing the taxpayers tens of thousands of dollars to deal 
with this act when we have people out there, as my colleague from 
Nanaimo—Cowichan mentioned, who cannot even get health care, 
when we have a judicial system that is clogged up, that denies 
justice to people, where justice has been absent for too long. 
The government has failed to take the bull by the horns and 
address these issues in a substantive and meaningful way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even with the Judges Act it had an opportunity to get it right. 
Instead of dealing with the substantive issue of putting 
accountability back in the system, transparency, scrutiny, we 
have the same old system where the prime minister appoints the 
people he or she sees fit to the Supreme Court of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not what we want.  That is not what the public wants. It 
can be done. It is possible to enter accountability into the 
judicial system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can look at California.  California has introduced elected 
judges. Judges can be elected.  They run every six years.  They 
do not run in the traditional sense as we run but they run on 
their record.  They are forbidden to actually campaign.  The 
purity of the system is that the judges are judged by their 
peers, by the public, on their record alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this way judicial independence can continue.  It is very 
important in a democracy.  I would ask that if the government is 
going to revisit the Judges Act again, heaven forbid, that it 
consider this a substantive and positive issue rather than 
tinkering around with issues that have very little meaning or 
impact on the Canadian people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other things we could have done. 
It has been intelligently proposed that lower court judges come 
under scrutiny in provincial or federal legislatures by the 
judicial justice committee.  This would provide some element of 
scrutiny as to the qualifications of the individuals concerned. 
This would be a reasonable and cost effective way of ensuring 
that judges are the best we can attain and are not merely 
buddy-buddy with the political elites.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other issues that can be dealt with and should be 
dealt with and the government has failed to do this with our 
justice system.  I will present some of the challenges and some 
of the solutions the government can tear apart and make better 
for the benefit of all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first thing is to streamline the judicial system which is 
getting clogged up.  We have a system right now where there are 
ways in which a person can go through the courts for an 
extraordinarily long period of time while the victims wait in 
earnest to try to find some end to the situation they are in, 
some end to their victimization.  This could be done if a 
committee were formed to find effective ways to expedite the 
judicial system from arrest to conviction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A DNA databank should be put forth that is effective, cost 
effective and based on the good science we have which would 
enable the police force to have the tools and power to arrest and 
convict those who are guilty in an expeditious way but also 
enable them to exonerate those individuals who are innocent.  The 
DNA databank cuts both ways.  It will be a good decider in trying 
to differentiate between those individuals who are guilty and 
those individuals who are innocent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to put justice back in the justice system.  Justice 
delayed is justice denied.  Now we have a system where we have 
enormous delays and procedural influences that can be put forward 
by clever lawyers who can clog the system for the benefit of 
their client.  The judicial system today and the wars that take 
place within our courts have little to do with justice and 
everything to do with how clever and able lawyers are to 
manipulate a legal system that has more to do with how you can 
manipulate the system than whether justice is truly being served. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometimes I wish I were a lawyer so I could put forth some 
suggestions.  I would implore those who are in the judicial 
system today who feel frustrated about the system they labour 
under and who want the best for their clients and the Canadian 
people to present those solutions to members from all party lines 
in this House so they can work to develop better solutions so 
that those individuals who are working in the courts are able to 
work more effectively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Give the tools to the police.  They are hamstrung in so many 
ways and they are getting increasingly frustrated as they put 
their lives on the line to make our streets safe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I applaud the minister for putting forth her suggestions on 
crime prevention.  A Reform motion was passed in the House of 
Commons that called for a national headstart program. That was 
supported by everybody but the Bloc.  The minister could use her 
resources and power and call together in Ottawa her provincial 
counterparts in human resources, justice and health. The minister 
could put on the table all the programs today, take out what is 
not working and keep what is working. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This could be integrated with the medical community, train 
mentor volunteers in the middle, as was done effectively in 
Hawaii.  Child abuse was reduced by 99%. We could use schools and 
the educational system for children between the ages of four and 
eight, use the parents and integrate them into the system. We 
would have a headstart crime prevention package that would be the 
most effective way to decrease crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know criminal behaviour in many cases results from a 
fractured psyche that is a result of situations of child abuse, 
violence, sexual abuse, improper parenting, absence of proper 
parenting, and improper nutrition.  A combination of all these 
during that sensitive first eight years of life fractures the 
development of the psyche and causes future problems, everything 
from personality disorders to conduct disorders and sometimes

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.)</B> moved that Bill 
C-366, an act to amend the Income Tax Act (deduction of 
mechanics' tool expenses), be read the second time and referred to 
a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Madam Speaker, I am absolutely delighted today to have 
the opportunity to speak on behalf of the 100,000 or so Canadian 
mechanics who pretty much keep our world turning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most little children by the time they are two or three years old 
have figured out that wheels make the world go round.  Wheels get 
things moving and keep them moving.  Anyone who has watched a 
child grow up would realize that at a very early age they figure 
out that engines make cars, trucks and airplanes move. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The private members' bill which I have prepared and presented 
and on which I speak today is about keeping engines on which we 
depend so much moving.  More specifically Bill C-366 is dedicated 
to the mechanics or technicians who assemble, maintain and repair 
the cars, trucks, heavy equipment, recreation equipment, 
airplanes, trains and items of convenience which add so much to 
enriching our lives every day. If anyone has any doubt about that 
they should just ask their 16-year old son or daughter who has 
just received their driver's licence what their wheels mean to 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every one of us depends on the work mechanics do every day of 
our lives.  We depend on them to keep the wheels turning so that 
we can go to and from work. We depend on their work to keep the 
wheels turning so that we can get our groceries delivered from 
the supermarket, go to the hospital, bring our families together, 
grow our food and so much more.  Now because of unfair tax 
treatment we may well face a shortage of mechanics which may keep 
us waiting for all of these things. The passage of legislation as 
outlined in Bill C-366, an act to amend the Income Tax Act, 
deduction of mechanics' tool expenses, could help to ensure that 
this does not happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since introducing Bill C-366 in March I have received over 6,000 
letters of support for this bill. I am sure many members of the 
House have received letters of support as well.  The letters are 
from mechanics, from various types of motor vehicle dealers and 
from many other companies and organizations involved in the 
automotive industry, with heavy equipment, any kind of equipment 
that requires mechanics to maintain and repair to keep them on 
the road or in the air. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have received many thousands of letters from mechanics from 
every province, from British Columbia to Newfoundland. These 
people are frustrated that even though mechanics are required to 
spend huge amounts on purchasing tools to get and keep a job, 
they are not receiving a tax deduction for these costs. 
As a result there is a growing shortage of mechanics, a problem 
that will increasingly affect all Canadians who own or lease 
vehicles or any equipment for that matter.

<A HREF="#LINKT43"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will explain what this bill does.  Bill C-366 amends the 
Income Tax Act to allow mechanics to deduct the cost of providing 
the tools for their employment if they are required as a 
condition of employment.  The deduction encompasses maintenance, 
rental and insurance costs, the full cost of tools purchased for 
under $200, inflation adjusted, and the capital cost allowance 
for tools over $200. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During my presentation I will explain what my bill would do if 
implemented.  I will demonstrate the broad support for this 
change.  I will explain how this more than anything else is an 
issue of tax fairness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is necessary for several reasons.  First there is the 
investment needed to get and keep a job.  To get and keep a job, 
mechanics must invest an average of $15,000 in tools.  Some may 
invest as much as $40,000.  We have heard from some of these 
people.  They must make annual replacement purchases of up to 
$1,000.  For example, the purchase of diagnostic hand tools which 
are required to work on anything newer than a mid-1980s vehicle 
would cost between $1,000 to $1,500.  Regular upgrading of 
software for these tools alone may cost $300 a year.  This amount 
is disproportionate in comparison with amounts in other employee 
groups that are required to provide their tools as a condition of 
employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The extent of this expense is exacerbated by the relatively 
modest wage level of mechanics.  The average income for mechanics 
in Canada today is $29,000 a year.  Clearly this kind of extra 
expense without the corresponding tax deduction is a great 
burden.  If anyone needs convincing of this I will quote from a 
few of the letters I have received from mechanics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Blair McKinnon, a mechanic from Lloydminster, Alberta said “A 
mechanic without tools is like a secretary without computer 
skills.  Presently, I have about $7,000 in tools.  To move up in 
my career, in two years the amount would double.  As technology 
changes, tools change at my expense.  The tool becomes a special 
tool and the price goes up”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Eddie Sagal, president of Sagal Brothers Sales Limited, Moose 
Jaw, Saskatchewan said “I am the New Holland dealer in Moose 
Jaw, Saskatchewan.  I employ about 10 service technicians, 
depending on the vagaries of business.  These technicians have a 
great deal of money tied up in their tools.  They can easily have 
$10,000 invested in a starter kit, while most have $15,000 to 
$20,000 worth of tools.  They have to buy these tools themselves 
and they need them for their employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Jay Sinclair of Clandonald, Alberta said “I have been in the 
automotive trade for seven years now and plan to continue for 
several more.  I have purchased approximately $8,000 in new 
tools, not including replacements.  Due to the rise of 
electronics in newer vehicles, not only is there a call for more 
specialized tools but also more costs in the necessary tools. I 
feel it is unfair that the trade that requires the most tools 
purchased to stay employed is not considered as an expense on an 
income tax form.  I know my employer does not adjust my wage or 
any others due to the purchasing of tools”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We clearly have a problem:  low wages combined with the high 
cost of purchasing tools which is not deductible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a tax fairness issue.  In its prebudget report in 
December 1997 the House of Commons finance committee stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Committee believes that all Canadian employees should be 
allowed to deduct from their income the cost of large mandatory 
employment expenses.  Special provisions in the Income Tax Act 
already apply to artists, chain saw operators and musicians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To deny this tax treatment to apprentices and technicians in the 
automotive industry is not only unfair, it also imposes an 
impediment to employment, especially for the young who might 
choose to work as apprentices.  Revising the tax treatment of 
such expenses would remove the impediment that exists under the 
present tax rules. 
</UL>

<A HREF="#LINKT44"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is from the finance committee.  It fully supports this 
move. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, this legislation is also completely consistent with the 
treatment of others, for example, small business people, 
including farmers and other independent business people.  Farmers 
can claim for maintenance, rental, insurance and the full cost of 
tools under $200 and a capital cost allowance of tools over $200. 
That is what I used as the model for this bill.  The mechanism 
for handling this is already in the tax system.  This change will 
clearly make the system more fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it not funny, is it not interesting that with this government 
and with this finance minister tax fairness always means an 
increase in taxation.  Tax fairness always seems to mean a tax 
hike.  This is one case where tax fairness should mean less taxes 
for mechanics who need to have this tax deduction available to 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, referring to some of these letters that I received on the 
issue of tax fairness, I will quote Richard Gauthier, president 
of the Canadian Automobile Dealers Association “The Canadian 
Automobile Dealers Association was disappointed that the 1998 
federal budget did not provide technicians with the tax changes 
that they deserve.  We will continue to work with all 
stakeholders to ensure that equity and fairness is restored to 
the Income Tax Act by providing technicians the ability to deduct 
the cost of their tools as an employment expense”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ross Ulmer, the general manager of Ulmer Chev Olds in 
Lloydminster said “Every journeyman mechanic is required to have 
from $8,000 to $15,000 of owned tools in order to continue their 
trade.  Most other professions, from musicians through plumbers 
and doctors, which require this amount of investment to continue 
their profession have tax incentives to allow them to deduct 
capital cost allowance on those items that are essential to the 
employment in their profession. These men and women are not 
asking for a break to take advantage of the tax system; they are 
simply asking for fair consideration given most other Canadians 
in similar circumstances”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a whole stack of other people I could refer to, but 
obviously I do not have time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third issue is the shortage of skilled mechanics.  The 
automotive industry is predicting that the lower enrolment rates 
in apprenticeship programs combined with high attrition rates in 
the existing workforce will soon place the industry in a severe 
shortage of skilled labour.  Because employers require mechanics 
to supply their tools and because of the size of the required 
investment, it is difficult for young graduate mechanics to enter 
the labour market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can we really take a chance on allowing the wheels to stop? Many 
say no, including the House of Commons finance committee. The 
finance committee has stated that allowing mechanics to deduct 
the costs of their tools would increase enrolment rates in 
apprenticeship programs and would reduce what the industry 
considers to be a severe shortage of skilled labour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With youth unemployment as high as it is and the fact that there 
is a real shortage of skilled mechanics, talented young Canadians 
should be able to see a career in the automotive industry.  It is 
unfortunate a change which could be made by this government will 
not be put in place to ensure that this can happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will quote from a letter I received from Ken Myhre, president 
of the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology. 
He says that students who enter the automotive programs at the 
Southern Alberta Institute of Technology and other technical 
institutes in Canada face a significant outlay in tool costs as a 
part of their training program.  Only when fairness is restored 
to these new entrants in the workforce will we see the 
technicians needed to meet Canada's workforce in the automotive 
sector.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers and other businessmen and workers employed as artists, 
musicians and chainsaw operators can claim their tools.  They are 
deductible.  Obviously mechanics should be able to do so.  The 
frustration felt by mechanics across the country is highlighted 
by the fact that I have received well over 6,000 letters in 
support of the bill in about two months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-366 gives mechanics fair tax treatment and in so doing 
helps to reverse the shortage of skilled labour in the automotive 
industry and other industries requiring mechanics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I conclude with a quote from a letter by Sandy Warrington of 
Paradise Valley, Alberta, who is writing on behalf of her son 
Scott who has just completed his apprentice motor mechanic papers 
after four years.  Four years ago when she and her son went to 
the office in Vermilion they were warned that as a parent she 
would have to help support Scott since as a starting mechanic he 
could not afford to buy his tools.  No kidding.  That was the 
understatement of the year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will get five minutes at the end of this hour to wrap u[.  I 
am looking forward to hearing the members who will speak on the 
bill. 
<P><A NAME="LINK237"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for Lakeland 
for providing an opportunity to address the issue of making 
mechanics tools deductible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On a personal level I inform the member that I am certainly 
quite familiar with the issue.  I have met on several occasions 
with the Canadian Automobile Dealers Association that has 
consistently raised concern regarding deductibility of tools as 
well as with individuals in my own constituency who own 
dealerships and employ mechanics that find themselves in this 
situation.  They have also been very effective in advocating the 
case for the deductibility of tools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also assure my hon. colleagues that the government has been 
working on this issue and has found the interventions made by 
mechanics, their related associations and members of parliament 
to be quite helpful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having expressed our willingness to find solutions that will 
assist mechanics with regard to this issue, I want to spend a few 
moments outlining where some of the difficulties need to be 
addressed with respect to Bill C-366. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tax recognition generally is not available for work related 
employee expenses because employers normally provide the items 
required for employees to perform their duties.  While this is 
true as a general rule, individuals in some occupations including 
mechanics incur substantial expenses as a condition of 
employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, mechanics are not the only occupation that incurs 
substantial expenses as a requirement of employment.  Other 
expenditures for which tax recognition might be sought include 
personal computers purchased by employees, reading material, 
professional journals, business clothing, uniforms and 
construction safety clothing, home office expenses, and tools for 
employee trades persons, just to name a few. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Due to these realities we must look at adopting a more all 
encompassing approach than is proposed by the bill if we are to 
be able to be justified in providing the requested tax relief for 
mechanics.  Any change in the tax treatment of employee equipment 
expenses would need to address all employee expenses incurred as 
a requirement of employment in a fair and consistent manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This private member's bill would also provide tax relief to all 
mechanics irrespective of the size of their expenditures instead 
of targeting relief to those incurring extraordinary expenses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also a number of other issues which this private 
member's bill fails to consider that must be addressed before 
such a measure could actually be implemented. For example, 
provisions would need to be developed to ensure that tax relief 
is provided only for those items genuinely required as a 
condition of employment and not for those purchased for personal 
use.  I am sure all members of the House would agree a tax 
deductibility or tax expenditure for personal use items would not 
be something they would support.

<A HREF="#LINKT46"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given this consideration, providing full tax recognition as 
proposed by the bill would be unwarranted.  The provisions needed 
to address these issues would inevitably be complex as they would 
need to account for a large variety of items for which tax 
recognition may be claimed and the different work situations in 
which such items are used. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To put the problem in context, consider the expensive provisions 
needed to ensure the equitable recognition of automobile 
expenses.  Provisions governing the deductibility of employee 
equipment expenditures would apply to hundreds of disparate items 
and numerous occupations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to take the appropriate amount of time and consultation. 
Some of that consultation has taken place with respect to the 
prebudget consultations in the finance committee which, as the 
hon. member so rightly pointed out, recommended this item be 
consider.  We need consultation with respect to the affected 
sectors and to work through how such a tax deduction might work, 
minimizing its complexity while providing effective relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of what I have discussed it is clear that the 
government is serious about undertaking further studies on this 
matter so that a just and workable solution can be found for 
mechanics, taxpayers and the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to restate that the intent is one that would provide tax 
recognition not only for mechanics but for all those occupations 
that may find themselves in the same situation as the situation 
of mechanics described by my colleague across the way that have 
to make substantial expenditures and are not able to deduct them 
because they are employees and are not incorporated 
organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue is one that the government will continue to work on. 
The interventions today by the hon. member are helpful in 
assisting the government to continue to pursue the issue.  We 
will continue to speak with associations like the Canadian 
Automobile Dealers Association which has made numerous 
interventions, which I am sure has consulted with the hon. member 
across the way, and which has spoken with the department and 
myself in particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are continuing to work on the issue.  I thank the member 
opposite for bringing this important issue to the floor of the 
House for debate.  I also thank him for the work he has done on 
the bill so far.  I assure him and other members of the House 
that we will continue to work together to address the issue in a 
meaningful way.  I say this in a non-partisan fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I noticed in his opening remarks the hon. member was somewhat 
partisan, but I assure him we want to ensure the issue is dealt 
with in the most effective way, one that would reduce complexity, 
ensure efficiency and be in the best interest of the taxpayers, 
the government and the particular sectors that may be affected by 
it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles-A. Perron (Saint-Eustache—Sainte-Thérèse, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am speaking today to the bill of the Reform member 
for Lakeland, Alberta, which is aimed at allowing mechanics to 
deduct the cost of tools they have to buy for their work from 
their taxable income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to speak to this bill, which affects one of the 
most important industrial sectors of our economy, the automotive 
industry.  As we all know, the automotive industry is constantly 
evolving, in order to meet new challenges and to keep its 
dominant position in our economy, which is of considerable 
advantage to all Canadians and all Quebeckers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this sector, independent business alone employs more than 
150,000 automotive maintenance and repair professionals.  There 
has been much debate about some major issues in the automotive 
industry, and now it is time to address the matter of the 
automotive maintenance and repair professionals, who are 
required as a condition of employment to purchase their tools 
and to maintain them in perfect condition, not to mention that 
they need to insure them as well.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a heavy financial burden because, on top of the normal 
wear and tear, technological progress also forces these 
technicians to continually update their equipment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An apprentice automotive technician who is starting out must 
spend between $2,000 and $5,000 to purchase the tools he needs 
for his trade.  That same technician, who could not start work 
without a set of up to date and well maintained tools, will have to 
spend over $15,000 on tools in his first 5 to 10 years.  If he 
specializes this could be as huge a sum as $30,000 to $40,000. 
This is far from peanuts, and justifies a tax deduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that level of work related expenses, there is no risk of 
creating a precedent, since this tax treatment is already 
applied to farm producers, forestry workers, artists and 
musicians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Needless to say that the high cost of this kind of equipment 
accounts for the current shortfall in automotive service 
technicians, which is a major impediment to young people 
entering that field. That is not right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance is aware of the problem, since he 
recently wrote to me, saying “While some workers do incur 
extraordinary expenses in their jobs, finding a solution remains 
difficult”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since he recognizes that these are extraordinary expenses, the 
logical next step is to apply extraordinary deductions. That is 
the only solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, there is food for thought for our finance and revenue 
ministers here. 
Here is an field of work which must not be overlooked for our 
young people, especially knowing how high youth unemployment is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government must look at this problem very seriously. It must 
not argue that granting this deduction to mechanics would lead 
other trades to demand similar deductions. As I said, mechanics 
incur enormous costs buying tools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Work tools are works tools, be they the virtuoso's violin, the 
lumberman's chainsaw or the mechanic's numerous tools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me reiterate at this time the purpose of Bill C-366. First 
of all, the bill seeks to ensure that mechanics benefit from the 
same fair tax treatment as farm producers, one in line with the 
treatment of chainsaw operators, artists and musicians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, it seeks to relieve mechanics of the financial burden 
that is imposed upon them since they are required to buy their 
own tools under their terms of employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, the bill seeks to alleviate the serious shortage of 
labour in automotive trades: enrolments in apprenticeship 
programs will be on the rise and an increasing number of 
mechanics will be able to continue working in this field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, it seeks to create jobs for young unemployed Canadians 
and Quebeckers, since talented young people will become aware of 
the fact that a career in automotive trades is affordable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fifth, it is intended to allow mechanics to continue to provide 
the usual level and quality of vehicle maintenance and repair 
services, which will benefit all car owners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all these reasons, I think this bill is good for the economy 
and for the creation of jobs. 
The Bloc Quebecois and myself support the measures proposed in 
this bill.

pleased to take part in the debate on Bill C-366, an act to amend 
the Income Tax Act to provide a deduction for mechanics' tool 
expenses.  I want to congratulate the member for Lakeland for 
bringing this legislation forward and to tell him and members of 
the House that the New Democratic Party caucus fully supports 
this concept and we will be supporting this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree, for the most part, with the parliamentary secretary 
that this is a non-partisan issue and to that effect note that 
this is not the first time such a bill has been presented in this 
Chamber.  On many occasions, in fact, members of parliament have 
proposed amending the act in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Joy Langan, a former distinguished member of this caucus from 
British Columbia, who we talked about earlier today with respect 
to the breast implant issue, had a private member's bill back in 
1992 which dealt with this topic and proposed the same amendments 
to the act.  In addition, in 1992 the member from Manitoba, who 
I believe is currently the parliamentary secretary responsible 
for western diversification, among other things, put this issue 
before the House.  The last attempt was made in 1996. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also interesting to note that my colleague, the member for 
Qu'Appelle, back in February tabled a similar piece of 
legislation to allow workers to deduct the cost of providing 
tools for their employment.  That particular bill addressed the 
unfairness and injustice inflicted by the current tax system on 
workers required to provide tools as a condition of employment. 
In the case of mechanics, for example, the current tax system 
does not take into account that just to get into the trade, as 
has been noted by others, a mechanic needs $5,000, $15,000 or 
$30,000 worth of tools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Qu'Appelle noted that we have seen the benefits 
of allowing artists, musicians and others to deduct the cost of 
supplies and equipment and it is high time that we extend similar 
tax treatment to include the tools of all trades persons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened intently to the parliamentary secretary.  I heard him 
say that there are some difficulties.  Tax recognition is not 
generally available for specific groups.  We need an 
all-encompassing approach.  He noted that he and his government 
would be seriously undertaking further studies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sincerely hope that is the case.  It is high time that we did 
something about this issue.  It is a non-partisan approach, 
although I am reminded of the old Irish proverb “You can vote 
for whomever you like, but the government always gets elected”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope this government will act seriously on this particular 
bill.  To that end, I remind the House and anyone who happens to 
be listening that government members opposite are taking a lot of 
credit for having balanced the books and working on debt 
reduction.  But on whose backs were those books balanced?  I 
would suggest that it was not on the backs of the captains of 
industry or the big banks.  It was on the backs of ordinary 
Canadians who got hit with higher taxes, surtaxes and higher user 
fees.  I think it is time to acknowledge the debt that is owed to 
those people and to repay them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the ways that the government could accomplish that is by 
look seriously at helping ordinary folks who incur heavy costs to 
go to work every day and, as the member for Lakeland noted, make 
the wheels of this country turn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the present tax system the favourable treatment of tools 
and supplies is subject to two conditions. 
First, tools supplied must be a prerequisite of employment. 
Second, supplies must be unusable after they have been used in 
the work for which they were purchased.  For example, explosives 
supplied by a miner or gasoline supplied by a chainsaw operator 
are currently deductible.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us consider the various advantages of such an amendment to 
the act for the 150,000 mechanics and apprentices who are subject 
to the present tax system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, as I noted before, mechanics must invest between $15,000 
and $30,000 in tools, an amount disproportionate in comparison 
with amounts invested by other employee groups who provide their 
own tools and equipment.  Given the size of this investment, 
mechanics consider more favourable tax treatment entirely fair 
and reasonable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, as noted, mechanics consider that they should be given 
the same tax treatment as musicians, artists, painters and the 
aforementioned chainsaw operators.  More favourable tax treatment 
for mechanics' tools would eliminate a situation that mechanics 
perceive to be unfair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, more favourable tax treatment would allow mechanics to 
purchase better equipment and provide better service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, more favourable tax treatment would encourage more young 
people to become mechanics and trades persons, as has been noted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, more favourable tax treatment would facilitate the 
mechanics transition from school to work.  Because employers 
require mechanics to supply their tools and because the size of 
the required investment is considerable, few young graduate 
mechanics can enter the labour market.  Based on this argument, 
as was noted earlier, the House of Commons finance committee 
recommended in its last pre-budget consultation report that the 
tax treatment of mechanics' tool expenses be reviewed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government ignored this recommendation when delivering the 
1998 budget, but we feel that now is the time to act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to note that I have received some correspondence on 
this from Sagal Brothers in Moose Jaw and the good folks who work 
at Nelson Motors in Avonlea at the John Deere dealership.  There 
is a lot of interest on this particular topic.  I sincerely hope 
that the government takes this bill seriously, does the necessary 
work and brings in something meaningful very quickly.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is nice that you could join us this evening, and myself 
particularly, because I know that you will be hanging on every 
word I am about to utter, as you like to listen very closely to 
what is being said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to pass on my thanks to the member for Lakeland who 
has once again brought forward a private member's bill to deal 
with what I consider to be an injustice and an inequity that has 
been around for too long. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it very interesting that the issue that is being debated 
tonight is so very logical.  So logical, in fact, that I would 
have thought the government would have been able to deal with 
this change to the tax legislation itself without continually 
having private members bring forward this particular issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I certainly wish that the government would listen to what is 
being said and, if not pass this private member's bill, at some 
point in the not too distant future, because the issue is a very 
important one, change the legislation itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As has been mentioned before, this is not the first time this 
issue has been before the House.  It is definitely non-partisan. 
This does not have anything to do with party politics.  It simply 
has to do with logic and correcting an injustice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1992 an NDP member brought forward a private member's bill to 
deal with the issue.  As a member of the government in 1992, a 
Liberal brought forward legislation to deal with it.  In fact, a 
Bloc member brought forward a piece of legislation in 1996 which 
unfortunately was not dealt with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a very simple situation.  One sector of our society, a 
very important sector, those mechanics and technicians who look 
after everything from our automobiles to very heavy duty 
equipment which is necessary for industrial development in this 
country, are being mistreated. 
Because it seems so logical, I am sorry to say that we have to 
stand here constantly to try to convince the government to make 
these changes.

<A HREF="#LINKT50"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is actually happening is that a mechanic or a service 
technician is required by their employer to invest capital 
contributions of anywhere from $5,000 to $40,000.  These are not 
pliers or simple screwdrivers.  This is mechanical equipment that 
is very sophisticated.  The automobiles and the heavy duty 
equipment that is available right now to industry is very 
sophisticated equipment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A mechanic, whether a journeyman, an apprentice or a 
full-fledged mechanic, is required to have the proper tools to 
fix those pieces of equipment.  These tools can cost upwards of 
$40,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard that certain pieces of technical, computerized 
equipment can cost anywhere from $1,500 to $3,000.  The problem 
is that when the mechanic goes out to buy the equipment, he does 
so and does not have the opportunity to deduct it from his 
taxable income.  That in itself is an injustice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a business buys a piece of equipment, whether it is 
computer equipment or any other type of mechanical equipment, the 
business can write it off.  It gets what is known as a CCA, a 
capital cost allowance.  The business can write it off, but the 
individual mechanic cannot do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If members of government have ever walked through a mechanical 
bay, they would have seen the service technicians and the 
mechanics along with their tool bins. I am sure government 
members would be very surprised to see the type of sophisticated 
tools that are required to become a mechanic or a service 
technician in today's society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a previous life I was with a municipal government, which 
supplied certain tools, but each individual mechanic was 
required, as a requirement of employment, to bring with them 
their own tools and equipment.  Those tools and equipment, 
unfortunately, are not at this point in time tax deductible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard the parliamentary secretary say that the government, he 
and his department were somewhat concerned about this issue.  He 
said that, in fact, there was an inequity and that the government 
would continue to look at the possibility of change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also mentioned two reasons we should be very careful when 
discussing this piece of legislation and supporting it.  First, he 
said that if we do it for the mechanics we may well have to do 
it for other employees who are required to have some piece of 
equipment in order to perform their job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is a possibility of correcting other inequities and 
injustices, that does not mean this one should be continued. 
If there are other inequities and injustices they should all be 
dealt with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the parliamentary secretary said that we have to be very 
careful because we have to make sure that these mechanical tools 
and pieces of equipment cannot and should not be used for 
personal use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talked about the farm equipment that can be deducted as a 
capital cost allowance.  We talked about musicians who can deduct 
the purchase of a very expensive piece of musical equipment.  We 
talked about chainsaw operators.  They have already been dealt 
with by legislation and can write off their equipment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the parliamentary secretary “Do you not think that maybe 
a chainsaw operator will use his chainsaw once for personal 
use?” Perhaps a musician who has a very expensive French horn, 
who uses it to generate revenue, will sit down some evening to 
play it for guests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Or the bagpipes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik:</B>  I appreciate that, but I would prefer 
the French horn as opposed to the bagpipes.  It can be done in a 
much smaller location with the French horn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the parliamentary secretary not think that perhaps these 
musicians do not use their musical equipment for some personal 
use?  They still have the right to deduct this from their taxable 
income because it is necessary for their employment. 
Those two excuses do not really cut a lot of ice.  They certainly 
do not have enough behind them to refuse this request to make 
mechanical tools a tax deduction. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1815"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT51"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also talked about what would happen if tax deductibility were 
allowed by government.  The first and foremost issue is that it 
will develop additional employment.  It will allow people to 
enter into a workforce where there is a desperate need for 
people.  We are not just talking about automotive service 
technicians, although they are very important.  As other speakers 
have indicated, I have received substantial support from 
automobile dealers who suggest the inequity should be corrected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can also look at heavy duty mechanics.  In my area, in 
particular in the farm industry, we are getting much more 
sophisticated and larger equipment that requires people who have 
been properly trained and who have the proper tools to fix the 
equipment.  We have a shortage in this industry.  Why does the 
government think we have a shortage in this industry although 
jobs in this industry are very good?  There is a good wage base, 
a lot of job security and a lot of opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would young people coming out of high school not want to go 
to a tech school to take heavy duty mechanics or automobile 
mechanics and servicing?  Because in order to get a job they have 
to invest $15,000 to $40,000 for equipment and tools.  That is 
the same amount that cannot be written off on a capital cost 
allowance, a CCA, as one would normally deduct in a business. 
That would allow them to afford to go into that industry which is 
a very good industry. Maybe if we did that we would encourage 
people to get into the industry and we would not have a shortage 
of mechanics and technicians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a community college in my community which has some very 
good programs with respect to mechanics. It has difficulty 
filling those programs, not because there are not competent 
people who would like to do it but because they cannot afford to 
do it.  This is one of those areas in which the government could 
look to help the unemployed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government says it is looking at it.  However, it has been 
looked at for many years even with previous governments.  When 
members of this government were in opposition, they would have 
liked to see some changes but now that they form the government 
it seems that changes move very slowly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The one thing that moves very slowly in this government is tax 
relief to Canadians in general. We could get into the very 
excessive payroll taxes in place now, the increased CPP which we 
have talked about ad nauseam in this House, the increased EI 
premiums and EI surpluses which have not been given back.  So 
maybe we could start with one very small opportunity to have 
government support this private member's legislation so that one 
inequity and one injustice would be corrected. 
<P><A NAME="LINK241"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords—Lloydminster, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am honoured to speak today on behalf of the many 
mechanics and technicians of Battlefords—Lloydminster in support 
of my esteemed colleague's private member's Bill C-366, an act to 
amend the Income Tax Act to allow for the deduction of mechanics' 
tools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is only fair that young men and women working to advance 
their careers in this growing field should be treated the same 
way by the tax code.  There is quite an inequity here.  We see no 
logic or common sense in denying these young people that tax 
deductibility.  The only thing we can see holding this up is that 
there is no desire from the government at this time to implement 
any kind of tax relief for their situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the parliamentary secretary said so eloquently a short time 
ago, there have been interventions on this issue.  I was at the 
finance committee with him during those interventions.  It has 
been done for the past number of years and no one has really 
taken the bull by the horns and made it happen. I am wondering 
with such logic and common sense in place to put this tax code in 
place, why are we waiting.  We talk about complexity of the act, 
that this cannot happen.  The Liberal government says don't 
worry, be happy, we are studying it, something is going to happen 
somewhere down the road. 
I wish to tell young mechanics and technicians not to hold their 
breath. Their tools are going to be old and rusty before the 
government ever gets off its duff to make this happen.

</I></B></P><P align=left>My son is a mechanic.  He is 19. Already he has over $6,000 
worth of tools and it is a prerequisite of the job. The total is 
well over $6,000 which is a big chunk of change for a young guy 
starting his career in the workforce.  If that were tax 
deductible there would certainly be an incentive to expand what 
he has and to work a little harder at the job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a tremendous pride in the ownership of the tools.  It 
is very self-evident in the workplace that they do.  They keep 
the workplace neat and tidy because of that, because they own the 
equipment.  My son has a little sticker on the side of his tool 
box that really says it all, “Don't ask to borrow my tools.  The 
only thing we loan out belongs to the old tomcat and he always 
brings it back”.  That is kind of evident of the way these kids 
feel about these tools.  They worked hard to own them, so there 
is a pride of ownership.  Why can we not extend that to being tax 
deductible as we do for all the other instances that were 
presented with here today? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are differences in mechanic and technician tools 
deductibility.  It is a growth industry.  There is a tremendous 
demand for young apprentices.  Exceptional expenses are involved. 
As opposed to a pair of shoes to feel better when you are working 
in a store, we are talking right off the bat of thousands of 
dollars of input. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also we are looking at programs in our community colleges to get 
the young people into the workforce.  A two year program puts 
them into a mechanic or body shop situation. They are earning 
money and paying taxes.  It is only fair that there is an 
incentive to make that happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a shortfall in the job sector for youth employment that 
the government is so intent on addressing.  There is a tremendous 
opportunity out there and making a deductibility for mechanics' 
tools and technicians' tools would certainly add to that.  We 
would see many jobs filled in that sector.  We have seen numbers 
as high from some interveners as 100,000 positions could be 
filled.  It may take just this little incentive to make it 
happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The objective of the bill is fairness in taxation.  I applaud my 
colleague's desire to see this done.  He is the latest in a long 
list of people from all political parties who have tried to put 
this act before parliament and have it acted on.  I have to 
stress the youth employment potential.  It is economically 
positive.  It is an excellent bill and I urge the government to 
act accordingly and have it implemented immediately. 
<P><A NAME="LINK242"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
delighted for the opportunity to add to the debate today since I 
too have had representations from people not only in my riding 
but from other areas around the country on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an issue of fairness.  Professionals, even lawyers, are 
able to deduct the cost of office equipment which he or she needs 
in order to do their business.  A doctor, a dentist or any 
professional is able to deduct the cost of equipment or have it 
apply in capital cost allowance schedules on income tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do we discriminate against certain groups of people like 
mechanics?  That is the topic we are dealing with today, although 
I hasten to add there are others who are discriminated against in 
this way.  It is a matter of great urgency that we actually get 
the government to move on this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague who just spoke was too negative.  He said the tools 
will be all be rusty before the government will move on it.  I 
take this occasion to appeal to the Liberal members on the other 
side who right now are in a majority.  I beg them to act on this. 
It is so obvious and self-evident. The previous speakers have 
all spoken about this.  All the different groups from the finance 
committee to others have heard presentations. It is a solid 
argument.  There is no reason to hesitate on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding there is a major shop and a number of other jobs 
that work on car repairs.  The one I am thinking of is Peterson 
Pontiac in Sherwood Park in my riding.  I had a letter from those 
people saying they need all this investment and they are among 
the only ones who cannot reduce their income tax payable by the 
amount of those tools.  They actually have to buy those tools 
with after tax income.  This for most of them effectively 
increases the cost by about 50% to 80% depending on how much 
money they are making.

</I></B></P><P align=left>To buy a $50 tool they have to earn $80 or $90 so that after 
they pay the tax on it they have enough money left. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge this government to do something about this.  It is time 
to stop sitting on our duffs.  We cannot do that anymore.  We 
must get moving.  We must do what is right.  We must give 
fairness in taxation to mechanics. 
<P><A NAME="LINK243"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
sincerely thank the members from all political parties who have 
spoken in support of this bill. I thank the parliamentary 
secretary who gave general support and some good reasons to 
support the bill but who also unfortunately came up with a few 
excuses as to why it has not happened, one being that other 
technicians should be included. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with that but the government has had five years to make 
that happen.  The parliamentary secretary also showed a concern 
regarding personal use of tools.  That is an issue regarding any 
item that is allowed for deduction under tax regulations, so it 
just does not wash at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the member from the Bloc Quebecois who spoke on this, 
gave his full support and made some very good comments.  The 
member from the New Democratic Party said this is not a partisan 
issue, that it has been brought up before, which is the case.  I 
thank the member for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the member from the Conservative Party who gave full 
support and hit on several of the key issues. This member also 
pointed out that the government has been very tardy on this. I 
thank them all for their comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our finance critic, the member for Battlefords—Lloydminster, a 
member of the finance committee, pointed out reasons employers 
require mechanics to own tools, which I think is a very important 
point. Anyone who has employed mechanics or who has worked with 
tools knows that tools tend to walk.  This is not only because 
people steal them but tools get left on a piece of equipment, the 
equipment gets driven away and the tools disappear. Certainly 
they would pay extra attention if they were their own tools.  I 
thank the member for making that important point and the member 
for Elk Island who showed his support for this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have what appears to be unanimous consent from the people who 
presented on this bill. I cannot understand why it has not 
happened before now.  This is not a new issue.  This issue has 
come up from MPs from all parties in the past, MPs such as Joy 
Langan, NDP, in 1992 and the Liberal member for Saint-Boniface. 
A Bloc MP in 1996 put forth a bill that would at least do some of 
these things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a new issue.  This government has had five years to 
act on it.  It has not acted and it is too bad.  It is very 
unfortunate, particularly for the mechanics who really need this 
piece of legislation.  I do not think we can wait any longer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is clearly a tax fairness issue.  I find it surprising that 
just because it is a tax fairness issue that actually requires a 
reduction in taxation, it is not going to be acted on, at least 
through this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to tell mechanics this issue is not dead. I have the 
6,000 to 7,000 letters.  I have the lists of groups and 
businesses that have supported this.  I am going to keep going 
with this.

<P><A NAME="LINK251"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, on May 
1 the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Indian Affairs 
and Northern Development responded to my question on the New 
Brunswick forestry crisis.  He said “We are working with New 
Brunswick”. Well, nice words but empty words it seems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Early last month the minister said “We have always said we will 
assist the province and the First Nations”. The truth of the 
matter is that the active federal government involvement should 
have happened a long time ago.  Just like other actions taken on 
aboriginal issues by this Liberal government, it is a matter of 
too little way too late. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the minister expect First Nations peoples of New Brunswick 
will easily leave the forest and reduce their logging ambitions? 
Does she expect that they will easily part with productive jobs 
and incomes to return to social assistance in many cases?  I 
expect not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why then has the minister abjectly refused to issue a reply to 
the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples tabled over 600 days 
ago?  This report outlined a number of initiatives in forestry 
which may have helped prevent the current crisis.  However, this 
government continues to hide its head in the sand when it comes 
to aboriginal forestry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When issuing the landmark Delgamuukw decision last December, 
Chief Justice Antonio Lamer stated “Let us face it, we are all 
here to stay”.  By refusing to provide leadership, this Liberal 
government appears to be hoping the aboriginal people will simply 
go away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Early last month Elizabeth Weir was quoted as saying “The 
province should be using this time to actively request the 
federal government get involved”.  She is right.  But this 
government should have been actively involved long ago.  It 
appears that this government is so deep in the pockets of the 
Irvings and the other logging mega corporations that it refuses 
to act on the recommendations of the aboriginal peoples 
commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Six years ago the national forestry strategy called to increase 
“the involvement of aboriginal peoples in forest land 
management”.  Six years later there is precious little except 
maybe a real crisis in the forests of New Brunswick to show for 
this government's efforts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has a responsibility to explain what it has done 
on each of the following 10 points, or why it has consistently 
refused to act.  These 10 points are based on the report of the 
Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This federal government should already have taken steps to: 
one, work with other governments and aboriginal communities to 
improve aboriginal access to forest resources on crown lands; 
two, promote aboriginal involvement in provincial forest 
management; three, give continuing support to aboriginal peoples 
forest resource associations; four, encourage the provinces to 
work with their large timber licensees, like the Irvings, to 
promote forest management partnerships with aboriginal firms; 
five, encourage joint ventures between aboriginal forest 
operating companies and other firms with wood processing 
facilities; six, promote less intensive aboriginal forest 
management practices and traditional land use activities; seven, 
work to provide for special roles for aboriginal governments in 
reviewing forest management and operating plans within their 
traditional territories; eight, work toward ensuring that 
aboriginal land use studies are a requirement for all forest 
management plans; nine, ensure that forest management expertise 
is available to First Nations; and ten, consult with aboriginal 
governments to develop a joint policy statement delineating their 
respective responsibilities in relation to Indian forest 
reserves.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Each and every day that this government refuses to actively 
pursue these recommendations of its own royal commission it 
shoulders a greater part of the responsibility for the current 
logging crisis in New Brunswick and for other crises that might 
develop elsewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just this morning there was news about a potential crisis 
brewing in B.C.  Maybe now this government— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The hon. Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Minister of Human Resources Development has the 
floor. 
<P><A NAME="LINK252"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert D. Nault (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to respond to the hon. member for Halifax West concerning 
aboriginal access to forest resources on crown lands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The key issue in this matter is the involvement of New Brunswick 
aboriginal people in the forestry industry in New Brunswick.  The 
New Brunswick appeal court found that there was not sufficient 
evidence in the case concerning Mr. Peter Paul to support a 
treaty or aboriginal right to commercial use of the forests.  In 
any event, court decisions in this case will not close the door 
forever on the question of aboriginal or treaty rights in the 
maritimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Including aboriginal people in economic activities throughout 
Canada can go a long way toward promoting economic development in 
aboriginal communities.  This will help raise the standard of 
living and hope for the future among a group of people who remain 
the most disadvantaged in Canadian society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada recognizes that this case deals with an 
issue that falls under provincial jurisdiction.  The government 
is pleased to see that the Government of New Brunswick is 
amenable to negotiating immediately interim arrangements that 
would enable First Nation communities to participate more fully 
in the province's forestry industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The province's initial proposal is being reviewed by a coalition 
of aboriginal leadership and loggers.  It is our understanding 
that a counterproposal will be submitted to the province shortly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the province launched a task force led by former 
chief justice of the Supreme Court of Canada, Gerard La Forest. 
The mandate of this task force is to consider the immediate 
issues related to forestry, but also a broader agenda of concerns 
to the province's First Nations such as education and economic 
development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that this task force will help bring all parties 
together to support peaceful resolutions to this issue. While 
respecting the primary responsibility of First Nations leadership 
and the province to resolve these issues, the federal government 
is open to considering how it could assist the parties to 
facilitate a resolution. The Minister of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development and her departmental officials will continue 
to discuss this with First Nations and the province of New 
Brunswick.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>NORTH AMERICAN FREE TRADE AGREEMENT 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK254"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roger Gallaway (Sarnia—Lambton, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
on May 5 I raised a question in this House concerning foreign 
workers entering Canada under articles 1601 and 1701 of the North 
American Free Trade Agreement, known as the NAFTA. The reason for 
raising this was a result of complaints I was receiving, 
complaints of abuse of the NAFTA provisions, complaints of 
blatant stretching of the rules, all of this to the detriment of 
Canadian workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The application of articles 1601 and 1701 is reasonable and 
straightforward.  It recognizes that sometimes citizens of the 
U.S. and Mexico may want to enter Canada to sell products, or to 
service products, or to install products manufactured in one of 
those countries.  In doing so it is quite a reasonable and simple 
idea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Suppose an American company sells an automated painting machine 
to a Canadian company that manufactures something like wooden 
doors.  When the equipment is delivered the American manufacturer 
may, pursuant to articles 1601 and 1701 of NAFTA, send a person 
knowledgeable in the installation and startup of that machine to 
supervise its installation.  What is presumed and expected is 
that Canadian electricians and millwrights will move the machine 
into place and hook up the electrical service but the technical 
expert is simply there to direct and supervise the work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What appears to be happening, or what is being suggested to me, 
is that this is being abused.  It is being abused by the 
Americans who become more than technical supervisors, but who in 
fact become tradesmen.  They start doing the work of people such 
as electricians, pipe fitters and millwrights.  They pick up the 
tools of these trades and in doing so they put Canadians out of 
work.  They take Canadian jobs from Canadian trades.  This cannot 
be tolerated.  The department of immigration must be vigilant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My concern involving this arose from a series of complaints I 
received in my office.  Quite simply, a number of tradespeople 
came to me and told me that there were at least 25 Americans 
posing as technical consultants on a job site in southwestern 
Ontario.  The complaints were the same.  These outsiders were 
working as tradespeople.  They were doing whatever was required. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1840"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT56"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Subsequently the regional immigration office in London advised 
me there were 40 Americans on the site, 40 so-called technical 
consultants. When I asked whether immigration had investigated, I 
was advised no.  To date it has not done so and the complaint was 
first laid on December 9 of last year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This in my opinion is a sad commentary on the state of the 
immigration department.  In fact the reason given was 
unbelievably weak.  The department did not intervene because it 
did not have hard hats or safety boots for its employees to enter 
the worksite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In her response to me on May 5 the minister stated “I would 
encourage any member who is aware of a situation to refer it to 
my department”.  I hope that the minister today is re-evaluating 
the resources of her department.  I hope that all of these 
potential abuses are being dealt with immediately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case four months after the initial complaint nothing was 
done and to date nothing has been done.  This is a tragic and sad 
commentary on how Immigration Canada protects Canadian jobs for 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the minister will move more decisively and quickly to 
change this.  On behalf of Canadian workers I hope that the 
minister will enforce the true spirit and intent of the NAFTA. 
Finally, I hope the minister will stand up for Canadians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK255"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime 
Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
Sarnia—Lambton for his question.  It reflects the commitment and 
concern he has for his constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First let me state that in our increasingly global economy the 
need to knock down trade barriers assumes greater importance. 
That is why the North American Free Trade Agreement in addition 
to other international agreements are crucial to the government's 
agenda for creating jobs and growth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>NAFTA commits Canada to work together with our U.S. and Mexico 
partners to expand trade and investment and to facilitate the 
movement of legitimate business persons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Success in the new economy increasingly relies not only on the 
ability to move products but also to move people across borders 
quickly and efficiently.  This is not to say we are throwing the 
door open to all workers from the United States and Mexico.  We 
are not. The categories of certain business persons permitted by 
the agreement from the three countries to have access to each 
other's countries to conduct certain types of business activities 
are strictly regulated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, we may at times encounter those who try to bypass 
the regular system and attempt to abuse our programs as the 
member had raised. I want to make it clear that this government 
will not tolerate this type of behaviour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration has said on 
several occasions that anyone who has information regarding 
potential abuses of the provisions of NAFTA and/or the 
Immigration Act is encouraged to contact the department. Hence, 
on hearing the question on this issue let me assure the member 
that again this matter will be brought to the attention of the 
department so that the member may be posted as to developments to 
ensure that indeed the problem raised has been solved 
definitively.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>VARENNES TOKAMAK 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK257"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to take part in adjournment proceedings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On May 12, I asked the Minister of Natural Resources why the 
federal government was withdrawing its financial support from 
the Varennes Tokamak. I denounce the inconsistency of the 
government's decision, and its lack of vision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The end of this major project is a considerable loss not only 
for Quebec, but also for Canada, in terms of developing an 
expertise in the high technology sector. 
The Varennes Tokamak, Quebec's number one R and D project in the 
energy sector, will shut down for good in a few days. The 
precarious state of public finances when the decision was 
originally made was used as an excuse for rationalizing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, the Minister of Finance boasts about having put the 
country's fiscal house in order and having managed to eliminate 
the deficit. However, the argument of rationalization is no 
longer valid, now that we have a budget surplus that was created 
essentially because of the efforts of the provinces and the most 
disadvantaged. The government can no longer invoke this 
fallacious argument to justify such an illogical and regressive 
decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government now has the means to continue its modest 
annual contribution of $7.2 million to the Varennes Tokamak. 
In its last budget speech, the Minister of Finance said, and I 
quote “the more R and D that is done in Canada, the more jobs 
that will be created for Canadians”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can this statement be reconciled with a decision so 
disconnected from Canada's future needs in the energy and 
technology sectors, for which we must prepare right now?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The research on nuclear fusion in the Tokamak project in 
Varennes is part of a concerted international effort.  Four of 
the major partners in this international project, namely, the 
United States, Japan, Russia and the European Union, invest 
nearly $2 billion in research on nuclear fusion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A full member of the select club working to develop a renewable, 
clean and safe form of energy, the federal government spent only 
$7.2 million annually on research, while enjoying all the 
benefits of the knowledge and technical and scientific expertise 
in the field of nuclear fusion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the closure of the Tokamak project in Varennes, Canada will 
now be deprived of the scientific and technological benefits. 
Not only will it lose its internationally recognized expertise 
in microwaves to achieve a modest saving of $7.2 million, but it 
will destroy the links it had with an international network of 
contacts in cutting edge scientific research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In an article in <I>La Presse</I> on May 11, Tom Dolan, the co-ordinator 
of the world fusion research program with the UN International 
Atomic Energy Agency, said he was very disappointed to see 
Canada drop its nuclear fusion research program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can such a project be shut down, when the minister was 
recently claiming to be concerned about the development of clean 
and renewable energies, and when this objective is part of his 
strategy for managing climate change? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But since the phenomenon of climate change will have very 
long-term effects, something the Minister of Natural Resources 
has just begun to admit, furthermore, research and development 
of forms of energy such as the one the Tokamak team was working 
on helps prevent the emission of greenhouse gases and avoid the 
risk of nuclear accidents presented by the Candu reactors, for 
instance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would Canada no longer participate in the development of a 
source of energy such as nuclear fusion?  We are told it is a 
question of priorities. 
Is it not a priority for Canada to be among world leaders in the 
research and development of clean and safe renewable energies, 
rather than limiting its role to that of a passive spectator? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am sorry to interrupt the hon. member, but 
the parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Human Resources 
Development has the floor. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK258"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert D. Nault (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
hon. member for raising this important issue and I welcome the 
opportunity to speak to the matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has provided $90 million to Tokamak de 
Varennes from 1981 to 1997.  The government chose, however, not 
to terminate funding abruptly.  This would have been unfair to 
the scientists and researchers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the government decided to terminate its support for fusion 
at the end of March 1997 it provided a lump sum payment of $19 
million to Hydro Quebec thereby absolving the government of any 
future liabilities for this project.  Hydro Quebec agreed to 
operate the facility for an additional three years, complete the 
experiments in progress and allow for an orderly shutdown of the 
facilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hydro Quebec announced in May that it would be shutting down 
this facility earlier than anticipated because of budgetary 
pressures. It seems that Hydro Quebec has decided, like the 
federal government, that fusion cannot be a priority at this 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Federal funding of fusion research has been a difficult issue 
over the years as the funding requirements kept escalating. 
Fusion research is expensive and equipment had to be kept up to 
date with advances in fusion science to be able to make 
meaningful contributions to the knowledge base.  Although the 
science was very good the technology was very expensive and has a 
payback that is at least 30 to 40 years in the future.  It is not 
certain the technology could be successfully developed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Natural Resources Canada decided that fusion could not be a 
priority given the spending cuts that had to be made and the 
limited resources at our disposal.  In energy R and D the 
government is focusing on those areas that have the greatest 
promise for reducing greenhouse gases and for helping to meet our 
commitment to the Kyoto protocol. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many accomplished dedicated scientists were associated with this 
project.  They are to be commended for their contribution to this 
field of research.  The Government of Canada has a responsibility 
to Canadians, however, to manage public investments prudently and 
to establish strategic priorities in energy research.  It simply 
does not have the means to fund all research, as worthy as it may 
be.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary is here tonight.  I guess maybe in 
an unusual sense we will have a little debate here if it is 
allowed.  I will put a question or two to the parliamentary 
secretary which perhaps he could answer.  I do not think that is 
breaching the rules too much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My last question to the minister on this issue had to do with 
the working group established after the breakdown in talks 
between the federal health minister and the provinces regarding 
compensation for all victims outside the 1986 to 1990 package. No 
one would argue with that package in and of itself, but obviously 
the problem is that we have many victims prior to 1986 who were 
not compensated.  Therein lies the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to see this issue resolved.  We want to see all pre-1986 
innocent victims of the tainted blood supply compensated.  It is 
as simple as that.  Some provinces have indicated since the 
breakdown of the federal-provincial negotiations that they would 
compensate.  They are on record and have obviously dedicated some 
funding to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am hoping to get tonight basically a sense of what is 
happening at the meetings in Edmonton which are presently 
ongoing.  We have heard everything from a complete breakdown in 
the negotiations to things are moving on, they are still talking 
and meeting and so on.  We are hoping the latter is the case and 
that negotiations are continuing.  I have to refrain from using 
the word negotiations because the minister says they are meeting 
and discussing.  At the end of the day we are hoping that 
something will happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the parliamentary secretary can bring us up to date on 
this issue because it is an issue that will not go away.  I do 
not think Canadians will be satisfied until there is a 
compensation package that includes all the victims prior to 1986, 
some of whom contracted hepatitis C since 1990.  Possibly the 
parliamentary secretary could bring us up to date. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a country as generous as Canada and in a country which as I 
told the Canadian public time and time again in the House is 
rated No. 1 in the world we are seeking fairness for all victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe the parliamentary secretary could deviate from the script 
a bit tonight and bring us up to date. 
<P><A NAME="LINK261"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased my colleague 
opposite has at least recognized the compensation package that 
was fashioned thanks to the leadership of the Minister of Health 
for Canada together with his colleagues at the provincial and 
territorial level.  It has finally been acknowledged as something 
that in and of itself is very good.  In fact I think he said 
unquestionably acceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know what has transpired since the package which deserves 
all those adjectives was placed before the House and before the 
Canadian public.  To be more specific, to get to a resolution of 
some of the things that have transpired in the last couple of 
months, as the member has indicated the federal authorities 
together with the provincial and territorial counterparts met in 
Edmonton for two days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind members in the House and those watching the proceedings 
that the victims were also present through their representatives. 
Some positions have been floated through the press.  Some have 
come before the House and others have been addressed by 
interested parties with respect to how to deal with those who 
fall outside the package that we placed before the House and the 
Canadian public some two months ago.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
on March 12, I asked the Minister of the Environment if 
Environment Canada had sufficient resources to fulfil legal 
responsibilities and to enforce regulations contained in the 
current Canadian Environmental Protection Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister replied that his department had sufficient 
resources to deal with every element of environmental protection 
under the current act.  The standing committee was contrary in 
its findings.  On February 26 Environment Canada's deputy 
minister responded to committee questions by indicating that the 
environment enforcement program lacked adequate human and 
financial resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The standing committee report entitled “Enforcing Canada's 
Pollution Laws:  The Public Interest Must Come First” raises 
concern that crown liability for failure to enforce environmental 
legislation may lead to actions against Environment Canada for 
regulatory negligence.  It also highlights the need for more 
human and financial resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The environment minister stated on national television that 
there had not been recent cuts to the environment enforcement 
program.  Following the interview Canadians could read the 
figures for themselves.

infractions.  Today there are 17 investigators or a loss of 11 
investigators. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The environment minister stated time and time again that the 
Liberal government provided the highest environmental standards 
for Canadians.  It is a convenient answer when opposition members 
call the government to account for the deterioration of 
environmental standards across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian public does not know the critical state of Canada's 
environment.  Most Canadians would be shocked to learn that 
entire sections of CEPA are not enforced in some provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister re-signed an agreement with Quebec to monitor pulp 
and paper effluents.  The next day it was reported that at least 
20 infractions were not being enforced in that province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most Canadians would be shocked to know that the entire CEPA 
budget for Atlantic Canada above salaries and operating expenses 
is $150,000 for the region.

government to cover an approximate 17,200 possible sites where 
federal regulations may apply will lose a third of its budget 
this year.

Parliament Hill than there are six field inspectors for the 
entire prairie and northern region, an area larger than Europe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before the program reviews which slashed an estimated 40% from 
Environment Canada's budgets since the Liberal took office, an 
internal Environment Canada report recommended 300 enforcement 
personnel would be needed to protect our environment. In reality 
today there are fewer than 70 people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The environment minister stated the benefits of voluntary 
compliance and reporting programs.  Canadians should know that 
report after report has stated otherwise.  Voluntary alone does 
not work.  Industry complies when federal regulations are 
applied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not saying there is a lot of bad apples but there are a 
few that require monitoring.  For instance in this wonderful land 
we call home, Canada, the harsh climate does not allow us to 
leave any window or door open without compromising everybody's 
comfort or safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The standing committee received numerous presentations from 
Canada's environment community which concur that voluntary 
programs are insufficient for environmental protection.  Why 
would the minister continue to pursue a policy that people in her 
own department stated does not work?  Who is the government 
trying to protect?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime 
Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, Canadians are committed to a 
clean environment in its many dimensions, knowing that a clean 
environment is one determinant of good health of the citizenry. 
That is why Canadians want strong and effective environmental 
laws to ensure a clean environment for Canada. 
That is why on March 12 the Minister of the Environment 
introduced Bill C-32 to renew the Canadian Environmental 
Protection Act.  The bill represents a shift from expensive 
efforts to try to clean up pollution after the fact to preventing 
it from occurring in the first place.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In the bill all substances used in Canada will be screened for 
their effects on the environment and therefore human health. 
Strict deadlines for action will be in place.  The government is 
committed to putting the most dangerous toxic substances on the 
path to virtual elimination. One of the innovative features of 
this bill is the authority to require pollution prevention plans 
for toxic substances, a first for Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pollution prevention is good for both environment and business. 
Companies that have voluntarily adopted a pollution prevention 
approach have found it improves the bottom line.  At the same 
time, sound enforcement of the law is essential to creating a 
level playing field that supports environmental leaders while 
penalizing polluters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The renewed act will improve enforcement by expanding inspector 
powers, including the authority to issue on the spot orders and 
ensuring that the financial and human resources needed are in 
place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new act is founded on the principle of partnership, not on 
devolution of federal powers to the provinces and territories but 
on close co-operative work with them.  The federal government 
remains firmly committed to safeguarding the health of Canadians 
from the threat of pollution by strengthening environmental 
protection in Canada.
