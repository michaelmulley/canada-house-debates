BISHOP OF THE ARCTIC OF THE CHURCH OF 
ENGLAND IN CANADA</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Jim Peterson (Willowdale, Lib.)</B> moved that Bill S-15, an 
act to amend an Act to Incorporate the Bishop of the Arctic of the 
Church of England in Canada, be read the second time and referred 
to a committee.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to rise today to bring 
about some amendments to the act incorporating the bishop of the 
Arctic for the Anglican church.
<P>
	By way of background, the Anglican church in Canada was 
officially founded in 1893, although many of its dioceses had 
existed prior to Confederation.
<P>
	Today there are 30 dioceses of the Anglican church in Canada, 
each one incorporated. The act we are dealing with deals with the 
diocese of the Arctic, which was incorporated by a federal act of 
Parliament in 1934.
<P>
	The diocese of the Arctic covers the Northwest Territories and 
the northern third of Quebec. It has 51 active parishes, 20 of which 
have resident Anglican ministers.
<P>
	Also by way of background, the primate of the Anglican church 
in Canada is the Most Reverend Michael G. Teers. He is 
responsible for five Canadian ecclesiastical provinces as they are 
called under the Anglican church. The archbishop for the 
ecclesiastical province of Rupert's Land is the Most Reverend 
Barry Curtis. He is situated in Calgary and the bishop of the 
diocese of the Arctic, Bishop Christopher Williams, reports to him.
<P>
	The Anglican church has changed over the years. It now has 15 
ordained Inuit clergy. Last year it elected its first Inuk bishop, Paul 
Idlout, a former member of the RCMP.
<P>
<B>(1110 )</B>
<P>
	The Anglican Church has a history of long and distinguished 
service to the people of Canada's north. The first missionary who 
came from England, Reverend E.J. Peck, gave the Inuit of the 
eastern Arctic their syllabic writing system which is in use today. 
The church continues to minister to the spiritual and other needs of 
the people of the north and has undertaken tremendous work in 
translating hymns, prayers and scriptures into many of the local 
languages.
<P>
	I am very pleased today that we have the opportunity to salute 
the work of the Anglican church in Canada's north and to bring its 
active incorporation into line with modern needs.
<P>
	Under the present act of 1934 the investment powers of the 
Anglican church in the north are very limited. It can invest only in 
the bonds of the Canadian or provincial governments or the 
Government of Great Britain and some mortgages on land. It is 
facing severe financial trials in these difficult times because of its 
immense responsibilities in that area. We as members of 
Parliament can help it to have greater investment powers and 
hopefully a greater income from its invested moneys in order to 
carry out its worthwhile work.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
speaking this morning on behalf of the official opposition, the Bloc 
Quebecois, on Bill S-15, an act to amend an Act to incorporate the 
Bishop of the Arctic of the Church of England in Canada.
<P>
	This private member's bill, passed by the Senate on March 18, 
1997 and sponsored by Senator Meighen, broadens the investment 
powers of the Bishop of the Arctic.
<P>
	As you know, I am a hardline abolitionist as far as the Senate is 
concerned. It is, in my opinion, an archaic institution which 
perpetuates colonialism in this country and interferes with the 
sovereignty of the House of Commons. I find it useless, therefore, 
to retain this institution on the eve of the third millennium.
<P>
	When the public interest of Quebecers and all Canadians is at 
stake, however, I am capable of being open-minded. I am aware of 
the problems involved in designating the Bishop of the Arctic in 
<P>

<B><A NAME="9628"> 9628 </A></B>
<P>
French as a ``corporation'' rather than a ``personne morale''. For  
this reason, the official opposition, the Bloc Quebecois, will vote in 
favour of Bill S-15.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to join my colleagues from 
Willowdale and Frontenac in the debate on Senate Bill S-15.
<P>
	Bill S-15 amends an Act to Incorporate the Bishop of the Arctic 
of the Church of England in Canada, an act passed by Parliament in 
1934.
<P>
	The main purpose of the amendment is to allow the Anglican 
diocese of the Arctic more flexibility in how it administers the 
endowment fund of the bishop of the Arctic.
<P>
	Since 1934 and up to the present this fund is limited to 
investments in securities of the governments of the Dominion of 
Canada and the United Kingdom and first mortgages in Canada.
<P>
	Churches across Canada, as has already been indicated by my 
hon. colleague from Willowdale, find themselves in increasing 
financial constraints, and the Anglican diocese of the Arctic is no 
exception.
<P>
	I believe this amendment will provide it additional versatility in 
investment alternatives for its endowment fund. Being able to 
secure the best return possible on its investments will obviously 
increase the funds available for the diocese to carry on its good 
work in the Arctic and in northern Quebec. The other two 
amendments are merely housekeeping items, necessary changes to 
the French text of the act to name the corporation, and the term 
corporation itself in French terms, which will bring the act into line 
with current French terminology.
<P>
<B>(1115)</B>
<P>
	On behalf of the Reform Party it gives me great pleasure to 
indicate our support for Bill S-15 and I call on the House for its 
speedy passage.

	The House resumed from April 10 consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jesse Flis (Parkdale-High Park, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to participate in the debate of Bill C-93, the budget 
implementation act, 1997.
<P>
	With all the election fever in the air, this may be the last 
opportunity in my political career to share with you and others 
some experiences I have had since the introduction of the last 
budget.
<P>
	It is peculiar that this last budget statement invoked very little 
response from my constituents in Parkdale-High Park who are as 
conscientious as they are diverse. As usual I received many 
representations from constituents before this year's budget 
presentation, but since the minister's statement I have had few 
comments that came to my attention.
<P>
	I recently had the opportunity to interview the hon. Minister of 
Finance on a local television station and I explained to him the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9629"> 9629 </A></B>
<P>
situation. In response the minister explained that the reason why 
Canadians have not reacted adversely to the last budget is because 
it was the  result of a process that incorporated the wants and needs 
of Canadians. The budget is proof that the government has listened 
to Canadians and responded accordingly.
<P>
	For this reason we can be proud of the popular participation of 
conscientious Canadians as it has reaped rewards like the child 
benefit act, expanded financial assistance for students in 
post-secondary studies, an extended interest in the Canada 
infrastructure program, and the list goes on.
<P>
	During my interview with the minister I asked him the questions 
I thought my constituents would ask him if they had the 
opportunity. Of particular interest in my constituency is the 
Canadian infrastructure program. One of the larger projects that 
has been undertaken as a result of the federal funding is the 
Western Beaches tunnel. This $57 million project will provide a 
conduit for the area's storm sewage so that it may be diverted to 
treatment plants, keeping Lake Ontario free of materials that 
prevent adults and children from enjoying the city beaches every 
time the temperature goes up above 25 degrees Celsius.
<P>
	Thousands of constituents and visitors are making excellent use 
of the new Western Beaches boardwalk, built not with boards but 
with a recycled plastic substance, making the boardwalk almost 
indestructible. Furthermore, the infrastructure works program has 
provided improved lighting and new paved roadways for High 
Park, a major attraction for the city's walkers, picnickers and 
tourists.
<P>
	Projects like these have had an impact on long term and short 
term employment as well as on relations between the federal, 
provincial and municipal governments in investing in our future. I 
emphasize the word ``investment'' as it is the predominant theme 
in the budget.
<P>
<B>(1205 )</B>
<P>
	An additional issue that has held the attention of many of my 
constituents is that of small business promotion. Parkdale-High 
Park is home to many small family run businesses. These 
businesses have multiplied over the years and have created 
communities that are renowned for their shopping and services.
<P>
	Throughout my riding one can find business improvement areas 
and associations, known as BIAs, that have engaged the interests of 
local business people to pool their resources in order to improve the 
local environment and attract consumers. Members of these BIAs, 
including the Parkdale Village BIA, Junction Gardens BIA, Bloor 
West Village, Roncesville Village and Bloor by the Park BIA, 
depend on programs like the Small Business Loans Act and the 
quarterly remittance of withholding amounts in order to stimulate 
their operations and assist them in reaching their markets. The 
presidents of the BIAs that I contacted for input on the recent 
budget statement were all pleased with the actions  the government 
had taken and encouraged the minister to stay the course.
<P>
	Speaking of staying the course, I assume that one of the 
fundamental reasons for Canadian support of the last budget is 
because they are pleased that the minister has committed to deficit 
reducing measures, and has not been swayed by the recent success 
of overachieving deficit targets. I am sure that everyone here is 
aware that the government surpassed its goals and reduced the 
Canadian deficit to the lowest among G-7 nations. This level is the 
lowest Canadians have experienced in 15 years and it is a testament 
to the excellent job the government is doing in controlling its 
spending and taxation activities.
<P>
	Canadians are proud to be in such economic good health but they 
are also wary that there is still a long way to go. For this reason the 
government has shown its prudence in not reversing the current 
trend. However, due to a combination of success and prudence, the 
government made no new program spending cuts in its last budget 
announcement. Instead it created new outlets for assistance to 
Canadian students, children below the poverty line and Canadians 
who are searching for jobs. These programs will cost the 
government less than $1 billion to implement and the result will be 
a great profit for all Canadians in the form of a preserved social 
safety net and a growing commitment to investment in Canada's 
future.
<P>
	The idea of investment takes on the guise of a theme throughout 
the budget. On this particular theme two initiatives spring to mind. 
The first is a child tax benefit for impoverished children and 
Canadian families, and the second is the government's 
commitment to post-secondary students, a demographic that is 
essential to the continued growth and prosperity of our nation.
<P>
	The issue of the child tax benefit is of great interest to me 
because I spent many years with the Toronto Board of Education 
where I was challenged to stimulate the attention of young children 
who came to school with hunger pains and the troubles associated 
with living below the poverty line.
<P>
	With the child tax benefit the government is increasing its 
current level of spending of $5.1 billion to $6 billion with the 
intention of increasing services and programs for poor working 
families such as child care, drug and dental benefits. This is a clear 
investment in the children who will one day grow up to be 
contributing members of society.
<P>
	Finally, I would like to spend a moment on the issue of 
post-secondary education and initiatives by the government to ease 
this pressing concern of students and parents across the country. 
Students are currently facing tuition increases in most 
post-secondary institutions. The fear of increased debt loads by 
students who need to borrow money to complete their studies is a 
great deterrent to potential.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9630"> 9630 </A></B>
<P>
	As a government we must do what we can to ensure that 
Canadian educational institutions will continue to produce highly 
educated adults who will be the next professionals and teachers 
for future generations. Through tax assistance and changes to the 
registered education savings plan, the RESP, student and parents 
will be better able to save and provide funds for those important 
years of study.
<P>
	The government has announced its intention to extend the 
interest free period for students facing hardships in repaying their 
loans from 18 to 30 months. Furthermore, the Minister of Human 
Resources Development will be looking into the possibility of 
negotiating with the provinces to alleviate part of the burden of a 
payment schedule for students.
<P>
<B>(1210)</B>
<P>
	The initiatives I have discussed are the ones I have gauged to be 
of the most interest to my constituents in my riding of 
Parkdale-High Park. These initiatives are clear responses to 
representations from my constituents and other Canadians who 
have shared their views with the government throughout its 
mandate. Canadians are content that their voices have been heard 
and they feel as if they have had a valuable hand in formulating the 
budgetary process.
<P>
	I would like to conclude by applying this public confidence and 
participation to a more global context. I recently had the honour to 
represent Canada at the Liberal International meeting, hosted by 
China. This nation has indicated that it is open to the ideas of 
liberalism which guide many North American and European 
national policies.
<P>
	During the nine day meeting, I spent a great deal of time 
discussing the virtues of public participation in Canada's 
democratic society. The Chinese were interested to learn how our 
budget process works, along with the decision making process for 
deficit targets and monetary policies. I believe that the Canadian 
system stands as a perfect example of how the public can become 
involved in the political process by speaking up and being heard. 
What Canadians have been saying and what the government has 
been hearing is: Stay the course.
<P>
	My course will be to exit this Chamber after the 35th Parliament 
is dissolved. Before doing so, I wish to thank you, Mr. Speaker, for 
ensuring objectivity and fairness to the democratic process. You 
protected the rights of every elected member in the House, 
regardless of party affiliation or sitting as independent members. 
You also brought into the House outstanding Canadians, such as 
former parliamentarians, well known artists, outstanding athletes 
and photographers. You made all of us feel at home in our House of 
Commons.
<P>
	I would like to express my appreciation to the table officers, the 
pages, the interpreters and the Library of Parliament for making my 
work easier and more effective.
<P>
	During each of the four terms that I was elected, I was sent here 
to serve my constituents, to make Canada a better country in which 
to live and to represent Canada abroad. I was able to do so 
effectively, thanks to the support resources on the Hill, within the 
House of Commons and outside the Chamber, especially in 
committees.
<P>
	To all individuals, departments, researchers, media, staff and all 
the others who I would like to mention but do not have the time, my 
sincere appreciation for all of their support.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
morning we now have 71 minutes left to talk about the latest 
budget, about Bill C-93, the Budget Implementation Act, 1997, and 
the motion to refer the bill to committee before second reading.
<P>
	As the member for the beautiful riding of Frontenac in Quebec 
and as a member of the Bloc Quebecois, the official opposition, I 
can hardly be expected to be enthusiastic about the latest budget 
which as far as I am concerned is a lot of smoke and mirrors. This 
is an electoral budget.
<P>
	First of all, when the Liberal Party came to power on October 25, 
1993, about three and a half years ago, the Conservative deficit was 
around $42 billion. For the current year, the deficit should be 
around $17 billion. Sure, the deficit went down by $25 billion, 
because the minister was able to take advantage of favourable 
economic trends and because of the drastic and often brutal cuts he 
made in his budget.
<P>
	First of all, let us remind the Minister of Finance that today the 
employment insurance fund has a $6 billion surplus.
<P>
<B>(1215)</B>
<P>
	So what did they do to get this $6 billion dollars? They kept 
employer and employee premiums very high. They reduced the 
time during which workers who lose their jobs can receive benefits. 
They also increased the number of hours worked-we now talk 
about hours-people need to qualify.
<P>
	Furthermore, 1 per cent of 55 per cent is deducted for every 20 
weeks a worker draws employment insurance. If a worker receives 
employment insurance every year, after 20 weeks of benefits he 
will reach the minimum, which is 50 per cent of his eligible 
earnings.
<P>
	So there is a $6 billion surplus the government uses year after 
year to reduce its deficit. It also cut $4.5 billion in transfers to the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9631"> 9631 </A></B>
<P>
provinces. In other words, the government has offloaded a 
substantial part of its deficit  onto the provinces, including Quebec. 
The Quebec government also has to make cuts in transfers to 
municipalities and school boards. This is a chain reaction. You kick 
your neighbour, who kicks the next person, and so forth.
<P>
	What I really want to condemn this morning, during the 10 
minutes I am allowed, are the promises made but not kept in the 
notorious red book that was distributed across Canada. Today, we 
are looking for copies to give our constituents before the next 
election, but they have become very rare. I am willing to pay a lot 
for the red books that were being circulated in 1993, just like Mao's 
little red book. I suppose the Liberal Party, in its shame, has 
collected all the red books and burnt them.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, you know the Prime Minister often has a colourful 
choice of words. He said they were going to scrap, and I imagine he 
meant tear up, the GST legislation. And now, less than three and a 
half years later, instead of scrapping the GST, he is doing 
everything he can to hide it. In fact, he gave $960 million, nearly $1 
billion, to three small maritime provinces for harmonizing his GST 
with their provincial sales tax, the so-called harmonized sales tax, 
the HST. So that is what the Prime Minister and the Minister of 
Finance did to make us accept the fact that the GST would no 
longer exist, at least in part of the country.
<P>
	I may remind the Minister of Finance that he is not being fair to 
all citizens of this country. Two weeks ago, in a pre-election tour of 
my new riding, I met the mayor of Saint-Ludger, in the Beauce 
region, who asked me: ``Why is the government not treating 
Quebec fairly? How does it explain giving $1 billion to harmonize 
the GST in the Maritimes, when we in Quebec did it in 1991 with 
Robert Bourassa, the Liberal premier in Quebec at the time, and 
Brian Mulroney, the Conservative Prime Minister?'' Mr. Mulroney 
had the courage to create the GST, and it is the cause of his 
downfall to a large extent and of the Conservative Party's being 
swept out of office in all but two ridings in Canada.
<P>
	So, Brian Mulroney and Robert Bourassa agreed in Quebec to 
harmonize their sales taxes, the GST and the QST. The Government 
of Quebec collects them, while, in the case of the maritimes, 
Ottawa will be collecting them. Year in and year out, it costs the 
government in Ottawa some $60 million, because we split the cost 
of recovering the government's GST fifty-fifty.
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	What does this government give the Quebec government in 
exchange for having harmonized in good faith in 1991? Zilch. It 
gives it nothing. This government is not treating Quebec taxpayers 
fairly. And Frank McKenna is using the money he gets from the 
federal government to pay for advertising to lure our industry 
away.
<P>
	Another fine promise I would like to look at in the now extinct 
famous red book is the slogan of ``jobs, jobs, jobs''. I was listening 
to the Prime Minister saying in a speech last week: ``We have 
created 675,000 jobs in the past three years''. In my region, while I 
was taking part in the opening of a new store known as 
Intermarché, the owner told me they were going to create 55 new 
jobs. At the end, off in a corner, I said: ``You are going to create 55 
new jobs, that is great. However, will there be layoffs in the other 
stores you will be getting your customers from?'' He said: ``Well, 
sir, one thing leads to another. Nothing is wasted in nature. I will 
create 55 jobs here, so 55 jobs will be cut somewhere else''. The 
fact that there is a new Intermarché in Plessisville is not going to 
cause people to go grocery shopping three times a week.
<P>
	It is the same story in the restaurant business. A new restaurant is 
opening on rue Notre-Dame, creating 43 new jobs. But I would 
expect there will be 43 layoffs in other restaurants.
<P>
	I could remind the Prime Minister, who is going on about how he 
has created ``jobs, jobs, jobs'', that we have never, since the terrible 
economic crisis of the 1930s, seen an unemployment rate as high as 
this go on for so long.
<P>
	Three weeks ago, one of my constituents turned up unannounced 
at my office with his tax returns. He asked my secretary if he could 
meet with me. Naturally, I saw him, but I wondered why he had 
brought along his tax returns. This was a man of 66, retired from 
the asbestos mines. Before sending off his tax returns, he had to add 
a cheque in the neighbourhood of $3,000 to each envelope, the one 
for the Government of Quebec and the one for Ottawa. I said to 
him: ``Why don't you help us bring about sovereignty for 
Quebec?'' Instead of having two agriculture ministers, a Prime 
Minister and a provincial premier, two industry ministers and so 
on, two of everything, you would just send your cheque to one 
place. Of course, the one cheque would be much higher but, 
proportionally speaking, you would pay a bit less and you would 
get better service''. Right now, we have a premier, who is working 
to help Quebecers, and a Prime Minister, who is doing anything 
but.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I request another 30 seconds in which to wrap up, 
30 seconds to talk about the results of the Gallup poll that came out 
this morning. It says that a majority of Canadians, 45 per cent, say 
we are worse off today, after four years of Liberal government, 
worse off today after what this Prime Minister's Liberal 
government is going to try to make us believe during the next 
election campaign. The Gallup poll results appeared on page 7 of 
this morning's <I>La Presse</I>.
<P>
	I take this opportunity to urge you to be wary and not to swallow 
everything you hear from politicians.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9632"> 9632 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure today to speak on the budget debate. In the 
10 minutes that I have I would like try to dispel some big myths. 
The government has been making misrepresentations to the 
Canadian public over the last three years in what it claims to be 
doing with its budget and its fiscal, macro and micro economic 
policies. The reality is that the financial situation is very different 
from what the government portrays it to be. Members of the 
government have repeatedly said a number of things that do not 
represent the real economic situation of the country.
<P>
<B>(1225)</B>
<P>
	I would like to go through a few of them. The first myth the 
government likes to put forward is that it does not increase taxes. In 
my hand I have a list of over 30 tax increases that the government 
instituted since it came into power.
<P>
	I will mention a few of them. The lifetime capital gains 
exemption was eliminated. The tax on private corporations 
dividends was increased. The air transportation tax all Canadians 
pay as they go through an airport was increased. The corporate 
surtax was increased. The excise tax on gasoline was increased, 
something that affects everyone, in particular people on fixed 
incomes.
<P>
	There was a reduction of $8,000 in RRSP overcontribution. This 
is at a time when the government is telling people that the CPP is in 
a bit of trouble, that it will have to take some extreme measures to 
save it and that in future they had better look forward to trying to 
provide for themselves. What did the government do? It prevented 
people from actually taking care of themselves by saving money 
for future retirement.
<P>
	It increased EI premiums from 3 per cent to 3.07 per cent. There 
have been a total of four increases in the CPP premium. That is a 
tax. It has gone from under 5 per cent to 9.9 per cent. That is what 
the government has done.
<P>
	It is completely disingenuous to say there have been no new tax 
increases. There have been lots of them. That is not the way to get 
our fiscal house in order. The way to do it is to cut sensibly and 
compassionately, get rid of the waste, priorize spending, and 
priorize the money the people of Canada give to the government 
and spend it wisely on those things government does best.
<P>
	Some would argue that increased tax on corporations is a good 
thing. When corporations are taxed it is the public that is being 
taxed. All those taxes fall on to the consumer to pay. It is not a tax 
on somebody who has deep pockets. It is not a tax on somebody 
who has a lot of money. It is not a tax on people with seven-digit 
incomes. It is a tax that has to be passed on to the consumer.
<P>
	Further, taxing corporations will make them unable to compete 
within and outside Canada. That puts Canadians out of work. 
Hence the fact that our unemployment rate has been hovering 
around 10 per cent, the worst since the depression.
<P>
	The government says it is a defender of medicare. It says it has 
put about $500 million into it. Bravo, but how could it possibly put 
$500 million into medicare when it has just removed $7 billion 
from education, health and welfare? It does not add up.
<P>
	The government likes to say it is interested in jobs, jobs, jobs. As 
I mentioned before, the job situation is completely appalling.
<P>
	There are things that can be done. This is not rocket science. 
There are real life examples of measures the government could 
institute to enable us to get our house in order. Where are they?
<P>
	Two places come to mind. First is Alberta. Alberta is the top 
fiscal performer in Canada and in North America. It is the best. 
Why? It has cut sensibly, is now running a budget surplus and can 
bring down its debt, the real ogre in the situation. By bringing down 
the debt, the structural changes necessary can be put forward to get 
social programs in order and bring in tax relief. In essence, it 
provides economic impetus that puts people back to work and 
enables Canadian companies to be more competitive.
<P>
<B>(1230 )</B>
<P>
	New Zealand is the other real time example. Instead of 
increasing taxes it drops taxes. Other countries such as Lebanon are 
doing the same. As a result, there has been a huge influx of capital 
and investment into these countries which has enabled them to 
create jobs and to become more economically aggressive.
<P>
	There is no reason we cannot do this today. I suggest the 
government take a few suggestions from countries that have done 
something good for their people. There is more we can do. The 
government should have listened to the plan we gave it three years 
ago. My colleagues put forward a budget that would have given the 
government the ability to balance the budget by 1997. If it had 
taken the plan we put forward, the budget would be balanced. We 
would be running a surplus. We could have reduced debt and 
provided tax relief to all Canadians. Did the government do this? 
No, it did not.
<P>
	Our party also put forward sensible solutions to decrease 
interprovincial trade barriers to prevent blocks to commerce within 
the country that prevent companies from being competitive across 
the border.
<P>
	We also need to improve our education system. Making it more 
attuned to the needs of the 21st century is absolutely essential if we 
are to be competitive in the future. Similarly enabling students to 
have enough money to pay for their education is important. 
Students  cannot do this if they cannot get jobs and once they are 
educated there are no jobs for them.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9633"> 9633 </A></B>
<P>
	A massive brain drain is currently taking place. Our best and 
brightest students are going to other countries because they cannot 
get jobs in Canada. Furthermore, many who stay in here are finding 
it impossible to work in what they are good at. They wind up taking 
jobs for which they are overqualified. It is a huge waste of the best 
and brightest.
<P>
	We need to do many other things. Above all we need to institute 
confidence in the Canadian public, Canadian corporations and 
foreign investors. It is impossible to do so if we continue to 
mismanage the finances and the fiscal responsibilities of the 
government.
<P>
	Plans have been given to the government yet it has chosen for 
political expediency not to listen. If the government were to take 
the bull by the horns and put forth solutions, the public would fall 
in behind it. The public would say it has a government that is 
making decisions, that is taking action, that is not trying to be ruled 
by opinion polls and focus groups, and that is prepared to put forth 
sensible, effective solutions to the problems.
<P>
	The government must consider several points. It has to get its 
fiscal house in order, bring our deficit to zero and decrease the debt 
and taxes. It has to provide strong educational support to the 
students and get rid of egregious restrictions, rules and regulations 
that prevent our companies from being the best they can be. It 
should take a leaf out of the books of other countries, look at what 
has been done there, look at what has been successful, employ it 
here, and above all else act.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Graham (Rosedale, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to be recognized to speak on the important budget we were 
privileged to assist in presenting to the House recently. I could not 
disagree more with the words of the member for Esquimalt-Juan 
de Fuca. The budget responds to the needs of the country. It 
responds to the needs of the people of my province of Ontario. It 
strongly responds to the needs of the people who live in Rosedale.
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	Rosedale is a complicated riding. It is an inner city riding with a 
great diversity of talent and background in its population. Its 
workforce is spread between those who work in some of the major 
financial institutions, mining companies and other big companies 
located in Toronto and those who have modest earnings in the 
southern part of the riding, some of whom are subject to the 
pressures of living in an expensive urban environment where they 
are dependent on social housing and welfare to survive.
<P>
	It is important that budget has achieved the need to get our fiscal 
house in order. It has stayed the course in that extraordinarily 
important enterprise. As a result we are seeing the fiscal integrity 
of the country being restored.  As a result of interest rates being low 
we are seeing more investment and a return of jobs for Canadians. 
In that sense the budget is making its most important contribution 
to the underlying economy of the country and the well-being of all 
Canadians wherever they may be located.
<P>
	It is a budget, however, that does not follow the tenets of the 
party the member from Esquimalt spoke for. It does not seek to 
achieve fiscal rectitude on the backs of the poor and the 
disadvantaged. On the contrary, the budget has enabled us to 
address some very serious problems in society. I do not intend to go 
into all of them, but in my riding there is no doubt the budget's 
concentration on the need for reform of the old age security system 
country and the Canada pension plan has enabled seniors, the most 
disadvantaged, to say we are looking at a system that will address 
their needs. We are guaranteeing the preservation of a healthy, sane 
and intelligent policy for sustaining the seniors population into the 
future. That has to be one of the great contributions of the budget.
<P>
	In the budget we have addressed another great problem facing 
many of us, the extraordinary issue of youth poverty. We cannot 
afford and should not further tolerate the problem of young people 
and children living in poverty. Nothing can be accomplished 
overnight. The seeds have been sown in the budget. The child tax 
benefit and other measures taken in the budget will help address 
this extraordinarily important social problem.
<P>
	The budget contains a hopeful message for youth. It contains 
specific programs for youth employment, some innovative, useful 
and important programs to enable young people to get their first 
jobs.
<P>
	The budget addresses the future, perhaps one of its most exciting 
aspects. The Minister of Finance made it clear to the Canadian 
people, to the government and to those of us in the House that we 
must have an intelligent policy for our future. If we are to have a 
future at all in a complicated, integrated global society in which we 
must remain competitive we must be able to deal with knowledge. 
We must deal with our survival in the most sophisticated manner. 
We must have a proper balanced approach to investment in 
research and development.
<P>
	In that sense the construction of the Canada Foundation for 
Innovation is one of the most innovative and important steps any 
government has taken in a long time in this respect.
<P>
	I would like to take the time of the House to read the comments 
of one of my constituents, the president of the University of 
Toronto, on the budget. He drew the attention of the public to the 
importance of the budget from a university perspective. In a recent 
publication he wrote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>February was a banner month for the University of Toronto and all other Canadian 
universities. The federal budget, containing the best news for Canadian research in 
many years,  represents a new beginning for Canada and moves universities to a central 
place on the nation's agenda. It deserves the enthusiastic support not only of </BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9634"> 9634 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>universities but of all U of T alumni and all Canadians who believe in a more 
prosperous future built on ideas and innovation.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The budget commits the government to critically important investments in 
Canada's future. It allows us to begin restoring the international competitiveness of 
our universities and teaching hospitals; it helps students and their families meet the 
rising costs of higher education; and it encourages the private sector to give more 
generously in support of public purposes.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The $800-million Canada Foundation for Innovation announced in the budget is a 
historic reaffirmation of the federal government's responsibility for research and 
innovation. We are extremely proud of the fact that the foundation will be headed by 
Dr. John Evans, an alumnus and one of U of T's most distinguished presidents-The 
foundation will help build critically important research facilities across Canada, 
facilities that will attract and retain Canada's outstanding scientists and enable them 
to unleash their full creative potential. In full partnership with the provinces and the 
private sector, this program will create new opportunities and jobs for the next 
generation of Canadians.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The decision announced in the budget to make the federal Centres of Excellence 
program a permanent part of our national science and technology policy ensures a 
secure foundation for partnership between universities and the private sector. The 
overwhelming success of the centres over the past 10 years fully justifies this vote of 
confidence.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	The president went on to say that the tax incentives to be 
provided for students are a very important contribution to enable 
affordable university education for students and that the improved 
tax treatment of charitable donations would help unlock private 
wealth for public purposes. The budget has thus contributed as well 
to the welfare of our universities and other public institutions.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I believe that we must say a few words about this centre, or 
foundation, for innovation, because a number of Quebec MPs have 
criticized the budget and also the creation of this foundation.
<P>
	It must be acknowledged that the purpose of the foundation is to 
enhance Canada's R &amp; D capacity on the national level. In deciding 
which projects will be funded, therefore, the foundation will be 
more concerned with research excellence than with allocation by 
province.
<P>
	A significant research potential is available from one end of 
Canada to the other. For example, Atlantic Canada distinguishes 
itself in the area of ocean and fisheries research; Saskatchewan, in 
biotechnology; Quebec and Ontario, in pharmacology; and Alberta 
and British Columbia, in sustainable forestry, to give but a few 
examples.
<P>
	The foundation has the capacity to examine in depth all of the 
proposals for funding research and other  crucial sectors, giving 
priority to quality projects. What is more, the bill calls for the 
foundation board to reflect regional diversity and to have equal 
representation from research and from business.
<P>
	Everything points to the regional representativity of the council 
and the expertise of its researcher and business leader membership 
guaranteeing a fair and equitable distribution of funding while 
reflecting regional realities. 
<P>
	I would like to add that the president of the University of 
Toronto's reaction to the announcement of the foundation's 
creation in last February's budget was that it would make a huge 
contribution to the national infrastructure required to promote a 
knowledge-based economy.
<P>
	I was, therefore, interested and somewhat astonished to hear the 
hon. member for Verchères criticize the budget and express regrets 
that the Varennes tokamak project in Quebec was no longer being 
funded. Yet it is that budget which has funded a major institution in 
order to enable it to carry out such research, and if this project 
merits funding, it will have the opportunity to get the money it 
needs. And that is exactly what has to be done.
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
	In closing, I will return to what I said at the start: this is a 
well-balanced budget, and one which has acknowledged the need to 
bring the deficit under control, while making it possible for the less 
advantaged in this country to survive.
<P>
	On behalf of my constituents of Rosedale in Toronto Centre, I 
wish to state that this budget will be accepted as one of the best the 
Parliament of Canada has ever seen.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise in the 
House today to speak to Bill C-93, an act to implement certain 
provisions of the budget tabled in Parliament on February 18 by the 
Minister of Finance.
<P>
	This bill, which was tabled last week, proposes measures to 
implement the government's latest budget. It was tabled just last 
week, and the government wants to use the fast track to refer the 
bill without delay to the finance committee for consideration.
<P>
	As we all know, the main objective of the latest federal budget is 
to fight the deficit, but at the expense of the provinces, with cuts of 
$4.5 billion in transfers to the provinces, and at the expense of the 
most vulnerable in our society, with cuts affecting health care, 
education and social assistance.
<P>
	This was a very harsh budget. Today, we read in the results of a 
Gallup poll that Canadians feel they are worse off than they were 
four years ago. It is the truth. Most Canadians feel they are worse 
off than they were four years ago when the Liberals were elected.
<P>
	The article in <I>La Presse</I> says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The majority (45 per cent) of respondents believe that they are worse off now than in 
1993, in other words, since the Liberals  came to power in Ottawa. A little less than one </BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9635"> 9635 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>third (32 per cent) feel they are now better off, while one fifth (20 per cent) have seen 
no noticeable difference in their lives during these past four years.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In practically all age groups, negative responses predominate. 
This is particularly obvious in the 50 to 64 age group, where only 
16 per cent of respondents said they felt they were better off and54 per cent said they were worse off. There you have the Liberal 
government's disastrous record for the past four years.
<P>
	However, the 1997-98 budget contains no job creation measures. 
Worse yet, the federal government has been the main source of 
collective layoffs during the past years: 45,000 public servants lost 
their jobs. And because of cuts made by the provinces, because of 
the reduction in transfers of federal funding, hundreds of thousands 
of people have lost their jobs in provincial and municipal 
governments and in our school boards. In Canada generally, 
200,000 people lost their jobs at provincial and federal levels.
<P>
	As I said earlier, I represent Bourassa, a riding in Montreal 
which is now the unemployment capital. The federal government 
has done nothing. It appointed a minister to look after Toronto but 
did nothing of the sort for Montreal.
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	As regards the deterioration of Canadians' situation, I have here 
figures on poverty for the year 1995, a report from the National 
Council of Welfare. In its report, the council says that the statistics 
on poverty for 1995 were alarming. Growing family poverty raised 
the overall poverty rate to 17.4 per cent and the number of 
Canadians living in poverty to close to 5.1 million, a new record for 
the past 16 years. The number of such people was higher in 1995 
than in the darkest period in the two recent recessions.
<P>
	As far as children are concerned, the rising level of family 
poverty has caused a corresponding increase in poverty among 
children. In 1995, the level of poverty among children reached20.5 per cent, and the number of poor children was over 1.4 
million. This is the highest figure ever reached in the past 13 years. 
Those are the statistics for 1995. We are in 1997, and the situation 
has got even worse.
<P>
	The immigrants form another sector of the population becoming 
increasingly poor in Canada. What does the report say? The levels 
of poverty among single people born in Canada and families where 
the heads of households were born here are invariably lower than 
those of corresponding groups of immigrants. In 1995, for single 
people born in Canada, the rate was 34.9 per cent and for those who 
had immigrated to Canada, it was 42.8 per cent. The poverty rate 
for heads of households born in Canada was 12.9 per cent, while it 
was 20.3 per cent for those who were born elsewhere.
<P>
	In addition, the government has imposed a tax of $975 on 
immigrants, including refugees. These days, Canada is the only 
country in the world to impose a tax on refugees, which 
contravenes the Geneva convention.
<P>
	We have said that the level of poverty is increasing among old 
people, especially among people who have lost their jobs. At the 
age of 45 or 50 they are no longer able to find work. The 
government has made the situation worse by eliminating the 
program for older workers adjustment.
<P>
	The situation is very serious in my riding in Montréal-Nord, but 
there are also signs of hope. I took part in the inauguration of the 
Montréal-Nord CDEC, the Corporation de développement 
économique et communautaire. Discussions have been going on for 
five years, and this was my priority when I was elected a member 
of Parliament. The CDEC finally began operations in February.
<P>
	The Government of Quebec made a contribution to the CDEC, as 
did Montreal North, but there has not yet been anything from the 
Government of Canada, which was to put in $170,000. I take this 
opportunity to pay tribute to the exceptional work done to date by 
the CDEC's president, Claude Tessier, and by the chairman of its 
board of directors, Yves Deslauriers.
<P>
	I also pay tribute to another organization that does a lot for the 
people of Montréal-Nord, the Montréal-Nord chamber of 
commerce founded in 1947, which is celebrating its 50th 
anniversary this year. It has made a major contribution to the 
economic development of our city. I would also like to pay tribute 
to its president, Richard Bertrand, and its executive director, Olive 
Lebeau.
<P>
	This 1997 budget falls down in many areas. We are going to 
point these areas out in the election campaign to be launched in two 
weeks' time.
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	We are going to talk about the Liberal government's broken 
promises. We are going to attack the government for its total failure 
in the fight against unemployment. We are going to condemn this 
government that has cut tax credits for workers' funds, particularly 
the Quebec workers' solidarity fund, an important tool for the 
creation of lasting jobs. We are going to talk about the Liberal 
government's terrible record over the last four years.

<P>
	I have had the opportunity to speak to the last three budgets 
and each time the conclusion is inescapable. The Minister of 
Finance still does not have it right.
<P>
	Government generated debt and the resulting tax burden is 
placing many Canadians in a position of financial hopelessness, 
unable to get ahead and forced to survive with a current personal 
debt load equivalent to 95 per cent of their annual personal 
disposable income. This has grown since 1982 from 62 per cent. 
This administration has picked Canadians' pockets for a further 
$24 billion in taxes.
<P>
	Before I turn to parts II, III and IV of Bill C-93 on the tobacco 
taxation issue, I would like to make a few comments regarding the 
manner in which the Indian affairs department is run and offer a 
few suggestions on what the government could do to improve the 
legacy of poverty that grips so many members of First Nations.
<P>
	In 1976-77, not so very long ago, total government departmental 
spending for the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development was $587 million. Today that number is $4.3 billion. 
This is an increase of 2.4 per cent over last year's budget. All of 
this for 573,000 status Indians registered under the Indian Act, 
about 2 per cent of Canada's population.
<P>
	This sink hole of spending is sad because we have continued 
misery and a sense of hopelessness where so many of our native 
people live and continue to live. Despite the spending restraint 
placed on all other government departments, the spending of the 
Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development to 
1998-99 will grow an accumulative 12.7 per cent during the term of 
this government compared with a decline of 24.4 per cent in other 
departments. This is the only federal department in which spending 
in 1998-99 will be higher than in 1994-95. It has a history of 
misguided priorities where the current minister feels that 
maintaining this native dependency on the federal treasury will 
deliver these people to self-sufficiency. This is a cruel hoax.
<P>
	Furthermore, the Canadian taxpayer is suffering because despite 
all the federal largesse and misguided paternalism, the status 
Indians who live on reserves do not pay income, property or sales 
taxes on purchases sold on or delivered to their reserves. The 
department is totally compromised on this taxation issue.
<P>
	Section 87 of the Indian Act is surely an outdated, out of step 
section of the act which protects and maintains this 
counterproductive exemption.
<P>
	Total government spending for Indians for all departments runs 
$7 billion. This excludes the taxation exemption or forgone 
revenue which results from section 87 of the Indian Act. Reform's 
position on section 87 is clear. We saw some signs in the Nisga'a 
negotiations and Sechelt negotiations in British Columbia where 
the  federal government is not dealing straight on the taxation issue.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	We have also seen how this tax exemption creates a 
circumstance where there is no mandate for any other federal 
department on reserves. For example, the Department of National 
Revenue has no mandate. This has entrenched a longstanding, 
self-serving mandate by the Department of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development, which has been very counterproductive.
<P>
	This artificial financial arrangement has also led to many 
economic dislocations. Lower wages have been justified by the 
government, lower welfare rates, all kinds of things have been 
lowered on reserves because of the absence of taxation on these 
kinds of schemes. In my view this is very counterproductive and in 
the view of many others.
<P>
	In hindsight the anecdotal evidence is that native run businesses 
with a focus on taxation exemption have not been nearly as 
successful as native run businesses which have operated with the 
same entrepreneurial focus as off reserve businesses.
<P>
	To really demonstrate that none of this shows that the taxation 
exemption is really working, one could ask why are 43 per cent of 
on reserve natives in Canada on welfare. There are certainly some 
people getting bloated on the morass of spending. One place is the 
Hull bunker for the department of Indian affairs which houses 
34,000 bureaucrats. Accompanying these public servants are 
consultants, negotiators, lawyers and advisers, all taking a piece of 
the $7 billion in action and keeping the myth and their club 
memberships alive.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> An Indian industry.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> It is an Indian industry that has made some very 
rich.
<P>
	We have before us today another half step, somewhat like the 
initiative of Bill C-79 that allows modifications in the application 
of the Indian Act for certain First Nations. It is a tinkering and at 
this rate with 600 First Nations we may address section 87 tax 
exemptions by the third millennium if we are lucky.
<P>
	This legislation in Bill C-93 is very much a British Columbia 
specific initiative. Part II of the bill before us will enable the 
Cowichan Indian tribes to impose a tax on sales of tobacco to 
Indians on reserves of the Cowichan tribes. The Cowichan tribe is 
essentially mandated by the legislation to collect a tax from its own 
membership similar to the way the province currently collects 
tobacco taxes off reserve. The tobacco taxation provisions for on 
reserve sales to Indians vary by province and are very complex in 
British Columbia.
<P>
	In some provinces there is no on reserve provincial tobacco tax 
exemption at all. It is a hodge-podge, getting hodgier and podgier.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9637"> 9637 </A></B>
<P>
	To further supplement the application of the first tax in section 
2, section 3 of Bill C-93 will enable the Cowichan tribes to impose 
a second tax or 7 per cent value added tax on sales of tobacco 
on reserve. One might compare this to the GST which is exempt 
for tobacco sales on reserve to band members.
<P>
	Part IV of Bill C-93 enables another First Nation, the West Bank 
First Nation, to impose a 7 per cent value added tax on all sales of 
tobacco products on its reserves. The West Bank band provisions 
do not include the provincial equivalent taxation provisions that 
apply on this bill to the Cowichan tribe.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	I have raised the issue of native taxation many times both in and 
out of the House and I have received the rebuke and bluster of the 
minister. His approach, like his predecessors, is to maintain more 
or less the status quo.
<P>
	The government now spends more on natives than it did three 
years ago. The Indian Act has not been amended, let alone 
repealed. Accountability for funding is no closer to acceptable 
procedures, and complaints from many quarters about 
undemocratic band elections remain unaddressed. Here we have 
complexities in our taxation scheme in Canada being assailed from 
all sides. A simplification need is apparent.
<P>
	Whose agenda is fulfilled by this initiative? Legislative 
tinkering has become a substitute for substance and vision from 
this government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Murray Calder (Wellington-Grey-Dufferin-Simcoe, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the overall thrust of this budget has been 
restoring Canada's fiscal health. The deficit for 1996-97 will be no 
more than $19 billion; $5.3 billion less than the target of $24.3 
billion set in the 1996 budget.
<P>
	The target for 1997-98 is $17 billion and for 1998-99 it is $9 
billion. By 1998-99 the deficit is expected to be 1 per cent of GDP 
with no new borrowings. On top of that these projections are based 
on prudent assumptions and include a contingency reserve to cover 
any unpredictable events.
<P>
	There is more to this budget than just the figures I have talked 
about, particularly for the agricultural community. I know the 
chairman of the standing committee on agriculture is going to be 
very interested in what I have to say about this. This is the national 
advantage. It is by far a better way of looking at agriculture than 
what the Reform Party, heckling me from the other side, has come 
up with so far.
<P>
	All stakeholders in our agriculture and agri-food sector stand to 
gain substantially in net benefits from being included within the 
larger Canadian federation. Together as a strong and modern 
unified nation we as an industry are indeed much greater than the 
mere sum of our  individual parts. That is what the Reform regional 
approach is about.
<P>
	By being Canadian we have access to a valuable domestic 
agricultural marketplace serving 30 million people, valued at more 
than $70 billion per year. While some interprovincial barriers still 
continue as impediments, over 90 per cent of our agricultural food 
products flow freely from coast to coast aided by federally 
developed standards. This is underpinned by the mobility of human 
technology and by financial resources and a single monetary 
system.
<P>
	By being Canadian we all benefit from national regulatory 
policies which, for example, created and sustained our made in 
Canada supply management system for dairy, poultry and egg 
producers. No one province alone would be able to do so. The 
financial fiscal policies of this government have resulted in a 
dramatic drop in interest rates. That has saved thousands of dollars 
in input costs for farmers and the agri-food business in every corner 
of the country. It is by far a much better system than the tax cuts 
that are put forward by the Reform Party. National taxation policies 
which include unique advantages for agriculture are available to all 
Canadian farmers.
<P>
	By being Canadian we all gain from Canada's international 
credibility and influence earned through 129 years of nationhood. 
Our reputation for the highest quality and reliability is an 
invaluable asset, something the Reform Party would try to destroy, 
the respectful manner in which we deal with our customers.
<P>
<B>(1310 )</B>
<P>
	Our unified Team Canada approach to trade missions in dealing 
with trade disputes has had a strong role for Canada to play in the 
WTO, the Cairns Group, the Quad Group, the APEC the 
Commonwealth, the UN and the G-7. In short, worldwide goodwill 
about Canada gives us the advantage that could not easily be 
duplicated. By being Canadian we all enjoy substantial economies 
of scale. This is important for our bargaining clout in dealing with 
both consumers and competitors.
<P>
	It is important in running a world class inspection and quarantine 
system, the cost of which would be prohibitive on a provincial 
basis. It is important in the field of science and technology where 
we have the leading edge in research and development facilities 
distributed nationally according to local natural advantages with all 
the accumulated knowledge networked to everyone regardless of 
location.
<P>
	The 1997 budget funding for the Canadian Foundation for 
Innovation can be used in support of research into biotechnology 
and other agricultural sciences. Our national advantage is 
impossible to quantify but it is hugely important. It is a 
combination of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9638"> 9638 </A></B>
<P>
synergy, strength, equity and compassion which is the envy of the  
world, and our government is committed to building it even better.
<P>
	Budget levels for the key responsibilities of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food Canada, research adaptation, safety nets and inspection, 
were maintained, ensuring the department would be able to 
continue to meet the needs of the sector. In maintaining spending 
for these key areas, the 1997 budget responds to the needs of the 
sector for stability.
<P>
	The government is working toward a growing, competitive, 
market oriented agriculture and agri-food industry, one that is 
profitable, responsive to changing needs of domestic and 
international customers and less dependent on subsidization; one 
that contributes to the well-being of all Canadians and the quality 
of life in rural Canada and one that generates farm financial 
security, environmental stability and a safe and high quality food 
supply.
<P>
	Significant progress has been made toward these goals but more 
remains to be accomplished. Strong partnerships with all the 
stakeholders are key to the further success. To this end the Minister 
of Agriculture and Agri-Food has been consulted extensively with 
all the agri-food sectors in all the regions through a series of round 
table meetings across the country, a national conference on 
Canadian excellence in agriculture and agri-food held in Winnipeg 
in June 1996, and a prebudget meeting with all stakeholders this 
December. The output of this effort is a practical business plan 
which portrays the ambitions of our sector as we head into the 21st 
century and lays out an agenda for action for governments, farmers 
and farm organizations, agri-food business and other stakeholders 
as we together strive to achieve our future goals.
<P>
	Examples of this consultative process between government and 
agriculture and agri-food sectors that reflect this desire to move 
together are numerous. It is hard to put a figure on it.
<P>
	The Canadian adaptation rural and development fund, for 
instance, is providing $60 million annually to support 
diversification, value added processing, market development, 
innovation and job creation. The national biomass ethanol program 
will help support financing of ethanol plants across the country. 
This is the fuel of the 21st century. The pesticide management 
advisory council and economic management advisory committees 
are being established right now to better foster communication and 
co-ordination of pest management issues. The Farm Credit 
Corporation has introduced new programs which will provide long 
term stability. A national agricultural environment committee, 
made up of farm leaders, has been tasked with providing the federal 
government, the federal minister of agriculture, with advice on new 
policies, research and development and key agricultural 
environmental indicators. The Canadian Agri-Food Marketing 
Council will provide strategic  sectoral advice on how to make the 
most of the available market development programs.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	I could go on and on with this good news. We must continue to 
let more and more people know that agriculture and agri-food in 
Canada accounts for 8.7 per cent of our gross domestic product. 
Two million Canadians' jobs are dependent both directly and 
indirectly on the health of the agri-food sector which presently 
generates $17.5 billion in exports annually. We are going to go over 
the top of $20 billion by the end of the century.
<P>
	The Canadian agri-food sector is on the leading edge of highly 
sophisticated science and technology. Canadian agriculture is a 
leader in environmental stability. It is one of our base industries.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> Resuming debate, the hon. 
member for Peace River. I should warn him that at 1.21 p.m., under 
the special order adopted by the House last Thursday, I will be 
obliged to interrupt the debate and put the question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, that was 
the longest one minute I have ever heard.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Calder:</B> But it's good news.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Penson:</B> I am glad to be part of the debate on Bill C-93. We 
have to put things in perspective when talking about a budget 
implementation bill. My perspective focuses on something that 
members on the Liberal side of the House have not talked about in 
this debate, the $111 billion they have added to the national debt in 
the past three and a half years.
<P>
	An equal amount of debt has been generated by the 
Conservatives and the Liberals, over $300 billion each in their 
mandates. It only took the Liberal government three and a half 
years to accumulate the last $111 billion. Talk about overspending. 
We are still deficit financing with $19 billion in this current year.
<P>
	I hear Liberal members in the House and Liberal candidates on 
the hustings say that now that we have a balanced budget they want 
to be part of the debate on how to address the national debt. The last 
time I heard, there was still a $19 billion deficit. That is what is 
being borrowed this year. That is what they have trouble getting 
their heads around. They seem to think that a $19 billion deficit is a 
balanced budget, and that will be the launching point for them to 
start spending again. That is what Canadians are worried about.
<P>
	During the last three and a half years we have gone through a 
whole process of budget cuts. The Liberals are telling people that 
now we have a balanced budget with a $19 billion deficit, we are 
going to start to talk about what we are going to do from here on. 
That could only be Liberal mathematics.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9639"> 9639 </A></B>
<P>
	Most Canadians want lower taxes. They want a balanced budget, 
there is no doubt about that. When we get to that point they want 
lower taxes which really can only be offered by smaller 
government. The Prime Minister is saying that lower taxes are not 
the Canadian way. Where has he been? Canadians want lower 
taxes. I agree with him that it has not been the Canadian way under 
Liberal government over the past 30 years, nor was it under the 
Tory government. Taxes have gone up almost every year to feed 
this monstrous government we have.
<P>
	In order to accomplish lower taxes for Canadians, the size 
government has to be pared down. Most Canadians realize a lot of 
paring could be done without too much hardship.
<P>
	We have seen the government spending that has added to our 
national debt in programs like the national infrastructure program. 
There is not a Canadian who does not believe that infrastructure 
needs to be funded, that it is deteriorating and needs to be replaced, 
but a different method could be used to accomplish this. Some kind 
of a revenue sharing program between the federal government and 
the municipalities has to be a better way of approaching it. Then we 
would not get into these patronage, politically driven motives 
where the ball bounces only at election time. My understanding is 
that the government has just announced it is going to increase the 
amount of infrastructure spending in Quebec by about $112 
million. It is going to supplement it a bit before election time. It is 
important to fix a canal over there.
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	The infrastructure program that the federal government has 
proposed will cost $6 billion. The federal Liberal government has 
spent $2 billion in the last three and a half years. It is borrowed 
money. That money was financed on international money markets. 
The program has been a failure. Every job created has cost $60,000 
and they are not long term jobs.
<P>
	Surely the better answer has to be smaller government and lower 
taxes.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> it is my duty to interrupt 
the proceedings to put the question on the motion now before the

	Pursuant to order made on Thursday, April 10, 1997, the

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CRIMINALCODE">CRIMINAL CODE</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (for Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.)</B> moved that Bill C-27, an act to amend 
the Criminal Code (child prostitution, child sex tourism, criminal 
harassment and female genital mutilation), be read the third time 
and passed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
first I would like to thank my colleagues on the justice and legal 
affairs committee for their work in relation to Bill C-27.
<P>
	The committee heard several important witnesses and, following 
the testimony of those witnesses, decided it would be appropriate 
to make two major amendments to the bill. I believe that the 
amendments, dealing with female genital mutilation and the 
prosecution of cases involving child sexual exploitation committed 
by Canadians outside Canada, significantly improve the bill by 
dealing more squarely with the problems of abuse and exploitation 
of women and children.
<P>
	Bill C-27 was introduced in the context of the government's 
willingness to address the serious problem of violence against 
women and children. Violence violates women's and children's 
fundamental human rights and freedoms. The harm caused by 
violence undermines their ability to lead lives free of fear and 
coercion and imposes great costs on society.
<P>
	The bill focuses on four particular problems related to violence 
against women and children: child prostitution, child sexual 
exploitation, criminal harassment and female genital mutilation. Its 
purpose is to provide for appropriate criminal legislation to deal 
with these problems and to make a clear statement that, 
notwithstanding the context in which it occurs, violence against 
women and children is clearly unacceptable.
<P>
	Canada is already playing an important role at the international 
level to address the problem of violence against women and 
children. More particularly, through its participation in the drafting 
of the draft optional protocol to the United Nations Convention on 
the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution 
and child pornography, Canada is committing itself to better 
protecting children, whether they are here or abroad, from all forms 
of sexual exploitation and unlawful sexual practices.
<P>
	The involvement of young people in prostitution, whether in or 
outside Canada, is a serious and tragic problem which has become 
more evident over the years. It is particularly troublesome because 
young people, by virtue of their age and legal status, are more 
vulnerable than adults to danger, exploitation and abuse.
<P>
	During the national consultations on prostitution, which were 
held during 1995 and 1996, it appeared that  there was an urgent 
need to address the problems of youths involved in prostitution as 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9640"> 9640 </A></B>
<P>
some provisions of the Criminal Code related to sexual offences 
against children have had a limited effect in reducing juvenile 
prostitution. Thus the changes proposed in Bill C-27 in relation to 
prostitution are aimed at protecting children from adult predators 
who seek children for sexual services or exploit young prostitutes 
for economic gain. These changes respond in part to the 
consultations and to the interim report of the federal, provincial 
and territorial working group on prostitution summarizing the 
results of these national consultations.
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
	In relation to the customers wishing to obtain the sexual services 
of a person under 18, the present wording of subsection 212(4) 
limits the ability of the police to gather evidence to support a 
charge as the youth must either be willing to give evidence of his or 
her age in court or there must be solid evidence from another 
source of the person's age. Many youths are not willing to provide 
evidence of their age. Furthermore, police are not able to execute 
sting operations against those who would purchase sex from youths 
as the use of an adult decoy would mean that there was no attempt 
to purchase sex from somebody under 18 years of age.
<P>
	During the national consultations on prostitution which I 
referred to earlier, there was strong support for amending 
subsection 212(4) to increase its enforceability. The present 
wording proposed to replace subsection 212(4) in Bill C-27 refers 
to a person who the offender believes is under the age of 18 years 
with a new subsection 212(5) providing an evidentiary 
presumption with respect to this belief.
<P>
	We believe that both of these subsections will greatly assist the 
enforcement of this provision by allowing for the use of an 
undercover operator who can present himself or herself to the 
customers as being under the age of 18 years.
<P>
	In relation to those who procure young people for prostitution, a 
new offence of aggravated procuring would also be created for 
those who, for their own profits and while living on the avails of 
youths involved in prostitution, use violence or intimidation in 
carrying out prostitution related activities. In order to send a strong 
message of society's absolute abhorrence of this type of crime, the 
offence carries a mandatory minimum sentence of five years 
imprisonment.
<P>
	While procuring youths is never acceptable as evidenced by the 
high sentences already included in the Criminal Code, procuring 
youths with these added serious circumstances is even less 
tolerable and is to be punished accordingly. Both public protection 
and the expression of public revulsion for such conduct would 
appear to require that the minimum time served in a correctional 
system be subject to legislative rather than judicial and 
administrative control.
<P>
	As other victims of child sexual abuse, youths involved in 
prostitution are genuinely afraid to testify against their procurers 
due to fear of reprisal. The same can be said in relation to young 
victims of child pornography or of assault. For this reason, special 
protection to ease the burden of these youths testifying in court are 
made available in Bill C-27. These protections include publication 
bans as well as methods of testifying that are less intimidating than 
courtroom testimony such as video taped evidence or the use of 
screens.
<P>
	Child sex tourism is another important area covered in Bill C-27. 
As members have seen in the media, there is growing concern at 
the national and international levels that citizens, mainly from 
developed countries, should not be able to go to a foreign, usually 
developing country and sexually exploit children with impunity.
<P>
	Initially, Bill C-27 proposed to amend the Criminal Code to 
enable the criminal prosecution in Canada of Canadian citizens and 
permanent residents who travel abroad to engage in the sexual 
exploitation of children for money or other forms of consideration. 
However, in light of very important testimony of several witnesses, 
the justice and legal affairs committee decided that the bill should 
go further and allow not only for the prosecution of Canadians who 
engage in what is often referred to as child sex tourism, but also of 
Canadians who sexually abuse children, including Canadian 
children while abroad without any money or any consideration 
being involved.
<P>
<B>(1330 )</B>
<P>
	The committee decided that two preconditions would be 
necessary before prosecution could be instituted in Canada in such 
child sexual abuse cases. First, the foreign state where the offence 
is alleged to have been committed would have to request Canada to 
prosecute the offence. Second, the consent of the responsible 
provincial attorney general would need to be obtained.
<P>
	The committee decided that contrary to cases involving child sex 
tourism, where a clear international consensus exists, cases of child 
sexual abuse committed by Canadians outside of Canada could not 
be prosecuted in Canada without complying with these two 
preconditions.
<P>
	I believe that in view of the lack of international consensus and 
for reasons related to the sovereignty of the state in which the 
offence is committed, such preconditions will allow Canada to 
comply with proper jurisdictional principles.
<P>
	The practice of child sexual exploitation, whether in Canada or 
abroad, can be stopped only if each country is committed to 
adopting legislation to fight it and to working at the international 
level to have it recognized as being subject to criminal liability 
notwithstanding where the crime has been committed.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9641"> 9641 </A></B>
<P>
	Bill C-27, as modified by the justice and legal affairs 
committee, recognizes this commitment and sends a very strong 
message nationally and internationally about Canada's intolerance 
of such abhorrent practices.
<P>
	As the preamble to the bill indicates, this government is also 
committed to taking strong measures against criminal harassment 
or stalking, as it is sometimes called. The two reforms proposed by 
Bill C-27 will do exactly that and will thereby provide increased 
protection to women and their children, who are often the victims 
of such conduct.
<P>
	Bill C-27 proposes that a person who commits murder while 
stalking in circumstances where he or she intended to make that 
victim fear for their safety and that of others, such as the victim's 
children, can be convicted of first degree murder. First degree 
murder carries mandatory life imprisonment with no eligibility of 
parole for 25 years.
<P>
	Bill C-27 also proposes that a court imposing a sentence on a 
person convicted of stalking in the face of an existing protective 
court order shall treat such a breach as an aggravating factor for 
sentencing purposes.
<P>
	Support for this strong denunciation of stalking conduct was 
recently expressed by the federal, provincial and territorial 
ministers responsible for justice at a meeting in February.
<P>
	Further, the Department of Justice's report on the 
implementation of existing criminal harassment provisions 
released in January also supports such efforts to treat criminal 
harassment as a more serious offence.
<P>
	Bill C-27 also addresses the need to protect women and girls 
from the life and health threatening practice of female genital 
mutilation. Young girls in particular are especially vulnerable to 
this practice by virtue of their lack of maturity and will clearly be 
afforded better protection against this practice.
<P>
	Bill C-27 proposes to clarify the existing law's prohibition of the 
practice by specifically stating that no form of female genital 
mutilation is permitted by Canadian criminal law.
<P>
	The Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs has further 
strengthened this amendment to ensure that there can be no doubt 
about the illegality of the practice of female genital mutilation. No 
one can consent to such a procedure that results in bodily harm.
<P>
	This reform will facilitate the collaborative efforts of the 
departments of justice, health, the status of women, Canadian 
heritage and citizenship and immigration in developing public, 
legal, health and cultural and educational materials on FGM.
<P>
<B>(1335 )</B>
<P>
	I wish to reiterate this government's commitment to addressing 
the problem of violence against women and children. I believe Bill 
C-27 is further evidence of  Canada's leadership in that area, as it 
deals with several issues where young people and women are 
particularly vulnerable, juvenile prostitution, child sexual 
exploitation, female genital mutilation and criminal harassment.
<P>
	Not only is Bill C-27 important for all Canadians, it 
demonstrates Canada's unwavering commitment at the 
international level to co-operate with other countries in developing 
measures to curb the abhorrent practice of sexually exploiting 
children wherever it takes place.
<P>
	I think this bill demonstrates the commitment of the federal 
government in dealing with the criminal law to ensure that 
appropriate measures are put in place to deal in a tough manner 
with criminals and those who would decide to breach the norms of 
a civilized society, those norms contained within the Criminal 
Code of Canada.
<P>
	As has been indicated on a considerable number of occasions, 
this legislation adds to the list of very successful, progressive 
legislation that has been put in place over the last term of the 
government to get tough on crime. More criminal legislation has 
been put in place by this government to get tough on crime than any 
government in the history of our nation. We have much to be proud 
of.
<P>
	I wish to congratulate the members of the standing committee on 
legal affairs for their work and the Minister of Justice for his work 
in providing this type of leadership throughout the country in the 
field of criminal law.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in Bill C-27, you will understand that, at this stage of the 
debate, the government is already aware of the position of the Bloc 
Quebecois.
<P>
	In this bill, I think the Bloc Quebecois has already, on a number 
of occasions, distinguished itself in the debate concerning 
amendments to certain provisions of the Criminal Code to protect, 
among others, children and young women who, in certain 
situations, were subjected to certain painful practices. We have 
tried on many occasions to have this debated in the House and in 
committee.
<P>
	Today, accordingly, Bill C-27 addresses a number of issues, 
including female genital mutilation, criminal harassment, child sex 
tourism, testimony by children, prostitution and procuring. It goes 
without saying that the Bloc Quebecois supports the government's 
approach on all these issues.
<P>
	I would like to remind the government that the Bloc Quebecois 
member for Québec has worked, I think, extremely hard to advance 
the debate and, to a certain extent I would say, to persuade the 
government to take the direction it did with Bill C-27. I will just 
mention her private member's bills: Bill C-246, an act to amend the  
Criminal Code with respect to the sexual exploitation of children 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9642"> 9642 </A></B>
<P>
outside Canada, and Bill C-235, an act to amend the Criminal Code 
regarding the genital mutilation of female persons.
<P>
	As a result of these two bills, of questions in the House and the 
pressure by the entire Bloc Quebecois-since the entire caucus 
supported the hon. member for Québec in this-the government 
decided to act and to introduce the bill we now know as C-27.
<P>
	Given its origins, you will understand that the opposition is in 
favour of bill C-27. The opposition has always been in favour of 
bills which advanced the debate, which were aimed at remedying 
situations and shortcomings, and Bill C-27 is one such bill.
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	As I was saying, then, Bill C-27 addresses a number of aspects, 
including sex tourism. Given the stage we have reached, I will go 
over it component by component, with comments and a list of 
certain things we would have liked to have found in the bill, but 
unfortunately do not. The Bloc Quebecois will, no doubt, manage 
to get the government to give in, as it has this time with this bill, 
with a future amendment to the Criminal Code, or in another 
Parliament.
<P>
	Now, when referring to sex tourism, we must understand the 
context. Everyone will agree with me when I say that the 
exploitation and victimization of children for purposes of sexual 
gratification is odious, but does unfortunately exist. This is not 
something much seen in Canada, but it does unfortunately exist in 
the third world, in the Asian countries. Poor and disadvantaged 
children in the developing countries are sometimes abused sexually 
by tourists from Canada and from Quebec.
<P>
	In the name of profit, children are kidnapped, beaten, 
humiliated, and exposed to all manner of diseases, some of them 
fatal. If we were to do nothing about this, I believe we would be 
indirectly contributing to this universal scourge.
<P>
	If this type of sex tourism exists, however, it is because there are 
people interested in it. We are speaking of people who are usually 
well-off, who come from the rich countries, the Canadians, the 
Germans, the Italians and the French. We had to set an example, 
and Canada has already done so on a number of occasions, no doubt 
because of the history of this country and its international image 
developed over the years. We have always set examples in certain 
areas of activity, and here again we are showing the world how far 
ahead we are. I am particularly pleased that this idea originated 
with a member from Quebec.
<P>
	So, we have financially well-off tourists paying for trips to 
exotic countries solely for the purpose of purchasing the sexual 
services of children. I do not think anyone in Quebec or in Canada 
is prepared to tolerate that. It is a  situation we must do something 
about, everyone agrees. But there are limitations, and I understand 
that. We had to find a way to structure this bill so as to overcome 
these obstacles. I think we managed to meet our objective, to some 
extent.
<P>
	Why do these people, these customers who are financially well 
off, go outside the country? Because in Canada it is a criminal 
offence. They argue that they have so much love to give and want 
to give it to children in third world, to other people. And they 
argue-I heard all kinds of things when I was looking into 
this-that their love was shared, that it was mutual.
<P>
	People also told us there were cultural differences, that some 
things that were not allowed in Canada were allowed in other 
countries. There are all kinds of misconceptions here that should be 
cleared up, and we must tell these people, who may be quite 
sincere, that what they do is wrong. Their arguments do not hold 
water, because according to the Bloc Quebecois, the official 
opposition, a child's right to security, health and life is sacred, 
whether you are in Asia, France, Italy, Canada or Quebec.
<P>
	The problem was that we needed to send a clear message, and I 
think we were successful. By passing this bill, the House of 
Commons will send the message that these are serious offences. 
This was the context that led us to consider passing legislation to 
deal with this. We know the typical customer, and we also know the 
explanations they give, and all this had to be reflected in this bill.
<P>
<B>(1345)</B>
<P>
	Because of the subject matter, this bill was not easy to discuss in 
committee. I realized that as I listened to testimony and put 
questions to witnesses. These are rather delicate matters involving 
a great many concerns, including cultural differences, because Bill 
C-27 deals with various sexual aspects of the lives of certain 
people.
<P>
	This bill confers a measure of extraterritoriality on the Criminal 
Code. The authorities can prosecute a Canadian national abroad. 
The Bloc agrees with that; in fact, our members would have liked 
to go a little further in this respect. Unfortunately, the amendments 
we proposed in the House of Commons and in committee were not 
passed. However, what is already proposed in Bill C-27 regarding 
the law's extraterritoriality is already a step forward, because there 
was nothing like this before. So we say congratulations. Bravo. We 
have understood part of it. We would have liked it to go further, to 
be more detailed, but it is a step forward, and we willingly support 
a bill that has an impact in this area.
<P>
	There is another extremely important element, that which 
concerns excision or female genital mutilation. Here again, the 
Bloc tabled a bill in 1994 to prohibit genital mutilation. Because it 
is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9643"> 9643 </A></B>
<P>
important to see the work the Bloc has done in this matter, it is 
worth  pointing out that, on a number of occasions in 1994 and 
1995, the member for Quebec City, who was particularly interested 
in this, asked the Minister of Justice some questions. At the time, 
the Minister of Justice said we did not need a special section in the 
Criminal Code, since it already covered this sort of mutilation. 
Everything was covered in the Criminal Code. There was no need 
for change, etc.
<P>
	The minister is dishing up much the same sort of thing now 
regarding biker legislation: ``Everything is in the Criminal Code. 
There is no problem. Everything is there. The tools are there for the 
police''. So, you will understand that we might have some 
reservations. This would not be the first time the minister has done 
an about-face on an issue because of the pressure the Bloc 
Quebecois exerts and will continue to exert. We exerted pressure in 
the case of genital mutilation and we are doing it in the case of 
biker legislation and on other issues as well. We will continue to 
ask the right questions, to do the right thing for the security of 
Quebecers and of Canadians as well, because the amendments we 
are seeking to the Criminal Code will benefit Canada as well as 
Quebec. It will all perhaps be part of the future partnership of 
Quebec and Canada, very soon to come about, I am sure.
<P>
	Next is genital mutilation. With respect to Bill C-27, I am very 
pleased that my colleague, the government member, mentioned 
very clearly during his speech that it was impossible to consent to 
excision in Canada. You will recall that, during first and second 
reading of this bill, a person 18 years of age could consent to 
genital mutilation. This showed a great lack of knowledge of the 
practice, because it is not carried out by Quebecers and Canadians 
but primarily by people whose culture is somewhat different from 
that of Canada. It is easy to put pressure on a young woman of 18 
years and one day, when she comes of age, and to say to her: ``If 
you want your husband to love you, you must have this done''.
<P>
	We therefore struggled in committee, and I must say it was quite 
a battle, to have the Criminal Code recognize that a person could 
not consent to this practice, whether she was 5, 10, 15, 20, 35 or 
however many years old, without being charged under the Criminal 
Code.
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
	But we also emphasized, and I think this will perhaps be up to 
those who administer justice and enforce the law, that cultural 
groups who have this kind of practice in their country must be 
educated and given information.
<P>
	There are penalties in place and I think this is a very important 
step for Quebecers and for Canadians. Naturally, there are some 
weaknesses. We would have liked to see certain provisions in the 
bill, including one that very clearly makes it a new offence in the 
Criminal Code, to have it singled out in order to draw it to the 
public's attention. We would also have liked to see  genital 
mutilation considered aggravated assault and clearly indicated as 
such in the bill, but it is not.
<P>
	In addition, there are various interpretations of the procedure 
itself. Do we allow excision when performed by qualified doctors 
and so on, for medical reasons? I think some things could have 
been spelled out more clearly, given the importance of the issue. 
Unfortunately, the minister was unwilling to bend on this point. I 
understand that, since he had just given in on a major element in his 
bill where consent is concerned, he was not going to do so with the 
whole list of Bloc demands made in connection with this bill. At 
any rate, we do support Bill C-27, because it represents a step 
forward.
<P>
	Naturally, where criminal harassment is concerned, the Bloc is 
totally in agreement there too. This is putting some teeth into what 
is already in place. The Criminal Code contained certain provisions 
about criminal harassment, but the sentence was so minimal that, to 
all intents and purposes, they were hardly ever enforced.
<P>
	You will readily understand, then, and I will conclude with this, 
that the government had the entire co-operation of the Bloc 
Quebecois on Bill C-27 in order to make the bill the most 
applicable, the most in line with what we are experiencing in 
Canada, and particularly the most stringent in order to protect those 
we wish to protect, that is to say, children, young women and all 
those who suffer directly or indirectly from the scourge of sex 
tourism, excision or any other offence of a sexual nature.
<P>
	We support Bill C-27, which was introduced by the government 
and which is, to all intents and purposes, virtually a carbon copy of 
the private member's bills we in the Bloc Quebecois tabled in the 
past.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
speak in favour of Bill C-27. At the outset I would like to respond 
to the remarks made by the parliamentary secretary to the justice 
minister who suggested that the track record of the government was 
to be tough on crime. He said that some of the toughest legislation 
in the history of the country had been passed by this government.
<P>
	For the first time in the history of the country convicted rapists 
are walking free due to Bill C-41 and conditional sentencing. For 
the first time convicted bank robbers are walking free due to 
conditional sentencing. For the first time child sex molesters are 
walking free, thanks to Bill C-41 and conditional sentencing. The 
hon. member speaks about getting tough on crime and criminals, 
but actions speak a lot louder than words.
<P>
	I rise today in support of Bill C-27 although I am concerned that 
portions of the bill which I will deal with later are unenforceable.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>

<B><A NAME="9644"> 9644 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
	Reform members came to Ottawa in 1993 with a commitment to 
the Canadian people to reform Parliament. Included in those 
reforms was a promise to be supportive whenever possible. We 
promised not to oppose government legislation simply for the sake 
of opposition. If a bill enhances public safety we will support it. We 
therefore support the government's initiative in this regard in 
relation to Bill C-27, in spite of the reservations we have about the 
unenforceability of some of its sections.
<P>
	Bill C-27, which is a series of amendments to the Criminal Code 
dealing with child prostitution, child sex tourism, criminal 
harassment and female genital mutilation, will help reduce 
violence against women and children. It is not the only answer. A 
number of legislative changes must be implemented if we are to 
continue to eradicate domestic violence and child abuse. Attention 
must be focused on crime prevention, starting with the 
identification of the cause of domestic violence.
<P>
	Section 5 of Bill C-27 amends Criminal Code section 268, 
making infibulation an offence of aggravated assault. Under Bill 
C-27 infibulation in whole or in part to the labia majora and labia 
minora or clitoris of a young person under the age of 18 years will 
be considered aggravated assault punishable by a term of 
imprisonment not exceeding 14 years.
<P>
	Female genital mutilation is abominable and therefore should be 
outlawed for all Canadians, not just those under the age of 18 years. 
This barbaric and inhumane practice should be illegal regardless of 
age to protect all women in the country.
<P>
	In view of the concern expressed in 1992 by the Ontario College 
of Physicians and Surgeons this Criminal Code amendment is 
necessary. The Ontario college reports that there has been a rise in 
the number of requests of infibulations. Infibulation is the cutting 
off of a young girl's genital parts including the clitoris and the 
subsequent sewing together of the opening, leaving room for only 
urination and menstruation.
<P>
	Canada has been cited by the World Health Organization as 
being one of the 40 countries involved in the practice of what has 
become known as female circumcision, correctly referred to as 
female genital mutilation.
<P>
	Female genital mutilation causes a number of short and long 
term problems including excruciating pain; hemorrhaging; 
occasional death; exceptionally high rates of infections to the 
urinary tract, bladder, reproductive organs and bowel; menstrual 
and pregnancy problems; anemia and disfiguring cysts which not 
only reduce or eliminate sexual pleasure but often result in extreme 
pain during intercourse and can even prohibit it.
<P>
	Suffice to say, the Canadian medical community says female 
genital mutilation has absolutely no benefits but is completely 
unnecessary and extremely harmful.
<P>
	Recently a documentary aired on television on the subject of 
female genital mutilation. It was absolutely horrifying to witness 
the barbaric act of inflicting unconscionable pain on a terrified 
child. It is a memory that will not be soon forgotten. In the film a 
4-year old girl sat on what appeared to be stool upon a dirt floor 
while an elderly woman from the community using a crude 
instrument cut off her clitoris. No anesthetic was used. No freezing 
was used. As the girl screamed in horror and pain, the woman 
proceeded without any sign of anguish on her part or on the part of 
the mother who not only witnessed the barbaric mutilation of her 
daughter but was part of it. The mother, showing no sign of 
emotion, restrained her daughter. When the procedure was 
complete the girl laid on a dirty mat sobbing with her feet tied 
together and with her hands bound.
<P>
	I relay this horrible story to the House today-

	Is the legislative agenda of this Parliament complete? No. Have 
the Liberals completed the four year mandate they were given at 
the end of 1993? No. Have the Liberals come up with a real plan for 
the jobs, jobs, jobs they promised? No. Do the Liberals finally have 
a real plan to ensure the unity of the country? No. Are the Liberals 
asking for Canadians' opinions on their 40 per cent cut to funding 
for health care and education? No. Are Canadians demanding an 
early election?
<P>
	Why then the meeting of the backroom boys? To decide whether 
the Liberals should call an election now before their support slips 
even more.
<P>
	Canadians can do better. They can make the system more 
democratic. Under a Reform government elections would be held 
every four years at a predetermined time of the year. That would be 
more efficient and more democratic. That is not the Liberal way.

the types of access First Nations should have to fish and in general 
how fish should be allocated.
<P>
	These questions have been settled by the Supreme Court of 
Canada. The court has acknowledged an inherent right to fish for 
food and for ceremonial and religious purposes. It has denied an 
inherent right to a commercial fishery unless it can be proven that 
sales were an integral part of a band's culture prior to contact with 
Europeans, something neither group participating in the pilot 
salmon sales projects was able to establish.

isolation. Others, non-aboriginals, also have rights.

remember his failure to initiate an effective job creation program. 
They will remember his failure to bring real unemployment down.
<P>
	According to a Statistics Canada report 50 per cent of Canada's 
youth are presently unemployed. This is almost four million 
Canadians between 15 and 24 years old who have been left out of

no job.

wrote Canadian history by their actions. Because of them and 
thousands like them, Canadians became known for their courage, 
their determination and their cohesiveness in helping each other 
both on and off the battlefield. Six first world war veterans were 
there representing the nearly 1,500 who are still living. Canada's 
youth were there.
<P>

	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, a poll was released today confirming that a majority of 
Quebecers and Canadians feel they are worse off now than when 
the Liberal Party came to power in 1993.
<P>
	I will remind the Prime Minister that his 1993 red book talked 
about a country facing hardship, with 1.6 million unemployed, 
millions more on welfare, a million children living below the 
poverty line and a record number of bankruptcies. What is the 
situation today? Well, there are almost as many people unemployed 
as in 1993, and there are still millions on welfare, more poor 
children and a record number of bankruptcies in 1996.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9649"> 9649 </A></B>
<P>
	Is the Prime Minister aware that he is leaving Canada and 
Quebec in a worse situation than the one he described in his red 
book in 1993?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, everyone agrees that we have made great progress. Our 
interest rates, for example, are the lowest they have been in 40 
years.
<P>
	There is no doubt that unemployment is still too high, but the 
fact is that, when we formed the government, unemployment in 
Canada stood at 11.4 per cent, and it is now down to 9.3 per cent. 
This is not satisfactory, but it is enormous progress.
<P>
	The Canadian economy has created 750,000 new jobs over the 
last four years. This is not perfect, but it is more than two, three or 
four European countries put together, with a total population much 
greater than ours.
<P>
	We had a deficit of $42 billion when we first took office, and that 
this deficit has been cut by more than half, even exceeding the 
objectives we set ourselves in the red book. There is no doubt that, 
when you form the government, no situation is perfect and we will 
continue to try to make improvements. For example, we are trying 
to reduce poverty as much as possible. This is why, in the finance 
minister's last budget, and in co-operation with the provinces, we 
gave additional tax credits for poor families in Canada.
<P>
	The work never stops. I think we have made enormous progress, 
but people naturally want us to do more. That is why we are 
continuing our efforts to improve the situation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is the opinion of the National Council of Welfare that 
poverty is likely to increase in 1996 and in all subsequent years.
<P>
	So when the Prime Minister talks about satisfactory results, is he 
aware that the situation is terrible for the public, particularly for the 
most disadvantaged, for women and the one million poor children 
in Canada?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am not going to repeat what I just said. We have focused 
on programs to combat poverty in our country. We have taken 
positive steps, implemented new initiatives, at a time when the 
government's budget is limited. I believe we have made progress in 
this regard. We have allocated large amounts in order to resolve 
these problems.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	But, as I said earlier, more work must be done, and we intend to 
do it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the red book criticized the fact that there were one million 
children living under the poverty line. Right now, the figure is one 
and a half million.
<P>
	Is the Prime Minister aware that his policies have not worked, 
that there are one and a half million children living under the 
poverty line and that this shows a flagrant lack of political will to 
tackle the problem of child poverty? Yet, in 1993, he criticized the 
previous government because there were one million children 
living under the poverty line. There are 50 per cent more now. Is he 
aware of this?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to point out to the Leader of the Opposition 
that, during the federal-provincial first ministers conference in 
June of last year, we were collectively convinced, provincial 
premiers and the federal government alike, that the problem of 
child poverty had to be tackled. We took action, in co-operation 
with the provinces, through specific measures in the last budget. 
The only government to put new money into this area is the federal 
government.

	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister can say whatever he wants, but his 
government has cut $4.5 billion from social programs. That is a 
fact. That is what it has done.
<P>
	As far back as the 1995 budget, the government was announcing 
its intention to reduce its overall expenditures, with a $4.5 billion 
cut in social transfers to the provinces, and that has been fully 
accomplished; siphoning off $5 billion from the unemployment 
insurance fund to reduce the deficit, and that has fully 
accomplished; a $10 billion reduction in departmental 
expenditures, but that has not been accomplished.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister. Are we to understand 
from these figures I have just given that, for the government, it was 
far easier to impose cuts on the provinces and on the unemployed 
than to cut its own expenditures?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I am 
forced to repeat what has already been stated very clearly: the $10 
billion we had said we would cut from our departments have been 
cut, since this money has quite simply been taken off the public 
accounts, the allocations to the departments. The cuts we had 
forecast and described in detail have been made.
<P>
	As for the transfer payments, compared to our cuts in our own 
departments, I repeat again: the cuts to our own expenditures, our 
departmental expenditures, are 40 per cent higher than the cuts we 
have made to transfer payments to the provinces.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this is pure demagoguery. In the 1995 budget, the 
government announced that it would be cutting its own 
expenditures by 19 per cent over three years; the  outcome: 9 per 
cent. Three billion in cuts were not made. It did not announce that it 
would cut 19 per cent and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9650"> 9650 </A></B>
<P>
would then hike them back up again afterward. Really now. That is 
not what happened.
<P>
	Moreover, according to page 67 of the last budget, 54 per cent of 
the government's reduction in expenditures is due to cuts in social 
transfers. The rest is the $23 billion more the taxpayers have had to 
pay over three years. Those are the facts.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister realize that his commitments, like the 
GST, have been trampled under foot?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
once again, taking into consideration the entire program review 
period, we see that the cuts detailed department by department in 
the program review have been made. The program review has 
accomplished the planned results.
<P>
	During that period, if additional expenditures have been 
approved by Parliament, these have, obviously, been totally 
legitimate and for the purpose of enhancing the well-being of 
Canadians.
<P>
	I shall close by referring to a study which indicates what has 
happened in Quebec with the transfer payments. According to this, 
if Quebec had reduced its expenditures and its deficit at the same 
rate as the average of the other provinces, it would have virtually 
eliminated its deficit last year.
<P>
	And what is the source of this document? It is a document 
published by the Government of Quebec in October 1996.

	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, with 
about two weeks to go before an election is called, the justice 
minister is working hard to change his image across the country. He 
is trying to portray himself as tough on crime, really in favour and 
the champion of victims rights. It is going to take more than words 
to convince the victims, that is for sure.
<P>
	The charter of rights has many sections that deal with the rights 
of the accused, but none that deal with the rights of victims. 
Something is wrong with this picture and it needs to change.
<P>
	Let me ask the justice minister this. Will he commit today to 
passing a victims bill of rights before the election is called? Yes or 
no.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we had occasion to discuss that at 
length last week in the House. As I said  on that occasion in answer 
to colleagues of the hon. member, the government has always 
preferred to act rather than to talk.
<P>
	The hon. member and her friends like to talk about a victims bill 
of rights, but we prefer to enact legislation to bring those rights to 
life. Whether it is the right to restitution, which is in Bill C-41 in 
terms of sentencing to make sure that victims of crime get 
restitution for their loss, or whether it is the right to take part at the 
sentencing part of a hearing, as we did for victims of young 
offenders in the Young Offenders Act changes, the government has 
acted throughout to ensure that victims have a role to play and their 
loss and their interests are respected by the criminal justice system.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
minister says it was discussed at length last week. We would lay off 
if the Liberals would give us some answers finally.
<P>
	The prevailing attitude among criminal defence lawyers, 
prosecutors and judges is that victims have no place in the criminal 
justice system. They think that giving victims rights would 
introduce emotion and bias into the criminal justice system. They 
think that giving victims a role in the court process will jeopardize 
the right of the accused to a fair trial. Who is paying a price here in 
terms of emotionalism and some sort of bias?
<P>
	I want to ask the government's top lawyer this question, and I 
would appreciate an answer. Does he think that giving victims any 
rights would compromise the fairness of the judicial system? Is that 
not the least he could do for victims?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, a year ago when this issue was 
debated in the House and before I requested the justice committee 
to look at the whole issue and have hearings, if necessary, I spoke 
in the House. I brought to the attention of hon. members the fact 
that in 1988, which is now nine years ago, the federal and 
provincial attorneys general adopted a statement of the 
entitlements of victims in the criminal justice system. That 
included a commitment by both levels of government to see to it 
that victims were given due notice of when a case was being called, 
that they were informed of their right to participate as provided by 
law.
<P>
	I read the statement of principles to the House. That statement of 
principles has guided federal and provincial governments since 
1988, virtually the same statement of principles that the Reform 
Party wants us to adopt as a so-called bill of rights.
<P>
	Therefore, the reality is that for the last nine years, both federally 
in creating the criminal law and provincially in the administration 
of justice, those principles in favour of victims have been in place.
<P>
	I urge the members of the Reform Party to look at that statement 
and realize they are already in place.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9651"> 9651 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
minister says that victims are given due notice. They want a little 
more than due notice. Victims must come first. They have the right 
to be informed. They have the right to have their voices heard at 
any stage in the judicial process. They also have the right to be 
protected from intimidation, harassment and abuse. Those 
fundamental rights must be reflected in the justice system.
<P>
	Therefore, I ask the justice minister once again: Will he pass a 
victims bill of rights, which is an umbrella operation over far more 
than just the Criminal Code? Will he pass the victims bill of rights 
before the next election? Is he going to pass the bill or just simply 
pass the buck?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as the hon. member has just said, 
what she proposes goes beyond the criminal law. Indeed, it goes 
directly into some areas of provincial jurisdiction, including the 
administration of justice.
<P>
	As soon as a charge is laid under the Criminal Code, it is the 
province that carries the prosecution, the province that must 
provide for grief counselling and other services to victims.
<P>
	Let me mention one other thing and it is this. The hon. member 
also referred to what the government does or can do for victims.
<P>
<B>(1430 )</B>
<P>
	Last week I brought to the attention of the House the position of 
a nationally recognized organization of victims called CAVEAT. 
Through its president, Priscilla de Villiers, CAVEAT recognized 
that the government has made significant changes in the last three 
and a half years and that the government is prepared to listen and to 
act.
<P>
	When the Canadian public comes to judge our performance they 
will not listen to the hon. member, they will listen to CAVEAT. 
CAVEAT has told the truth.

with which he does not agree.
<P>
	In connection with the B.C. case to which he has referred, as I 
told the hon. member, that decision is under appeal. Indeed, it is 
being argued in the B.C. Court of Appeal. Let us wait to see what 
the Court of Appeal has to say about it.
<P>
	The hon. member ought not mislead the Canadian public about 
the effect of Bill C-41 and conditional sentences. He ought to make 
it clear that the courts have said time and again that conditional 
sentences are not appropriate for violent crimes.
<P>
	I refer to the British Columbia decision in Regina <I>v</I> Bishop 
O'Connor involving allegations of sexual assault. The court said it 
would not be in the public interest to impose a conditional 
sentence, given the seriousness of the offences and the accused's 
position of trust and authority vis-à-vis the victims.
<P>
	In Ontario there is the case of Regina <I>v</I> BLG. The initials are 
used because the names cannot be released. The Ontario Court of

<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, what the 
justice minister is reading is all fine and dandy but the courts are 
still releasing rapists and violent offenders on conditional 
sentences.
<P>
	The justice minister is correct when he points out now, as he did 
last week, that the case of the convicted rapist in B.C. is under 
appeal. Until the appeal court comes to a decision, the rapist is still 
at large, which causes enormous apprehension and fear on the part 
of his victim.
<P>
	Will the justice minister amend the law so that future victims of 
violence do not have to live with the trauma of knowing their 
assailant is free and can victimize them again?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is so typical of the hon. member 
and his colleagues to take the unhappy facts of a single case and to 
use them to fearmonger, to mislead people into believing that there 
is a problem where it does not exist.
<P>
	There are, in this memorandum, particulars of a dozen recent 
cases in which courts have said that conditional sentences will not 
be given when there is violence, when society requires deterrence 
and denunciation.
<P>
	Let the member continue. He will find that these shallow tactics 
of fearmongering do not succeed.

Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services.
<P>
	On March 20, the minister said in this House, and I quote: ``As 
long as Canada Post serves a public policy purpose then it should 
not be privatized''. Furthermore, she said she wanted postal service 
to continue, especially in rural areas. However, the minister's 
office has stated that a firm of consultants, Valeurs Immobilières 
TD, has been asked to study the viability of privatizing the Canada 
Post Corporation.
<P>
	After retaining only the election serving elements of the 
Radwanski report, will the minister assure us that Canada Post will 
not be privatized, regardless of how she fares in the upcoming 
election?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I will repeat what I said 
last week and what I continue to say: the Canada Post Corporation 
will not be privatized so long as there is a need for postal service in 
all of Canada's regions.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in that case, if the minister really believes what she is 
saying, I would ask her why a firm is conducting a study on 
privatizing or on the possibility of privatizing the Canada Post 
Corporation?
<P>
	``As long as there is a need'', she says, but people have not 
stopped writing letters and will need stamps for a long time to 
come. There is no need to privatize for that.
<P>
	So, is there something in the wind or is this purely and simply 
intended to waste public funds, as is the government's practice?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, if you recall, we 
provided a partial answer when we received Mr. Radwanski's 
report. At the time, we said we would continue to study his 
recommendations, because he was not able to get all the figures he 
wanted either. That is what we did, and we will continue to do our

	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
truly unfortunate that the justice minister talks about the unhappy 
facts of a single case.
<P>
	I am aware of four recent court decisions in this land. Three are 
serious sex offences and one is an attempted murder. What is 
concerning about these cases is that all four accused were given 
conditional sentences. No time in jail. The justice minister thinks 
that is okay.
<P>
<B>(1440 )</B>
<P>
	Since the justice minister is responsible for legislating 
conditional sentences, will he at least put some justice in the 
system by excluding sex and other violent offences from 
conditional sentencing?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the conditional sentence provisions 
that are already in law provide, first, that they are only available 
where the court decides the sentence should be two years less a day 
or lower-obviously that is the less serious case-and, second, 
where the court is satisfied the person does not represent a danger 
to the community.
<P>
	There have been some decisions where conditional sentences 
have been granted where violence has occurred. Many of those 
have been appealed. Some are now before appeal courts including 
the case in B.C. to which the hon. member referred last week.
<P>
	I say to him, as I said to his colleague, let the courts decide. The 
law is clear. Prison is the appropriate sentence for violent crime. I 
have said that time and again. We have a system of justice in which 
judges decide on the facts of all the cases and the appeal courts can 
correct any error.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have about 13,000 names on a petition that says the case in British 
Columbia is more than less serious as the justice minister would 
call it.
<P>
	Last week we pursued the justice minister on his lack of interest 
in enacting victims rights or changing conditional sentence 
legislation. His futile attempt to protect his poor performance 
resulted in his quoting from a victims rights group letter.
<P>
	My question is one of integrity in the office of the justice 
minister. Did the minister or anyone in his office initiate a request 
for that letter?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the answer is no. Even if we had, it 
would not go near the integrity the hon. member pretends to talk 
about.
<P>
	The answer is no. It was unsolicited. It came from CAVEAT 
because, as the letter says on its face, it is evidence and it expresses 
the view of Priscilla de Villiers that the government has acted 
appropriately, has introduced significant change, and has shown a 
willingness to listen and to act.

<P>
	Since the government did not answer our question last week, we 
must come back to the charge concerning the annual migration of 
snow geese from the United States to the northern regions. This 
migration is resulting in major losses to the farmers of the 
Bellechasse region, the Beaupré coast, Ile d'Orléans, and certain 
other regions of Quebec, such as the Lower St. Lawrence. Last 
year, for the period from April 22 to May 26, the Canadian Wildlife 
Service issued permits to allow scaring and shooting so as to limit 
the damage done to fields by the geese. This measure produced 
excellent results.
<P>

to issue immediately, for 1997, permits allowing scaring and 
shooting?

	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr.

whole issue of snow geese.
<P>
	I had the opportunity of dealing with the provincial Minister of 
the Environment a few weeks ago at an environmental technology

him the issue of last spring and that we had a number of 
recommendations coming from round table discussions on this 
important issue.

<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
point is that time is running out. It is a matter of days before the 
geese arrive and damage the fields. Permits must be issued as 
quickly as possible. It is no longer good enough to procrastinate 
and consult right and left, without actually taking any decision.
<P>
	What farmers want to know is whether or not the government is 
going to authorize and issue permits to scare and shoot the geese in 
the coming days, because it is clear from the minister's answer that 
the government is in worse shape than the fields are soon going to 
be.

this duty. The solution cannot only come from governments.

	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
is all about the integrity of the justice minister and the integrity of 
the government.
<P>
	I asked the justice minister a question about who in fact initiated 
a letter and he indicated it was neither his department nor himself.
<P>
	I wish to quote from a document from CAVEAT which I received 
on April 11. It says: ``Yesterday the office of the Minister of Justice 
called CAVEAT offices and asked if we would consider drafting a 
letter indicating his government had listened to the concerns of 
victims of crime''.
<P>
	Would the justice minister confirm or deny what I have just 
read?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, neither I nor anyone at my 
direction telephoned CAVEAT and asked for any such letter. I am 
not aware of the document to which the hon. member refers. I will 
look carefully into the matter. Anything the hon. member says 
requires that kind of examination. I will examine it and I will 
answer when I have all the facts.
<P>
	I am telling the member right now that I did not ask for that letter 
and I did not ask anybody in the department to do so.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
justice minister has now indicated that he will look at this to see 
whether or not he or his department actually sent the letter or 
initiated the letter.
<P>
	The fact is that he answered the question originally and said no. 
The question was: was he or anyone in his department, to which he 
answered no.
<P>
	I would like the justice minister either to come forward now in 
the House and be honest about the answer, or tell the rest of the 
country just how the Liberal government and its justice minister 
are open and honest with the people of Canada.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General

badly hurt the hon. member and his party are by the views of 
CAVEAT that the hon. member is making this issue.

knowledge no one in my department asked for the letter. If the 
situation is otherwise I will tell the member. I answered with the

question is directed to the Prime Minister or his substitute.
<P>
	The government is apparently incapable of enforcing its 
principle of the polluter pays. First, it has been unable to make 
Irving pay back the cost of refloating the <I>Irving Whale</I>, and second, 
it failed to convince the United States that it should pay the full cost 
of cleaning up the military facilities they occupied on Canadian 
soil.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister confirm that the total cost of cleaning up 
former U.S. military facilities on Canadian soil may exceed $500 
million, which is well in excess of the agreement for $100 million 
just signed with the United States?
<P>
<B>(1450)</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the figure of 
$500 million mentioned by the hon. member was not established by 
the Government of Canada.
<P>
	We negotiated with the U.S. government to find out whether it 
was possible to reach an agreement on cleaning up certain sites.
<P>
	I may remind the hon. member that the Americans deployed 
military units in various parts of the country over a period of nearly 
40 years. At the time, conditions were vastly different from what 
they are today, especially with respect to the environment.
<P>
	I hope the hon. member realizes what happened in other 
countries where the Americans had military facilities. I suggest the 
hon. member find out what happened when other countries, 
including Canada, had to deploy units for 40 or 50 years in certain 
countries, such as our stint in Europe with NATO.
<P>
	These are situations we are dealing with now that the 
environment has become an important factor, but we should also 
remember what the situation was like when these incidents 
occurred.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Marc Jacob (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
figures I mentioned may not have been released by the Canadian 
government but they are accurate. The agreement with the United 
States is clearly inadequate.
<P>
	I wish the Minister of National Defence would tell us which 
scenario we should expect. Either the government completely 
decontaminates U.S. military facilities on Canadian soil, in which 
case Quebec and Canadian taxpayers will bear the cost, or 
decontamination will be only partial or non existent, and 
Quebecers and Canadians will have to live with the environmental 
damage caused by the American army on Canadian soil.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I hope the 
theory advanced by the hon. member is not an indication of his 
party's attitude to the Americans who came to Canada during the 
Cold War, not as invaders, but as part of an alliance to defend the 
interests of North America as a whole.
<P>
	Canada recognizes its responsibilities regarding the 
environment. We will do what it is our responsibility to do as far as 
cleaning up is concerned, and not only in the case of U.S. facilities 
but also in the case of other sites. As far as the U.S. government is 
concerned, we have done our best to reach an agreement that is 
realistic.
<P>
	I think the hon. member should find out more about this, because 
it is the only agreement signed by the Americans who, during two 
world wars and subsequently during the Cold War period and even 
today, have worked and are working throughout the world to 
protect the interests of people who want to maintain their freedom. 
I hope the hon. member understands that.

rates in relation to credit cards issued by financial institutions, 
companies engaged in retail trade and petroleum companies.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I would remind you that, on numerous 
occasions, the hon. members of this House have proposed, along 
the lines of this bill I am introducing today, that there be limits set 
on the interest rates that major companies, banks and petroleum 
companies can charge on the credit cards they issue for the 
convenience of cardholders.
<P>
	This bill is in the same vein. You will recall that I had made a 
commitment to my colleagues and to the public to introduce such a 
bill if the banks did not bring their interest rates down to a more 
acceptable and reasonable level. I have now done so.

<P>
<B>(1505 )</B>
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, a victim of a terrible crime, Rosemary 
Eaton of Windsor, Ontario, provided me the motivation to forge 
ahead with this bill. Since my initial contact with Rosie, I have 
learned that many serious offenders are changing their names in 
prison under provincial law, getting out and under a new name they 
are able to begin another life of crime without our knowing it.
<P>
	Somewhere, somehow, we must get the government to 
understand that those in prison should not have the same rights as 
those outside. In this case, the safety of Canadians is at stake.
<P>
	This bill would apply when an offender is convicted of first or 
second degree murder or sexual assault. These offenders would not 
be able to change their names for life or for another period 
determined by the court. Every person bound by this prohibition 
order would be guilty of an indictable offence should they not 
comply.

<P>
	It is a report in which the committee considered chapter 26 of the 
report of the Auditor General of Canada tabled in November 1996, 
entitled ``Canada Infrastructure Works Program: Lessons 
Learned''.
<P>
	I draw the attention of this House to two recommendations in the 
report. As we know, the auditor general noted that the agreements 
did not set out specific requirements for carrying out timely 
compliance audits. Quebec is fairly advanced in this area and a 
compliance audit system has been set up for a sampling of projects.
<P>
	Our committee therefore recommends that the officials 
responsible for the Canada infrastructure works program draw on 
Quebec's experience and negotiate agreements with their partners 
to set up a compliance audit system. They should also ensure that 
the quality and scope of the compliance audits satisfy the 
requirements of the federal government on the terms of the 
program.
<P>
	The second and final recommendation is as follows. Our 
committee realizes that the calculation of the additional investment 
based on a minimum threshold represents a significant change in 
the terms of the agreements. It does not therefore consider this 
should be included in the negotiations under way to extend the 
program. On the other hand, the committee recommends that this 
element be taken into serious consideration in any similar 
infrastructure program the government may want to establish in the 
future.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CRIMINALCODE">CRIMINAL CODE</A></H3>
	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-27, 
an act to amend the Criminal Code (child prostitution, child sex 
tourism, criminal harassment and female genital mutilation) be 
read the third time and passed.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9660"> 9660 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, before 
question period I was expressing my concerns over the practice 
of female genital mutilation.
<P>
	I know that in Somalia and other countries the practice meets 
religious standards or preserves a sense of identity to their 
communities or it is done to preserve virginity and family honour. I 
think it is time that countries, including Canada, step in and protect 
these children from being assaulted and abused in the name of 
culturally acceptable practices.
<P>
	The UN has been asked to put a stop to child labour and child 
abuse. It is therefore absolutely imperative for the UN to put a stop 
to this most savage abuse of children.
<P>
	I urge the Government of Canada to take the lead on this issue by 
initiating talks with those countries which would be supportive of 
UN action in this regard.
<P>
	It is clear that Canada should first address that kind of situation 
in this country and urge other countries to address the problem 
there. We must take every measure possible to protect children in 
this country and throughout the world.
<P>
	I am therefore fully supportive of the section of Bill C-27 which 
makes it an offence for a Canadian citizen to obtain paid sexual 
services from children abroad or to engage in activities associated 
with child prostitution when they are out of the country. Of course I 
object strenuously to that kind of thing occurring in this country as 
well.
<P>
	I would, however, be remiss if I did not question the 
effectiveness of this Canadian measure in eliminating child 
prostitution throughout the world. While it may bring Canadian 
citizens to justice in very limited cases, it will not stop citizens of 
other countries from engaging in sexual relations with children.
<P>
	The Canadian Bar Association as well as a number of Canadian 
lawyers, including University of Toronto law professor Alan 
Mewett, criminal lawyer Douglas Usher and Windsor based 
criminal lawyer Michael Gordner, have all said that although Bill 
C-27 is an admirable statement of principle, it would be nearly 
impossible to enforce. That is my greatest concern about this bill. It 
sounds good, it looks good, but is it going to be enforceable?
<P>
<B>(1520 )</B>
<P>
	I agree with these lawyers that it will be nearly impossible to 
enforce this portion of Bill C-27. The justice minister and his 
government must recognize this fact. One can therefore surmise 
that the Liberals have imposed this law in an attempt to create the 
impression that they are doing something about the sexual 
exploitation of children. I think it is a false pretence.
<P>
	Alan Young, a criminal law professor at Osgoode Hall, said: 
``We have seen this before with Parliament  enacting a law with 
little teeth. It has shown a good intent but it is just not an 
enforceable law. Think about it. How could it be? How are 
Canadian authorities going to become informed about these 
infractions? Any extraterritorial law is going to be fraught with 
political infractions and be near impossible to enforce. Look at 
what has happened with the war crimes prosecution. Ten years after 
the fact and there still has not been a conviction. It is 
embarrassing''.
<P>
	Canada is the 12th country to criminalize child sexual abuses 
committed by citizens overseas. Last summer representatives to the 
world congress against the commercial sexual exploitation of 
children urged governments to levy strong criminal sanctions such 
as those proposed by Canada in Bill C-37. Governments were also 
urged to promote strong co-operation between states and societies 
to prevent children from entering the sex trade and to mobilize 
nations around the world to help countries eliminate the sexual 
exploitation of children.
<P>
	This action is absolutely imperative and in its absence Canada 
will do little if anything to eradicate child sex tourism. I would like 
to point out that the greatest culprits of child sex are not tourists or 
foreigners, particularly in countries such as Thailand where 95 per 
cent of child prostitution customers are domestic inhabitants. 
Foreign pedophiles account for a very small percentage.
<P>
	What countries such as Thailand need to do is rigorously enforce 
their laws. Currently this is not being done. Perhaps to be more 
effective in combating the sexual exploitation of children, Canada 
could provide police training to countries such as Thailand to make 
it easier to catch and punish domestic sex offenders within their 
own country.
<P>
	However, I firmly believe that before the federal government 
concentrates any more efforts abroad it should deal with the 
growing problem of child prostitution and child pornography in 
this country. It should establish a child sex registry, something 
Reform has been urging since 1993. I also suggest the government 
support local police efforts to inform people when a pedophile is 
released into their community.
<P>
	It is unfortunate that the Liberal dominated justice committee 
did not support my colleague from Surrey-White Rock-South 
Langley in her attempt to have child sex offenders deemed 
dangerous offenders and thus detained until being evaluated as no 
longer being a threat by at least two psychiatrists.
<P>
	I support the portion of Bill C-27 that imposes a mandatory 
minimum sentence of five years imprisonment for persons found 
guilty of profiting from juvenile prostitution. I have some concerns 
regarding the effectiveness of imposing only a five year minimum 
sentence. Pimping is a serious offence and as such should carry a 
severe penalty.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9661"> 9661 </A></B>
<P>
	Under section 212(4) of the Criminal Code obtaining the sexual 
service of a person under the age of 18 is an indictable offence 
and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years. 
Bill C-27 alters this section of the code by adding that it is an 
offence to obtain sexual services of persons believed to be under 
the age of 18 years. I have great difficulty with this portion of 
the bill. The justice minister is asking the crown to prove what 
a person may or may not have believed at a specific moment. How 
can this be done?
<P>
	Is this another law that looks good but cannot be enforced? Is 
this simply another dumb law? Is it another stupid law like Bill 
C-41, which allows convicted rapists to walk free? Is this another 
example of the kind of legislation that comes out of an ivory tower 
but cannot be properly and adequately enforced by our justice 
system? How can you prove something is believed, that someone 
believed or did not believe something? How can people's thoughts 
be on trial when it is impossible to establish those thoughts?
<P>
<B>(1525)</B>
<P>
	This is precisely what the justice minister plans on doing under 
this section of the bill. Witnesses dealt with this particular portion 
of the bill and expressed concerns about the ability of the justice 
system to enforce it. They dealt with what the purpose of this was, 
to allow the police to use undercover operatives in sting operations; 
in other words, a woman peace officer poses as a prostitute and 
when she is approached by a john she says she is under 18.
<P>
	As was pointed out in testimony and by others I have spoken to 
outside the committee room, how is a conviction going to be 
registered when the accused only has to say ``she may have said 
that she was under 18 but it was obvious to me that she was older''. 
Here we have a situation where the accused can say he thought she 
was older. In fact she would be older because the police would not 
be using anyone under the age of 18 in a sting operation.
<P>
	How are we going to enforce this part of the bill? It looks good, it 
sounds good but how are we going to use it? Is it a practical law? I 
say it is not.
<P>
	The sex trade in this country is a booming industry in which 
children are a hot commodity. Child sex consumers demand young 
flesh, and violent parasites, the pimps, happily supply that demand. 
This is an absolutely deplorable situation. The demand for child 
prostitutes will not go away as long as child sex consumers know 
their risk of arrest is minimal and if caught the penalty is only a 
maximum of five years.
<P>
	According to the B.C. attorney general's office only eight B.C. 
men have been charged for buying sex from a juvenile since 1988. 
My goodness, that is close to nine years and less than one 
conviction a year. What is happening in that province? Why is that 
the case?
<P>
	By contrast, 215 pimping charges were laid between 1988 and 
1993. Sexually exploited children deserve protection in the 
Criminal Code with all other children who are victims of sexual 
predators. Whether they are sexually abused on the street instead of 
in their homes or schools, the penalty should be the same.
<P>
	All children, especially those who are products of abusive and 
dysfunctional families who have forced them to retreat to the 
streets where they are further abused, deserve equal protection 
under the law.
<P>
	We have today child molesters, people who have had sex with 
children, who are walking free because of conditional sentencing. 
Here we have an example of the government doing something with 
its left hand and exactly the opposite with its right. It is passing a 
bill that pretends to get tough on those who would sexually abuse a 
child or who would have sex with a child under the age of 18. Yet it 
passes laws that allow those people to walk the street after 
conviction, to walk free. What kind of a government is this? How 
do we make sense of this kind of a bill? How do we make sense of 
the overall legislative agenda of this government? It is impossible 
to do so.
<P>
	When we ask the justice minister to do something about Bill 
C-41 and the conditional sentencing we heard what he said today 
and all of last week, that he is not prepared to move. He is not 
prepared to protect the children and the women who are abused and 
raped. These individuals are now walking the street free. It is 
confusing and it is unbelievable that the justice minister would 
bring in laws that conflict directly with other pieces of legislation 
that he puts forward designed to protect members of society and to 
protect victims of crime.
<P>
<B>(1530 )</B>
<P>
	If we ever hope to reduce and eventually eliminate juvenile 
prostitution, we must address the reasons why children are turning 
to the streets where they are vulnerable to abuse and exploitation.
<P>
	Despite the justice minister's admission in the fall of 1995 that 
he had no money for crime prevention, preventive crime measures 
must be implemented, particularly in relation to juvenile 
prostitution and young offenders. Those children who turn to the 
streets and a life of crime must be given an alternate safe haven 
where they are given some hope and assistance to have a positive 
and productive future.
<P>
	The government now says, after 30 years of overtaxing and 
overspending, having borrowed $600 billion, and having increased 
taxes to the point where 50 cents of every dollar that a person earns 
goes to one of the three levels of government, that we have child 
poverty where one child in every five lives in poverty. It says that 
the root cause, at least in some cases, of poverty is that the families 
are becoming dysfunctional and the children are going to the streets 
and entering the prostitution racket.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9662"> 9662 </A></B>
<P>
	The policies of the government have led to that. When the 
government takes 50 cents of every dollar out of the pocket of 
every wage earner and the people who create the wealth in this 
country, what can be expected other than poverty? From poverty 
flows some of these very negative aspects such as child 
prostitution. The government's own policies are coming home to 
roost. It is now trying to fight it with laws that have such holes 
in them they are unenforceable in some areas.
<P>
	Finally, I would like to briefly touch on the section of Bill C-27 
regarding harassment. We are all aware of the growing problem of 
domestic violence and the need for the section on criminal 
harassment that is outlined in the bill. We need more legislation 
and more preventive measures in relation to domestic violence, 
including providing the police with more power to investigate and 
prosecute people who abuse their spouses. What we do not need is 
a law that allows rapists to walk free after they have been 
convicted. What kind of a message does that send?
<P>
	Bill C-27 has some good aspects but it is completely destroyed 
by the way the courts are using conditional sentencing granted by 
this justice minister who will not move to remedy that.
<P>
	Bill C-17 deals with taking care of children, dealing with 
domestic abuse, rapes, assaults and so on, yet too many cases 
where violent offenders against women and children are walking 
free. What kind of a message is that to send to the people? It is a 
confusing message and an unbelievable message that this country 
could bungle this in the way it has.
<P>
	If the justice minister thinks that Bill C-27 and his gun 
registration legislation are the only measures needed to combat 
domestic violence he is wrong. Firearms registration will not 
eliminate or decrease this form of violence. This fact was evident 
in the recent shooting death of 10 members of a Vernon, B.C. 
family by an estranged and distraught spouse. Not only did the 
police in that case not follow a 1993 government policy to 
investigate cases of domestic violence, including those cases where 
there is no co-operation by the victim, they issued a gun permit to a 
person who had allegations of violence and abuse launched against 
him.
<P>
	I would like to quote an article in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> dated April 
10, 1996 which stated: ``The mass killing of 10 people last 
weekend in Vernon, B.C. has revealed fatal flaws and everyday 
limitations to Canada's much vaunted gun control laws. The two 
handguns used by Mark Chalal in the killings were acquired legally 
because there were not enough police officers, enough public 
funding and enough political pressure to pursue telltale doubts that 
he might have been dangerous''.
<P>
	That says it all about the vaunted gun control bill that somehow 
is going to make firearms safer simply because they are registered. 
Of course the government has never been able to explain to us or 
offer any evidence at all on  how the registering of a rifle or 
shotgun is going to reduce the criminal use of firearms. However, 
we plough on spending hundreds of millions of dollars in order to 
do so while at the same time creating laws that allow rapists and 
violent offenders to walk free.
<P>
<B>(1535 )</B>
<P>
	I reiterate my opening statement. We support this bill, although 
we have some reservation about its effectiveness in eliminating 
juvenile prostitution, domestic violence and female genital 
mutilation. I would be remiss if I did not briefly refer to what took 
place on Monday outside these chambers. The mother and 
grandmother of murdered teen Sylvain Leduc gathered supporters 
on the steps of Parliament Hill to protest the Liberal government's 
lax treatment of young offenders and to protest the justice 
minister's refusal to listen to the people of Canada and implement 
effective measures to combat youth crime.
<P>
	It is no secret that for over a year I have publicly questioned the 
commitment of the justice minister and the Liberal dominated 
standing committee to effectively change the 13-year-old Young 
Offenders Act.
<P>
	As this session of Parliament quickly comes to an end with the 
threat of a spring election, my earlier observations and scepticism 
unfortunately I think will be validated. It is indeed unfortunate that 
the government has failed during its three and a half year mandate 
to improve public safety and to do anything to make victims rights 
a priority.
<P>
	I would like to commend my colleague from Fraser Valley West 
for his tremendous efforts in the area of victims rights. It was the 
Reform member's initiative and tenacity which forced a reluctant 
justice minister to have my colleague's victims bill of rights 
reviewed in committee. It was shocking and disgusting to hear him 
in question period today where he suggested that we do not really 
need a victims bill of rights because the guiding principles are 
already in the Criminal Code and other areas to guide the courts, 
the crown prosecutors, defence counsel and the police. It is just 
amazing the contradictions that we hear from the government.
<P>
	We all know the minister's back is against the wall on this issue. 
We all know this is nothing more than a futile attempt to deflect 
criticism for a disastrous bungling of victim's right to be heard. He 
apparently embraced the bill of rights concept and yet today seems 
to have put a kibosh on it. It is very confusing when the justice 
minister moves in fits and starts.
<P>
	In Bill C-41 the minister granted victims the automatic right to 
make victim impact statements. Victims rejoiced in this victory. 
However, the victims later were shocked to learn what the minister 
giveth the minister taketh away. In Bill C-45 the minister betrayed 
victims. He stole from them their hard won victory. He denied them 
their unconditional right to provide impact statements and in  doing 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9663"> 9663 </A></B>
<P>
so, he added to a misery they have endured since their children 
were so brutally ripped from their lives.
<P>
	What happened? We had to piggy back an amendment to Bill 
C-45 on to Bill C-17 that passed last week in order to rectify the 
mistake. It was just another bungled job by the Department of 
Justice, led by the justice minister. That amendment had to be 
brought in with the unanimous consent of the House in order to 
reinstate what the victims had fought so hard and achieved in Bill 
C-41, which was their automatic right without the consent of the 
judge to make an impact statement at hearings.
<P>
	Let us look at some of the areas under the jurisdiction of the 
justice minister, such as section 745 of the Criminal Code. That 
section allows first degree murderers, after 15 years, to apply for 
early parole. Not only that, they are allowed to take their victims 
through the horror and the terror and the pain one more time after 
15 years.
<P>
	Do the families of victims not deserve a degree of peace? When 
will they be able to put the horror behind them? It has not died 
away after 15 years and after 15 years it is harrowed up again. Not 
only that, if the applicant is unsuccessful he can apply again, and 
again and again, depending on what the jury or the judge has to say. 
They do not have another period of 15 years. They could be looking 
at the same kind of situation, having to appear and make an impact 
statement to keep the murderers of their children from walking the 
streets, in two years, three years, four years or five years. On and 
on it will go. Surely these victims have a right to a degree of peace 
of mind. That is being denied them by the justice minister and his 
department. It is not right and it is not fair.
<P>
<B>(1540)</B>
<P>
	The emphasis by Liberal governments over the last three 
decades has been not on the victims and the protection of society, 
but on the offenders. The whole idea and philosophy is an attempt 
to rehabilitate the offenders.
<P>
	There is something to consider about these conditional releases 
that are now occurring. What is a fair and just penalty for the rapist 
who is walking free in B.C.? Even if there was a guarantee that he 
would never offend again, what is a fair and just penalty for the 
horrible act which that single mother had to endure for an hour and 
a half? I ask the justice minister and I ask the parliamentary 
secretary to the justice minister: What is a fair and just penalty? Is 
it to walk free? That is what is happening.
<P>
	We pass laws in this place which tell the courts what to do, and 
yet the justice minister will not amend the bill to tell the courts that 
they must not use conditional sentencing for those kinds of 
horrible, heinous crimes.
<P>
	We have been pounding away at the justice minister, making his 
life miserable over the last week because we  are supposed to stand 
on guard for the interests of the people of Canada. If we do not, 
who will stand on guard for the victims? The justice minister? Ask 
the victims of the violent offenders who are now walking free 
because of his law.
<P>
	We are only asking him to make an amendment which would 
exempt violent offenders not only from conditional sentencing, but 
also from the alternative measures contained in Bill C-41. Under 
alternative measures, violent offenders may never see the inside of 
a courtroom. They will do community service if they admit their 
offence. A Liberal backbencher said during this debate that under 
alternative measures he could see where a rapist might never see 
the inside of a courtroom. That does not make sense. That is not the 
purpose for conditional sentencing or alternative measures.
<P>
	There are justifiable circumstances for conditional sentencing 
and there is a role for alternative measures in our justice system, 
but not when it comes to allowing violent offenders to walk free, 
such as Mr. Ursel in B.C. That is not what it was meant for.
<P>
	We have expressed our concerns and our fears. In fact we moved 
an amendment to Bill C-41 in committee which asked that 
alternative measures be restricted to non-violent offences. That 
amendment was killed by the Liberals on the committee.
<P>
	We do not yet know the consequences of alternative measures, 
but we surely know the consequences of conditional sentencing. 
Why do we not change that?
<P>
<B>(1545 )</B>
<P>
	Why will the government not simply say the courts are using the 
law for a purpose that it did not intend? As the justice minister said 
last week and again today, people convicted of rape should go to 
jail. However his law is allowing the courts to set these people free. 
Why does he not simply change it? Why can we not come together 
in this place and act in the best interests of society? Why do we not 
consider the plight of these victims? Why do we not consider that 
single mom whose life has been ruined while she wrestles with the 
terrible trauma she went through and her assailant walks free?
<P>
	How did the judge come down on the side of the offender and not 
on the side of the victim and the safety of society? He did it with 
the tools granted him by the House through the justice minister and 
the government. It is called conditional sentencing. It was 
contained in Bill C-41, about which we expressed very grave 
concerns, and nothing was done about it. Now our worst fears have 
become the victims nightmares.
<P>
	We are asking the government to change. Why will it not 
change? How many more victims must be subjected to conditional 
sentencing while their assailants walk free and they cower in the 
homes afraid to leave? How many more times must this happen? 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9664"> 9664 </A></B>
<P>
Shall we ask the justice  minister formally and informally to make 
this simple change?
<P>
	We will support Bill C-27, as we have supported bills passed 
through the House which we thought were in the best interests of 
society. We have many reservations about certain aspects of the 
bill, but it goes in the right direction and we will support it.
<P>
	We ask the minister to bring in an amendment that would deny 
violent offenders access to conditional sentencing and remove the 
tools from the courts when they use them improperly. He should 
change the law. The support would be in our caucus and I am sure 
throughout the House. Who can stand in this place and say that they 
support Mr. Ursel walking free after what he did to that young 
single mom? No one.
<P>
	We will support the bill regardless of our reservations about it. 
As the bill hits the road and we see how it is applied that we hope 
the justice minister, if it needs amendment, will bring it forward. 
We wish he would do that with Bill C-41 and he has not. I cannot 
for the life of me understand why.
<P>
	We will be bringing to the attention of the House case after case 
after case where the tools granted to the courts have been used 
improperly and violent offenders have been allowed to walk free.
<P>
	Rest assured, we ill take this message across the country in the 
coming election unless the justice minister has the forethought, the 
wisdom and common sense to bring forward a simple amendment 
that will deny the courts the tool they are using in an improper way.
<P>
	I see my time has run out. The Reform Party caucus will support 
the government's measure and initiative in Bill C-27.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
once again I rise in the house to speak to yet another piece of 
criminal justice legislation from the government.
<P>
	People across the country should pay a great deal of heed to the 
words of my hon. colleague from Crowfoot, who happens to be one 
of the more knowledgeable people in the country on legislative 
matters. They should also pay heed to what members on this side of 
the House have to say.
<P>
	I have heard a great deal in the House about victims rights, 
conditional sentencing and a lot of issues that matter to people 
across the country. I grow increasingly concerned that the 
government is addressing the issues either in a very small, half 
hearted manner or not addressing them at all. As we get closer to 
the election-some say it is as early as two weeks away-I find it 
greatly disturbing that the government all of a sudden throws a 
bunch of legislation on the table, knowing full well it will not 
become law.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	It is probably one of the worst signs of misinforming people. 
Government members say what they will do, table it and ask people 
to vote for them, but they will not get it anyway. That is probably 
the height of deceit, quite frankly, in Canada.
<P>
	I have heard it all this week and last week as I asked and asked 
and asked questions of the justice minister. I heard statements 
regarding the victims bill of rights, that the government has done a 
lot for victims.
<P>
	The minister has no idea of what we are talking about in victims 
rights. Victims rights are not an amendment to the Criminal Code. 
It is meant to be a guiding light for the Criminal Code.
<P>
	We do not want amendments to section 745 that cover an 
isolated part of early release. We want something that overrides 
and says that victims can have the right to victim impact statements 
at any time, regardless of what article of the Criminal Code applies. 
That is what we are asking for. For them to say that they have 
helped victims by an amendment they made to section 742 is not 
what this is all about.
<P>
	It is important that those listening in Ontario understand what we 
are saying. We need the assistance of the people in Ontario, 
Atlantic Canada and Quebec to make sure the government gets the 
very clear message that it has failed to represent the people in the 
35th Parliament.
<P>
	As I travel through Atlantic Canada I know the feelings of the 
people there. They are concerned. It is time for decisions to be 
made in these parts of the country. They will take one step forward 
and say that traditional governments have not accomplished what 
we want them to accomplish.
<P>
	It is 1997 and we have a bigger crime problem than we have ever 
had. This group in government will say that is not the case, but it 
certainly is the case. It is 1997 and nothing has been done about the 
unity issue. They are still munching on their MP pensions like there 
is no tomorrow. This party has declined to do so. It is time to truly 
look beyond the status quo and take charge by putting the people in 
power. This is what it is all about.
<P>
	I asked some questions today relative to conditional sentences. I 
was alarmed to hear the justice minister suggest that the situation in 
my riding with Darren Ursel was a less serious situation. I assure 
the House and all Canadians watching today that this is anything 
but less serious. I tabled in the House 13,000 names on a petition 
showing that they are concerned.
<P>
	I do not want to go through those details any more. Suffice it to 
say a terrible sexual offence has occurred and the perpetrator of the 
crime did not serve one day in jail. The judge said that he was 
tender at times, that he was sorry for what he did and that it was his 
first conviction.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9665"> 9665 </A></B>
<P>
	Folks who are watching should think how they would feel about 
what occurred in that court room if it was their daughter or wife. 
How would they feel it they complained about it to the justice 
minister and he said it was a less serious crime?
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	I have talked in the House about that situation. The justice 
minister said that amendments had been made to conditional 
sentences. The fact is that he is not making the simple amendment 
everybody is looking for. He should exclude serious offenders from 
conditional sentences. He says that it is in a court of appeal. Who 
cares?
<P>
	Today I had in my hands three cases of sex offenders who were 
getting conditional sentences. I do not believe two of them are 
being appealed. The justice minister should not stand and try to 
give us hogwash that conditional sentences are okay and will be 
fixed up some time. They are not okay.
<P>
	My hon. friend from Crowfoot says he will count on the court of 
appeal. The court of appeal only deals with one case. I had three in 
my hand today. It is getting frustrating.
<P>
	People in the rest of Canada where there are no elected Reform 
MPs should consider what is going on here. It is very terrible. This 
Ursel character should have done time in jail. If that were my 
daughter or my wife who was treated the way this lady was treated, 
I do not know what I would do in this land where there is supposed 
to be justice. The victim is wondering where the justice system is. 
She tells me that she does not think the justice minister cares about 
her. Quite frankly I do not think he does either. If he had one hoot 
of care for the lady he would change the system. It is too bad we 
live in a country run by a Liberal government that is seriously 
deficient in matters of criminal justice.
<P>
	All last week my colleagues and I asked questions in the House. 
The justice minister suggested that we were exploiting people. That 
came very close to slander, but let us let the man do what he thinks 
he should do. We were sticking up for the rights of victims. If there 
is any exploitation, it is the minister getting a letter from a victims 
rights group and waltzing into the House trying to justify his 
actions over the last three years and saying that group was happy to 
send it to him on that basis. I do not believe that to be true. We will 
pursue that a little more this week.
<P>
	What are we to do? We have conditional sentences now. It is a 
heck of a mess. We have victims rights that have gone nowhere. 
Three weeks before the election call the government finds it in its 
heart to do something about victims rights, only to be able to go out 
during the election campaign and ask: ``Guess who we are for?'' 
That is what this other party from Jurassic Park has done.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kirkby:</B> Do you mean the Reform Party?
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> The hon. Liberal suggests that 
is the Reform Party, but I tell this member to just wait. All he has to 
do is wait for another 40-some days and we will see about that.
<P>
	Let us consider someone committing an offence related to child 
prostitution. I find it difficult to believe that a bill like C-27 would 
deal with pimps of people under 18. I would have thought that the 
government would be concerned with pimps, period. The fact is 
that I do not understand why it plays these kinds of games. Is not a 
pimp a pimp? Is it not abusing and taking advantage of women? If 
one is a child who becomes 18, is it all of a sudden okay to be the 
pimp of that person? What is wrong with these people?
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	One of the things that has to be done is set a minimum 10-year 
sentence for those living off the avails of child prostitution. What is 
wrong with that? It is time to start getting serious about the 
customers of child prostitutes. Those are the kinds of things that 
matter out on the streets, not the rhetoric we get in this place, not 
bills that are thrown before us seven or eight days before an 
election writ is dropped, when the whole country knows that the 
government is not serious about implementation. In fact, it is an 
insult to the intelligence of Canadians to be dropping this stuff in 
the House, knowing full well that it will do nothing about it.
<P>
	Just how does the government think we felt last week sitting in 
the justice committee trying to convince a group why victims rights 
are so important, knowing full well the government was not going 
to do a darn thing about it? Talk about insulting.
<P>
	Last April 29, 1996 the justice minister stood up in the House 
and said: ``Yes, we have to deliver on this. We have to develop 
legislation. Let us get it right to the justice committee''. He told me 
that he was going to do something about it in the fall agenda. What 
happened? Nothing. I talked to him in the fall session and he said 
that he was going to do something in the winter session. Did he? 
No.
<P>
	When did he do something about victims rights? Eight or nine 
days before an election he decides we should look at it. The insult.
<P>
	However, that does not bode well for these folks across the way. 
Some of those in the Vancouver area have already been criticized 
for doing nothing in the 35th Parliament. I do not expect to see 
them back.
<P>
	Ontario is not void of its criminal justice problems nor is 
Halifax, Atlantic Canada or Saint John, New Brunswick. This is not 
isolated. I talked to a lady from New Brunswick just yesterday 
about some of the problems she has had and the fact that her rights 
seem to be much inferior to the rights of the criminal. She has all 
but given up. I told her to hold in there and we will see if we can get 
it changed.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9666"> 9666 </A></B>
<P>
	I debated and debated across the country issues like victims 
having the right to be informed of their rights. The justice minister 
stands up and says he will look after it. However, if he cannot 
look after it he says it is a provincial issue.
<P>
	I talk about individuals having the right to be able to provide 
unrestricted victim impact statements, for instance, at parole board 
hearings and judicial reviews. The justice minister stands up and 
says the government did something on that, he thinks.
<P>
<B>(1605 )</B>
<P>
	Two weeks ago I was in a Vancouver courtroom listening to the 
parents of the victims of Clifford Olson begging for the right to 
submit victim impact statements and this clown is on a speaker 
from his prison cell saying: ``If you give them the right to do that 
I'm going to cross-examine them''.
<P>
	How can the justice minister stand up and say ``We did 
something for victims'' and yet victims do not have the right, no 
matter what is the issue, to submit victim impact statements? I 
could go on with a litany of the problems with issues like plea 
bargaining. I have seen it. I have been there. I have gone through it.
<P>
	People think that when someone is charged and the court case 
will be for first degree murder, they end up bargaining for assault or 
manslaughter which carries a much lower sentence. All victims are 
asking for is the right to know whether or not a plea bargain is 
being considered before it is given to the defence. That is not too 
much to ask. It is not too much to ask of people, of this 
government, to make sure that victims are not harassed and 
intimidated.
<P>
	I have been involved in several. One notable case was where the 
parents were told in a letter from the perpetrator, which he wrote 
from his prison cell, the last words of their son. Not only did he tell 
them their son's last words but he described in detail how he killed 
him. Do they not have the right to have this prevented? Do not 
victims have the right to know the status of an offender? They are 
not asking to keep him in any longer necessarily. They just want to 
know where he is, when is he getting out, what are the terms and 
conditions of his getting out and how long will it be before he gets 
out? Is that too much to ask the government?
<P>
	I cannot wait for this election. Folks in Ontario and Atlantic 
Canada who are listening to this should understand what is at stake 
here. We have lost a justice system and are into a legal industry and 
it must change. It will not change with this government. Some day 
this government will fall. That time is very near. It can come out 
with its polls and tell all us little folks how badly we are doing and 
it can tell us how we must vote. It can tell us that some parties are 
going to come back. This country will not go backward to the 
future. We are going ahead  with an agenda that we will implement. 
In this country victims rights will become a reality.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as always my colleague for Fraser Valley West put his 
case for victims most eloquently. Sadly the message continues to 
be ignored by the Liberal government and the Liberal justice 
minister. Hopefully that will change at some point in the future. If 
not it will change when the government is changed.
<P>
	I want to draw to the attention of the House what I feel is the 
hypocrisy of the stand of the Liberal government when I look at the 
infamous red book that was circulated-not widely I will 
admit-during the 1993 election. There were only several thousand 
copies available. Although it was not widely available, it is often 
quoted by Liberals. What they do not want quoted is some of the 
commitments that they clearly have not lived up to.
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	I refer to page 84 of the Liberal red book under the grand title 
``Safe home, safe streets''. It states: ``Dealing with the growing 
incidence of violent crime will be a priority for a Liberal 
government. Every person has a right to personal security and a 
Liberal government will move to protect this right''.
<P>
	On page 85 it states: ``Several flaws in our correction system 
have recently been exposed by high profile cases. Under a Liberal 
government sex offenders who are not rehabilitated at the end of 
their sentences could be transferred by court order to secure mental 
health facilities for further detention''. These were fine words 
immediately before and during the election campaign.
<P>
	In light of the commitments that were clearly made in the red 
book before and during the 1993 election campaign, how does the 
hon. member for Fraser Valley West see how that sits with what has 
happened subsequently with Bill C-41, conditional sentencing and 
the fact that rapists are allowed to walk free without serving a day 
in jail.
<P>
	When the Liberals refer in their document to the fact that they 
were going to introduce legislation because of ``recently exposed 
high profile cases,'' why, when Reformers refer to high profile 
cases are we admonished and ridiculed every time we raise them? 
Canadians are crying out for justice. They are asking because of 
these high profile cases that the justice minister take action and 
bring in legislation to prevent the abuses of our now 
inconsequential justice system. The justice minister says that we 
are simply picking, choosing and using these high profile cases to 
make our point.
<P>
	Is it not about time that somebody made a point? These abuses 
are going on. Even in the Liberal's red book they refer to high 
profile cases. That was the reasoning behind their wanting to bring 
forward legislation. I would suggest they have done a terrible job.  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9667"> 9667 </A></B>
<P>
They should be thrown out of office for their lack of attention to 
victims and keeping sexual offenders locked up.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, that was a good 
question.
<P>
	I can understand why my hon. colleague from Prince 
George-Peace River is so vociferous when it comes to talking 
about these issues. In small towns-the hon. member has a number 
in his riding-he does not escape either. He has the same problems 
in those small towns as I do in my city or west of us, as Vancouver 
does.
<P>
	These are not isolated incidents that the Liberal government says 
we are talking about. This is not taking advantage of people. This is 
not rhetoric. This is not all of those things that those clowns over 
there say that we talk about. These are serious on the street 
problems.
<P>
	I could stand here and give a litany of cases that the fellow over 
there does not even know about. He does not care anyway, so why 
tell him.
<P>
<B>(1615 )</B>
<P>
	Crime is a serious problem in this country. My colleague is right. 
Of all the problems we have in this country, very little has been 
done to reconcile and correct crime.
<P>
	I feel ashamed when I sit with victims who pour their hearts out 
to the government and tell it why they want to have rights and a 
minister says ``we gave you rights''. If they were given rights why 
are victims rights groups across the country expanding 
exponentially? The government has not fixed the problem.
<P>
	When we bring up these cases government members say it is 
exploitation. That is a lot of hogwash. It is a very serious situation. 
It is just as bad in Halifax as it is in Vancouver, Windsor or 
Saskatoon.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Then they go after the law-abiding gun 
owners.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> That is a good point. What is 
the answer to crime in Canada? A gun bill. We are going to tax 
hunters, farmers and gun club owners. What is wrong with the 
common sense here?
<P>
	Shortly after the gun bill was proclaimed five people were shot 
in my riding in one night. What has the government resolved? 
These guys did not leave registration numbers on the street. The 
guns were not even registered.
<P>
	It is no wonder people are frustrated. People are being killed by 
guns. Government members say that the gun law will fix it because 
the guns will be registered. There is not a criminal in this country 
who will register his gun, you fools. Wake up. This is serious stuff. 
When five people in one night get blown away, my constituents are 
incensed by answers like the gun law. It does not make sense.
<P>
	I listened in a courtroom two weeks ago when a defence lawyer 
said that the reason we need conditional sentences is the prisons are 
too full. They let a rapist walk. Another defence lawyer said that 
being locked up at home and not being able to go out at night is just 
as bad as being in prison. What kind of people are in the legal 
industry? What is wrong with the mentality?
<P>
	Pretty soon we will have to put victims on parole boards. Then 
we will see some logic. We will have to appoint victims to other 
boards, including deportation and refugee boards, of which I have 
attended many hearings.
<P>
	Some day people will run this country and not the tired 
traditionalists who come to Ottawa, fall into the party lines and do 
what they are told. That is what the next election will be all about.
<P>
	For the people listening to the debate today, there is only one 
choice. Forget the polls these guys mastermind and pay for. Forget 
the rhetoric. Remember who stands for what in this country.
<P>
<B>(1620 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to congratulate my colleague from Fraser 
Valley West for his usual eloquent defence of the rights of 
Canadians to live in peace and without fear to walk down their 
streets without be affected by criminals.
<P>
	It has been a great disappointment to me to see what has been 
going on in the House over the last three weeks, as my colleagues 
from Crowfoot, Fraser Valley West and Prince George-Peace 
River fought very hard day in and day out to bring to the House the 
real plight of Canadians.
<P>
	It is not an illusion that Canadians from coast to coast are 
increasingly fearful for their safety as time passes. It is remarkable 
that as time passes Canadians are not feeling more secure on their 
streets or in their homes. They are feeling less secure because they 
have less confidence in the judicial system to protect them from 
criminals.
<P>
	That is unfortunate. If there is one basic right we should have in 
this country it is to live without fear and in peace. Unfortunately 
that is not occurring.
<P>
	The statistics show that youth crime is increasing dramatically. 
Adult criminal activity is going down. However, the statistics do 
not demonstrate the reality.
<P>
	Police officers say that quite a large number of Canadians are not 
going to the police to report their claims. In my constituency office 
over the weekend the windows were smashed. The police said they 
would register the complaint but they would not come around. 
They do not have the time. They have other things to deal with, like 
paperwork. Our police officers are inundated with paperwork, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9668"> 9668 </A></B>
<P>
restrictions and constraints that the current judicial system has 
placed on their jobs.  Police officers from coast to coast have their 
hands tied. They are equally upset by what is taking place.
<P>
	The fault of the justice system does not fall at their feet. The 
fault of the justice system falls at the feet of members of the House. 
The House does not do justice to our police officers, the courts, the 
legal profession in order that there is prompt, fair, compassionate 
justice to be meted out to individuals who go afoul of the law. The 
government has done nothing to institute sensible measures of 
prevention of criminal activities.
<P>
	I used to work in jails. A few years ago I dealt with a couple of 
13-year old prostitutes who were in a youth jail, both of whom were 
going to be released to the same terrible abusive situation that they 
had lived in their entire lives. They told me they would go back to 
prostitution because they had no other choice.
<P>
	It is a shame that we do have a system that would enable those 
children to get out of that situation and to live in an environment of 
peace and security, rather than going back to the same family 
environment which was full of abuse, violence and drugs.
<P>
	I told those two young girls that if they continued on that course 
they would die before their 18th birthday. Within 16 months I 
encountered those two girls again. I saw the name of one of those 
girls in the obituary column, a murdered prostitute. The other girl 
had a stroke because she was mainlining cocaine and had become a 
human vegetable, irreparably damaged. What a tragedy for those 
vibrant young girls who could have become functional members of 
society and lived in peace and security rather than suffering this 
terrible tragedy; one dead, one irreversibly brain damaged. What a 
tragedy.
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
	The system does not provide for these people. I had a 15-year old 
young man stand in front of me in the same jail two years ago and 
say: ``Please, Dr. Martin, do not let me go out because if I go out 
into the situation I was in before, I will be forced to engage in the 
same criminal activity for my survival''. It is profoundly tragic that 
we do not have a system to address this.
<P>
	There has been a lot of very good work done in Canada. I 
brought to the attention of the justice minister constructive 
solutions.
<P>
	Dr. James Mustard in Toronto and his superb group there put 
forth constructive solutions dealing with early childhood education 
and ways we can put forward measures to identify children and 
families at risk, ways we can put forth measures in schools right 
from kindergarten to identify these kids and help them and their 
families to develop environments that are free of violence so that 
those children have the elements of security and love they need in 
order to survive.
<P>
	The government likes to bring forth the theory that child poverty 
is the cause for this. Members need not look any further than the 
large numbers of immigrants who have come to this country with 
not a penny in their pockets. They have worked at one, two or three 
jobs and have provided for their children and themselves basic 
security at home with love and an opportunity to go to school to 
develop skills they require.
<P>
	These children did not have very much in terms of monetary 
attributes but they did have security. They had love and supportive 
parents, the most important factors in enabling children to go on to 
becoming functional, productive and sometimes affluent members 
of society.
<P>
	When the statistics are compared looking at the success of 
immigrant children and non-immigrant children, it will be found 
that immigrant children do better than non-immigrant children 
even when the differences in economics are factored in.
<P>
	It is important that the government look at that and ask why it is 
so. That is why our party has put forward plans to help strengthen 
families, to provide families with ways in which they would have 
more money in their pockets and more time to provide a caring, 
stable environment that children need as an essential part of their 
growing up in order for them to become functional members of 
society.
<P>
	The government, in the way that we have looked at things over 
the last 20 years, has totally ignored this perhaps most important 
investment we can make in our society, the investment we make in 
our children.
<P>
	Getting back to more specifics of Bill C-27, the government is 
dealing with a number of other issues with respect to international 
child prostitution. We could not agree with that more.
<P>
	There are sex tours that enable individuals to go from all over the 
world to places like Thailand where they can engage in sexual 
activities with under aged children. That is illegal and it should be 
illegal.
<P>
	Furthermore, I challenge the Minister of Justice to work with the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs and their counterparts in other parts of 
the world together to develop an international scheme to address 
this very important issue.
<P>
	They could do this through the United Nations and through all 
the other groups of which we are members. This would show 
Canada in a leadership role on how to address this very important 
issue.
<P>
	I was looking at some of the statistics not so long ago. Very few 
individuals who go to these countries and engage in sexual 
activities with under aged children are ever brought to the attention 
of the justice system.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9669"> 9669 </A></B>
<P>
	Very few of them are arrested and very little happens to them. 
This must stop because it is preying on those people who are most 
vulnerable in societies, generally speaking the very poor.
<P>
	The committee on sustainable human development put forward a 
superb document just about two months ago on child labour. An 
offshoot of child labour was child prostitution. In that document 
was a number of very important, very productive measures that the 
government could take in order to address child labour and hence 
child prostitution.
<P>
<B>(1630 )</B>
<P>
	This is not rocket science. Some solutions are there from 
members across the country. Members of both houses contributed 
to it. Senator Landon Pearson is very knowledgeable on the issue. 
She put forth some very important interventions.
<P>
	I challenge the government to bring effective legislation to the 
House, as we in the Reform Party requested, to address this 
important international issue. It is sitting on the minister's desk. He 
should use it.
<P>
	In 1982-83 the Liberal government of the day decided to make a 
change in the mindset of the justice department. It said that from 
then on it would not focus on the rights of innocent civilians but on 
the rights of criminals. That was to be the primary focus of the 
justice department.
<P>
	Canadians do not want that. It is fundamentally wrong for 
Canadians to believe that the justice department will hold the rights 
of the criminal ahead of the rights of the innocent, ahead of the 
protection of innocent civilians.
<P>
	Contrary to Liberal government members, we in the Reform 
Party feel the most important functions of the justice department is 
to uphold the rights of innocent civilians and to protect them. It is 
absolutely critical for the justice department to have teeth. It should 
be an overarching rule and thrust of the justice department.
<P>
	That is why members such as the members for Fraser Valley 
West and Crowfoot have been raising horrendous examples day in 
and day out in the House. It is not because we want to shock 
anybody. It is not because we want to take advantage. The only way 
we can possibly get the attention of the government is to hit it with 
hard facts, to hit it with the most egregious examples of what takes 
place in society and and is being completely ignored.
<P>
	If the government had been instituting ideas to strengthen the 
justice department perhaps people who committed rape would not 
be set free. A pedophile in my riding committed over 1,000 assaults 
on little boys. Perhaps that person would not have the right to move 
into the neighbourhood of one of his victims. Let us imagine what 
is going on in the minds of the family of victims who know full 
well that the person who abused  their family members will be 
moving in next door. That cannot and should not happen. It should 
never happen.
<P>
	People who commit these sexual acts have a problem. Balancing 
that fact with the right of innocent people to live in peace and 
without abuse, it is quite obvious it is most important for Canadians 
to live without the threat of being assaulting, raping them or 
someone trying to kill them.
<P>
	There are examples from coast to coast of it happening. It is a 
great disappointment that in the last 3.5 years very little has been 
done on the issue.
<P>
	We have spoken of other important matters. My colleague from 
Fraser Valley West introduced a victims bill of rights. The 
Canadian public should ask the government why it stonewalled the 
bill. Why has the government not allowed the bill? It only called 
for victims to have some rights in court. Why is there not an 
established set of rights in court? Why has the government wilfully 
chosen to stonewall the bill in committee? It had a choice to allow 
it to go through with input from all sides of the House but it chose 
not to. Why did it do this? It was for partisan reasons.
<P>
	We are looking at a government that has chosen partisanship 
over the safety and rights of Canadians. The Canadian public must 
clearly ask itself very clearly if it wants a government that will put 
its own political future over the safety of Canadians.
<P>
	The government would have a large amount of Canadian public 
support if it would lead by example, by demonstrating and 
elucidating a vision for the country, by expressing a vision for the 
country, by explaining it to the people and by saying that we should 
work together toward that end. Instead the government follows a 
course of opinion polls and focus groups. That is what is ruling the 
country. It is not leadership. It is political expediency. The 
government would get many more votes if it would express a firm, 
definitive vision of the country and lead the country in that 
direction rather than play games. I fail to understand why it has not 
done so.
<P>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
	In closing, if we are to break the cycle of crime, punishment and 
incarceration, it will not come from the justice system. It will not 
come from the courts. By addressing the rights of children we will 
break the cycle. Families sometimes beget individuals who then 
become adults who then beget children who unfortunately run afoul 
of the law.
<P>
	It is true that there are criminals in every sector of society, every 
socio-economic group. Many children are being born into families 
full of abuse and neglect. If we think about it, it is impossible for 
them to develop the pillars of a normal psyche to enable them to 
become integrated members of society, individuals who have 
compassion, sympathy and empathy. Some of these  children do 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9670"> 9670 </A></B>
<P>
not have the pillars we take for granted. It is absolutely essential for 
them to learn them.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice should work with his provincial 
counterparts in education, justice and human resources and 
development. Then they could develop a cohesive plan across the 
country for kids to learn their ABCs in school, as well as sympathy, 
empathy, appropriate conflict resolution and the dangers of drugs 
and alcohol. All these issues have to be learned.
<P>
	This has been done in some areas of the United States. They 
bring the parents into the school system very early on so they 
understand the concepts of sympathy, empathy, appropriate 
conflict resolutions, the dangers of drugs and how to interact with 
their children in a supportive fashion.
<P>
	This is the most important, cost effective and humane method to 
break the cycle of crime, punishment and incarceration. I hope the 
government listens and takes the suggestions of my colleagues in 
the Reform Party over the last 3.5 years. If it were to institute some 
of these measures Canada would be a safer place.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened intently to my colleague's comments in reference to the 
bill, specifically to the children and how many of them have been 
affected by crime and abuse in society. I have to agree with him. I 
thought his statements were very appropriate.
<P>
	As a police officer for 20-some years I came across many 
heart-wrenching situations that impacted directly on families and 
children. We want to deal with the perpetrators, the ones who 
abuse. We want to hit them hard, to tell them it is inappropriate 
behaviour and to get the point across. The way the courts have 
shifted over the years, they really do not impact in that way. They 
do not strike the abuser as he should be struck by being put in his 
place.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	In one section a new offence will be created under subparagraph 
(2.1). It is called aggravated procuring and is applicable to:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>every person who lives wholly or in part on the avails of prostitution of another 
person under the age of 18 years, and who</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a) for the purposes of profit, aids, abets, counsels or compels the person-to engage 
in or carry on prostitution with any person or generally, and</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(b) uses, threatens to use or attempts to use violence, intimidation-in relation to the 
person-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It goes beyond the regular section of procuring. It deals with a 
child or a person under the age of 18. Attached to it is a mandatory 
minimum term of five years in prison to a maximum of 14 years, 
which is above the Criminal Code provisions at the present time. 
For all  intents and purposes it is good that the abuser of children 
will be hit with a minimum sentence.
<P>
	A charter argument of cruel and unusual punishment comes into 
play. It has been used time and time again. It has been brought 
forward frequently under other pieces of legislation. Some pieces 
of legislation have been struck from the record even though the 
intent on the part of the government was to move it through and 
certainly make it sound good. That has happened.
<P>
	Would the member for Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca like to 
comment on the fact that the provision is for a minimum 
mandatory sentence of five years? Does he believe it would be a 
suitable case for a charter argument to have this provision struck 
from the record as being cruel and unusual?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
congratulate my colleague from Calgary Northeast. He has 
repeatedly brought his police expertise before the House over the 
last 3.5 years. He has made many eloquent speeches and instructive 
suggestions to strengthen the justice department. No doubt his 
constituents in Calgary Northeast will re-elect him in the coming 
election for all the hard work he has done in the justice area.
<P>
	He raised the issue of the charter being used to subvert what 
Canadians would commonly embrace as justice. He referred to 
what some charter experts might say, that it is cruel and unusual 
punishment to put a pimp jail for five years who is assaulting and 
abusing a minor in the worst possible.
<P>
	Most members in the House and I would argue that it is cruel and 
unusual punishment for an adult to abuse minors and force them 
into a life of sexual abuse, prostitution, violence and often drug 
abuse.
<P>
	I neglected to mention another aspect of the bill. It repeatedly 
refers to the concern of the government in the area of violence 
against women and children. Everybody would agree with that. 
However men suffer from violence too. It is a huge disservice to 
half the people in Canada to exclude men from the purpose of the 
bill.
<P>
	People suffer violence. It does not matter if it is a man or 
woman. A victim is a victim. There has been a strong movement in 
the justice department and in many aspects of legislation in 
Parliament that tends to focus on women to the exclusion of men. 
That will not bring the genders together. It will separate them.
<P>
<B>(1645 )</B>
<P>
	It is important that we start talking about our laws in a gender 
blind fashion. To exclude women is wrong. To exclude men is 
equally wrong. I ask that the government have gender blind rules 
and regulations and not focus on one gender over another.
<P>

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It is my duty, pursuant to Standing Order 
38, to inform the House that the questions to be raised tonight at the 
time of adjournment are as follows: the hon. member for 
Mackenzie-Transport.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
want to address this bill in a different fashion. We have been 
talking a lot about criminal justice matters over the last few days 
and there is going to be more on the plate of this Parliament as the 
justice minister tries to push through other bills. I understand there 
are two in the line of succession. There is an anti-gang coming 
forward. What shape that is going to take is anybody's guess.
<P>
	I want to talk to the moms and dads for a while, and specifically 
those moms and dads who have perhaps had their daughters, young 
ladies, run away from home and fall into the clutches of an 
unsavoury procurer, a pimp in common language on the street.
<P>
	It is a heart wrenching thing to see some of these young girls 
who have run away and have come into the grasp of these leeches 
who hang around waiting for these unsuspecting young people. 
They are there ready to take hold of them and actually in a very few 
short months after these young people have run away turn them on 
to something they never dreamed would be possible for them to be 
doing.
<P>
	I can relate to a situation some years back in my police career 
where one such criminal was so intrusive into the lives of some of 
these young people and had pushed so many of them out on to the 
street into prostitution that we had to form a special unit to deal 
with him. He and his henchmen were solely set on grabbing these 
young runaways and putting them on the street and they had done 
so in great numbers.
<P>
	How would this criminal go about doing that and have young 
people willingly prostituting themselves on the street? How would 
he go about doing that? I do not believe the majority of politicians 
even understand what happens to a young lady who has run away 
from home, somebody's daughter, and falls into the clutches of 
these criminals. I do not believe that most politicians understand. 
In fact I do not believe that a lot of people really understand what 
happens.
<P>
	I am going to tell the story because it happens all too frequently. 
I think it needs harsh treatment for those who abuse.
<P>
	In any event, this guy who was the overseer of all these thugs on 
the street was also a cocaine dealer. Of course his intent was to 
have the prostitutes out there. He wanted to control his band of 
girls. Some as young as 12 to 13 years old were under his so-called 
guidance. He  would have his henchmen prowl the streets at night. 
It was pretty common knowledge where the runaways would go if 
they left home. Some of them got away unscathed but many of 
them fell into the clutches of these characters.
<P>
<B>(1650 )</B>
<P>
	They would grab the girls. These thugs would treat them very 
well at first. They would pay attention to them. They would buy 
them gifts. They would show that they cared in some fashion. It 
was all very superficial of course because there was an underlying 
reason for doing these things.
<P>
	Then they would start the girls on a bit of cocaine at a party. 
They would pay lots of attention to them over two, three or four 
days. There were some things the girls wanted from mom and dad 
and they felt that their needs could be met by these characters. 
Little did they know what was in store for them.
<P>
	As time went on the cocaine amounts would increase. Then, 
when a dependency on the substance took hold, it was time for Mr. 
Big to say ``you owe me now, I am going to put you on the street 
and you are going to be one of my girls''. The young ladies were 
prepared for the street by being gang raped for two or three days. 
They were kept in confinement.
<P>
	This brings to mind another revision to the Criminal Code which 
was made by the justice minister that lessened sentences 
concerning confinement.
<P>
	The young girls would be put out on the street with their cocaine 
habit. The thugs were relentless in digging up whoever they could. 
The runaways were a prime target. There was an endless supply.
<P>
	It was difficult for the police to pinpoint the abusers and it was 
difficult for the courts to convict. Seldom did they get the evidence 
required unless the girls were willing to testify in court. However, 
intimidation by the pimps was so great that many of them were 
afraid to testify.
<P>
	After a period of time of being abused sexually they had such 
low self-esteem that they did not really care about a lot of things. 
The procurers and the pimps remained, for the most part, 
untouched.
<P>
	I can remember one project in which we tried to nail one guy. We 
never did get him on prostitution. We got him on drugs but not on 
prostitution because that evidence was not forthcoming. The 
destruction that was brought about by his actions left an indelible 
mark on a lot of lives. It is up to the law to offer some protection to 
the witnesses who come forward.
<P>
	That is the ugly side of life. It is there. I do not think it should be 
totally hidden to parliamentarians. I certainly do not think it should 
be hidden to the general public. I believe that the general public 
would not find the actions of any pimp to be acceptable.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9672"> 9672 </A></B>
<P>
	I do not know about all the information that was before the 
committee and the justice minister when this bill was drafted. 
However, I assume they must have taken into account some very 
devious criminals when they suggested a mandatory minimum 
sentence of five years imprisonment. I think it is still going to be 
a very hard one to prove. But the questions do come up about this 
type of legislation. It will no doubt be challenged.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	I have read some of the outline reference to this provision and it 
is almost anticipated by the justice minister and the department that 
the matter will be challenged under section 12 of the Canadian 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
<P>
	I think there has to be some sort of test. If the public in general 
finds this unacceptable, I think that is the test, not what the courts 
say. Some code charges and criminal offences are certainly higher 
in the minds of the public than others, and this is one that is 
sometimes hidden and secluded. But it is there. It is real and it is 
still very detrimental because it does cost society a lot when it 
comes to paying for rehabilitation of the victim. Those who are 
caught up in this terrible whirlwind of events of prostitution and 
drugs have to go through a terrible amount of rehabilitation.
<P>
	The provisions of the Criminal Code as outlined in Bill C-27 I 
agree with. I think there should be minimum mandatory sentences. 
I believe that is quite positive. I am certainly prepared to support 
those in every way that I can.
<P>
	A second point that I found very interesting is the whole area of 
harassment or stalking. In 1991 an Ontario study found that 61 per 
cent of women who were murdered in the province between 1974 
and 1990 had been killed by intimate male partners, whether 
current or estranged, and that 75 per cent of these had taken place 
in the victim's home.
<P>
	The minister through Bill C-27 desires to make stalking which 
results in a death a first degree murder charge. I agree with that. I 
believe for the most part it is a first degree murder charge. One 
would have to prove the whole stalking event.
<P>
	Here is where I have a bit of a problem. The legislation sounds 
very good, quite positive. Overall it sounds like something I would 
draft. However, look at the results of the 745 applications. From the 
time of the first application until mid-1995 I believe there were 46 
applications from first degree murderers for early release, and 11 
applicants who had their sentences reduced murdered women, their 
wives, girlfriends or women they knew.
<P>
	I have to come back to the legislation. Sure, it sounds wonderful 
but let us look at the statistics of release under section 745 and the 
true story will be heard. Of the 46 applicants, 8 murdered 
policemen and three murdered  children. So 14 out of the 46 
murdered women and children, charged with first degree murdered, 
applied for early release and had their sentences reduced.
<P>
	It is okay to come out with what sounds like a good piece of 
legislation which is supportive of women and children in the 
country.
<P>
<B>(1700 )</B>
<P>
	When people look at the statistics on release and how the 
government views those who commit such violent acts, we have to 
ask ourselves why they should be let out earlier. When we talk 
about those who have taken the lives of their partners, we are 
talking mostly of men committing acts of violence against women.
<P>
	I am pleased to see good, sound legislation come in. However, it 
is like all the other bills we have had. Bill C-45 tinkers with section 
745 on early release. One bill steps on the violent offender and the 
other undoes everything the first bill stated.
<P>
	I have major questions about how a government can act in that 
fashion. Looking at the broader picture, it is somewhat deceitful. 
The whole picture is not seen before looking at everything.
<P>
	A third part of this bill deals with female genital mutilation. It is 
good to see provisions dealing with that offence. In some countries 
it is commonly practised. In Canada it is not acceptable. I agree 
with that aspect of Bill C-27.
<P>
	I am encouraged by one bill, which does not sound very good. 
However, one bill coming from the government actually deals 
precisely with these offences. There are no provisions that weaken 
the bill although I pointed out section 745, which is in another bill 
and in another part of the Criminal Code.
<P>
	In that respect, we support the bill and look forward to debating 
the next one.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
question for my hon. colleague from Calgary.
<P>
	When he was elected, he was an acting police officer. My 
concern about this bill-we are supporting the bill-is that we are 
creating the impression that it will do something about the child 
sex tours to other countries and that, through this legislation, we 
will create a penalty for a pedophile who goes to another country 
and has sex with children.
<P>
	My concern is in the area of enforcement and establishing a 
prima facie case. I want my hon. friend to address his thoughts to 
this. He, in his former career, as I did a number of years ago, had to 
put cases together. We needed evidence that gave us reasonable and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9673"> 9673 </A></B>
<P>
probable grounds to believe that an offence had been committed. 
Based on that, we were allowed to lay an information, a charge. In 
addition, we needed evidence to support the charge, evidence that, 
under normal circumstances,  would bring about a conviction by 
the court. He would need a well established case based on solid 
evidence.
<P>
<B>(1705 )</B>
<P>
	Does he share my concern about the government passing 
legislation to allow for the successful prosecution of Canadians 
who travel to another country, commit what would be an offence in 
Canada over there and come back here? What are the chances of a 
successful prosecution? What resources would be required in order 
to establish a successful prosecution? Would the child who was 
involved in the sex act have to appear and give testimony? If so, 
how difficult would it be not only to gain the consent of the child 
but also to bring her here? Does he see anything in the bill where 
the child would not have to appear here? Is there written testimony, 
an affidavit that could be sworn that could be admissible in court? 
He may not want to touch on some of these areas but I have great 
concern that part of the bill will be unenforceable.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hanger:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his question 
which addresses a portion of the bill that will be very difficult to 
enforce. I cannot see how the testimony of any individual living 
outside the country can be brought forward in any form. We have 
no jurisdiction in other lands. My colleague from Esquimalt-Juan 
de Fuca mentioned Thailand as being one place where this kind of 
trade exists. It will be very difficult to enforce any kind of 
Canadian law or to compel witnesses who live outside the country 
to attend and testify in a Canadian court of law.
<P>
	There may be other ways to address this issue. Perhaps we could 
focus on the tour guides who arrange for such tours into other 
nations. We could crack down on the marketing side of it here. 
Again, evidence will be difficult to accumulate and the proof would 
still lie at the other end of the trip to really establish that something 
did in fact happen. That part of the bill will be difficult to address.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I know the 
member for Calgary Northeast is quite interested in sentencing, in 
amendments to the Criminal Code that involve sentencing and in 
having the punishment fit the crime. We have some problems in 
that area.
<P>
	Is it the lawmaker's fault? Is it the politician's fault? Is it our 
fault here in this Chamber that we do not tell judges what the 
punishment should be? Do we give judges too much leeway in 
applying a sentence to a particular crime? We often read stories the 
paper that make us shake our heads. We wonder why the judge gave 
such a light sentence for an apparently horrendous crime. The 
public is upset with that.
<P>
	What is the cure for that? Is it a justice minister who would bring 
amendments to the Criminal Code to narrow the punishment and be
<P>
more specific? For example, should there be minimum sentencing 
for certain things?
<P>
	Then there is the idea of living out the sentence. I have never 
understood section 745, the faint hope clause. If you are guilty of 
premeditated murder, you will be sentenced to life. You have the 
right to appeal your sentence after 25 years and then you are given 
a second right of appeal after 15 years. It seems like we are 
tinkering instead of getting more specific and narrowing the range. 
Could the member comment on that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hanger:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his question. 
One area of debate has been neglected in Parliament: the selection 
of judges, the judiciary and how judges are appointed.
<P>
<B>(1710 )</B>
<P>
	For too long the input from the average person into our criminal 
law has been shut out. There has not been consultation. Most of the 
laws and changes to the law that have come about in the various 
bills have been as a result of a very narrow focus on the part of the 
justice minister and this government.
<P>
	For too long people have been sitting back, as have 
parliamentarians, and letting it happen. From what I can tell, they 
have not had a debate on some of these issues for some years. If 
they have I do not know when it was because we sure did not see it 
reported anywhere.
<P>
	First we have to again look at the judges that have been selected 
to date. Many of them appear to have a certain philosophical point 
of view that is much in keeping with the legislation that is coming 
from the government. We are going to have to put a different 
selection process in there for the judiciary. Anyone who abuses a 
position, like offering a conditional sentence for a proven rape, 
should be fired. There should be some way to fire a judge. That is 
not something that happens very often. We are really going to have 
to examine the whole selection process and put some checks and 
balances into the whole process.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, one thing that I 
have been surprised at is the issue of the age of sexual consent. This 
bills deals with prostitution and young prostitutes. The age of 
sexual consent is not commonly known to many Canadians as 
being 14 years of age.
<P>
	I would be quite interested for the member, who has broad 
experience in police matters, to make a comment on the age of 
sexual consent and whether he thinks it is appropriate at age 14.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hanger:</B> Mr. Speaker, I certainly do not think it is 
appropriate at age 14. In fact I believe that the age should be kicked 
back up to 16 for sure but even as high as under 18 years of age. I 
have seen time and time again  violations of young women by 
much older men. Because the age limit is so low right now, this 
whole 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9674"> 9674 </A></B>
<P>
argument of consent comes into play. Some horrible offences take 
place even with young women as early as 15 or 16 years old and 
their perpetrators walk free because of the age of consent aspect in 
sexual matters.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to rise today and add my comments 
and perspectives on Bill C-27, another justice bill, another act to 
amend the Criminal Code.
<P>
	I want to state very clearly at the outset that Reform is 
supporting this bill. The reason why I want to state that so clearly is 
because it seems that often we are accused of opposing everything 
that the government does.
<P>
	If people will take the time before and during the next election 
campaign to do their research and to see what we have said and the 
positions we have taken on legislation that has passed through the 
House over the past three and half years, they will find, quite 
surprisingly, that we have supported a lot of government 
legislation, but not without concerns. We have been very vocal, as I 
feel that we should be, with our concerns as we try to represent our 
constituents on important legislation that comes before the House.
<P>
	We are supporting Bill C-27. As has been indicated by a number 
of my colleagues, the members for Crowfoot, Calgary Northeast 
and Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca when they spoke to this bill, it really 
covers off several issues in one bill even though the bill is quite 
succinct. It is only about eight pages and contains only eight 
clauses. First, this bill adds an additional offence, that if someone 
lives on the avails of a person under the age of 18 and uses, 
threatens to use or attempts to use violence, intimidation or 
coercion to effect that aim, the individual is subject to a minimum 
punishment of five years.
<P>
<B>(1715)</B>
<P>
	We have heard a number of Reform speakers raise the concern 
that has been expressed on both sides of the House about the 
possibility of a charter challenge. In particular the member for 
Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca very clearly stated that Canadians have 
to understand what we are talking about here. We are talking about 
pimping. We are talking about pimps. We are talking about the 
lowest form of human degenerates I believe on the face of the earth 
who would use children in this manner.
<P>
	If there is ever a case that could be made to push the envelope of 
a charter challenge I believe very strongly that pimps would be it. 
They are disgusting individuals who would use other people in a 
manner like that and manipulate them. It is high time we come 
down very strongly on the side of morality and this issue and send a 
message to these people that their acts of manipulating, using and 
abusing children are not to be tolerated in society.
<P>
	We are very strongly in favour of that clause. If it comes to a 
charter challenge, so be it. Let us face that obstacle when we come 
to it.
<P>
	Another clause in the bill deals with female genital mutilation. 
The proposed legislation would protect those under the age of 18 in 
that it does not allow for consent to mutilation, even where the 
child actually consents to that type of operation. That is not good 
enough. The Reform Party has been very outspoken on this issue in 
the 35th Parliament. We support that as well.
<P>
	Another area that the bill deals with is the whole issue of child 
sex tourism. Some of my colleagues have spoken on the difficulties 
it presents in international relationships and trying to work those 
types of things through international diplomacy and working with 
other countries to ensure there is some standard globally when it 
comes to those who would prey on children and use them in an 
improper manner.
<P>
	The other issue in this bill is it amends the classification of 
murder. If in the course of a criminal harassment, stalking, death 
occurs then the offence is deemed to be first degree murder 
regardless of a planned or deliberate intent on the part of the 
assailant. This is an interesting clause. It is certainly one, as we 
have with so many justice bills, that we support on the face of it.
<P>
	I would raise an issue that has been bothering me on many 
justice issues. The government is going to hold up this clause in the 
upcoming election and say ``We have come down strong on the side 
of women who are being stalked. We are going to get tough. If a 
woman is stalked and murdered from now own that is going to be 
first degree murder''. Interestingly, what are we talking about here?
<P>
	We are talking about 15 years. That is all we are talking about for 
someone who deliberately stalks a woman and terrorizes her, in 
some cases for years and years. She knows this individual is out 
there. There is not a day or a night in her life that she is not very 
aware of that, living in fear day to day, night by night. Finally that 
stalker commits murder.
<P>
	What is this government saying? It is going to automatically 
convict that person, if found guilty, of first degree murder. This 
government will not bring about the abolition of section 745. This 
government is going to point to this and say ``We have come down 
tough. We are getting tough on crime. We are coming down on the 
side of those who are being stalked in society''. In reality it is 
talking about 15 years for someone who does something like that.
<P>
<B>(1720)</B>
<P>
	Is that going to provide deterrence? I think not. Is that going to or 
should it satisfy those women out there, the hundreds if not 
thousands, who are being stalked as we are carrying on this debate 
today? I know there are a number in my riding. I have met these 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9675"> 9675 </A></B>
<P>
women face to  face and I have heard their pleas for help. I am sure 
all members have if they are doing their job. Is this the best we can 
come up with to assist those women? It is pathetic. It is disgusting. 
This is saying that if they happen to get murdered then we are going 
to convict their assailant, their stalker, of first degree murder and it 
is 15 years.
<P>
	This is not good enough for me. It is certainly not good enough 
for Reformers and we will be reminding this government and its 
candidates every chance we get during the next election campaign. 
Where is their commitment to women?
<P>
	Where is their commitment to women when it comes to section 
745 and Bill C-41, conditional sentencing? Where is their heart 
when these women are crying out for some justice? Clearly those 
cries are falling on deaf ears when it comes to this government. We 
have raised this issue of conditional sentencing time and time again 
during question period, in speeches and presentations in this place, 
and the hon. justice minister sits over there and ridicules and 
admonishes Reformers for even raising the issue. He mocks and 
scorns us. He says how dare the Reformers bring up these cases and 
these issues.
<P>
	The real message is going to get out. I hope it is getting out. I 
have met with groups in my riding, as I am sure all Reformers have 
and hopefully all members have regardless of their partisan 
affiliation. They have met with groups who are concerned about 
criminal justice or the lack of it. In meeting with those groups I 
have had to tell them that I agree with everything they say as they 
present case after case where people are not held accountable, 
whether it is young offenders or people who are stalking women or 
people who are preying on the most vulnerable members of our 
society, or pedophiles, these disgusting degenerates who are 
preying on our children.
<P>
	I have sat there and felt their pain and I felt defenceless. What 
could I do? What could I do as an individual member of Parliament 
but carry their message to this place and try as hard as I can to get 
this justice minister and his bunch of bleeding heart Liberals to 
understand what is happening out there in the real world. That is 
what Reform is all about. That is what Reform is trying to do, carry 
that message to this place where we are ridiculed, mocked and 
scorned. I say shame on the justice minister.
<P>
	I want to ask Canadians as we head down the campaign trail in 
this next election to take the time to really understand what has 
happened in this place on justice issues in the last three years.
<P>
<B>(1725 )</B>
<P>
	On one side we have the justice minister saying that he has done 
so much for the victims of crime and that he has brought in all of 
these laws to get tough with  criminals. We do not believe it. A lot 
of people have told us they do not believe it.
<P>
	I am appealing to the people who will be casting a ballot in the 
next election to understand what has happened over the past three 
years. What have those laws done and what have they failed to do? 
The very future of our society depends on how we handle this issue.
<P>
	I would ask those people to look at the private members' bills 
which Reform members of Parliament have taken the time to draft 
and introduce in the House of Commons. I have been a member of 
Parliament for only three and a half years. Three times I have 
drafted and introduced legislation which would reinstate capital 
punishment so that people like Clifford Olson and Paul Bernardo 
would never have an opportunity to reoffend or torment their 
victims. We would not be debating whether someone like Clifford 
Olson could revictimize the families of the victims in court August 
18 because Clifford Olson would not be breathing. He would not be 
a problem. That is where I stand on the issue.
<P>
	Consistently about 70 per cent of Canadians when polled say 
they support the reinstatement of capital punishment for cold 
blooded, first degree murder, and yet the government refuses to act. 
It refuses to hold a referendum on capital punishment, as suggested 
by the Reform Party, or the second best thing, a free vote in the 
House of Commons so that MPs could truly represent the wishes of 
the majority of their constituents. That is too much to ask.
<P>
	I ask the people as we head down the campaign trail to take a 
look at what Reform members have drafted and introduced by way 
of private members' bills. We have done everything procedurally 
possible to draw to the attention of the government the wishes and 
the will of the Canadian people on justice issues as well as on many 
other issues.
<P>
	Many Reformers are strong supporters of consecutive sentencing 
as opposed to concurrent sentencing. We would not have to worry 
about section 745 for an animal like Olson if he got a life sentence, 
even the scaled down version of life sentence which the Liberals 
support. Multiply 15 years by the 11 victims which he has claimed 
credit for and there would not be a problem. He would never get out 
if we had consecutive sentencing like they have in some of the 
states.
<P>
	There are lots of things that we can do if we want to get tough on 
crime. None of them is being done by the justice minister and the 
Liberal government.
<P>
	The people living in the real world are doing everything they 
can. We in this House are failing them. There are organizations 
such as Rural Crime Watch, Crime Stoppers, Block Parents, 
Neighbourhood Watch and the victims groups, many of which have 
recently been formed. They are trying to raise the voice which is 
crying out for justice across the country.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9676"> 9676 </A></B>
<P>
	The people of Canada are doing everything they can. They are 
looking for new avenues all the time to try and bring about justice.
<P>
<B>(1730)</B>
<P>
	I know in my home town of Fort St. John the people have formed 
a community justice group which is looking at other means of 
sentencing, primarily for young offenders, which is built on the 
native model of circle sentencing. They are having some good 
initial success with misdemeanours and minor crimes. They are 
trying to help kids to get off this criminal track. The people are 
reaching out and trying everything. They are willing to give of their 
time, their energies and their resources to do whatever they can 
think of to make their communities safer.
<P>
	They are forming these organizations but this place is failing 
them. They tell me when I meet with them, as I am sure when other 
MPs meet with groups and individuals, that what is lacking is 
deterrence and accountability.
<P>
	Consequences and accountability are things that we took for 
granted when I was growing up, but are lacking in the system 
because of Liberal-Tory laws that have been passed. Precendents 
have been set in the courts over the last while. The people are 
crying out for justice. They are willing to do whatever they can to 
assist. But some responsibility has to fall to the legislators. We 
have to do our bit also, and the government is not doing that.
<P>
	I ask the people that before they cast their ballot in the next 
election to very carefully consider that. I ask them to do their 
homework before they mark their <I>x</I>. If they do that, I am sure they 
will not be supporting the government's weak-kneed, bleeding 
heart approach to criminal justice.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to 
thank my hon. colleague for his address on Bill C-27.
<P>
	We have discussed a number of issues related to crime over the 
last two or three weeks and we are going to be addressing more. We 
have some difficulty with possible charter challenges in some areas 
of legislation. The hon. member for Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca 
mentioned this in his address on Bill C-27.
<P>
	We had this type of discussion when we touched on Bill C-45. 
We wanted the complete elimination of section 745 of the Criminal 
Code which allowed first degree murderers an opportunity for 
reduction of their parole ineligibility after serving just 15 years. We 
were told that it would be contrary to the charter of rights to make 
the law retroactive. That involved some of the contents of Bill C-45 
as well. It could not be made retroactive. Why? Because it would 
be a violation of the charter of rights.
<P>
	Well, when the charter was introduced, a safeguard went along 
with it. That safeguard has never been used by the federal 
government, but it has been used a couple of times by a couple of 
the provinces.
<P>
	The charter of rights and freedoms is being interpreted in such a 
way that it strikes down laws passed by the representatives of the 
people and which are in the best interests of the people. I wonder if 
my colleague has thought about the lack of courage or intestinal 
fortitude on the part of the government since the enactment of the 
charter of rights and freedoms. The safeguard could be used that 
would say to the people of Canada that in spite of what nine men 
and women in the supreme court might say, or anyone sitting on the 
bench at any level might say, how they are going to interpret the 
laws passed by this House.
<P>
<B>(1735 )</B>
<P>
	Is it in the best interests of the people of Canada? Are they going 
to strike down those laws and deny the people the benefit that 
would flow from those laws because of their interpretation of those 
rights?
<P>
	What is the hon. member's opinion or feeling about using the 
safeguard that was placed there for governments to use? That kind 
of thing has happened over and over again. It is being used by the 
government to justify not moving adequately and properly against 
section 745 of the Criminal Code that allows first degree murderers 
an opportunity, after serving just 15 years, at early parole.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
welcome the comments and question from my hon. colleague from 
Crowfoot. As usual, he cuts to the nub of it and gets right to the 
main issue.
<P>
	I have travelled across the country and talked to countless people 
involved in the justice system: judges, policemen from varied 
backgrounds, city police and provincial police, the RCMP and 
crown counsels who deal daily with the frustration of seeing 
criminals get off scot-free because of these laws.
<P>
	As I talk to thee people involved in the justice system I keep 
hearing that the problem is the charter of rights. We have to do 
something about it. I am not a lawyer-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Thank goodness.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Yes, thank goodness.
<P>
	I cannot comment in depth on whether the notwithstanding 
clause is the answer to getting around the problem the system has 
with the charter. A step in the right direction would be the motion 
by the member for Fraser Valley West to enact a victims bill of 
rights to offset some of the power and to provide some guidance for 
judges when they bring down their rulings. I believe that would 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9677"> 9677 </A></B>
<P>
help but it would not be the whole answer, as I am sure the member 
for Fraser Valley West recognizes.  I am not sure that enacting the 
notwithstanding clause would be the whole answer either.
<P>
	Surely something that can be done. I sense the frustration that 
my colleague from Crowfoot feels. As we have raised these justice 
issues the passed three years we have constantly been getting this 
nonsense thrown at us from the other side: ``We cannot do that. We 
would like to do that but we cannot do it because it will invoke a 
charter challenge''. There is this bogeyman that if we go too far 
then the charter challenge is going to come down and stop us.
<P>
	We on this side of the House have often remarked that if we 
cannot do something about it in this place, good god, where in hell 
are we going to do something about it? That is what the people are 
asking us.
<P>
	The people are telling us that there are problems in the system 
when rapists are walking free. The government gets up and says 
there are no problems because the crown is appealing it. That is the 
nonsense that we have heard from the justice minister for the last 
week on the fallout from Bill C-41 and conditional sentencing. 
That is what the Canadian people have been listening to and have 
had to put up with.
<P>
	The reality is that those victims should not have had to go 
through an appeal. Goodness gracious, if the system was working 
properly, no one can tell me that a judge would rule that a rapist 
who was found guilty should walk out of the courtroom scot-free. It 
cannot be so.
<P>
<B>(1740 )</B>
<P>
	People in my riding say to me all the time, as do people in every 
other riding to their members of Parliament: ``Tell me it cannot be 
so''. The minister's response is that the crown can appeal. That is 
absolute nonsense.
<P>
	There would not have to be an appeal if the sentence was 
appropriate to begin with. If the sentence was appropriate, the only 
appeal would be on the part of the criminal. He would appeal 
because he believed it was too harsh. It should not be the crown 
appealing because the sentence was too lenient for rape.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Penson:</B> It is a sorry system we have.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> It is disgusting. It is 
not only Reformers who are fed up with this nonsense. I hope there 
is a growing awareness in the real world, outside the fantasyland of 
this town, of what is going on.
<P>
	I do not have the answer to the question posed by my hon. 
colleague. Something has to be done, like invoking the 
notwithstanding clause, to get around the charter challenges of 
some of the laws that people are crying out for and demanding. Let 
us do it. Let us get on with it. Let us face that challenge when we 
come to it.
<P>
	Let us not use it as an excuse, as the justice minister does to do 
nothing but to sit and say: ``We cannot do anything about it because 
there will be a charter challenge''. Hogwash.
<P>
	If we cannot do anything about it here, where will people go? Is 
it any wonder that people have lost faith in the system when 
politicians say that they cannot do anything about it? There has to 
be something we can do about it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, sometimes at the beginning of a television program, there 
is a little warning that it will be sensitive material, that perhaps 
children should be restricted from watching. I would like to put that 
warning at the beginning of my speech today.
<P>
	I will deal with a topic that will be offensive to some, however, it 
needs to be talked about now. We have done quite a bit of research 
on this lately.
<P>
	Forcing children into prostitution and forcing them to participate 
in pornographic acts is a horrific violation of the innocence of our 
youth. It needs to be punished to the full extent of the law.
<P>
	Unfortunately, only Reformers seem to be listening and acting 
on what the people want. We heard the previous speakers 
emphasize this over and over. While a succession of Liberal and 
Tory governments have taken a few tentative steps to improve the 
law, the Criminal Code provisions regarding child prostitution, 
child pornography and the definition of obscenity need to be 
strengthened.
<P>
	Better enforcement will help us bring more criminals living off 
the avails of child prostitution and child pornography to justice but 
mandatory minimum sentences are necessary to deter the criminal 
element from getting into this sick business in the first place. 
Recent cases involving importation, possession and distribution of 
child pornography on the Internet demonstrate the need to crack 
down and crack down hard.
<P>
	A point that needs emphasis is that child prostitution and child 
pornography are inextricably linked. One cannot be looked at 
without looking at the other. The two issues are completely tied 
together.
<P>
	Our research shows-this should be alarming to all those 
listening-that there has been a 170 per cent increase in sex 
offences since 1984. In a Canadian study of male inmates 
convicted of rape, 86 per cent of the subjects admitted to being 
regular or habitual users of pornography. That ought to tell us 
something very clearly.
<P>
<B>(1745)</B>
<P>
	A survey of Canadian use of pornography indicates that young 
persons aged 12 to 17 years are the primary consumers of 
pornography. Less than 10 per cent of  pornographic materials 
depict vaginal intercourse between one man and one woman. The 
majority of pornographic products are the hard core variety 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9678"> 9678 </A></B>
<P>
depicting one or more of the following: group sex, bestiality, 
torture, incest, bondage, urination, defecation, sado-masochism 
and sex with children.
<P>
	Here are some recent news headlines that should alarm 
everyone. The first one comes from Montreal <I>Gazette</I> of 
September 6, 1996:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>B.C. school principal charged with creating child pornography. If the allegations 
are true we have seen a grave violation of trust of parents and students.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The next one is datelined Vancouver:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The arrest of a Burnaby elementary school principal on child pornography 
charges sent shock waves across British Columbia yesterday. Inspector Ken Doern 
said police would be sifting through a large amount of material, including videos, 
audio tapes, photographs and written material.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Another one comes from the Ottawa <I>Sun</I> of August 27, 1996:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Pedophiles ``shop'' the Internet for victims. ``The Internet has become a shopping 
centre for pedophiles'', says a local investigator. Regional police Detective Keith 
Daniels, of the child abuse-sexual assault unit says the worldwide web has given 
predators a larger, more dangerous outlet to find victims.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It includes child prostitutes, I might add. The third one I would 
like to quote is from an article in <I>Maclean's</I> of November 18, 1996 
entitled ``A mountain of smut-Police make an arrest in a child

<BLOCKQUOTE>Each printout is a colour photograph of one or more naked children, some in sex 
acts with adults, some with their genitals displayed, sifting through 30,000 computer

files. Jim Carrol, the co-author of the Canadian Internet Handbook says, ``And the 
problem is going to get worse. If the police think they have a challenge today, they 
haven't seen anything yet''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The government's amendments proposed in Bill C-27 fall far 
short of providing the public protection and severe punishment 
Canadians are demanding for these despicable crimes.
<P>
	The Liberal proposals include making it illegal to attempt to 
procure sexual services from someone under 18; a new offence for 
aggravated procuring that would carry a five-year minimum 
sentence which would apply to criminals who live off the avails of 
child prostitutes, use violence and assist in carrying out prostitution 
related activities; allowing the child victims to testify from behind 
a screen, by video tape or closed circuit television; and, last of all, 
encouraging rigorous enforcement of Criminal Code provisions 
focusing on pimps and customers.
<P>
	Unfortunately the government has not proposed any 
amendments strengthening the child pornography provisions of the 
Criminal Code. It should include  strengthening the definition of 
obscenity in the Criminal Code. There should be a restricting of the 
use of artistic merit as a defence by those who produce child 
pornography. There should be a placing of the onus on the accused 
in any child pornography case to prove the so-called art passes the 
community standard of tolerance test. Those items should be 
included in the bill.
<P>
	I also point out a major weakness in the government's child 
prostitution legislation. Bill C-27 creates a new offence for 
aggravated procuring which would carry a five-year minimum 
sentence.
<P>
<B>(1750)</B>
<P>
	The lawyers from the Library of Parliament explained it this way 
in their legislative report on Bill C-27:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-the new offence is applicable to anyone living to any extent on the avails of 
prostitution of a person under the age of 18 and who, for profit, aids, counsels, or 
compels that person to engage in any prostitution and uses, threatens or attempts 
to use violence or intimidation against him or her.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	As with most laws the Liberal government rams through 
Parliament, it sounds good but it does not do the trick.
<P>
	This section means that the police has to prove that the pimp 
profits from the actual prostitution and that the young girl was 
threatened with violence or intimidated.
<P>
	What about the pimp who bribes and seduces a young girl? What 
about the pimp who intentionally seduces a 14-year old girl into a 
personal relationship and then bribes, tempts and tricks her into 
trying prostitution as a way of making extra money or simply 
pleasing him? As long as the 14-year old girl consents to have sex 
with her pimp, there is no criminal law against this disgusting 
recruiting process. It is happening today and it has to stop.
<P>
	A February 5 <I>Globe and Mail</I> article described pimps who cruise 
the malls looking in:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-the food fair for children (they look for young teens who smoke and are chubby, 
two signs of insecurity) to recruit kids to work in the ``baby stroll'', which also is 
known as ``popcorn alley'' (where the youngest prostitutes work).</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I agree with Alderman Bev Longstaff of Calgary who was quoted 
in Don Braid's February 9 column in the Calgary <I>Herald</I>:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>When you're only 14, it's pretty hard to realize what impact your actions are 
going to have on your future.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Braid's column stated that it was Longstaff's idea to amend the 
Alberta child welfare act to allow police to apprehend underage 
hookers and charge the johns with child abuse.
<P>
	While the Alberta amendments are great, the problem of the 
luring of kids into child prostitution by pimps could be better 
addressed simply by raising the age of consensual sex between an 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9679"> 9679 </A></B>
<P>
adult and a child from 14 to  16 or, as some advocate, 18 years of 
age would be even better.
<P>
	I agree with the Calgary <I>Sun</I> editorial which stated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It's time our laws clearly state that it's impossible for a child to have consensual 
sex.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Bill C-27 is a missed opportunity to do just that. The Liberals 
pass laws that say 16-year-olds cannot buy cigarettes, but they 
leave a law on the books which says that it is okay for an adult to 
have sex with a 14-year old child. Does that make sense? 
Obviously not.
<P>
	As with most things in Ottawa, if the Liberal government will 
not do what is right we have to do it ourselves. Therefore I will be 
working with my colleagues to amend the Criminal Code to raise 
the age of consent from 14 to 16.
<P>
	Here is what Reform's blue book policy states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Reform Party recognizes that child abuse and family violence attack the very 
foundations of organized society. The party supports enacting, communicating and 
enforcing laws that protect family members against such acts. Effective programs 
aimed at prevention of family violence will be a priority.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Reformers have already promised to make this a priority issue in 
the next election campaign, whenever the election is to be called. 
Reformers believe:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Current laws dealing with child prostitution, child pornography and obscenity in 
Canada are too weak. While both child pornography and child prostitution are 
illegal, currently laws are insufficient to check the exploitation of children.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A Reform government will:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Set a minimum 10-year sentence for living off the avails of child prostitution;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Introduce tougher sentences for anyone convicted of producing, peddling or 
promoting child pornography;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Set a minimum two-year sentence for customers of child prostitutes; and</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Redefine ``obscenity'' to include the exploitation or glorification of crime, horror, 
cruelty or violence in materials aimed at children.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A Reform government will always hold families in high regard, and will do 
everything possible to protect the people within them. There's no better investment 
in the future of our country.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1755)</B>
<P>
	We are living in the dying days of this Parliament. The situation I 
have just described throughout my speech is intolerable. It should 
be corrected immediately.
<P>
	The facts speak for themselves. Even though there are laws on 
the books, the problem of child prostitution and child pornography 
that are inextricably linked will get worse. Canadians are 
demanding their politicians take action. They will not be satisfied 
with half-hearted measures put in place by the government.
<P>
	In conclusion, this has been a very interesting time for me. It has 
been a great learning experience. I have  worked on many issues. I 
guess I have been a thorn in the side of the government on many 
occasions. I will not apologize for that because I feel very strongly 
about the issues I have spoken on. I sincerely believe the 
government is off the rails on many of the topics I have addressed, 
especially the major areas of justice, democracy and finance. These 
three areas concern my constituents a great deal and need to be 
corrected.
<P>
	When we came to Parliament the first speech we made is called a 
maiden speech. What do we call probably one of the last speeches 
at the end of a Parliament?
<P>
	A lot of emphasis and a lot of attention has been paid to the 
maiden speech. Now that I have been here for 3.5 years I would like 
to find the name of the speech we give once we have acquired the 
wisdom and experience of being in this place.
<P>
	One message needs to be emphasized over and over and over. 
Big centralized government control has made people feel their 
participation in Canadian politics, the running of their country, is 
futile. I have recorded many comments as I have gone door to door 
about how useless people feel this place is. We need to fix it so that 
we address the issues I have related in the past 20 minutes.
<P>
	People feel they cannot change things. They are becoming very 
cynical about this place and about any promise that politicians 
make to change things. They want to have more control over the 
affairs in their local communities, but they are being held back by 
Parliament and by the things we do here.
<P>
	We need to change this. We need to address their concerns. The 
concerns I have related on child prostitution and child pornography 
is one of the concerns of many people that needs to be dealt with.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I must say I was disappointed with my hon. colleague's 
swan song and remarks at the end of his speech.
<P>
	His speech was fine but he concluded his remarks by saying that 
Parliament was useless. That is basically what he said. Perhaps 
Parliament does not necessarily agree with the positions taken by 
his constituents which he feels he reflects when he stands here. He 
says that there is great cynicism in the land because Parliament is 
not acting on the viewpoint he presents on child pornography and 
child prostitution. That is unfortunate. Everyone in the House feels 
very acutely the horror of the abuse of children in any sense.
<P>
<B>(1800)</B>
<P>
	I support Bill C-27, but it opens some very difficult areas. My 
hon. friend mentioned one of those areas when he talked about 
child pornography. He said that Parliament has to do something 
about the distribution of materials which celebrate sex and 
violence, especially when these materials are aimed at children.
<P>
	One of the reasons we have these debates and one of the reasons 
I am here is to say to the hon. member that he is right, we have to 
act on child pornography. We have to act on pornography of any 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9680"> 9680 </A></B>
<P>
kind. However, how do we do that and not interfere with free 
speech? That is the problem.
<P>
	Whenever we get into areas of crime and victims rights we 
always have to weigh the other side, the interests of seeing that the 
accused has a fair day in court and that the innocent are not 
punished. We always have that balance in debate, even though in 
our hearts we reach out to the victims of crime. Certainly children 
are the ultimate victims of crime.
<P>
	Does my hon. friend not agree that we have to debate these 
issues in the House to make sure that in our desire to address the 
victims of crime we do not interfere with fundamental liberties like 
freedom of speech? There are video games, board games and 
television shows which cross the line with respect to violence and 
pornography which are aimed at children. Would he stop those 
things?
<P>
	These are the problems which we face. I would ask him to 
comment on that. How do we balance in a parliamentary debate the 
interests of the victims with the interests of the rights of the 
citizens of this country?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to deal with the first point raised by the hon. member.
<P>
	Parliament is not working. If there are concerns in the 
community and the highest court in the land does not address those 
concerns and is not responsive to them, Parliament is not effective. 
That is the bottom line.
<P>
	I related to the House one of the problems we have in society. I 
appealed to the government to do something. For the government 
to come back and say that it does not want to interfere with free 
speech when it comes to pornographic material, I can hardly 
believe my ears. I can hardly believe that we have people opposite 
who are defending some of the things which are causing child 
prostitution. They are making it worse. I cannot believe it. It is 
absolutely unacceptable.
<P>
	If there is a choice, as the hon. member outlined, victims rights 
come first. We always put victims rights first. Criminals do not 
deserve the same rights. This government has it all backwards.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rex Crawford (Kent, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have been 
sitting here most of the afternoon listening to the speeches on Bill 
C-27. The hon. member for Hamilton-Wentworth asked a 
question about free speech. Before that the hon. member for Prince 
George-Peace River spoke and before him the hon. member for 
New Westminster-Burnaby.
<P>
<B>(1805 )</B>
<P>
	I believe the word was disgusting. I can agree with that 
terminology because then the hon. member for Prince George-
<P>
Peace River went into artistic merit. Do we have artistic merit 
today?
<P>
	What our censorship council or board is allowing us to see as 
adults and children is even more disgusting than the hon. member 
had said. I remember when ``Gone with the Wind'' was a little 
ticklish. I am not one to go to movies but some I have gone to and, I 
must admit, left are some of the worst degrading garbage I have 
ever seen. However, our censor board in Canada allows it. Is that 
allowed under freedom of speech?
<P>
	There is child pornography and pedophiles. I do not think it is 
the government that is breaking down. I think it is families that are 
breaking down. When we see children 12 years of age and under 
causing vandalism after midnight or in the early hours of the 
morning and being picked up by the police, where are the families? 
What has happened to the families that children are allowed to 
vandalize and steal?
<P>
	Thank goodness we have the Young Offenders Act to protect us. 
But what is happening to Canada and Canadian families? I believe 
there is a sincere breakdown in the families. But are we causing it 
through our government bills?
<P>
	I have read in the media where our crime rates, according to the 
justice department, are down in Canada compared to the United 
States where crime is rampant. The article stated that putting these 
offenders in jail is not helping.
<P>
	In the area where I grew up we never locked a door, never locked 
the car because the neighbour might want to borrow it. Today 
everything is locked up. Homes have security systems. However, 
crime has gone down. Every home in my area out in the country has 
been robbed.
<P>
	I ask the hon. member to explain more of his views on how we 
can fight this. I think we as a government want to fight this but we 
need guidance.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate 
the member's comments and I appreciate his desire to solve some 
of the problems we have in Canada.
<P>
	I think he has zeroed in on one of the key concerns that we as 
Reformers have as well. It is one of the top three parts of our 
election platform, to make families in Canada a priority. I will 
come back to that in a minute.
<P>
	The hon. member said that crime is going down in Canada. Stats 
Canada has just released its report. Criminal Code offences have 
increased 400 per cent since 1962. I am not sure where the member 
is getting his information from.
<P>
	I would like to come back to the family for a moment but I see I 
am being signalled that my time is up. The family is the basic 
building block of society. Much of the  legislation in the House has 
harmed the family. It has not allowed parents to take the 
responsibility for their children which they must take.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9681"> 9681 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1810 )</B>
<P>
	We need to emphasize the family. All legislation in this House 
should be checked to see what effect it has on the family. The 
taxation policies of this government have harmed the family to the 
point where both parents have to be outside of the home, one to pay 
the taxes and the other to put bread on the table.
<P>
	I could give members a speech on how government has 
undermined families. We need to make families a priority. I agree 
that is a lot of the problem. We cannot just punish crime. We also 
have to make it so that there is an avenue to transmit values from 
one generation to the next and allow community organizations and 
churches to do their part by having them work through strong 
families.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Zed:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think you would find unanimous 
consent to have debate collapse on this government order. With the 
predisposition of the House, and after a great deal of consultation, I 
believe we would then call Bill C-44 and proceed with report stage 
of Bill C-44 only.
<P>
	I believe that the predisposition of the House at the moment is 
that there would be no further debate on Bill C-27, the question 
would be put and deferred, and we would move on to Bill C-44.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> Is the House ready for the 
question on Bill C-27?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think the deputy government 
House leader indicated that there may be an all-party agreement 
here. Should we not seek that agreement before we collapse the 
debate on Bill C-27?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Zed:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think if you seek it you would see that. 
However, I believe the Speaker would advise that we need to 
collapse Bill C-27 and defer that vote and then move to Bill C-44. I 
believe there would be three ten-minute speeches for report stage 
only.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> The Speaker is a servant 
of the House. Is there unanimous consent that we proceed as 
indicated by the parliamentary secretary to the government House 
leader?

<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to thank especially the 
parliamentary secretary to the House leader for his diligence in 
co-ordinating what we see as a rational and accepted debate that 
will take place on Bill C-44. I also want to thank the members 
opposite in the Reform and Bloc for their co-operation.
<P>
	It is a great privilege to speak to Bill C-44, the Canada Marine 
Act, which was reported back to this place by the Standing 
Committee on Transport.
<P>
	In December 1995, the Government of Canada published the 
``National Marine Policy: A Sweeping Strategy for Modernizing 
the Marine Sector''. The policy sets out a clear and cohesive plan 
of action to help Canada's harbours and ports. The seaway, pilotage 
operations and ferry services face present and future challenges.
<P>
	In June 1996, the government introduced Bill C-44, the Canada 
Marine Act, which is crafted to give full effect to the 1995 policy 
strategy. It brings business principles to bear on the use and future 
development of the marine system.
<P>
	Only a cost effective, affordable system will be sustainable in 
today's highly competitive environment. The system no longer will 
be weighed down by costly administrative overhead. Procedural 
red tape is being cut. Ottawa's involvement in the day to day 
running of the system will be reduced. Reporting and approval 
requirements will be streamlined and what remains will be clearly 
spelled out.
<P>
	Threaded throughout the Canada Marine Act is the philosophy of 
commercialization. It is to lighten the load on Canadian taxpayers 
for provision of the marine service. The proposed legislation will, 
in no way, compromise the high safety and environmental 
standards now in place. The rights and interests of all adjacent 
communities, including First Nations will be respected.
<P>
	Much has been and will be done to remove subsidies. The cost of 
services will be shifted to those who benefit most directly. Ports 
that operate commercially using facilities that were built up at 
substantial public expense will make modest annual payments back 
to the taxpayers. Those at the local level who are charged with 
running the system will be given greater autonomy and freedom to 
manage. The marine sector is a business and must be as free as 
possible to operate as one.
<P>
	Commercialization also means more user say. For business to be 
viable, it must be responsive to the people it serves. The 
infrastructure and the resources of the  marine system will be better 
matched to market demand and to real need.
<P>
	A more cost efficient, businesslike marine sector will enhance 
opportunities for economic growth and job creation at home and 
make us more competitive on the world stage. Bill C-44, and the 
national marine policy on which it was founded, are products of 
much time and effort by many people.
<P>
	At this point, I would like to express my sincere thanks on behalf 
of the government for the efforts of the House Standing Committee 
on Transport. The standing committee's role was invaluable in 
shaping, first, the national marine policy and today, the Canada 
Marine Act.
<P>
	I had the honour to chair the House Standing Committee on 
Transport when we formulated the national marine policy. On 
September 26, 1996, in my new role as parliamentary secretary, I 
witnessed the participation of the Minister of Transport who 
requested that the committee focus on some key issues that already 
had been raised by stakeholders in discussions since the 
introduction of the bill last June.
<P>
	The four issues that he put on the table for attention were: crown 
agent status, the capacity and power of port authorities, the tax 
status of ports, and port governance structures.
<P>
	The standing committee then travelled across Canada again so 
that everyone with an interest had the opportunity to shape the bill. 
Provinces, communities, industries, managers, unions, members of 
the public, all took the time to record their views with the Standing 
Committee on Transport. All are to be commended.
<P>
	Not all the viewpoints could be reconciled with each other nor to 
the policy direction that helped shape the bill. However, the 
standing committee has reported changes to the bill that strengthen 
it, while striking an appropriate and objective balance.
<P>
<B>(1825 )</B>
<P>
	The structure of the new Canada port authorities has to reflect 
our best view of how we want our national system of ports to 
operate. On one hand, there is a need for modern ports to have 
freedom to manage in order to meet user need and to stay 
competitive. On the other hand, there is the awareness that while 
ports are important economic generators in the economy, they also 
perform something of a public function. For this reason, they enjoy 
certain special privileges compared to other businesses and need a 
higher standard of public accountability for their operations.
<P>
	After considering the many views on these issues, the standing 
committee determined that a number of changes were needed in 
management structure and operating conditions for our new port 
authorities.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9684"> 9684 </A></B>
<P>
	The government supports the changes in this area brought 
forward by the standing committee. I will single out only three 
of them to mention the impact they will have. For better 
manageability and efficiency, the size of the governing board is 
now permitted to be as few as seven, compared to the previous 
minimum of nine directors. This does not compromise the 
objective of maintaining a user majority on the board.
<P>
	To ensure adequate continuity, the chairperson's term of office is 
increased from one to two years and the limitation of only one 
re-appointment is removed. To clarify that ports will have status as 
government institutions in their international dealings, port 
authorities now are declared to have crown agent status. These 
three changes illustrate that the standing committee has listened 
very carefully and has struck an equitable balance among 
sometimes very divergent interests.
<P>
	This government said at the outset that it was flexible and open 
to constructive suggestions for making the legislation better. The 
standing committee has formulated more than 100 changes, some 
of a substantive nature, plus many more that represent a technical 
fine tuning of the bill to make the legislation more practical, clearer 
and more user responsive.
<P>
	In the same spirit of continuous improvement, we have been able 
to identify some additional changes that would make it better for a 
more workable bill. We have submitted these changes for 
consideration by all members of the House. I am privileged on 
behalf of the government to speak to this bill. We have here a bill 
that ensures a more effective marine sector to the benefit of all 
Canadians. The Canada Marine Act will play an important part in 
the government's overall strategy to move the national 
transportation system forward into the 21st century. I look forward 
to hearing the interventions from my colleagues on this side and the 
members opposite.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to speak to Bill C-44 at report 
stage.
<P>
	I should point out that Bill C-44 is the result of the extreme 
frustration caused over the past 30 years by the lack of 
effectiveness of Canada's marine policy. The bill before us today is 
aimed at giving local authorities a greater say in the way port 
facilities are managed; for the longest time the federal government 
believed it could run ports across Canada from afar.
<P>
	Bill C-44 now before us has been completely reworked. At 
report stage, we managed to get some significant improvements. 
We will recall the victory of seaway pilots, who were able to show 
how crucial it was to put safety first, and prove, thanks to their 
excellent presentation highlighting seaway safety, that the integrity 
of their job  had to be preserved and therefore, that they could not 
be subjected to management rules that might jeopardize seaway 
safety.
<P>
	At the cross-country hearings, we heard testimony from several 
local authorities asking that federal agency status be granted to 
national ports. We supported this proposal. At first glance, this 
might appear surprising on the part of a Quebec sovereignist party, 
but the rationale is the following: major national ports must be 
given more opportunities in order to become competitive on the 
North American market and on the world market. When Quebec 
becomes sovereign, Quebec ports enjoying this status under federal 
legislation will retain the same opportunities since the legislation 
will become law in Quebec. And this is why it is interesting.
<P>
<B>(1830)</B>
<P>
	During the hearings, many people underscored the need for some 
flexibility in ensuring that the existing harbour commissions, 
which are the most advanced form of local management 
established under the old legislation, can maintain their status or at 
least continue to operate as they should. There are some interesting 
elements in that area.
<P>
	However, one element seems particularly important as far as the 
objectives of this bill are concerned. Clause 3 of the bill states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It is hereby declared that the objective of this Act is to</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a) implement a National Marine Policy that provides Canada with the marine 
infrastructure that it needs and that will promote and safeguard Canada's 
competitiveness and trade objectives;</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The Bloc felt that the bill would be improved by ensuring that 
the national marine policy makes it possible to achieve the local, 
regional and national socio-economic objectives, in order to 
promote and preserve Canada's competitiveness. However, the 
purpose of our amendment, which seems very reasonable to me, is 
to strike a balance between competitiveness, which is now part of 
our system, and free trade, which is invading all areas of activity, 
so that local, regional and national socio-economic objectives can 
be taken into account in all regions of Quebec and Canada.
<P>
	This means that the legislation as a whole must be interpreted in 
light of this objective of the bill.
<P>
	If the amendment is accepted, and I ask members on the 
government side to consider it seriously, it will improve the 
legislation and go along the line of a number of amendments put 
forward by the hon. member for Labrador, who suggested we 
ensure that the situation in remote areas for instance is different 
from the situation in major centers or in economic circles where 
there is more free trade within North America.
<P>
	Underlying this legislation is a desire to transfer responsibility 
for the facilities to local authorities, but this transfer must take 
place under acceptable terms. Our  Motion No. 5 would ensure that 
the principle of the legislation's objective is respected.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9685"> 9685 </A></B>
<P>
	If the House approves this amendment, it will affect every aspect 
of the department's operation, the process by which the decision is 
made for instance to effect the divesting of ports or by which funds 
are allocated to wharf repair, whether on a ferry wharf like the one 
in Rivière-du-Loup or wharves with a more commercial use like 
the one in Cacouna, in my riding, or in Trois-Pistoles, or repairs on 
certain port facilities no longer used for what they were originally 
designed for. There are many good examples of this in the Gulf of 
St. Lawrence. Since the Saguenay St. Lawrence Marine Park was 
established, many lighter port facilities need to be overhauled to 
give access to the river in support of the jewel of tourism this park 
will become.
<P>
	By including this requirement to meet local, regional and 
national social and economic objectives in the legislation, we will 
ensure an essential balance.
<P>
	It is also important to ensure that, when this bill is implemented, 
sufficient funding is provided to effect the divesting because, at 
present, every operation whereby responsibility is transferred to 
local authorities is permeated by the fear that the funding required 
to perform the function will not be transferred along with the 
responsibilities. This does not necessarily occur in transfers made 
in an effort to decentralize.
<P>
	If it keeps improving at this rate, Bill C-44 could well achieve a 
large consensus in this House.
<P>
<B>(1835)</B>
<P>
	Unfortunately, for the time being, there are still flaws and the 
government will have to deal with them. I mentioned one, but there 
are others which are addressed in the proposed amendments.
<P>
	One of the amendments proposed by the Bloc Quebecois deals 
with the need to recognize, as a Canadian port authority, facilities 
such as those of Port Saguenay and Trois-Rivières. These are 
facilities which, originally, might not have met the specific criteria 
set out in the legislation.
<P>
	Through our work in committee, we were able to make sure that 
these ports can enjoy such status and thus be part of the wide 
network of national ports, which are vital elements of the 
transportation infrastructure to promote economic development in 
Canada. I will conclude by discussing elements of that nature.
<P>
	For a long time, the whole issue of port management in Canada 
was essentially the federal government's responsibility, and there 
are many stories of port facilities that were built a long time ago 
and then more or less set aside, because they were deemed 
obsolete. Local communities did not feel these facilities were their 
own, while the federal government could not assume sole 
responsibility for them.
<P>
	The arrival of the Bloc Quebecois in Ottawa helped develop an 
awareness of the importance of the transportation issue, of the 
interface with the transportation sector to help diversify regional 
economies. The reform of port activities is one element of this 
policy.
<P>
	We are not yet totally pleased with the bill. I hope the 
government will recognize the soundness of our amendment. I 
believe the serious work done by both sides of the House to make 
this bill as good as possible has already been recognized.
<P>
	In conclusion, there are still some elements to be corrected, 
especially the need to ensure that the national maritime policy will 
not be merely a market-based policy promoting pure 
competitiveness. The entire Canadian economy must take it into 
consideration that there are specific characteristics, other criteria to 
consider, including the economic impact of port facilities. It is not 
true that a port has the same importance and the same relationship 
to community development whether it is in Cacouna, Quebec City, 
Montreal or Thunder Bay.
<P>
	In my region, we have been aware for the past 15 or 20 years of 
the importance of finding a way to develop Cacouna's port 
infrastructure. This project has gone through all of the stages of 
what might be called the region's political history. With the bill as 
it is, and with the proposed amendment on government 
responsibility to make this national maritime policy a tool of 
regional economic development, if we attain that objective, the 
federal government will then have to provide the necessary funds 
for implementation, so that the devolution is done properly.
<P>
	We will be able to improve the bill in committee and at report 
stage. Then, when it gets to third reading, we shall see whether 
amendments might be made to its substance.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Duncan (North Island-Powell River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we have on the west coast a lot of community problems 
originating from the designation of ports and port facilities and we 
have some ongoing discussions and negotiations at the local level 
in terms of how they are going to manage their affairs given the 
devolution of the wharfs and facilities which have been known 
throughout the last few decades as the federal dock and so on.
<P>
	We have a very specific problem on Vancouver Island with the 
naming or designation of ports. We have a remote designation and 
a local and regional designation. These have major implications to 
communities. When we end up with a largely bureaucratic driven 
decision that impacts a community thousands of miles a way we 
have to find a way to ensure that the information upon which the 
bureaucracy is making its decision is the correct information and 
not something that someone like I  would have to ferret out after 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9686"> 9686 </A></B>
<P>
months of amazement at how a decision could be made through 
something like the freedom of information.
<P>
<B>(1840)</B>
<P>
	Lo and behold, in the cases of the two communities of Zeballos 
and Tahsis which are adjacent communities on Vancouver Island as 
the crow flies but over 300 kilometres separate by road, I 
determined that the bureaucracy in Ottawa thought they were 
connected by a 10 kilometre road which affected the designation 
and how this enabling package and the devolution of port facilities 
is going to affect them in a very negative way. I am still trying to 
get that sorted out. I hope I will get some assistance from the 
respective minister.
<P>
	I have some assurance that where there are port facilities that fall 
under small craft harbours under the Department of Transport that 
are adjacent and have been considered by the community to be 
single facility, these proposals will be looked at with a lot of 
flexibility by the respective ministers. In this case, the Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans and the Minister of Transport both have 
jurisdiction. It makes common sense to include both these facilities 
under one domain and then to move it into a community harbour 
committee type of arrangement. I am looking forward to 
co-operation in that regard as well.
<P>
	This bill has been in the hopper for quite some time. When it was 
sent to the Standing Committee on Transport there was an awful lot 
of listening that had to be done. I witnessed a number of 
amendments that have been made to the legislation. We know it 
was certainly not a complete package when it was presented and we 
know there has been a lot of input. We also know that the direction 
of some of the amendments is very good indeed.
<P>
	I have a concern that not all the amendments will achieve what 
needs to be achieved. I think a part of that is due to partisanship and 
gamesmanship in this place rather than really trying to accomplish 
what is right. There have been filibusters at the committee stage to 
block amendments having to do with the St. Lawrence seaway.
<P>
	Based on a Bloc filibuster the government backed down and 
withdrew four amendments which were designed to aid the control 
of the cost of shipping in the St. Lawrence. Government members 
of the committee rationalized this as a necessary move in order to 
move the bill along quickly and suggested they would be able to 
reintroduce them at report stage. This was months ago.
<P>
<B>(1845)</B>
<P>
	From all outside appearances once again we are in the final days 
of another sitting of Parliament with an agenda that should not be 
rushed but appears to be rushed. There were amendments involving 
ports policing. Ports operating under the umbrella of the Canadian 
Ports  Authority were being policed by the Canada Ports 
Corporation Police. The bill would bring an end to the existence of 
the Canada Ports Corporation. However, with the end of the Canada 
Ports Corporation, also comes the end of the Canada Ports Police.
<P>
	We have a circumstance where essentially the municipalities do 
not mind looking after the policing. However, where there are 
incremental costs which there will be in some cases, naturally they 
wanted to be compensated. We cannot have federal offloading on to 
municipalities. I believe there are amendments that will take care 
of that situation. I hope and pray those amendments will indeed 
pass.
<P>
	The legislation also establishes many of the ports previously 
operating under the Harbour Commissions Act as Canadian port 
authorities. As such they will be required to pay full grants in lieu 
of taxes.
<P>
	We have an amendment calling for a five-year phasing in period. 
Ports that are not required to pay these grants would pay no less 
than what they had already been paying and 80 per cent of the 
difference between what they had been paying in the full value 
grants in lieu over the next succeeding four years and the full grants 
in lieu by year five.
<P>
	No city or municipality would have received less than it had 
already been getting. At the same time the phase in period would 
allow time for ports to prepare for the previously unbudgeted 
impact of these payments. This deficiency in the bill has also been 
overcome by an amendment that I am supporting as well. However 
some small ports under the legislation will be placed in financial 
risk. This is not a good way to start a new program.
<P>
	There is some good in the bill. In fact there is quite a bit of good 
in it. The objective of the committee was to examine the bill and 
make it as good as possible. That has not been met. The issues were 
clear. The solutions were clear. However the government has failed 
not because of marine philosophy but because of political 
gamesmanship. The bill could have been better.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Zed (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise on a point of order. I think you will find that the House will 
grant its consent for the following motion after the speakers from 
Blainville-Deux-Montagnes and Beauport, who I understand 
have 10-minute speeches, and the two speakers on the government 
side who are splitting their time five minutes each. I move:
<P>

	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> Just to clarify the matter 
for the Chair, the question before the House is that there be an 
additional 30 minutes of debate, two 10-minute speeches from the 
official opposition and two 5-minute speeches from the

questions necessary to dispose of report stage of the bill will be 
deemed to have been moved, seconded, divisions demanded and

<P>

<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	(Motion agreed to.)
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Mercier (Blainville-Deux-Montagnes, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, when we consider the current administrative and financial 
aspects of running the St. Lawrence Seaway, we can just imagine 
the president of a private company announcing to his board of 
directors and shareholders that the capital they invested in the 
company produces an average yield of 1 per cent.
<P>
	Canadian taxpayers may react like the shareholders after 
investing $7 billion in the St. Lawrence Seaway, which brings in 
$70 million annually, or 1 per cent. I imagine the shareholders 
would not be very pleased and would be even less so if the 
president went on to announce that tonnage on the St. Lawrence 
Seaway has declined by 50 per cent over the past 25 years. I 
imagine there would be frowns all around and that the president 
would be accused of poor management and asked to explain the 
reasons for these disastrous results.
<P>
	The books would reveal a top heavy bureaucracy which does not 
make for efficient management but does generate many 
opportunities for giving jobs to friends. They would also show 
other signs of poor management, and even if the purpose of this bill 
is not really to improve the situation, we would hope that the 
amendments we are proposing would have that effect.
<P>
	We believe that basically, as in other legislation, this government 
is trying to scale down its financial commitments and 
responsibilities in order to offload them onto other levels of 
government and the private sector.
<P>
	At any rate, we are not opposed to this bill. We think that the 
management of the St. Lawrence Seaway could only improve if 
handled by someone else, since it could not be handled any worse 
than it has been by the federal government.
<P>
	But for this bill to produce good results, we in our party would 
like to make a number of really important changes, one of which 
deals with the divesting of certain ports. Some of these ports, which 
have been victims of mismanagement for many years, are in bad 
shape, and we feel that the government has a duty to put them back 
into decent shape before they can be sold. That is one of our 
conditions for supporting this bill, and a number of the 
amendments we have put forward deal with this.
<P>
	Also, with the federal government financially withdrawing from 
the St. Lawrence Seaway and in the absence of any government 
subsidies, loans and financial contributions, one would expect that 
the federal government would stop, to a great extent, imposing its 
will on the boards of directors to be established. But that is not 
what is happening. We can understand the federal government 
having one representative on these boards. However, we strongly 
object to the fact that, except for those members coming from the 
provinces and municipalities, board members will be appointed by 
the government, without our knowing whether it will do so 
arbitrarily or if, as it should, it will listen to the suggestions made 
by the organizations represented. We will move amendments to 
make sure the government will listen-not merely consult, but 
listen-to the organizations involved, when they make 
recommendations regarding the appointment of members to ports' 
boards of directors.
<P>
<B>(1855)</B>
<P>
	I only raised two issues. The hon. member for 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup mentioned a number of other ones. 
Other comments will be made but, in conclusion, we agree with the 
principle of this legislation and we will support it, provided our 
proposed amendments to improve it are accepted. Otherwise, we 
would have no choice but to oppose the bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak to Bill C-44, the Canada 
Marine Act.
<P>
	I rise to speak wearing various hats. I rise as Bloc Quebecois 
transportation critic in 1993, 1994 and 1995. I also rise as a 
representative of a people who, on the eve of what I hope is an 
imminent election, want to demonstrate the role of the Bloc 
Quebecois in Ottawa.
<P>
	Quebecers watching us from the comfort of their living rooms 
will be more than able to understand-and I assure you Quebecers 
do understand-the importance of the Bloc Quebecois here in the 
House of Commons in Ottawa. If, in 1993, they had sent back 74 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9688"> 9688 </A></B>
<P>
Liberal MPs  out of a total of 75, as happened in the Trudeau era, 
there would not have been a block of MPs to defend Quebec's 
interests.
<P>
	Once again, in this bill, we have solid evidence of the victories 
won by the Bloc Quebecois for Quebecers.
<P>
	I also want to congratulate my colleague, the member for 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, for the excellent work he did on 
this bill, assisted by the hon. member for 
Blainville-Deux-Montagnes. I think that what we have before us 
is almost the final product, but hours and hours of hearings and 
committee work went into the amendments we see today. I would 
therefore like to congratulate them.
<P>
	As the previous two Bloc Quebecois speakers have mentioned, 
the Bloc Quebecois will not be opposing this bill in principle, but 
once again, as the member for Blainville-Deux-Montagnes has 
just pointed out, everything depends on the government's 
receptiveness to our amendments.
<P>
	But I should begin by addressing the whole issue of the 
commercialization of ports. I remember that, in 1985, the first goal 
of the Standing Committee on Transport, made up of a majority of 
Liberal members, was to replace or abolish Ports Canada. I see that 
the minister is listening to my speech and I am very pleased to tell 
him that the decision to terminate Ports Canada was an excellent 
one.
<P>
	I remember putting questions to the transport committee about 
expense accounts. So, at the outset, I wanted to say that we 
wholeheartedly agree with the dismantling of Ports Canada. 
However, the Liberal majority sitting on the transport committee 
supported the establishment of some kind of ports secretariat which 
would have been based here in Ottawa, another monitoring agency.
<P>
	Fortunately, the bill before the House provides for the 
commercialization of these ports. So, no structure will have to be 
set up. There will be independent entities. The board will be made 
of a majority of local stakeholders, that is people who are familiar 
with the needs and the concerns of the region and the local ports. 
Again, this is an interesting development.
<P>
<B>(1900)</B>
<P>
	Once again, with regard to the role played by the Bloc 
Quebecois, members of the Bloc who sat on the transport 
committee managed to have included in the Canadian port 
authorities network two ports that were originally forgotten, 
namely the port of Trois-Rivières, thanks to representations made 
by my colleague, the Bloc member for Trois-Rivières, and 
Saguenay port, located in the federal riding of Chicoutimi, thanks 
to representations made by my colleague, the member for 
Chicoutimi, and also by another colleague, the late member for 
Jonquière, André Caron, who had replaced me as transport critic. It 
is a victory for the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
	Another victory is the retention of pilotage on the St. Lawrence 
River. I had the opportunity to make several speeches in this House 
in which I asked a simple question: can we afford another <I>Exxon 
Valdez</I> on the Montmagny archipelago, in the Cap Tourmente 
wildlife preserve in my riding, along the shore of Île d'Orléans? 
Can we afford that?
<P>
	I can tell you that it is thanks to the tenacity of the members of 
the Bloc Quebecois and also to representations made by the pilots 
of the Lower St. Lawrence that this bill provides for the retention of 
pilotage. At least, it will not be reviewed until December 31, 1997, 
and this is why I wanted to stress this interesting aspect of the bill.
<P>
	My time is running out and the last point I would like to make is 
that our party plans to vote against this bill at the third reading 
stage because, even though we do agree with some elements of the 
bill, we object to some of its shortcomings. For example, nothing in 
this bill reflects a determination to maintain or promote 
shipbuilding.
<P>
	I made some proposals and submitted some amendments 
concerning tax laws so that shipbuilding could be encouraged and 
even developed in Quebec and Canada, but the bill contains 
nothing to that effect. Once again, I would like to stress that the 
Quebec region shipyard now called Industries Davie, formerly MIL 
Davie Inc., is still waiting for the federal government's position on 
its recovery plan and its future.
<P>
	Workers at MIL Davie have done their part. They literally 
butchered whole sections of their collective agreement to allow 
MIL Davie to compete with shipyards in Korea, China or 
elsewhere. It is now profitable, the rest is up to the federal 
government.
<P>
	It should be remembered that only Quebec has been affected by 
the downsizing of shipbuilding. We saw the demise of Canadian 
Vickers, in Montreal, and Marine Industries, in Sorel; MIL Davies 
is the only shipyard left in Quebec. While shipyards were closing in 
Quebec, 10 or 11 were being built in the maritimes with the help of 
the Conservatives.
<P>
	That is why, in the next election, we will keep telling Quebecers 
that Tories and Grits are all the same and that the only solution is to 
support the Bloc Quebecois members, who will go to Ottawa to 
stand up for their interests, as we did with this bill.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to give notice that I will be sharing my time 
with the member for Hamilton-Wentworth.
<P>
	It gives me great pleasure to speak on this very important bill 
today. It is such a relevant bill for the city of Toronto. I want to go 
back to the Prime Minister's very first speech in Toronto after he 
was elected about  four years ago. During that first speech in 
Toronto the Prime Minister said that Toronto would play a very 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9689"> 9689 </A></B>
<P>
important part in the economic renewal of the country. Because the 
people of the greater Toronto area came on side with the Liberal 
Party, the Prime Minister during the last election said that 
instruments would be put in place to ensure that the economic 
revitalization of the city of Toronto, which is so important to the 
rest of the country, would happen. Today, thanks to the Minister of 
Transport, thanks to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Transport, the hon. member for Hamilton West, the author of the 
Keyes report, we now have Toronto named as a Canada port 
authority in the new Canada marine act.
<P>
<B>(1905)</B>
<P>
	For those of us who have been working in the Toronto caucus 
over the last few years on economic revitalization through tourism, 
recreation and commerce, this bill, by recognizing Toronto as a 
port authority, will finally give the proper tools to those who 
understand our city and the importance of the presence of the 
Government of Canada in the overall economic renewal of the city 
of Toronto.
<P>
	It would be remiss of me not to mention the leadership of 
Charles Parmalae of the Toronto Harbour Commission, the 
leadership of Harold Pereunboom, Howard Joy, Gary Reid, Bill 
Jackman and many others. I wish I had more than five minutes to 
deal with this very important legislation.
<P>
	It is important to realize the work that was done in setting up the 
Toronto port authority, which will now have special Government of 
Canada status. The work which was done to make that happen is 
unimaginable. It has been a long arduous task, but today in the 
nation's boardroom we celebrate the fact that we finally have an 
all-party agreement to proceed with this designation. That, in itself, 
is a rare achievement in the House.
<P>
	I know there are a number of people in Toronto who from time to 
time wonder about the commitment of the Government of Canada 
to that city. Sometimes they wonder whether the Toronto members 
of Parliament are giving full force to the economic renewal which 
is needed in that city.
<P>
	It is no secret that many young people in Toronto are 
unemployed. One of the sectors of the economy that is counted on 
heavily to help support those unemployed Canadians is tourism. In 
the last four years Parliament has quadrupled the tourism 
marketing budget to ensure that the conventions, the trade shows, 
the entertainment industry, the hotel and restaurant industries of 
Toronto are provided all the necessary tools.
<P>
	To be able to stand in the House on the eve of an election and say 
that the Government of Canada's presence through the Toronto port 
authority has once again been revitalized is a very meaningful 
opportunity  for me. I want to thank the master of the Keyes report, 
the member for Hamilton West, the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Transport, for working with us on this very important 
instrument of economic renewal for the greater Toronto area. It is 
very important.
<P>
<B>(1910 )</B>
<P>
	I wish I had more time to go into the various impacts this will 
have. It will allow the Government of Canada to once again 
become a full partner with the city of Toronto and with the province 
of Ontario. Together the three levels of government, including 
metro, will make sure that we do our part not only for the city of 
Toronto and the province of Ontario but all other regions of 
Canada. When we have a healthy, vibrant reinvigorated Toronto, it 
has a ripple effect throughout the whole country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keyes:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I did not want 
to interrupt the member for Hamilton-Wentworth, however, to 
ensure that we have the right instruments in place of which the hon. 
member spoke, if you request it, you will find unanimous consent:

<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak on this bill. It is a very fine bill. At 
third reading I hope to speak at greater length than the five minutes 
I have allotted to me now.
<P>
	This is a very good bill because it replaces, in my region, an 
appointed harbour commission with a port authority of seven to 
eleven directors. In Bill C-44 is built in an elaborate series of 
systems of accountability and checks and balances where a board 
of directors is required to file annual reports, make annual 
statements, disclose salaries, subject themselves to periodic audits 
and thus forth.
<P>
	When I examined the bill, however, I found it deficient in one 
small corner. That was with respect to the appointment of the board 
of directors should a port authority replace the Hamilton Harbour 
Commission in my riding. As the bill is now composed, the board 
of directors would consist of a member appointed from the 
province, a member appointed by the minister and a member 
appointed by the municipalities that might be mentioned in the 
letters patent.
<P>
<B>(1915)</B>
<P>
	I would like to draw the attention of the House to the two 
specific sections which apply to my Motions Nos. 20 and 31. The 
one that clearly states the situation is the one which states that the 
letters patent shall set out the following information for the 
appointment of directors and it will be one individual appointed by 
the municipalities mentioned in the letters patent.
<P>
	My amendment would simply add the word ``each'' between the 
words ``by'' and ``the municipalities mentioned in the letters 
patent''. As the wording currently exists it gives the minister the 
opportunity to name only one director from all the municipalities 
mentioned in the letters patent. If the word ``each'' were inserted in 
this clause it would enable the minister to appoint as many 
directors representing as many municipalities that are mentioned in 
the letters patent.
<P>
	That seems like a very small point and it is. But it is very 
significant in my riding because Hamilton harbour, as everyone 
knows, consists on one side of the city of Hamilton and on the north 
shore the city of Burlington. Historically the two communities have 
shared the harbour even though in the early days of the 19th 
century Hamilton grew much faster than Burlington and 
consequently most of the harbour facilities are on the south shore.
<P>
	On the north shore there is a lot of residential development and 
some very fine shoreline wildlife and recreational facilities. 
Whatever happens to the port of Hamilton ultimately impacts on 
the city of Burlington. This amendment I proposed simply would 
guarantee the city of Burlington having representation on the new 
port  authority at such time as the Hamilton harbour commissioners 
are replaced by a port authority.
<P>
	It is a matter of fairness but it is also a matter of relevance. I 
think the city of Burlington has now grown significantly in 
economic strength to stand on an equal footing with the city of 
Hamilton.
<P>
	Therefore this is simply an amendment that will not affect other 
communities because the minister still retains the right to name 
which municipalities in the letters patent he thinks should have a 
membership on the board of directors. It does not impede his 
freedom of action when it comes to making a decision about port 
authorities.
<P>
	Traditionally Hamilton harbour has always been called such by 
the people of Hamilton. However, on the north shore it has always 
been called Burlington bay. I think the bill is an opportunity to 
bring these two communities together on the management of a very 
important body of water which, indeed important to all residents of 
the Golden Horseshoe.
<P>
	The city of Burlington to stress its feelings that it needed 
representation on any port authority board of directors, should a 
port authority be named for the Hamilton area, passed a resolution 
on Monday, February 10. This is Motion No. 24 from the council of 
the city of Burlington:
<P>
	``Whereas Burlington and Hamilton each share approximately 
one half of the shoreline of Hamilton harbour; and whereas the 
harbour provides many beneficial uses and amenities for residents 
of Burlington; and whereas harbour governance in decision making 
is vitally important to the city of Burlington;
<P>
	``Now therefore the city of Burlington hereby endorses the 
efforts of Mr. John Bryden, MP to seek amendments to the 
proposed Bill C-44, the Canada ports authority act, which would 
promote the creation of a Canada port authority for Hamilton 
harbour, governed by a board of directors which includes 
representatives of both the cities of Burlington and Hamilton''.
<P>
	The House has an opportunity to listen to a municipality which is 
making a request to this Parliament. It is a very fair request. I hope 
the House will see fit to support the two amendments I brought 
forward at report stage.
